Mr. President, I should like to personally welcome the \nguest Chaplain today, Dr. James Olson, who is from my home State of \nColorado. I wish to also thank Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie for his graciousness \nin welcoming him here to the Senate.\n  My wife Joan and I are blessed that we have inspirational leaders \nboth here in Washington and back in my home State of Colorado. Dr. \nLloyd Ogilvie is somebody we really respect and value and look to for \nour spiritual leadership. Dr. James Olson is not only a spiritual \nleader for my wife and I in Colorado but of the family, and I just wish \nto state in a public manner how much we appreciate his leadership and \nhow much as a family we appreciate what he does for us. He has not only \npersonally served the Allard family, but he has personally served the \ncommunity of Fort Collins, CO. He has taken an active part in that \ncommunity as a religious leader, and in his sermons in the Faith \nEvangelical Free Church of Fort Collins he has been a leader of affairs \nbefore our country, and I think he has been a voice of reason for the \ncongregation and one of balance. I have always appreciated his message \non Sundays whenever we have attended his church, and I think that he \nhas strengthened the spiritual community in Fort Collins, particularly \nthe Christian community.\n  I just want to recognize in a public way all his leadership in \nColorado, particularly his community. I think he typifies the \nleadership throughout this country of many of our community pastors and \nreligious leaders. Sometimes I don't think we recognize them as we \nshould. They are an important part of what goes on in this country; \nthey are an important part of what America is all about.\n  So it is with a great deal of pleasure that I welcome Dr. James Olson \nto the Senate and let him know just how much we appreciate his prayer \nthis morning and wish both his wife Carol and him our very best. We are \nhappy that they could take time out of their religious lives to come to \nWashington and be a part of the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1743-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, it is rare for both Houses of Congress to \nreach a unanimous agreement--fully bipartisan legislation. The Food \nQuality Protection Act (FQPA) was enacted in this manner in 1996. This \nnew law eliminated the famed Delaney Clause for residues in raw and \nprocessed foods--replacing it with a scientific, rational standard of \n``reasonable certainty of no harm.'' Food and agricultural interest, as \nwell as the pesticide industry, saw the passage of FQPA as an \nopportunity to assure that sound science is paramount in EPA's \ndeterminations on use of crop protection chemicals. It is worth saying \nit again--a scientific, rational, sound and reasonable standard.\n  Mr. President, sound science is what the authors intended and \nexpected. This is what Congress wanted--sound science as the rule's \nfoundation. Further, the new law provided an additional safety factor \nto protect infants and children, and new ways of assessing pesticide \nbenefits and risks. This is something Congress fully supported. Despite \na unanimous Congressional vote, implementing the law at the regulatory \nlevel has been a very difficult and unnecessarily complex process.\n  In fact, only a few months after the law was passed, the entire FQPA \nimplementation process broke down. Members of Congress voiced their \nconcern. The problems were so great and concerns from America's \nagriculture industry so substantial that Vice President Gore sent a \nMemorandum to both the Department of Agriculture and the Environmental \nProtection Agency on April 8, 1998. This memorandum laid out the White \nHouse's plan for getting FQPA's implementation back on track.\n  The White House's plan for FQPA implementation contained four basic \nprinciples. It included sound science in protecting public health, \nregulatory transparency, reasonable transition for agriculture, and \nconsultation with the public and other agencies. The Vice President's \napproach was supported by America's agriculture community. Everyone's \nhopes were high.\n  Mr. President, today, almost a year after the White House got \ndirectly involved in FQPA's implementation process, it is still off \ntrack. It is becoming clear to me that Congress may again have to \nrevisit FQPA.\n  Mr. President, Congress wanted a law to eliminate the scientifically \ninadequate and outdated Delaney Clause. What Congress and the Nation \ngot was much worse. In fact, the EPA has failed to provide \nscientifically sound guidance to the regulated community. The EPA \napproach follows a path toward great economic harm for both \nagricultural producers and urban users of these products--an EPA \napproach which is without scientific foundation.\n  Farmers, the food industry, pest control interests, and many others \nare understandably concerned. Americans want and deserve a fair, \nworkable implementation of this bipartisan law. Americans want and \ndeserve rules that are based on real information and sound science. \nAmericans want and deserve rules that follow the Vice President's memo. \nAmericans want and deserve rules which fit FQPA's requirements.\n  In order for these rules to be achieved EPA must:\n  Allow development of the best scientific methodology and data;\n  Base its decisions on actual pesticide uses rather than model \nassumptions; and\n  Operate in an open, transparent manner to establish uniform, \nscientific and practical policies.\n  Mr. President, this is simple and straightforward, and makes \nscientific common sense. This request is consistent with the intent of \nthe unanimously passed law. This request is also consistent with the \nVice President's memo of nearly a year ago.\n  The requirements of the law are achievable. I have confidence that \nEPA can do this right--EPA just needs to take the time, invest the \neffort with the proper focus.\n  EPA must recognize the problems that will be created if FQPA is \nimproperly implemented. It is estimated that the economic impact for \nagricultural producers is tremendous. For just one class of chemicals \nbeing analyzed by EPA, estimates have shown a 55% yield loss in my \nstate for corn if these products were eliminated. For cotton in \nMississippi, the yield loss has been estimated at 8 percent. Crops \nacross the United States would also be negatively impacted.\n  However, Mr. President, FQPA is not just about farming. Poor \nimplementation of FQPA could also have consequences in the public \nhealth area. FQPA's passage was not just about reassessing old \nproducts, it was more about getting new, safer crop protection products \non the market. FQPA's passage was bipartisan & unanimous because \nCongress also wanted new products and a rational scientific process. \nOne such new product intended for use on cotton is currently under \nreview by EPA. This new cotton insecticide, PIRATE, is extremely \nimportant to Mississippi cotton producers and we need full registration \nof this product before the growing season this year.\n  Mr. President, EPA must implement FQPA properly. EPA should not make \nany final decisions on important pesticide products until they have \ncompletely developed a clear and transparent process for implementing \nthe law and have evaluated the impacts of product loss. With that \ndone--FQPA will meet the expectations of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1744-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1744-S1745]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish that I could say that Congress and \nthe President of the United States are doing everything possible to \nprotect the American people and preserve the values that we hold dear. \nBut that is not the case.\n  At this time, the United States is defenseless against a ballistic \nmissile attack. Clearly, that is an unacceptable state of affairs. \nRecent events demand the United States move forward and deploy, as soon \nas technologically possible, an effective National Missile Defense \n(NMD) system which can defend U.S. territory against any limited \nballistic missile attack, whether from an accidental, unauthorized, or \ndeliberate launch.\n  It is my sincere hope that President Clinton's recent decision to \nrequest $6.6 billion over 6 years for missile defense research in his \nbudget reflects a new commitment to deploy the most extensive, \neffective national missile defense system in the shortest amount of \ntime. I am pleased the President finally understands the need for a \nmissile defense system and hope he will continue that commitment. Any \nPresident sworn to protect our Nation must support the deployment of a \nsystem that would protect Americans from annihilation.\n  We know that the threat of a missile attack is growing stronger as \nmore emerging powers, such as North Korea and Iran are developing long-\nrange ballistic missiles that could reach the United States. As recent \nevents have shown, we cannot rely on the intelligence estimates this \nadministration has been using as a security blanket. Remember, our \nintelligence community projected that Iran could not field its medium-\nrange ballistic missile (the 800-940 mile range Shahab-3) until 2003, \nbut Iran flight-tested this system 6 months ago. We were also surprised \nby North Korea's test firing of a two-stage missile over Japan last \nAugust. It is simply not reasonable to assume that the United States \nwill get 3 years' advance warning, thus allowing 3 years to deploy a \nlimited defense under the Clinton administration's ``3+3 deployment \nreadiness program.''\n  As the congressionally mandated bipartisan Rumsfeld commission noted, \nIran has acquired and is seeking advanced missile components that can \nbe combined to produce ballistic missiles with sufficient range to \nstrike all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota. As the Senator from \nMinnesota, I must say that I take that threat to heart. In addition, \nNorth Korea is close to testing a new missile that will have sufficient \nrange to strike the continental United States. When that occurs, the \nthreat to\n\n[[Page S1745]]\n\nthe United States could increase exponentially, because North Korea has \nannounced that it had and would continue to sell ballistic missiles and \nproduction technology to any interested buyer.\n  We live in a very dangerous world that is growing more and more \nvolatile--a world where rogue regimes and terrorist groups are \ndeveloping and purchasing the means to attack our Nation. We have to \nmake a choice. We can rely on leaders like Saddam Hussein to show \nrestraint, which seems unlikely--or we can develop a national missile \ndefense that will provide the United States with means to counter a \nballistic missile attack.\n  America can no longer afford to hide behind the outdated ABM Treaty. \nIt does not offer any protection from the threats emerging at the end \nof this century. It was negotiated and ratified to address the cold war \nera when the Soviet Union was our major threat. At present, rogue \nstates consider ballistic missiles valuable instruments to intimidate \ncountries that are unable or unwilling to defend themselves. As a \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who supports a strong \nleadership role for the United States in the global arena, I am \nconcerned that the U.S. vulnerability to missile attack could undermine \nour Nation's capacity to defend our national security interests abroad. \nFor the sake of our Nation's security, I hope this administration will \nmove forward to embrace the most effective national defense system \npossible. The future of our great nation literally depends on it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have been given \nsome 10 minutes in morning business, but I am coming up against an 11 \no'clock scheduled floor debate. If the manager of the bill is not on \nthe floor, I would like to proceed with my 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I just left a hearing of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, and I thought it was ironic that we are now in a debate over \nthe disposition of America's surplus. I am sure the President will \nrecall that 2 years ago, almost to the day, we were here on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate where the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, brought out virtually every \nbudget report from the last 30 years that he believed to be in deficit, \nin red ink, and stacked them up. They were higher than the height of \nthe Senator from Utah, and he is a tall man, making the point that we \nhad been embroiled in deficit spending for so long we had no recourse, \nnothing we could do, other than to amend the Constitution of the United \nStates and to give the Federal courts the authority to force Congress \nto stop spending, to stop deficits, with the so-called balanced budget \namendment. That amendment lost by 1 vote 2 years ago. It was the \nhottest item on the Senate calendar 2 years ago.\n\n  Today, we are deeply embroiled in a debate in the Senate Budget \nCommittee on how to spend the surplus. We have turned the corner as a \nnation, and the President has come forward and said, ``I think we \nshould take this surplus and use it in a sensible way for the future of \nAmerica.'' I hope we engage in debate here in the 106th Congress, House \nand Senate, Democrats and Republicans, in a way to do that responsibly.\n  I think we should take the President's advice that at least 62 \npercent or so of this surplus be dedicated to Social Security, to \nretire the debt in Social Security, to give it a longer life. But then \nwe seem to break down after we kind of reach that agreement on 60 \npercent or so of that surplus, and it is that breakdown I would like to \naddress for just a few moments on the floor of the Senate this morning.\n  One of the things that concerns me is that there are other programs \nin need of help, not just Social Security, not the least of which is \nMedicare. And after we have taken some 60 percent of the surplus and \nspent it to solidify Social Security, the President is suggesting we \ntake some 15 percent of that surplus and invest that in Medicare, \nadding about 10 years to the Medicare Program.\n  We have to do more. Just putting that money in may buy some time. We \nknow the fundamentals of the program need to be addressed. And if I am \nnot mistaken, this week, or soon, we will have a report from a \nbipartisan commission on what to do with the future of Medicare. It \nwon't be easy, whatever it might be.\n  But I am concerned that the Republican Party, in addressing this same \nsurplus, does not speak to the need for more money into Medicare. \nInstead, what they are proposing is $776 billion in tax cuts. I cannot \nthink of two more popular words for a politician to utter than ``tax \ncuts.'' People just sit up and listen. ``Are you going to cut my taxes? \nI want to hear about it.'' It is a very popular thing to say.\n  But I hope we will step back for a moment and realize that a program \nlike Medicare needs an infusion of capital to make sure it can survive. \nGene Sperling, the economic advisor to the President, said the other \nday, in a bipartisan meeting, he is hoping the Republican leadership \nwill join us in not only dedicating surplus to Social Security but also \nto Medicare because so many millions of Americans are dependent on \nthat.\n  I might also say that I think there is need and room for some tax \ncuts after we have taken the surplus and put it into Social Security \nand Medicare, things we need to do. But I do not believe the tax cut \nwhich has been proposed, at least initially, by the Republican Party is \none that is fair, because, frankly, it is not progressive. Inasmuch as \nit is not progressive, this chart demonstrates what happens.\n  For the bottom 60 percent of wage earners in America, those making \n$38,000 a year or less, a 10-percent across-the-board tax cut means a \nsavings of $99 a year, about $8.25 a month--hardly enough to pay the \ncable TV bill, let alone change a lifestyle--$99 in tax cuts for the \nbottom 60 percent of wage earners in America.\n  The same Republican tax cut, though, for the top 1 percent of wage \nearners, those making over $833,000 a year--over $833,000 a year--for \nthem the Republican tax cut is worth $20,697. Ninety-nine dollars for \n60 percent of America; for 1 percent of America, $20,000 in tax breaks.\n  That offends me. And I think it is worthy of a debate. I think it is \nmore sensible for us to focus tax breaks on working middle-income \nfamilies--families who are trying to pay for day care, families who are \ntrying to save a few dollars for their kids' college education, \nfamilies who are trying to get by. Keeping this kind of a tax break for \nthe wealthiest of Americans may make them happy but I do not think it \nis good for this country.\n  I think the single best thing for us to do with this surplus is to \nretire our public debt. The President's proposal of focusing 62 percent \nof it in retiring the debt in Social Security and another 15 percent \ninto Medicare is eminently sensible. Before we take the money that \ncould be used to save Medicare and give it away in tax cuts that really \nbenefit the wealthiest of Americans, I hope we will stop and think \ntwice and remember that only 2 years ago we heard passionate speeches \non this floor that, without an amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States giving the Federal courts the authority to clamp down on \nCongress' runaway spending, deficits would loom for generations to \ncome.\n  We have turned that corner. With the leadership of the \nadministration, with the cooperation and leadership of a bipartisan \nCongress, we are here today discussing surpluses. Let us do it in a \nsensible way--retire the national debt, take that burden off future \ngenerations, put the money into Social Security and Medicare, so that \nthose programs will be sound for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S1746]]\n\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1745-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1746]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS--S. 311\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of S. 4, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to improve pay and retirement equity for \n     members of the Armed Forces, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I first wish to inquire of our colleague if he felt he \nhad adequate time to conclude his remarks. If not, I think we could \naccommodate him. Could someone ask the Senator to return momentarily?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Illinois did \nindicate to me he had completed. Thank you for your concern.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, we are ready to resume. I see the Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think the Senator from Idaho has an amendment, \nafter which I would like to be recognized to talk about an amendment as \nwell.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. President, fortunately we have a flurry of activity on this bill. \nWe have an amendment to be offered momentarily by our distinguished \ncolleague from Idaho. There are some 21 amendments that have been made \nknown to the managers, Mr. Levin and myself. And I am confident we can \nmake some strong gains today on this bill.\n  The leadership--and I presume in consultation with the Democratic \nleader--desire a vote at the conclusion of our two luncheon caucuses \ntoday. So after further consultation with the leadership, I think they \nwill direct me to seek from the Senate an understanding that we will \nvote at about 2:15 on the amendment of the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. President, before we proceed further on the bill this morning, I \nwould like to--each day as the bill is brought up, I am going to \naddress what I call the overnight constructive criticism that is \nbrought to bear on this piece of legislation. And I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in today's Record an editorial from the \nWashington Post, dated Tuesday, February 23, 1999, entitled ``Bad Bill \nin the Senate.''\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 23, 1999]\n\n                         Bad Bill in the Senate\n\n       The Senate this week is scheduled to debate a showy \n     military pay and pension bill whose enactment many members \n     realize would be a mistake but which no one in either party \n     seems prepared to oppose. The Republican leadership ordered \n     it split off from the rest of the defense authorization bill \n     to make it the first substantive bill of the year.\n       The goal is to demonstrate that Republicans do indeed have \n     a legislative agenda, and to take back from the president a \n     defense spending issue that Republicans regard as their own. \n     He too proposed pay and pension increases in his budget. His \n     were already more generous, particularly as to pensions, than \n     military personnel needs can justify. No matter; the bill, \n     which most Democrats as well as all Republicans on the Armed \n     Services Committee supported, is more generous still.\n       The services are having trouble with both recruitment and \n     retention in a strong economy. The pay raises in the bill may \n     well be justified in light of this, and help the services \n     compete. The pension proposals are the problem. They would \n     undo a hard-won reform that Ronald Reagan joined in enacting \n     in 1986, one purpose of which was to save money, another to \n     improve retention. The system this bill would restore was \n     dropped because it was thought to encourage experienced \n     people to leave the serve, not stay.\n       The estimated cost when fully effective is in the \n     neighborhood of $5 billion a year. The effect, if it happens, \n     will be to squeeze other parts of the military budget that \n     themselves are already tighter than they should be. The \n     current uniformed chiefs, who support the step in part as a \n     way of boosting morale, may not regret it, but their \n     successors will.\n       Last year the leaders of the Armed Services Committee \n     cautioned against a costly pension increase until the issue \n     could be studied. Several major studies are soon to be \n     completed, yet, for the flimsiest political reasons, the bill \n     is being rushed to a vote without them. A hurry-up vote on an \n     enormously costly bill with little to back it up can't \n     possible be good politics. It surely isn't good policy. It's \n     especially not good defense policy. A vote in favor will make \n     the opposite of the showing the leadership intends.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I will not take up too much time of the Senate here \ntoday, but I welcome constructive criticism, such as forwarded by this \npiece and others. And I am ready to meet it head on and reply and \nexplain exactly what it is that this Senator intends to achieve through \nthis bill.\n  We are faced every day that we get up with fewer and fewer young men \nand women willing to sign on the dotted line and take up an initial \ncareer in the U.S. military, and it is very serious for all the \nservices. Every day we wake up, fewer and fewer men and women who have \nbeen in the services, who have received--in many instances, pilots the \nmost notable--an extraordinary taxpayer investment in their training, \nare not seeking the opportunity to remain in the services. We have to \naddress these two ``hemorrhaging'' problems. That is the purpose for \ndriving this bill through.\n  I am confident when we emerge in conclusion of this bill, and we come \nto the final passage, we will probably have a better shaped instrument \nthan is before the Senate at this time, but that shaping has to take \nplace on this floor with constructive criticism such as the editorial \nsets forth.\n  This bill was driven by the testimony of the Chairman and the members \nof the Joint Chiefs in September and again in January.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record statements of \nthe Chairman and Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Retirement\n\n\n   gen. henry h. shelton, usa, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       First, we need to fix the so-called REDUX retirement system \n     and return the bulk of our forces to a program that covers \n     our most senior members--that is, a retirement system that \n     provides 50 percent of average base pay upon completion of 20 \n     years of service.\n       If we fail to address these critical personnel issues, we \n     will put at risk one of our greatest achievements for the \n     last quarter century, the all volunteer force.\n       It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets \n     the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries. These \n     talented people are the ones who won the Cold War and insured \n     our victory in Desert Storm. These dedicated professionals \n     make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many \n     missions we are called on to perform around the world every \n     single day.\n       I assure you, Mr. Chairman, that the troops and their \n     families appreciate this very much. But as I have noted that \n     alone will not be enough. As we develop the Fiscal Year 2000 \n     budget proposal, we will take a hard look on what must be \n     done on core compensation issues such as pay and retirement \n     to maintain the quality of the people in the military. No \n     task is more important in my view.\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       The ideal here would be the full retirement system. However \n     the triad that we referred to we consider to be very \n     important, and the reason in our recommendation initially was \n     to go with the 50 percent retirement with the COLA, the CPI \n     minus 1 percent retirement with a 2 percent floor, was \n     because the full retirement was a very expensive system to \n     restore and we wanted to make sure that we, in fact, could \n     have money to apply to pay reform because we think that is \n     very important too, that we reward performance vice just \n     longevity and put it in those mid-grades\n\n[[Page S1747]]\n\n     in the enlisted force as well as the officer force where we \n     have got retention challenges today in addition the standard \n     across the board raise of 3.6 in '99 and 4.4 percent in '00.\n       Chairman, this Congress has already taken an important step \n     in this process by supporting the 3.6 percent pay adjustment \n     for the military in 1999, preventing the pay gap from growing \n     any wider still. And as the President has pledged support for \n     a 4.4 percent pay raise in the Fiscal Year 2000 budget and \n     for adjustments in subsequent years at the ECI rate, this \n     will at least prevent a widening of the gap.\n       Senator Kempthorne, there was no specific agreement on that \n     particular issue because, as we pointed out during the \n     session with the President, there is a number of ways that \n     this issue can be addressed. We are currently looking at \n     various options and what the cost of this would be, not just \n     for a single year, for '00, for example, but across the FYDP. \n     So we had not reached that level of specificity when we met \n     with the President. That is currently being worked within the \n     Department of Defense.\n       Senator Kempthorne. Do you feel you will see efforts in \n     that direction with the Fiscal Year 2000 budget?\n       General Shelton. The President's instructions to us were to \n     come back to him and work with OMB. That certainly, as you \n     have heard this morning, is high on our agenda, to make sure \n     that we apply some of the resources to those two issues, pay \n     and retirement.\n\n\n        statement by dennis j. reimer, chief of staff, u.s. army\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       I would also say, Mr. Chairman and members of the \n     committee, that the soldiers are very excited about the pay \n     and compensation package. I would urge your immediate and \n     prompt support of the total package.\n       Soldiers are concerned about what they read about the pay \n     gap. Whether it is 8.5 or 13.5 percent, they know that there \n     is a pay gap out there. They are concerned about a retirement \n     system that is coming into being where we promised them 40 \n     percent of take-home pay, but they are finding out that 40 \n     percent of their take-home pay does not equal 40 percent of \n     their base pay.\n       There is no set solution, and I do not think pay and \n     retirement benefits alone is going to solve our problem, but \n     it is vital that we send that message out there to those \n     soldiers that we really care about them. But it is more about \n     making them feel good about the contributions they have made. \n     It is more about making them feel like they are doing the \n     things they joined the army to do.\n\n\n    Statement of Admiral Jay L. Johnson, U.S. Navy, Chief of Naval \n                               Operations\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       I would offer the following waterfront perspective having \n     just returned from the Pacific Northwest. First of all, the \n     resilience and esprit of our men and women is probably no \n     surprise to you, but it is most gratifying to me. But they, \n     indeed, have very serious concerns. They are working harder \n     with no end in sight. They are underpaid relative to what is \n     available to them on the outside. They believe the REDUX \n     retirement system, as you have heard, is broken, and they \n     are, frankly, tired of being asked to do more with less. \n     These things are on their minds as they make career \n     decisions.\n       In summary, my number one short-term concern is taking care \n     of our people, pay, retirement, OPTEMPO, stability at home, \n     and my number one long-term concern is building enough ships \n     and enough aircraft to recapitalize the force we know we \n     need.\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       I fully support Sec Cohen's initiative calling for a 4.4% \n     across the board pay raise, pay table reform, and restoration \n     of the 50% retirement package. This triad of initiatives is \n     absolutely essential in FY00 if we are to reverse the \n     negative trends in recruiting and retention.\n       I must reiterate a final point: I ask that you support Sec \n     Cohen's triad of pay and retirement initiatives as the most \n     critical of our needs with this FY00 budget.\n\n\n                             General Reimer\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       There is no set solution, and I do not think pay and \n     retirement benefits alone is going to solve our problem, but \n     it is vital that we send that message out there to those \n     soldiers that we really care about them. But it is more about \n     making them feel good about the contributions they have made. \n     It is more about making them feel like they are doing the \n     things they joined the army to do.\n\n\n Statement of Gen. Charles C. Krulak, Commandant of the Marine Corps, \n                           U.S. Marine Corps\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       Our unit commanders routinely cite dissatisfaction with the \n     40 percent retirement pension at 20 years of service (called \n     REDUX) as one of the foremost reasons for separations prior \n     to retirement eligibility. Originally intended to keep our \n     military personnel in for longer periods of time, it has had \n     the exact opposite effect. Marines who entered the service \n     after 1986 are, 12 yrs later, just beginning to understand \n     the importance of their future retirement. They note the \n     disparity between their pension benefit and the 50 percent, \n     ``traditional'' pension at 20 yrs afforded to their \n     predecessors, and they wonder why their service is considered \n     less significant. They are asking themselves whether 40 \n     percent of basic pay at the earliest retirement date is \n     adequate compensation for the level of sacrifice our Nation \n     demands from them and their families. Their answer is not to \n     stay in longer, as was the goal of REDUX, their answer is to \n     get out. Their answer is not to make the services a career. \n     The commanders' assessments indicate that Redux considerably \n     reduced enticements for having a military career and will \n     increasingly become a deciding factor regarding continued \n     service. The negative impact on retention, in turn, will \n     degrade the stability and quality of our officer and non-\n     commissioned officer force. Readiness will eventually suffer \n     as more experienced personnel leave for the civilian job \n     market and are replaced by less experienced, and in some \n     cases less qualified, Marines.\n       By restoring the traditional retirement plan, preserving \n     benefit services, pursuing the reduction of the civilian-\n     military pay gap, and enhancing their quality of life through \n     appropriate equipment and infrastructure repair and \n     replacement, we can demonstrate a clear and genuine \n     appreciation for the selfless service provided by our Marines \n     and their families. Your support for this goal was evident in \n     the 3.6% pay increase for 1999. As we continue in our quest \n     to further close the civilian-military pay gap and reduce \n     this critical readiness challenge, we need your continued \n     support for the planned 4.4% pay raise in 2000 and the \n     proposed replacement of the Redux retirement plan.\n\n\n        Statement of Gen. Michael E. Ryan, Chief of Staff, USAF\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       For the Air Force to continue attracting and retaining \n     quality people, we must be competitive with contemporary \n     labor markets. Restoring the retirement system as a retention \n     incentive is our top priority.\n\n\n                            Admiral Johnson\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       Pay and retirement benefits rank among our Sailors' top \n     dissatisfiers. We must be able to offer our Sailors a quality \n     of life that is competitive with their civilian counterparts. \n     The Congressionally approved pay increase of 3.6%, which took \n     effect Jan 1, 1999, was greatly appreciated. However, the pay \n     gap that exists and the reduced retirement package for those \n     who joined the Navy after August 1986 continue to hamper our \n     recruiting and retention efforts.\n       I fully support Sec. Cohen's initiative calling for a 4.4% \n     across the board pay raise, pay table reform, and restoration \n     of the 50% retirement package. This triad of initiatives is \n     absolutely essential in FY00 if we are to reverse the \n     negative trends in recruiting and retention.\n       I must reiterate a final point: I ask that you support Sec. \n     Cohen's triad of pay and retirement initiatives as the most \n     critical of our needs with this FY00 budget.\n       In summary, my number one short-term concern is taking care \n     of our people, pay, retirement, OPTEMPO, stability at home, \n     and my number one long-term concern is building enough ships \n     and enough aircraft to recapitalize the force we know we \n     need.\n\n\n                             General Krulak\n\n                            January 5, 1999\n\n       By restoring the traditional retirement plan, preserving \n     benefit services, pursuing the reduction of the civilian-\n     military pay gap, and enhancing their quality of life through \n     appropriate equipment and infrastructure repair and \n     replacement, we can demonstrate a clear and genuine \n     appreciation for the selfless service provided by our Marines \n     and their families.

Henry H. Shelton\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       In our recent efforts to balance these important and \n     competing requirements, we have allowed the pay of our \n     soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines to fall well behind \n     that of the civilian counterparts.\n       One can argue about how large the pay gap is depending on \n     the base year selected, but the estimates range from 8.5 \n     percent to 13.5 percent, and very few deny that the gap is \n     real.\n       If we fail to address these critical personnel issues, we \n     will put at risk one of our greatest achievements for the \n     last quarter century, the all volunteer force.\n       It is the quality of the men and women who serve that sets \n     the U.S. military apart from all potential adversaries.

These dedicated professionals \n     make it possible for the United States to accomplish the many \n     missions we are called on to perform around the world every \n     single day.\n       We must begin to close the substantial gap between what we \n     pay our men and women in uniform and what their civilian \n     counterparts with similar skills, training and education are \n     earning.\n       I assure you, Mr. Chairman, that the troops and their \n     families appreciate this very much. But as I have noted, that \n     alone will not be enough. As we develop the Fiscal Year 2000 \n     budget proposal, we will take a\n\n[[Page S1748]]\n\n     hard look on what must be done on core compensation issues \n     such as pay and retirement to maintain the quality of the \n     people in the military. No task is more important in my view.\n       And, as I said earlier, there are various estimates about \n     the magnitude of the pay gap and there are several time lines \n     that could be considered for closing that gap. But we must \n     act soon to send a clear signal to the backbone of our \n     officers, that their leadership and this Congress recognize \n     the value of their service and their sacrifices, and that we \n     have not lost sight of our commitment to the success of the \n     all volunteer force.\n\n                             III. Personnel\n\n\n                         Gen. Henry H. Shelton\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       We already see troubling signs that we are not on the path \n     to success in that effort. Our retention rates are falling, \n     particularly in some of our most critical skills, like \n     aviation and electronics, the very skills that are in demand \n     in our vibrant economy. And we are having to work harder to \n     attract the motivated, well-educated young people we need to \n     operate our increasingly complex systems.\n       So, Mr. Chairman, my recommendation is to apply additional \n     funding to two very real, very pressing concerns. First, we \n     need to fix the so-called REDUX retirement system and return \n     the bulk of our force to the program that covers our more \n     senior members--that is, a retirement program that provides \n     50 percent of average base pay upon completion of twenty \n     years of service. Second, we must begin to close the \n     substantial gap between what we pay our men and women in \n     uniform and what their civilian counterparts with similar \n     skills, training, and education are earning.\n       The President has pledged support for a 4.4 percent pay \n     raise in the Fiscal Year 2000 budget and for adjustments in \n     subsequent years at the ECI rate to at least prevent further \n     widening of the pay gap.\n\n\n                         Gen. Dennis J. Reimer\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       Personnel shortfalls were having an adverse impact on \n     current readiness, and these concerns were clearly reflected \n     in their Unit Status Reports (USRs).\n       The net effect of the drawdown and change process has been \n     too few soldiers to fill too many requirements. That left us \n     with too many undermanned and unmanned squads and crews, and \n     shortages in officer and noncommissioned officer positions.\n       Today, funding concerns have replaced manning as the number \n     one issue for commanders.\n\n\n                            Quality of life\n\n       One can argue about how large the pay gap is depending on \n     the base-year selected, but the estimates range from 8.5 \n     percent to 13.5 percent. Few deny that the gap is real.\n       Another key factor seriously affecting our force today is \n     the different retirement system for the most junior two-\n     thirds of the force. In 1986, Congress changed the Armed \n     Forces retirement system to one that is increasingly \n     perceived by our military members as simply not good enough \n     to justify making a career of military service.\n\n\n                         Gen. Dennis J. Reimer\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       As operations continue apace, the cost of maintaining \n     excess capacity and inefficient business practices can only \n     be supported at the expense of readiness and quality of life.\n       Over the past few years, commanders have resourced BASOPS \n     and RPM at the absolute minimum in order to protect training.\n\n\n                          Adm. Jay L. Johnson\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       The quality of life of our Sailors is the issue that \n     concerns me above all others. Our ability to attract and \n     retain an all-volunteer force is increasingly being tasted in \n     the face of the strong national economy.\n       If we do not reduce the workload and provide Sailors with \n     pay and benefits competitive with their civilian \n     counterparts, they will leave the Service.\n       The very nature of our operation--forward deployed with a \n     high OPTEMPO--is also taking a toll on our people. The \n     frustrations our Sailors are experiencing is related to the \n     increasing amount of time they are spending at sea while \n     deployed and at work while non-deployed.\n\n\n                          Gen. Michael E. Ryan\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       We are especially interested in restoring the retirement \n     system as a retention incentive. At the same time, we need to \n     keep pace with inflation and close the gap between the \n     military and private sector wages. Pay and retirement are not \n     the only reasons of concern.\n\n\n                         Gen. Charles C. Krulak\n\n                           September 29, 1998\n\n       Our austere military construction program also remains \n     seriously underfunded, allowing us to focus only on meeting \n     our most immediate readiness needs, complying with safety and \n     environmental standards, and maintaining our commitment to \n     bachelor quarters construction.\n       At current funding levels, our plant replacement cycle \n     exceeds 190 years, compared with an industry standard of 50 \n     years! Our goal is to replace our physical plant every 100 \n     years be investing one percent of the plant value in new \n     construction. Attainment of this goal would require an \n     additional $75 million one year by investing one percent of \n     the plant value in new construction. Attainment of this goal \n     would require an additional $75 each year across the FYDP. If \n     we attempted to achieve the industry standard, it would \n     require an additional $275 million per year. We have a family \n     housing deficit of 10,000 units which is not corrected under \n     the current FYDP, and there are 12,000 houses which require \n     revitalization. The Department of Defense goal is to \n     eliminate all substandard housing by FY10. At current funding \n     levels, we will not attain that goal until FY15. Essential \n     rehabilitation as required by Department of Defense guidance \n     would necessitate an additional $940 million.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. This committee has done a conscientious effort to react \nto the specific directions given to us by the senior military officers \nof the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the Marine Corps.\n  I thank the indulgence of the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n(Purpose: To repeal the reduction in military retired pay for civilian \n                  employees of the Federal Government)\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 9.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 39, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 204. REPEAL OF REDUCTION IN RETIRED PAY FOR CIVILIAN \n                   EMPLOYEES.\n\n       (a) Repeal.--(1) Section 5532 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is repealed.\n       (2) The chapter analysis at the beginning of chapter 55 of \n     such title is amended by striking out the item relating to \n     section 5532.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the first day of the first month that \n     begins after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nLott. It is an amendment that will repeal the current statute that \nreduces retirement payment for regular officers of the uniformed \nservice who choose to work for the Federal Government. The uniformed \nservices include the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, the Public \nHealth Service, and the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency.\n  If a retired officer from the uniformed services comes to work for \nthe Senate, his or her retirement pay is reduced by about 50 percent, \nafter the first $8,000, to offset for payments from the Senate.\n  The retired officer can request a waiver but the executive, \nlegislative and judicial branches of government handle the waiver \nprocess differently on a case by case basis.\n  The dual compensation limitation is also discriminatory in that \nregular officers are covered by reservists and enlisted personnel are \nnot covered by the limitation.\n  My amendment should be scored at zero because no additional \ndiscretionary funds are required to implement the change and the \nuniformed services retirement system is fully funded to pay retirees \ntheir full retirement benefit that they have earned.\n  In fact, because of this law, many of them are discouraged from \nseeking employment from the federal government. I have been unable to \nfind one good reason to explain why we should want our law to \ndiscourage retired members of the uniformed services from seeking full \ntime employment with the federal government. It deprives them of an \nimportant opportunity for employment and it deprives our government \nfrom their able expertise and service.\n  This amendment would fix this inequity, and give retired officers \nequal pay for equal work from the federal government and it would give \nthe federal government access to a workforce that currently avoids \nemployment with the federal government.\n  I hope this amendment will be accepted by all involved. I yield back \nmy time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could just say a word about the \namendment pending from the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I am \nprepared to support that amendment. It is long overdue, and I think it \njust removes\n\n[[Page S1749]]\n\nanother one of the inequities that, regrettably, from time to time \nthroughout history come up through our system. Those men and women who \nserve in the active forces for great periods of time should not be \npenalized when a Reserve officer or a Guard officer or others, don't \nhave a comparable situation. So I commend the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to briefly explain my reasons for \nopposing this amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and \nMarines' Bill of Rights. This amendment may look alright on the \nsurface, but it falls apart when it is closely examined. Apparently, no \none has estimated how much this amendment would cost if it became law, \nand no one knows how we would fund the changes that this amendment \nwould require in the pension system. I cannot in good conscience \nsupport a measure when we have not considered that basic information.\n  I fully support the goals of this bill and this amendment. I think \nthat our men and women in uniform deserve good pay and benefits, but we \nmust be responsible when we take these sorts of actions. Our uniformed \npersonnel would be the first to tell us that. There have been no \nhearings on this amendment or this bill, and there is no evidence that \nthis change in pension policy for military retirees will improve \nretention.\n  I want to focus on the issue of how we would pay for this amendment. \nIt seems to me that a vote for this amendment is a vote to cut military \nprocurement, research and development, military construction, or some \nother item in the defense budget. If it is not a vote to cut the \ndefense budget, a vote for this amendment would have us dip into the \nsurplus to cover the full pensions of military retirees. I would prefer \nto see the surplus go towards ensuring the long-term solvency of Social \nSecurity. Perhaps, though, the drafters of this amendment do not intend \nto find offsets in the defense budget or use the surplus. In that case, \nthe only thing left to do to fund this amendment is to go into domestic \nspending. I would most certainly be opposed to that course of action. \nIn short, none of the three possible options for funding this amendment \nappeals to me, and that is why I opposed it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                          MILITARY HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment later \ntoday which I hope can become a part of the bill and will be acceptable \nto the managers. I have been trying to work with everyone who is \nconcerned about the military health care issue, and I look forward to \nhaving it be a part of this bill.\n  Today, I, along with one of my cosponsors, Senator Edwards from North \nCarolina, will talk about what is in this very important amendment. \nBoth Senator Hagel and Senator Helms are also cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  I have just finished touring every single base in Texas--Army, Navy, \nAir Force--and I have talked to young enlisted people, young \nnoncommissioned officers, recruits. I went to Lackland and I talked to \npeople who are in their first month in the Air Force. I talked to these \nyoung people, as well as people all the way up and down the line, about \ntheir concerns. Of course, we know that we are having the biggest \nretention problem that we have had in the military for a long time. In \nfact, for every pilot we keep in the Air Force, we lose two. We are \nalso looking at tough recruiting.\n  We are looking for ways to say to our military personnel, we want you \nto come and be a part of our armed services because we are proud of the \njob that our armed services do; and we are saying to the experienced \npeople in our military, we want you to stay because we need our \nexperienced pilots and sailors and those who are on the ground. We need \nevery one of you to stay in.\n  I talked about why they aren't staying in. First and foremost is pay. \nWe are addressing that in the military bill of rights. Second to pay is \nhealth care. Health care is part of the package that we promised to our \nmilitary personnel. It is part of the package that we say we are going \nto give to the military, to their families and to retirees. We say we \nwill provide for your health care now and we will provide for it when \nyou retire. That is part of the incentive for signing up for the \nmilitary.\n  I became very concerned and started looking at the different military \nhealth care options. It differs around the country. TRICARE, which has \nbeen adopted by much of the military, is the system that really needs \nfixing. TRICARE says to community doctors, we will reimburse you to \nserve our military personnel. In fact, we have cut back on military \nhealth care facilities in the Base Closing Commission. There are fewer \nhealth care facilities, so we reached out into the community.\n  The problem is the bureaucracy. Getting a claim is causing the \ndoctors to say, ``I don't need this, I can't deal with it. It is much \nworse than Medicare or any other government program with which we have \nworked.'' Doctors are saying, ``I'm not going to serve our military \npersonnel.''\n  If you are in the town of Abilene and you can't get a pediatrician \nfor the children of the military personnel, this is a problem.\n  I, along with Senators Edwards, Hagel and Helms, have introduced a \nbill called the Military Health Care Improvement Act of 1999. This is \nthe amendment that we are offering today. Basically, what the amendment \ndoes is require that benefits be portable across the regions \nestablished in the current system so that once you have a TRICARE \ncoverage and you move--which we know our military personnel do every 2 \nor 3 years--you will be able to keep that coverage as you cross \nregions. That will make it much easier for our personnel to know \nexactly the kind of care they are getting. We would ensure that \nmilitary coverage is comparable to the average coverage available to \ncivilian Government employees, many of whom work side by side with our \nmilitary personnel. We think it should be comparable.\n  Third, we minimize the bureaucratic red tape and streamline the \nclaims processing. This is one of the big problems. It will not cost \nmoney to fix--and probably will save money. If we could streamline the \nclaims processing, it will be easier for the Department of Defense, and \ncertainly easier for the person who is getting this health care. It \nwould increase reimbursement levels to attract and retain qualified \nhealth care providers. Now, this is an option with the Department of \nDefense, where they need to be able to increase the coverage. It would \nallow the Department of Defense to say, all right, as an incentive to \nget this coverage for our personnel in this area, we will increase the \nreimbursement levels.\n  Fifth, it would increase the revenues to military treatment \nfacilities by permitting reimbursement at Medicare rates from third \nparty payers. Now, this is something that will be very important to our \nmilitary hospitals, where they can get reimbursed at the Medicare \nlevel, or they can be reimbursed by Medicare through subvention. We \nwant them to be able to do that. That will, in fact, help our \nDepartment of Defense get the same level of reimbursement into the \nmilitary hospitals that anyone going to a civilian hospital would be \nentitled to.\n\n  So we are very hopeful that this amendment will just be accepted by \nthe sponsors of the bill, because you can't have a military bill of \nrights that says we are going to deal with the biggest issues of \nrecruiting and retention that we have in the military without \naddressing health care.\n  I want to commend the chairman and the distinguished ranking member \nof the Armed Services Committee for getting this bill up and out as the \nvery first piece of major legislation we are going to pass in this \nsession. They are increasing the pay, and that is the key issue for \nmost people in our military. And they are bringing the pension up to \nthe 50-percent level. I applaud them for that.\n  I want to add a third element of the problems that our military are \nfacing, and that is quality health care. We have more military families \nthan we have ever had in the military before. Back in the old days, \nmany of our people in the military, the personnel, were single. That is \nnot the case today. Now most of them are married and most of them have \nfamilies. So we must deal with that reality and make the military \nfamily-friendly if we are going to keep the good people of our country \nwho want to be married and have families, which is the normal thing \nthat we\n\n[[Page S1750]]\n\nwould like for people to have the option to do.\n  So that is the crux of our amendment. I think it is a good amendment. \nI believe the Department of Defense will have a lot of latitude to work \nwith this issue. But it must be addressed. We cannot have shoddy health \ncare coverage that differs in different regions of the country, \ndepending on what the military health care facilities are. If you don't \nhave a military hospital in a city that has a military base, you have \nto provide for that health care. We want it to be good quality health \ncare.\n  I will never forget when I was over in Saudi Arabia visiting an Air \nForce base with our personnel. We were talking to these fliers and \nasked, ``What is your biggest problem?'' One flier said, ``Senator, my \nbiggest problem is that I called home yesterday and my wife was in \ntears because we have a sick baby and not a doctor in the city will \nserve our baby. That is the biggest problem I have.'' And I said, \n``Wait a minute, that is a problem we can fix.''\n  That is what the amendment that I and Senator Edwards and Senator \nHagel and Senator Helms are offering today. We don't want one pilot in \nour military in Saudi Arabia or in Turkey or in Bosnia or in Italy or \nanywhere else to tell us that their biggest problem is that they called \nhome last night and their wife is in tears with a sick baby who cannot \nget a pediatrician to see that baby.\n  So that is what our amendment will do. I appreciate the distinguished \nchairman of the committee allowing me to talk about this amendment. I \nreally hope that he is going to accept this amendment because this \ncould be the third part of the improvement that he is seeking, by \nincreasing the pay, by increasing the pensions, and health care. I hope \nthat we can do this so that we can say truthfully to everyone that \ncomes into a recruiting office that we are going to give you the health \ncare, the pay, and the pension that will make this a great job, because \nwe want you to serve our country and protect our freedom.\n\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to commend our colleague from \nTexas. I express once again the regret of the Armed Services Committee \nthat we could not keep her on that committee. We knew the demands of \nTexas were perhaps matched by the Appropriations Committee, where she \nalso has the opportunity to work with the Defense Subcommittee on \nAppropriations so that she is still very much involved in defense \nissues.\n  This, I hope, is an amendment that we can accept. We will be working \nwith the Senator from Texas throughout perhaps today and tomorrow. But \nshe is absolutely right. My constituents, as I travel among the bases, \nbring this to my attention wherever I go. I commend the Senator for her \nleadership.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the chairman. If the Senator will make me an \nhonorary member of the Armed Services Committee, I will be there in a \nflash.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator can come back tomorrow. We want to hear from \nour colleague who is going to address this bill.\n  Are we agreeable on the vote at 2:15?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I haven't seen that yet. If you will withhold on that.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Larry Slade, \na fellow in Senator McCain's office, be allowed access to the Chamber \nduring the discussion of S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, relative to the amendment of the Senators from \nTexas and North Carolina, we understand that both of them have joined \ntogether in that amendment. We are very supportive of that effort. We \nthink it is an important effort. Health care for themselves and mainly \nfor their families is the number one concern of our uniformed military. \nThis amendment would be very, very helpful.\n  I want to commend both Senator Hutchison and Senator Edwards for this \namendment. I look forward to accepting this amendment. More important, \nI think the uniformed military and their families look forward to this \nimprovement. I commend both of them. After Senator Edwards is \nrecognized next, when we then go back to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom Idaho, I will have a question to ask of him.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. EDWARDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Edwards.\n  Mr. Edwards. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator Warner and \nSenator Levin for their comments. I rise today in support of Senator \nHutchison's amendment. I think it is critically important that we set \nminimal standards for TRICARE, which provides health insurance care for \nall of our military personnel, their dependents, and retirees.\n  There are currently 6.6 million people who are enrolled in TRICARE \nand 350,000 who are located in North Carolina. So I want to talk \nbriefly about why this amendment is critical not only to the country, \nbut also to the people of North Carolina.\n  Comdr. Ronald Smith, who is in the Greensboro-High Point area of \nNorth Carolina, has warned me about the experiences of his soldiers \nwith TRICARE. In all of Guilford County, which is actually one of the \nlargest counties in the State of North Carolina in terms of population, \nnot a single primary care manager is willing to see his soldiers or \ntheir dependents. The nearest TRICARE hospital available is Womack Army \nHospital, which is almost a 2-hour drive away.\n  Just last week, one of his active duty female soldiers drove to \nanother county to see one of the only two primary care providers \navailable in that area, only to find that they would not let her leave \nwithout paying a copayment, even as an active duty member of the \nmilitary.\n\n  Commander Smith tells me that local pharmacists are unwilling to fill \nmilitary personnel prescriptions without up-front payment because they \nhave had trouble getting reimbursed by TRICARE. Consequently, one \nsecond-class petty officer who recently came down with a bad case of \nthe flu 4 days before payday was forced to take a no-interest loan in \norder to pay the prescriptions to treat her condition. Another active \nduty soldier held off on getting her blood pressure medication \nprescription refilled--she went without the medication for a week--\nbecause she couldn't afford the out-of-pocket expense for the \nmedication.\n  All of this happens because local private physicians and pharmacist \nare unwilling to contract with TRICARE due to the lengthy waiting \nperiod for reimbursement and because reimbursement rates often fall \nbelow those allowed even by Medicare.\n  Recently in Onslow County, NC, the Onslow Hospital Authority voted \nunanimously to terminate the contract with TRICARE when it expires on \nMay 1 and to renegotiate a new one. Onslow Memorial Hospital is \ncurrently owed more than $2 million in back claims from TRICARE.\n  Sgt. John Williams of Fayetteville, NC, recently wrote to me with his \nexperience. His family is enrolled in TRICARE Prime. His daughter \nreceived a dermatologist consult in November from Womack Army Hospital. \nHowever, her appointments with the physician were canceled by the \ndoctor's office three times, the last time with the explanation that \nthe doctor had quit. In order to get an appointment with the new \ndermatologist, the girl had to go back through Womack. Sergeant \nWilliams was told that if he chose to take her to a specialist at Duke \nof his own choice, TRICARE wouldn't pay and that a $300 charge would \nhave to come out of his own packet.\n  Sabrina Williams had been waiting 81 days, at the time of Sergeant \nWilliams' letter in January, to be seen by a dermatologist. In the \nmeantime, the rash she was complaining of initially has spread over her \nentire body. She now has a second appointment with the dermatologist on \nMarch 1. Her first referral was on November 6 of last year.\n  As Senator Hutchison recognizes and as I recognize, we have to do \nbetter. Of course, I share everyone's concern about the cost of \nimplementing this program. Indeed, I am concerned about\n\n[[Page S1751]]\n\nthe cost of the whole bill. But after this TRICARE amendment, we have \ndrafted a provision for assessing the cost of implementation within 6 \nmonths of enactment, and I am confident it will not cost much. We are \naiming for increased efficiency with this, not increased costs.\n  I believe that the TRICARE system can be made to work if we work to \nmake it better. This amendment takes the initial steps to addressing \nsome of the main problems that are widely recognized by all of those \nparticipating in TRICARE.\n  Our service men and women deserve reliable, quality health care. We \nmust show them that we value their commitment to our country by \nfollowing through on our commitment to provide this fundamental \nbenefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure. The TRICARE system has \nserious problems that need to be fixed. So I am proud to cosponsor \nSenator Hutchison's amendment.\n  Thank you. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank the Senators. Subject to \nconcurrence by the distinguished ranking member and others, I hope we \ncan arrive at a vote on this amendment this afternoon, with an \nopportunity preceding that vote with the sponsors to once again address \nit. I understand another Senator has indicated his desire to speak to \nthis amendment.\n\n  So I hope we can put this up as a package and have it addressed by \nthe Senate in the form of a vote this afternoon.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I would \nlike to first say how much I appreciate Senator Edwards working with me \non this amendment. This is a very important issue in North Carolina. He \ncertainly understands it. I appreciate his statements.\n  I ask the chairman if we can have about 15 or 20 minutes in closing \nbefore we go to a vote once this is acceptable. Then we could hear from \nSenator Hagel as well as Senator Edwards.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that could be done. I would like to \nconclude the discussion on this amendment because we wish to go into \nrecess at 12 o'clock and there are several other Senators desiring to \nbe recognized. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  At this time, Mr. President, I think it is in order--we have revised \nit. While we are waiting for that, it is my understanding Senator Levin \nhas some questions for the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if my good friend from Virginia will yield \non this unanimous consent proposal which he is about to propound, I \nunderstand it is going to be revised.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It has to be further amended, because we want to make sure \nthat in the event there is a point of order--we don't know whether \nthere will be one or not--but in the event there is a point of order, \nthat a motion to waive that point of order would be debatable. I don't \nknow that there will. But the Budget Committee folks are now apparently \nin a hearing. We can't get an answer from them as to whether or not \nthere is an interest in making a point of order, assuming one lies. And \nI am not sure we even know yet whether or not a point of order lies. \nBut we want to protect the rights of those Members.\n  So in order to do that, we have to protect the rights of anyone to \nmake a point of order and to debate a motion to waive that point of \norder. That is being written.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure my colleague that this is now \nbeing redrawn.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it needs to be redrawn further in order to \nprotect the point of order and motion to debate.\n  Mr. WARNER. We will put that aside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We can just add it. Perhaps, while we are waiting for \nthat, I can ask our friend from Idaho a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 9\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I generally support the thrust of the Senator's amendment. \nBut I also want to make sure that it accomplishes its goal in the \nCongress too.\n  One of the issues which has been raised is whether or not the \namendment addresses the administrative cap that exists on salaries here \nin the Senate, and I understand there is a similar administrative cap \nthat exists in the House as well. That is one of the issues as to \nwhether or not changing the law here will, in effect, accomplish the \npurpose or then just create another inconsistency between Congress and \nthe executive branch.\n\n  So that is one issue which perhaps the Senator can address. The other \nissue is just the concern that I have as a member of the Governmental \nAffairs Committee which is that we should give that committee an \nopportunity to take a look at this amendment, because there is a civil \nservice aspect to this which they may have some feelings about and we \nwere trying to see whether or not there is any desire on the part of \neither the chairman, ranking member of Governmental Affairs, or anyone \nelse on that committee to speak on this amendment. We have been unable \nto ascertain that.\n  But taking the first question first, I am wondering whether or not \nthe Senator would comment on the question whether or not his amendment \nwould address the current administrative cap that exists on staff \nsalaries here in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Michigan. I \nappreciate the Senator's commitment.\n  This amendment simply eliminates the dual compensation prohibition in \nthe statute. It does not specifically address the administrative cap \nthat Congress has on top of that limitation placed on those who seek \nemployment with Congress.\n  It should be clarified that although it does not remove the cap that \nthe Senate and House have administratively placed on their own \ncircumstances, it does solve the problem for our military retirees in \nall other branches of Government. And with regard to the Congress, it \nsolves the problem up to the cap that Congress has put into place, \nwhich is a significant benefit to those who now are not able to get any \nsupport from the circumstance after the first $8,000 of compensation.\n  I agree with what I assume to be the ranking member's concerns and \nwould be very willing to work with them to try to address that \nsituation with regard to the administrative cap imposed by the Senate \nand by the House. But we must solve these problems one step at a time, \nand the first step must be to eliminate the dual compensation \nprohibition in the statute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend from Virginia will \naddress this issue as well. We have an administrative cap on staff \nsalaries here in the Senate, and this amendment does not address that \nadministrative cap. So we would be correcting one problem.\n  I happen to support the thrust of that, which is that we would not be \nputting our active duty retirees at a disadvantage compared to our \nReserve retirees. But we are also creating, in a sense, another \ninequality because the executive branch now would have no restriction \nadministratively, whereas we apparently will retain this administrative \ncap.\n  So I am concerned about that inequity that would be created between \nourselves and the executive branch with the passage of this, and I \nsimply want to point it out. I think the direction here is the right \none. But I do think we are facing another inequity. We are creating, in \neffect, another equity by eliminating the executive branch statutory \ncap and eliminating our statutory cap, leaving in place the \nadministrative cap that is already in there.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my friend and colleague raises a very \nvalid point, and I suggest that we address that in the course of this \nbill but allow this amendment to go forward, because numerically we are \ntalking about a relatively small number of officers who, fortunately--\nand I underline ``fortunately''--have offered their service to the \nCongress in comparison to many others throughout other agencies and \ndepartments in the Government.\n  So I would not want the amendment by our distinguished colleague to \nbe delayed from a vote subject to our reconsideration of this very \nimportant issue.\n\n[[Page S1752]]\n\n  As you might imagine, I think it is incumbent upon primarily the two \nof us to consult with one of our more distinguished colleagues around \nhere whose knowledge of the Senate and salaries gave rise to this \namendment. I would certainly want his input before we tried to make any \nadjustment.\n  Why don't we leave it that we can go ahead with this amendment, and \nat a time convenient in the course of the deliberations on this bill we \nwill address the other problem.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Virginia for that \nresponse. I wonder if the Senator from Idaho has discussed with the \npersons who were involved actively in placing that administrative cap \nin the--relative to the issue of removing that cap, have there been any \ndiscussions and, if so, could he share those perhaps with the Senate.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, no, I have not discussed removing the \nadministrative cap with those who placed it, but I would be very \nwilling, as I said before, to do so and to work toward that end because \nI agree that that is one more inequity that should be removed. I think \nit is an inequity that already exists and, as the chairman indicated, \nonly applies--if this amendment passes, it only applies at the very \nhighest levels of salary, then only to a very small number of \npersonnel, but that inequity should also be removed, and I would be \nglad to work on that effort.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, in a moment the chairman will be \npropounding a unanimous consent request which I will support.\n  I do want to have one caveat on it, however, and that is that the \nGovernmental Affairs members, as far as I know, have not had an \nopportunity to review this. This is within their jurisdiction; it \naffects civil service, and I think we should alert--I am hereby \nalerting them that there would be a vote on this matter at 2:15--and I \nthink that in the event that a member of that committee, or anyone else \nfor that reason, that it is within the jurisdiction of another \ncommittee, wanted to speak on this amendment before it were adopted, I \nwould support a request from such a member to have an opportunity to \nspeak for a brief amount of time prior to the vote. It would require a \nchange in the unanimous consent agreement, and I am going to support \nthis unanimous consent agreement so we can sequence some votes at 2:15, \nbut I do want to alert our colleagues particularly on the Governmental \nAffairs Committee that this is an amendment within their jurisdiction, \nand if any member of that committee or any other member wants to speak \nto it for that reason, that this is not in the jurisdiction of Armed \nServices but a different committee, I would support--that doesn't mean \nit will succeed, but I will support a modification in our unanimous \nconsent agreement at 2:15 to permit a short period of time for such \namendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest that I propound the request, \nthen the Senator propound his amendment. And I am certain that I will \nagree to it.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \noccur on or in relation to amendment No. 9 at 2:15 today, and that no \namendments be in order prior to the vote on amendment No. 9, and, \nfurther, no points of order be waived with respect to the amendment. I \nfurther ask that with respect to a motion to waive the Budget Act or \nportions thereof, the motion to waive be debatable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that concludes this amendment. There are \ntwo Senators seeking recognition, and therefore I am going to yield the \nfloor momentarily.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have some general remarks about the \nbill. I know that under the previous order we are to recess at 12, and \nI will try to make my remarks as brief as possible. I know the senior \nSenator from Kansas has some remarks as well.\n  I know there is a lot of concern about the U.S. involvement in \nputting troops into Kosovo. I wish to bring to the attention of my \ncolleagues a conference report that was passed last year as part of the \ndefense appropriations bill that says--as a matter of fact it is law--\nthe President and the administration must come to the Congress with a \nreport of that deployment. Senator Hutchison and I will be making some \nremarks sometime later this afternoon in regard to this provision.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this page of the Conference Report \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMaking Appropriations for the Department of Defense for the Fiscal Year \n Ending September 30, 1999, and for Other Purposes--Conference Report \n                           (H. Rept. 105-746)\n\n       Sec. 8115. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available under this Act may be obligated or expended \n     for any additional deployment of forces of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia \n     unless and until the President, after consultation with the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader \n     of the Senate, the Minority Leader of the House of \n     Representatives, and the Minority Leader of the Senate, \n     transmits to Congress a report on the deployment that \n     includes the following:\n       (1) The President's certification that the presence of \n     those forces in each country to which the forces are to be \n     deployed is necessary in the national security interests of \n     the United States.\n       (2) The reasons why the deployment is in the national \n     security interests of the United States.\n       (3) The number of United States military personnel to be \n     deployed to each country.\n       (4) The mission and objectives of forces to be deployed.\n       (5) The expected schedule for accomplishing the objectives \n     of the deployment.\n       (6) The exit strategy for United States forces engaged in \n     the deployment.\n       (7) The costs associated with the deployment and the \n     funding sources for paying those costs.\n       (8) The anticipated effects of the deployment on the \n     morale, retention, and effectiveness of United States forces.\n       (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to a deployment of \n     forces--\n       (1) in accordance with United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 795; or\n       (2) under circumstances determined by the President to be \n     an emergency necessitating immediate deployment of the \n     forces.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to restrict the \n     authority of the President under the Constitution to protect \n     the lives of United States citizens.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might interject here----\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted to yield to the distinguished \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. On the question of procedure, there is an order for the \nSenate to go into recess at 12. I ask unanimous consent that that order \nbe extended beyond the hour of 12 to accommodate Senators. How much \ntime would the Senator like?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I should be able to finish in 15 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps a little less maybe.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Maybe 13\\1/2\\.\n  Mr. WARNER. Would 10 do?\n  And the Senator from Kansas, how much time does he want?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think I could do it in 7 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And the Senator from Louisiana?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Four minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess \nat the hour of 12:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would want \nto clarify it. That would then be the sequence of the remarks?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor this legislation that is designed to provide fair compensation, \nimproved educational opportunities, enhanced financial saving program, \nand a fair retirement system for the men, women and families of the \nArmed Forces of the United States.\n  America is facing a serious crisis in the recruitment and retention \nof key members of the military. This crisis is a very complicated issue \nand one that has a complex answer. I am confident that the elements of \nthis bill, S. 4, are an integral part of the solution to these \nproblems. But I am also confident that passage alone will not correct \nall of the problems we face.\n  Near the end of the last Congress and after talking to soldiers in \nthe field, senior enlisted and officer leadership of the US military, I \nwas struck with the myriad of problems facing our service members. \nThese problems are contributing to the rapid decline in mid grade\n\n[[Page S1753]]\n\nretention and the growing inability to recruit new members of our \nmilitary.\n  I might add that I was just out to Fort Leavenworth, KS, and the Army \nis 40 percent short in regard to the recruiting targets they have to \nhave to simply accomplish their mission. That is as of last week. I \ncame to the floor and laid out what I saw as the key components of \ntheir discontent. Rather than restate my comments of last fall, let me \njust highlight my key points:\n  1. We have significantly increased the work load on a substantially \nsmaller military.\n  Since the percentage of service members that are married has grown, \nthis increased work load has amplified the negative effect of \ndeployments on the morale of our troops and their families. The \nreluctance of families to continue to tolerate these separations \ncontributes to the loss of mid-career personnel.\n  2. With a significantly increased deployment schedule on a \nsubstantially smaller force, the value and importance of today's \nmissions impacts on the willingness of the men and women to join or \ncommit to the military as a career.\n  Without clearly articulated mission goals and objectives founded in \nthe fundamental of the U.S. vital national interest, the ability to \nrecruit and retain motivated men and women for our military will remain \ndifficult.\n\n  3. Although the skill level required of the men and women of our \nmilitary continues to grow, the pay differential between the same \nskilled civilian and the military continues to widen.\n  The current pay of many of our young military families is so low that \nit is not adequate to keep them off of welfare programs. The prospect \nof continued and frequent, long deployments coupled with the \nopportunity to get better pay on the ``outside'' for the same work \ncontributes to the inability to attract and retain the skills needed \nfor today's military.\n  4. We ask our military to deploy at a much higher pace than ever \nbefore, we assign missions that do not meet the ``national interest'' \nthreshold, we pay them less than they could get for the same or similar \nskills as a civilian, and in many cases we ask them to live in \nsubstandard housing.\n  It goes without saying that the culmination of these problems \ncontribute to the dissatisfaction with the military as a career and its \nattractiveness to potential recruits.\n  5. The members of our military are working harder, deploying more, \nreceiving less pay than civilians are for the same job, living in \ninadequate housing, and now are seeing a reduction in their retirement \nbenefits.\n  It is not difficult to understand that with this collection of \nnegatives, the military is experiencing problems in retention and \nrecruiting.\n  As I have stated before, S. 4 does not solve all of the problems \ncontributing to the crisis in retention and recruiting but it does \nstrike at the heart of many of the problems facing our military. \nSpecifically:\n  It works to close the gap between civilian and military pay for \nsimilar skills. Just as importantly, it reforms the military pay tables \nto better reward promotion rather than longevity.\n\n  It establishes a savings program by authorizing members of the \nmilitary to put up to 5% of their basic pay in a thrift savings plan--a \nplan already available to other federal workers. Additionally, it \nallows service secretaries to focus some matching funds for the thrift \nsavings plan to certain critical skills.\n  It corrects the problems of the current retirement system by giving \nservice members a choice to stay on the current retirement plan and \nreceive $30,000 to put in a savings plan for their future or opt to \nreturn to the pre 1986 retirement system. This $30,000 has been the \nsubject of some discussion and perhaps some misunderstanding. I will \naddress this issue later.\n  It works toward getting our military family off of food stamps by \ngiving special pay to food-stamp eligible members. I find nothing more \ndisheartening or embarrassing than to know that our military \ncompensation is so marginal that we have families on food stamps.\n  It makes significant improvements to the Montgomery GI bill. The GI \nbill has long been a backbone in attracting and retaining military \nmembers.\n  S.4 takes significant progress toward relieving the stress on our \nmilitary families but there are key contributors to that stress that a \nbill such as this cannot address.\n  This bill can not address the willingness of this administration to \ndeploy our troops on mission that are not in our vital national \ninterest.\n  This bill can not address the willingness of this administration to \nassign them to missions where there is no clearly defined strategy or \ndesired end state.\n  This bill can not address the willingness of this administration to \nunder fund the military for the many operations they are assigned.\n  This bill can not address the willingness of this administration to \nunder fund critical modernization and procurement accounts.\n  The net result of the administration unwillingness to address the \nimpact on the military by the high rate of long deployments, \nquestionable mission quality, and under funding of critical accounts is \na double whammy on the men and women of the military.\n  They are not only deploying longer and more frequently and therefore \nspending much more time away from their families, but when they return \nto their home base, they also are faced with long hours in repairing \nold equipment or making preparation for the next deployment. I am told \nthat this the real pain for many in our military families--they can't \neven relax with their family after a long deployment.\n  Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues are concerned that there \nhas been little study to show the elements of this bill are necessary \nor will give a return that is proportionate to the cost of this bill. \nWithout doubt this is a very expensive bill but the cost to national \nsecurity by not correcting the problems of retention and recruitment \nare not even calculable.\n  But before I discuss the lack of hard data, let me return to the \n$30,000 bonus for staying on the REDUX plan.\n  The concern voiced by some is that military members may spend the \n$30,000 on short term needs or even gratification such as a new car. \nThat certainly could happen but I am counting on the solid leadership \nof military commanders to educate and explain the investing opportunity \nthat money represents to the very bright, well educated men and women \nof today's military.\n  There are already several examples of how that $30,000 could grow \nover a career if reasonably invested. The very fact that our members \nare apparently concerned about their future retirement gives me comfort \nthat if they choose to stay on REDUX and except the bonus, most will \nnot squander this opportunity to invest for their retirement.\n\n  Some members of Congress are not convinced that REDUX is a problem at \nall and does not contribute measurably to the retention problem the \nmilitary faces.\n  They are asking: Where is the study that shows REDUX is why many \nmembers are leaving the military? Mr. President, there is no study. \nThere is only the alarm of the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, all of the Service Chiefs, and the senior \nenlisted members of all of the services.\n  Additionally, I do not find it surprising that there is no data \nbecause the people that are affected by REDUX are just now reaching the \npoint in their career that they are thinking about the decision to stay \nin the military for a career or leave. I ask the members of Congress to \nremember that the decision to except or reject REDUX as a retirement \nplan or leave the military rests solely with each military individual \nand not because an analysts' projection of how many will accept or \nreject REDUX. Our senior leaders of our military are saying REDUX is a \nsignificant part of their decision to leave.\n  Shall we ignore them and wait until enough service members have left \nto satisfy the statistician? Do not forget we are also having a \nexceptionally difficult time recruiting new members. Nor can we forget \nthat while we run this data gathering experiment, critical, un-\nreplaceable skills are walking way from military service every day in \nalarming numbers.\n\n  Unfortunately, we are too accustomed to working with weapons systems \nthat we can halt production until\n\n[[Page S1754]]\n\nthe wing-drop problem is fixed, or until the required testing is \ncompleted to our satisfaction. Unquestionably the men and women are the \nkey element to all of our weapon systems but they cannot be put on hold \nuntil the retention problem is clearly defined nor can we slow \nretirement or withhold pay until the theorist have the problems neatly \npackaged.\n  We do not have that luxury to delay or wait for all the data to be \ngenerated with the people that are willing to defend this Nation. We \nhave created an ``all volunteer service'' and they volunteer to join \nand they will go home if they perceive they are not being treated \nfairly or the Nation does not care that they and their families make \ngreat sacrifices to serve in the defense of our country. We can only \nlisten to them and their leaders and make our best judgment about the \nright course of action to recruit and retain the people we need for \ntoday's military. S. 4 makes significant progress toward addressing the \nproblems they tell us are contributing to the crisis in retention and \nrecruiting facing the United States military.\n  I strongly support the bill and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, before I start, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a member of my staff, Steve Thompson, be granted the privilege of \nthe floor during debate and consideration of S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here joining my \ncolleague from Kansas and other Members, expressing support for S. 4, \nthe Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of \n1999.\n  This bill comes at a time when our services are facing increased \ndifficulties in hiring and keeping quality personnel because of low \npay, inadequate benefits, and increasingly frequent deployments. There \nis nobody who would say that what I just stated is untrue. Those are \nall true. They are all impacting our military personnel today. I join \nmy colleague from Kansas, who serves on the Armed Services Committee, \nin strongly supporting this bill and saying that the first and foremost \nrequirement of the Federal Government is to provide for the common \ndefense and we are not providing adequately for the common defense. We \nhave to do that. And, if we let down on that obligation because it does \nnot show up high in the poll numbers or some other reason, we are \nfailing our duty to this country to provide the first and foremost \nthing that we are required to do.\n  Let me remind my fellow Senators that defense spending has declined \nin real terms every year for the last 11 years and now comprises a \nlower percentage of our budget than ever before. We have seen a 19-\npercent decline in defense spending since 1992. Is the world that much \nof a safer place today? We have troops scattered everywhere around the \nworld and we have had a 19-percent decline in defense spending since \n1992. We have peacekeeping operations, we have had global contingencies \nin Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, the Persian Gulf, and now we are facing \ndeployment decisions in Kosovo. This is an extremely high operation \ntempo that is being maintained over this period of time, with an \nenormous strain on troops and on their families.\n  Even under adverse conditions, our troops have continued to perform \ntheir task superbly. The lower defense spending combined with an \nincreased deployment schedule and inadequate benefits, though, have \nresulted in an all-time low enlistment and inability to retain quality \npersonnel: Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. America's service \nmen and women and their families deserve a better quality of life. They \nput their lives on the line to protect our freedoms and the least we \ncan do--the least we can do, I would think, is provide adequate pay, \ndecent living conditions, and some educational opportunities.\n  This bill includes several provisions that will benefit our military \npersonnel and increase retention and enlistment. It will include a 4.8-\npercent military pay raise. This, plus future pay raises at the \nemployment cost index plus 0.5 percent, helps close the gap between \nmilitary and civilian pay.\n  In addition, we have included military pay table reform that will \nincrease pay for those personnel in midcareer points by up to about \n10.3 percent. These are experienced personnel that we cannot afford to \nlose.\n  We also revised the military retirement system by allowing service \npersonnel the option, after 15 years of service, to revert to the pre-\n1986 military retirement system or take a one-time $30,000 bonus if \nthey remain under the current system. We allow Thrift Savings Plans, \nsimilar to what other Federal employees get. Our military members \ndeserve to have the same opportunities that other Government employees \nhave.\n  We also enhanced the Montgomery GI bill. This educational benefit has \nalready sent hundreds of thousands of veterans to college and, I might \nadd, has been a key fuel in pushing forward our economy. These \neducational benefits come back to the Federal Government in economic \ngrowth and opportunity and tax revenues. This is a good investment for \neverybody, and they will be transferable to immediate family members. \nBut most important, this bill provides for a special subsistence \nallowance for enlisted personnel eligible for food stamps.\n  If you can imagine that, you are in the U.S. military, you are \nputting your life on the line and you are living on food stamps--living \non food stamps. For those service members who demonstrate eligibility \nfor food stamps, this bill provides them with a monthly allowance of \n$180 per month. This will keep our military personnel off food stamps \nand provide them with the support they need.\n  Mr. President, this to me is just unconscionable, that you really \nwould put your life, your family at stake, and what are we paying you? \nWe are not paying you enough if you can get food stamps, that you would \nqualify for food stamps. That is ridiculous, and we need to change it. \nThis bill, S. 4, does change it.\n  I close by cautioning my fellow Members of the Senate that this may \nnot be enough to stem the exodus of our service members. The Department \nof Defense and Congress must pursue additional remedies that will \nrectify the retention problem. This legislation takes a good first \nstep, and I certainly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today, along with my \ncolleagues, in support of S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and \nMarines' Bill of Rights Act. Our military has the finest hardware and \nequipment in the world, but, as any general or admiral will tell you, \nthe real source of America's strength is America's fighting men and \nwomen. We spend billions of dollars to train and equip our troops. I \nbelieve the investment has paid off, but we have neglected one very \nimportant aspect of this equation. As we now have an all-volunteer \nforce, our training and weapons will be wasted if we cannot keep \nquality personnel in our Armed Forces.\n  Everyone has seen, I think, the recent press accounts about the \npersonnel shortfalls, particularly in the Navy and Air Force. The \ndiscussion in the Washington Post about the status of the U.S.S. Harry \nTruman, our newest aircraft carrier, provided dramatic evidence of how \ndeep this crisis has grown in our inability to man this vessel.\n  Fortunately, the Senate is able to act now to begin to reverse this \ntrend. S. 4 provides us with a very significant across-the-board \nminimum pay increase of 4.8 percent. In addition, there will be other \nincreases staggered on top of this targeted to specific areas of the \nmilitary.\n  As Secretary Cohen has stated, I do not believe we can pay our troops \ntoo much, but I do believe we can pay them too little. That is the \nstate we find ourselves in today. In a booming economy, Mr. President, \nwith low unemployment, our well-trained soldiers and sailors can walk \noff a base and often double their salary for less work. It has made \nretention very difficult, and we are taking a great stride in \nalleviating the situation with S. 4.\n\n  The value of this bill is not just in the actual pay increase, it is \nalso an\n\n[[Page S1755]]\n\nimportant gesture that tells our fighting men and women that their \nGovernment cares about their well-being and appreciates the very \ndifficult task that we ask them to perform and we are hearing them \nloudly and clearly.\n  We will keep in mind that pay increases alone, however, cannot solve \nthis problem, as many of my colleagues have said earlier this morning. \nThe military will never be competitive with the private sector on a \ndollar-for-dollar basis.\n  My friend, Senator Cleland from Georgia, made a similar remark in \ncommittee the other day that stuck with me. I think he was quoting \nsomeone else, but he said the armed services may recruit a soldier, but \nwe retain a family. And that is so true.\n  When we talk about keeping our troops in the service, we have to \nremember that the quality-of-life issues for the family is really the \ncore issue--soldiers wanting to be good spouses, soldiers wanting to be \ngood parents, soldiers wanting to have a good quality of life for their \nfamily.\n  So while pay is certainly part of the equation, it also extends to \nhousing, medical care, education benefits for spouses and children, day \ncare, operations tempo, and a myriad of other issues that make up a \nfamily's quality of life. There is still much to do. This bill is only \na beginning, but it is a good step.\n  One of the important steps taken in this bill--and it is quite \ninnovative and I thank, again, the Senator from Georgia for bringing \nthis up in committee--is that we will allow military personnel to \ntransfer their Montgomery GI bill benefits to their spouses or \ndependents. For midcareer, officer or enlisted person, the knowledge \nthat their children will have access to a quality education by enabling \nthem to use their benefits is a smart incentive and one that is cost \neffective for us. It is an example of how we can tailor our benefits in \na way that meets the needs of precisely the kind of people we want to \nretain.\n  I also believe it is very important for us to remember the \ncontribution of our Guard and Reserve forces in these discussions. For \nthis reason, I have a series of amendments that address some of the \ninequity between the benefits programs for our regulars and the Guard \nand the Reserve units.\n  With a leaner military, Mr. President, we cannot perform the complex \nmissions of our military without a strong Guard and strong Reserve \ncomponent. We must always keep our eyes on this reality when addressing \nretention issues.\n  I am proud of the statement that the Senate is making with this \nlegislation. I commend our chairman and our ranking member for bringing \nthis bill to the floor this early in this Congress. I hope that this \nwill not be the end of our work, but rather a strong beginning, a \nbipartisan beginning. I look forward to working with my colleagues on \nthe committee to make the real difference in the quality of life for \nAmerica's military personnel.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1746-4", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to alert our colleagues to a fact \nwhich was not clear the last time we spoke on the subject of this \namendment which we just adopted. There was not certainty as to whether \nthat amendment would have been subject to a point of order had a point \nof order been made. We protected that possibility in our unanimous \nconsent agreement in the event the Parliamentarian ruled that it would \nhave been subject to a point of order.\n  In fact, we now understand that it would have been subject to a point \nof order, and therefore we have now another provision in the bill that \nis in violation of the Budget Act because it is not paid for. That is \nsomething which we should really be very conscious of as we go along \nhere and very concerned about.\n  But we did protect our colleagues in the event that that was the \nruling, and none of our colleagues decided to raise the point of order. \nBut in fact it could have been raised. And we should take very serious \nnote of any of the violations of the Budget Act as we proceed, because \nat some point we are going to have to pay for the amendments we add as \nwell as the bill itself.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n\n[[Page S1756]]\n\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 11\n\n(Purpose: To make a limitation on tuition assistance for members of the \n     Armed Forces inapplicable to members deployed in support of a \n              contingency operation or similar operation)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to S. 4. The \namendment has already been sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Enzi) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 11.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. INCREASED TUITION ASSISTANCE FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES DEPLOYED IN SUPPORT OF A \n                   CONTINGENCY OPERATION OR SIMILAR OPERATION.\n\n       (a) Inapplicability of Limitation on Amount.--Section \n     2007(a) of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (2);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (3) and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) in the case of a member deployed outside the United \n     States in support of a contingency operation or similar \n     operation, all of the charges may be paid while the member is \n     so deployed.''.\n       (b) Increased Authority Subject to Appropriations.--The \n     authority to pay additional tuition assistance under \n     paragraph (4) of section 2007(a) of title 10, United States \n     Code, as added by subsection (a), may be exercised only to \n     the extent provided for in appropriations Acts.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999.\n  The need for this bill is obvious. The Army, Navy, and Air Force are \nall experiencing recruitment and retention problems that threaten to \nfurther degrade our already overstressed military. By every measure, \nquality of life issues are the center of the problem. Fortunately, our \nmilitary personnel don't join to get rich. In this all too material \nage, it is refreshing to note that their motivations to remain in \nuniform do not include financial gain.\n  Nonetheless, it is a fact that our current military is not the \nmilitary of our fathers. It currently includes the highest percentage \nof families in its history. The pay, the retirement, and the medical \nbenefits are issues that must be addressed. This bill seeks to do that.\n  Educational opportunities are also important to our service people, \nespecially those who perhaps are not career oriented. We cannot lose \nsight of the fact that what we do here today will benefit not just our \nmilitary personnel by increasing knowledge, eliminating boredom, and \nstimulating the mind, but are all things that improve the capability of \nour young men and women in our armed services.\n  Our society at large will benefit especially with regard to \neducational opportunities. Today's corporal studying in his off-duty \nhours for his bachelor's degree might well be tomorrow's small business \nemployer. Nevertheless, his extra effort will improve his job \nperformance immediately. The Department of Defense has long offered \nexcellent opportunities for active duty personnel to better themselves \nthrough education. The administrators of these programs are \nenthusiastic and devoted to the uniformed people they serve. There is \none thing we can do, however, to fine tune the regulations they must \nfollow, and my amendment is designed to do just that.\n  Currently, secretaries of each branch of the service are authorized \nto pay up to 75 percent of college tuition and related instructional \ncosts for most personnel pursuing additional education in their off \nduty hours. However, for Navy personnel deployed aboard ship, the \nSecretary of the Navy is authorized to pay the full 100 percent of such \ncosts by virtue of their PACE program. PACE is an acronym for ``Program \nfor Afloat College Education.'' Therefore, a soldier on deployment in \nBosnia may only be receiving reimbursement for 75 percent of his \ntuition costs, while just offshore, a sailor deployed aboard ship is \nreceiving 100 percent.\n  My amendment would authorize all service secretaries to pay up to 100 \npercent of tuition costs for personnel deployed on a contingency basis. \nIt does not require that a specific percentage be paid. It simply gives \na service secretary that option. And because the exercising of that \noption is contingent on the availability of funding, no additional \nappropriation is required.\n  This amendment will equalize the playing field between the services \nas well as make the difficult deployments to such places as Bosnia and \nSaudi Arabia a bit more beneficial to those service people who wish to \ntake advantage of the opportunity. It is supported by the Defense \nDepartment and is indisputable in the interests of our young men and \nwomen in uniform. I ask my colleagues for their support of this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, my colleague from the State of Wyoming has \ndone a great job on the amendment. It is discretionary and begins to \nput on par the Army and Air Force with the Navy program. We think it is \nthe right solution and the right direction for this. So we are not \ngoing to object to the Enzi amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do other Senators wish to be heard?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Wyoming for his \namendment. It is a very good amendment. It equalizes the Army and the \nAir Force with what already exists for the Navy and the Marines. The \nreason we should equalize it is because when our Army and Air Force \npersonnel are deployed, they are effectively in the same situation and \nneed this tuition assistance to the same extent that the Navy and the \nMarines already have it authorized. As Senator Allard said, it is \ndiscretionary with our service secretaries. That means that it \nhopefully will be accomplished and hopefully can be done within their \nbudgets but does not raise a Budget Act problem.\n  I commend our friend from Wyoming, and we support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nof the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The amendment (No. 11) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Virginia yield for a \nunanimous consent request?\n  Mr. ROBB. The Senator from Virginia is delighted to yield to the \nranking member for a unanimous consent request.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Matthew \nVarzally and John Bradshaw of Senator Wellstone's staff have floor \nprivileges during consideration of S. 4.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n(Purpose: To increase the amount of certain bonuses and special pay and \n  to authorize payment of certain additional special pay and bonuses)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 8 previously filed \nat the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia (Mr. Robb), for himself, Mr. \n     Cleland, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Bingaman proposes an amendment \n     numbered 8.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to offer the special incentive pay \namendment to S. 4.\n  I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by our \ncolleague from\n\n[[Page S1757]]\n\nMassachusetts, Senator Kennedy, Senator Cleland from Georgia, Senator \nKerrey from Nebraska, and Senator Bingaman from New Mexico.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, a number of our colleagues, among them \nSenator Allard, described the acute challenges that are faced by the \nNavy as it struggles to retain sufficient numbers of critical personnel \nlike Navy SEALS, surface warfare officers, nuclear-qualified officers, \nand career enlisted fliers.\n  While S. 4, with its significant pay raises, improved retirement and \nenhanced GI bill benefits is an important step in the right direction, \nwe still have big problems in these smaller categories of military \nservice where we have been only marginally successful in our retention \nefforts.\n  This amendment begins to address the downward retention trends the \nNavy is experiencing in these areas by aligning pay increases with \nproblem specialties.\n  S. 4's compensation approach begins to address the services' broad \nrecruiting and retention concerns, but it won't assure that the \nundermanned, highly skilled warfare specialists that Senator Allard \ndescribed so eloquently yesterday will get well any time soon.\n  Special incentive pay and bonuses have been the shaping tools of \nchoice to fill the breach. The experience of the military services is \nthat historically targeted kinds of bonuses have proven highly \neffective and very cost efficient in attacking retention problem areas \nwithin specific communities.\n  This year, the Navy and Air Force would like to make even greater use \nof this proven strategy. They have fully funded in their budgets, and \nhave asked us to support, establishing two new bonuses and expanding \nauthority for four others.\n  This amendment to S. 4 provides these targeted fixes. Specifically, \nit addresses enlisted recruiting and retention shortfalls by increasing \nthe maximum authorization of the enlistment bonus, or EB as it is \nreferred to, and selective reenlistment bonus, or SRB. And it addresses \nthe critical shortfalls in the unrestricted line communities by \nproviding two new continuation bonuses, one for surface warfare \nofficers, and another for special warfare officers.\n  Finally, several existing bonuses are increased, including those for \ndivers, nuclear-qualified officers, linguists, and other critical \nspecialties. These pay increases will target specific job skills at \nexperience levels to cost-effectively attract, retain, and distribute \nhighly trained personnel at critical points in their career.\n  The Nation simply cannot afford to continue to pay as much as we do \nto recruit and train these talented individuals only to see them leave \nthe service out of frustration over the inadequacies of their pay and \nbenefits and the promise of better compensation in the private sector.\n  Mr. President, as I stated yesterday, the special incentive pay \namendment to S. 4 is exactly the kind of targeted fix Congress can and \nshould support. I hope our colleagues will join us in sending a signal \nto our men and women in uniform that we have listened to them and that \nwe understand their needs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask for its adoption.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment. We are all \nconcerned about reports of declining retention in our Armed Forces. Our \nmidgrade officers and enlisted personnel are leaving the service at \nalarming rates. This amendment directly addresses this critical problem \nby focusing special and incentive pays on areas where the Armed Forces \nface the greatest retention challenges.\n  The readiness of our Armed Forces must be a top priority. Our service \nmen and women are an indispensable part of our Nation's defense. We \nmust act to improve retention in order to ensure the readiness of our \nArmed Forces. In today's tight budget environment, it is imperative \nthat we efficiently use our taxpayers' dollars. Special and incentive \npays are an effective way to increase retention while being mindful of \ncosts.\n  Our amendment responds to the needs of the Armed Services by \nauthorizing programs that the services specifically want and that are \nready to be implemented. These programs have been thoroughly researched \nby the services and will have an immediate impact on retention.\n  At the Senate Armed Services Readiness Hearing in January, Admiral \nJay Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, agreed with my assessment \nthat current Navy retention rates will result in the Navy having 50 \npercent fewer Surface Warfare Officers than needed. Officers in these \npositions have never been authorized to receive special pay incentives, \nand retention of these men and women is now among the lowest of any \nofficer community in the Armed Forces. This amendment gives the Navy a \nflexible means to address this critical retention issue, and will give \nthe same flexibility to the other services in the specific areas where \nthe most attention is needed.\n  In these critical times for recruiting and retention of military \npersonnel, we must enact sensible legislation that provides the \nservices with effective flexibility in the management of their \npersonnel challenges. No one knows the full effects of retention \nproblems more than the services themselves. We need to give the \nservices the tools they need so they can help ensure the readiness of \nour Armed Forces. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this \namendment and I commend Senator Robb  and Senator Cleland for their \nleadership on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further discussion? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 8.\n  The amendment (No. 8) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to add my enthusiastic support for \nS. 4.\n  The most important responsibility a nation has is to its people's \nsecurity, ensuring a nation's freedom. As all of us in life, nations \nand governments are no different. We must prioritize. We must \nprioritize our resources. We must prioritize our agendas. We must \nprioritize the focus that we give to our people.\n  As important as is Social Security, and Medicare, and tax cuts, and \neducation and all that compose a society that helps develop a culture, \nnational security is the highest priority, the highest priority of a \ngovernment, and its most important responsibility.\n  There will be much debate, as there should be much debate, over the \nnext year and a half about the priorities of this Nation as we move \ninto the next century. None will be more important than the debate that \nis occurring in this Chamber today, because what we are saying, the \nmessage we are sending to our people, to our friends and our foes alike \naround the world, is that, first, we will address the important issues \nconfronting our national security interests; second, we will put into \nplay and into our national security interests the resources necessary \nto maintain a national security system second to none. We will, in \nfact, prioritize our national security so that it will, as history has \nshown, guarantee our foreign policy, our export expansion, our trade \nreform. All of these are part of an overarching policy that connects, \nand we cannot have one without the other. We know--we have heard today, \nwe have heard over the last 2 days--the problems that now confront our \nmilitary--readiness, retention, recruitment.\n  Any measure we take of our national security today comes up short, \ncomes up wanting, and it is the responsibility of this Congress to \nlead; it is the responsibility of the President to lead, and it is the \nresponsibility of America to prioritize the national security interests \nof our country.\n  We need, more than ever before, the best, the brightest, young men \nand women to make a military career a career not only they can be proud \nof, our Nation can be proud of, but a career that serves our interests.\n  When we look at what has happened to this military in the last 10 \nyears--longer deployments, more deployments, losing our senior enlisted \nhalfway through their 20 years, pilots dropping out, the investment our \nsociety puts in these men and women--we find we are perilously close to \nthe edge as\n\n[[Page S1758]]\n\nto how far we can continue to defend not only our freedom but our \ninterests in the world. And make no mistake about this, Mr. President. \nWe just don't have select interests in the world; all the world is in \nour interests. Does that mean we are the international policemen? No. \nWhat it does mean is, because we do live in a globally connected world, \na very competitive world, that in every corner of the world our \ninterest is peace, stability, freedom; the development of democratic \ngovernments and market economies are in the interests of all of our \npeople.\n\n  So, this is not esoteric. This is relevant. And as we close the \ndebate on this issue, we are talking about more than just putting the \nnecessary resources into our national security commitments and \ncapabilities, but we are sending a message to our people, to our \nculture, to our society, that in fact we very much value the men and \nwomen who make defending our freedoms their life. What we are saying, \nas well, to the families of these men and women is: We value you. We \nknow the hardships that you deal with. We know about those long \ndeployments. Not since Vietnam--and I see my colleague, Senator Robb, \nstanding across the way--not since Senator Robb and I served in Vietnam \nhas there been any addressing of the pay scale of our military. That is \nembarrassing. That is not worthy of a great nation and a great people.\n  So, again, I say this is not only in the best interests of our \ncountry, but it is making a very specific and definite statement to our \npeople, to our culture, to our society that duty, honor, and country \ncount. Duty, honor, and country count. We want people to be proud to \nserve our country in uniform. We want to acknowledge them, not just by \nincreasing their pay and their benefits--because that is, in part, a \nmeasurement of their worth and a way to keep score--but by saying: We \nknow your worth. We know how important you are and we value that. We \nneed you.\n  For those reasons and many more that we have heard today and we will \nhear tomorrow, I strongly support S. 4.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I want to recognize in a public way the \nfine statement of my colleague from Nebraska and his hard work on this \nand many other pieces of legislation coming before the Senate. It is \nalways good to hear from somebody who has personally served in Vietnam \nand been under fire, so to speak. I want everybody to know it is people \nlike my colleague from Nebraska and their dedication to this country \nand to freedom which is the reason we think this bill is so important. \nThis is the first major increase in military pay since 1982.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me also commend Senator Hagel for his \nspeech. He inevitably is on the floor when we have a defense \nauthorization bill or an item related closely to it, as this bill is. \nHe is here, fervently urging support of our men and women in our \nuniformed military. I just want to say that voice is a particularly \npowerful voice, given Senator Hagel's background. I again compliment \nhim and thank him for the ongoing commitment. He has not forgotten \nwhere he came from, as we sometimes say, and it is very important that \nwe hear such strong voices as Senator Hagel's.\n  Mr. HAGEL. I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 8\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I am on my feet, if I could also \nthank Senator Robb for the previous amendment. I was not here. I had to \nleave for a moment. But it is a very important amendment which we just \nadopted. We did it in a few moments, but this increased special and \nincentive pay provision that Senator Robb has now inserted in this bill \nis targeted at critical specialties where services are having a \nsignificant retention problem. It is very important that we do that.\n  This provision was in the budget which was submitted to us, but it \nwas not included in this pay bill. It should have been. I think it was \na significant oversight that it was not. That oversight has been \ncorrected by Senator Robb, who is here, as always, watching very, very \nclosely and carefully to make sure that we do the right thing by our \ntroops and by our defense and by our security needs. I thank him for \ndetermining that this was left out of a bill which is aimed at \nsupporting our troops, and should not have been. Because of his energy \nand his perception, it is now back in the bill. I thank him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, if I may, I thank the ranking member for his \nkind words and his leadership on the Armed Services Committee. I join \nin paying tribute to my fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator Hagel from \nNebraska. It was for all of us who shared that experience a distinct \npleasure to have a fellow warrior, comrade in arms, with us who not \nonly understood the causes for which we fought and the trials and \ntribulations of those who wear the uniform of our country, but was \nwilling to continue to stand up and be counted in those particular \ninstances where it really matters to those we ask ultimately to place \nthemselves in harm's way for our country's benefit.\n  So I join in the tribute that the Senator from Colorado made and \ncommend him, as well, for the eloquent speech he made yesterday in \nunderscoring the need to address the critical concerns about retention, \nparticularly in some of the critical MOSs.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 15\n\n    (Purpose: To amend title 37, United States Code, to improve the \n                 aviation career officers special pay)\n\n  Mr. ROBB. With that, Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, and Mr. Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 15.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. AVIATION CAREER OFFICER SPECIAL PAY.\n\n       (a) Period of Authority.--Subsection (a) of section 301b of \n     title 37, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(1)'' after ``Authorized.--'';\n       (2) by striking ``during the period beginning on January 1, \n     1989, and ending on December 31, 1999,'' and inserting \n     ``during the period described in paragraph (2),''; and\n       (2) adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Paragraph (1) applies with respect to agreements \n     executed during the period beginning on the first day of the \n     first month that begins on or after the date of the enactment \n     of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \n     Rights Act of 1999 and ending on December 31, 2004.''.\n       (b) Repeal of Limitation to Certain Years of Career \n     Aviation Service.--Subsection (b) of such section is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (5);\n       (2) by inserting ``and'' at the end of paragraph (4); and\n       (4) by redesignating paragraph (6) as paragraph (5).\n       (c) Repeal of Lower Alternative Amount for Agreement To \n     Serve for 3 or Fewer Years.--Subsection (c) of such section \n     is amended by striking ``than--'' and all that follows and \n     inserting ``than $25,000 for each year covered by the written \n     agreement to remain on active duty.''.\n       (d) Proration Authority for Coverage of Increased Period of \n     Eligibility.--Subsection (d) of such section is amended by \n     striking ``14 years of commissioned service'' and inserting \n     ``25 years of aviation service''.\n       (e) Terminology.--Such section is further amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f), by striking ``A retention bonus'' \n     and inserting ``Any amount''; and\n       (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking ``retention bonuses'' \n     in the first sentence and inserting ``special pay under this \n     section''.\n       (f) Repeal of Content Requirements for Annual Report.--\n     Subsection (i)(1) of such section is further amended by \n     striking the second sentence.\n       (g) Technical Amendment.--Subsection (g)(3) of such section \n     if amended by striking the second sentence.\n       (h) Effective Date.--This section and the amendments made \n     by this section shall take effect on the first day of the \n     first month that begins on or after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment is the aviation career \nofficer special pay amendment to S. 4. I am very pleased to be joined \nin offering\n\n[[Page S1759]]\n\nthis amendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. He has been a major force in taking care of our military \naviators for many years, and I am very pleased to have Senator McCain \nas a cosponsor as well as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee \nare all very much aware of the serious retention problems now faced by \nDOD, and especially those pertaining to pilots. The Air Force, for \nexample, is losing three pilots for every two pilots it trains. You \ndon't need to have a math degree to understand the implications of that \nstatistic. To quote Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mike Ryan, this is \n``one of the most serious pilot force challenges in Air Force \nhistory.'' And the Navy's situation is no less daunting.\n  Current law allows aviation officers from O-1s to O-5s with 6 to 13 \nyears of service to receive a bonus of up to $25,000 a year if the \nofficer agrees to complete 14 years; or up to $12,000 per year if the \nofficer agrees to complete 1, 2, or 3 additional years.\n  While existing law was intended to fix retention problems in specific \naviation communities such as the F/A-18 community, retention problems \nare now showing up across the board. This amendment is straightforward. \nIts intent is to give DOD maximum flexibility to stop the widespread \nhemorrhaging of pilots. The provision broadens eligibility from \nanywhere from 1 to 25 years of service and allows for up to $25,000 for \neach year of extended duty.\n  DOD's retention and recruiting problems can grow rapidly. Indeed, \nmany problems that DOD did not even report just a year ago were \nreported with alarm just 6 months ago. We need to give the Department \nthe flexibility and the headroom to manage a serious and unpredictable \nproblem that cannot be adjusted only once a year by the Congress.\n  To address concerns that we are ceding too much authority to DOD, \nthis authority must be renewed after 5 years, and the Secretary of \nDefense will be required to report annually to the defense committees \non the impact of this increased authority on the retention of aviators.\n  This provision is supported by the Department of Defense and is \nincluded in the budget request. The flexibility afforded by this \nprovision reflects a consensus of service views developed and will \nallow each service the ability to tailor compensation programs to meet \ntheir specific retention challenges and to accommodate their unique \ncareer path requirements.\n  During a period of excessive and costly resignations, we simply \ncannot afford not to give DOD the tools it needs to fix the retention \nproblem. I urge my colleagues to support this provision and help us to \naddress one of our most serious readiness dilemmas.\n  I yield the floor. I ask for whatever action the managers may wish to \ntake on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? The Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague for his hard \nwork on the Armed Services Committee. I do agree with him; the idea of \ngiving discretionary authority to the Secretaries to meet certain \nretention challenges that come up with qualified pilots is extremely \nimportant.\n  The question I would like to ask my friend from Virginia with regard \nto his amendment is that I understand that the funds to cover the cost \nof this amendment are in the fiscal year 2000 defense budget; is that \naccurate?\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I respond to the distinguished Senator from \nColorado by saying that the information provided to this Senator is \nthat it is, in fact, included. There was some concern about one of the \nservices having an objection to this provision at one point. I \nunderstand that was cleared up, and it is now in the budget. If there \nis any information to the contrary, because we haven't actually had the \npresentation of those details, I will inform the committee before any \nadditional action is taken on this amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, in that case, if this has all been cleared \nwithin the budget, then we have no objection to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, let me, again, commend \nour friend from Virginia for his leadership in this area. This is one \nof our greatest areas of shortfall. It is one of our greatest retention \nproblems. We have to try to do better to retain our pilots, and this \namendment will go a long way, indeed, the administration proposal--\nhopefully it is in their proposal--will go, we believe at least, some \nway in terms of retaining pilots as its goal. It is a very important \ngoal.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from Virginia for his leadership in \nzeroing in on some of the greatest problems that we face in our defense \nbudget, and that is the retention problem of pilots. So we very \nstrongly support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment offered by the Senator from Virginia, \nMr. Robb.\n  The amendment (No. 15) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the overall goal of this bill is to address \nthe critical recruitment and retention problems facing our military \ntoday. I strongly support that objective. We have heard that \nrecruitment numbers are down; that the Navy is 20,000 sailors short of \nwhat it needs to meet our national interests at sea; that within the \nlast three months the Army was 2,300 soldiers short of its recruitment \ngoal; and that increasingly pilots are leaving the service to take more \nlucrative jobs with private airlines. These are serious problems \nrequiring serious attention.\n  At a time when we are asking our Armed Forces to undertake more \ndifferent kinds of missions, we need to provide incentives to men and \nwomen to serve and to be able to keep those who are currently serving. \nA 1998 Youth Attitude Tracking Study of 10,000 young men and women \nfound that the desire to serve in our military remains strong. In fact, \nmore than 25% of the men surveyed said they wanted to join one of the \nactive duty services. The percentage of women who expressed interest \nactually increased by a percentage point from last year, reaching 13% \nfor 1998. Therefore, if the initial desire is there, we should not \nallow it to be clouded by fears of low pay, frequent deployments and \ninsufficient retirement benefits once they sign up. We must do \neverything we can to ensure that high quality men and women will \ncontinue to join the United States Armed Services maintaining a force \nthat is second to none in the world. The U.S. military maintains its \nstature because of the people who serve in it.\n  We cannot afford to lose them or lower the standards of recruitment \njust to fill in the holes.\n  Unfortunately, the reality is that we are losing them and we are \nbeing forced to look at ways of lowering the bar so that each service \ncan meet its recruitment goal for the coming years. A strong economy \nable to boast of high paying jobs in the private sector is causing \nextreme recruitment and retention problems for the Department of \nDefense. S. 4 attempts to reverse these problems by offering high pay \nraises, reforming the pay table, establishing a retirement savings plan \nand expanding Montgomery GI bill benefits for those who serve and will \nserve in the military. Specifically, it provides for a 4.8% pay raise \nfor every member of the Armed Services. It changes the pay scale to \nrecognize and reward meritorious service rather than the number of \nyears served. It establishes a thrift savings plan similar to the one \navailable to Federal civil employees and available to many in the \nprivate sector by way of 401-K plans. It also provides a monthly \nsubsistence allowance for those service personnel eligible to receive \nfood stamps and expands current Montgomery GI Bill benefits both in the \namount of money provided and in the number of people who can use it, \namong many other things.\n\n[[Page S1760]]\n\n  When I read through this bill, I find many things that I believe can \nimprove the current system and I support the general thrust of this \nlegislation. I believe that significant pay increases are necessary \nboth to help those currently serving in the military and those who \nmight serve in the future. The Administration did not ignore the call \nfor pay increases coming from many personnel, as well as the Joint \nChiefs. They are in the President's budget request. It is clear that \nmilitary pay must be competitive with wages paid in the private sector.\n  It truly saddens me that about 12,000 of the brave men and women who \nhave chosen to serve their country by defending the flag, to which we \nall pledge allegiance, are on food stamps. These people should not be \nforced to make a decision between serving their country and bringing \nhome enough money to make ends meet. At a time when our economy is \ngrowing and higher paying jobs require the kind of skills that are \ntaught in the military, it must be very difficult not to look at the \ngreener pastures.\n  There is another part of this bill that I want to address because it \nis one of the reasons why I am going to vote in favor of it. I \nsincerely believe that the Montgomery GI Bill should be revamped and am \npleased that this legislation takes a step in that direction. When this \nbody passed the GI Bill in 1984, the average annual cost of tuition at \na four-year university was about $5,200. That number has since doubled \nwith costs reaching above $11,000 for the school year 1996 to 1997. \nHowever, we are still offering basically the same amount of financial \nassistance per month and requiring that those eligible to use it first \npay $1200 before they can receive anything back. I wholeheartedly agree \nthat we should do away with that requirement and increase the amount of \nmonthly assistance provided. It is the right thing to do. I also \nsupport the provision in this bill that allows immediate family members \nalso to benefit from the education allowances. I am pleased that my \nfriend--and fellow veteran--Max Cleland introduced this portion of the \nbill and that it was incorporated into the final version we are \ndebating today.\n  I don't believe there is a single one of us who would argue that we \nshouldn't do more for our Armed Services personnel. That is clear. \nThere is no question that they need increases in their basic pay and an \nexpansion of their education and retirement benefits. But it seems to \nme that we ought to be careful and at least examine--if not critically \nanalyze--how best to go about addressing our recruitment and retention \nproblems without trying to fast-tract a bill which has significant \nincreases in funding, above and beyond what the Administration has \nrequested, without adequately explaining how to pay for it.\n  I believe that we owe it to our military men and women to determine \nhow we are going to pay for this bill and how funds used for this \npurpose will affect overall spending and military readiness. What are \nthe sources for funding this bill? Is this coming out of other accounts \nwithin the Pentagon's budget? Is it coming out of domestic spending? Is \nit going to be off-budget? Can we really afford to pay for this across \nall the pay scales? Are we going to tap into our large budget surplus? \nIt is not clear to me that these critical questions have been answered.\n  This bill requires funding for 10 years, not just this fiscal year. \nWe don't have any ironclad promises that our economy will prove as \nstrong tomorrow as it is today. I think we ought to be sure that the \ncommitments we make now can be met in the future.\n  I remain concerned that we are moving this bill in the absence of \nhearings by the Armed Services Committee and an overall discussion \nabout how our defense dollars should be spent. However, I will support \nthis bill because as a veteran, I understand how important it is to \nknow that your country is behind you and to know that your country \nrecognizes and rewards the service you have given it.\n\n\n                            amendment no. 9\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate voted on an \namendment to S. 4 offered by my colleague Senator Crapo from Idaho. I \nvoted ``present.''\n  The amendment would eliminate a federal law that reduces the military \nretirement pay of those retirees who continue their public service by \nworking for the federal government as civilians. As a Senator who would \npersonally benefit from the amendment's passage, I am subject to a \nclear conflict of interest and thus cannot properly vote.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am retired Air Force Reserve \nofficer. As such, my retirement pay from the Air Force would increase \nsignificantly if the Crapo amendment were signed into law. With that in \nmind, I voted present.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nwholeheartedly endorse this Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' \nBill of Rights. With this bill, the members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee are making a pledge to the men and women who so \nbravely defend our freedoms: we honor them, we respect them, they and \ntheir families are important to us, and we are going to take care of \nthem. We have been asking them to get by for too long, with too little. \nStarting now, we are going to make good on our debt of gratitude.\n  In my view, this bill addresses three key areas that must be fixed if \nwe are going to be able to keep quality people in uniform. The largest \npay raise since 1982, and annual raises that outpace inflation, will \nshrink a double-digit pay gap that has been growing for 20 years. \nService men and women know they will never make as much as their \ncivilian counterparts, and they serve proudly anyway. But we cannot \ntell them their contributions to America are invaluable, and then stand \nby and watch their earning power erode more and more each year without \nany plan for stopping the erosion. They deserve to provide their \nfamilies with an honorable standard of living, and we are committed to \ndoing that.\n  In addition, Mr. President, raises for mid-level officers and \nenlisted personnel are designed to retain critical personnel and reward \nperformance over longevity. Currently, some leaders are paid less than \ntheir subordinates due to an over-emphasis on years served rather then \nresults achieved. We win or lose wars based on results, not seniority, \nand the pay chart ought to reflect that reality. We want to encourage \nand reward those who go ``above and beyond,'' and reinforce a culture \ndedicated to achievement and success.\n  Restoring previously reduced retirement benefits to their original \nlevels shows a commitment to our veterans' long term security and the \nvalue of a career of honorable service. Our troops spend an entire \ncareer living in danger, sacrificing their own interests and putting \ntheir country's needs ahead of their family's. We cannot in good \nconscience reward their service by cutting their retirement benefits.\n  In closing, Mr. President, more than just voicing a commitment to our \nservice men and women, we must take bold, swift action to put that \ncommitment to work. We must provide them a long overdue increase in \npay, we must reform the pay table to reward performance over longevity, \nand we must repeal the Redux retirement plan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate \nmy amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' \nBill of Rights Act of 1999, which would extend key bonuses and special \npayments to the men and women of our armed forces for another three \nyears.\n  Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nand the Service Secretaries have all testified and stated for the \nrecord that recruiting and retention are the most important challenges \nfacing our military today.\n  With a strong economy and the perception of a reduced military threat \nabroad, the incentives to leave the military, or to not enlist in the \nmilitary, are greater than ever before. However, even with the end of \nthe cold war, we have increased our military commitments around the \nworld, in such places as Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia. We are now facing a \npossible use of American forces in Kosovo. Those brave individuals, who \nare preparing to respond to our Nation's call deserve our every \nconsideration and effort on their behalf. That is the whole reason of \nS. 4.\n  The amendment I am now offering seeks to correct an oversight in the \npending bill: namely, an extension of the authority for the services to \nprovide special pay incentives for positions which have been hard to \nfill.\n  The authority for many of these special pays and bonuses will expire \nin December 1999. My amendment would simply extend funding authority \nthrough the end of 2002. It would give the Services the certainty that \nthese essential retention tools will continue to be available.\n  These incentives affect many positions within our military, ranging \nfrom bonuses for aviation officers to special pay for health \nprofessionals. Passage of this amendment will reinforce S. 4's message \nthat we as a nation take seriously our commitment to give our military \nthe ability to continue to recruit and retain the finest servicemen and \nwomen in the world. I urge my colleagues to further that objective by \nadopting this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that this is \nincluded in the budget. So we don't have an objection on this side. We \nview it as an important retention use to help keep our enlisted men and \nwomen in the armed services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend our friend from Georgia for \nthis amendment. He has made a number of major contributions already to \nthis bill, most particularly in the transferability provision of the \neducation benefits under the GI bill. That is a huge gain for our men \nand women in the military and for this Nation.\n  Again, as I pointed out earlier, I thank him for the initiative that \nhe took to have that provision added in committee.\n  The amendment he is offering this afternoon is an important \namendment. It will extend the authority for 3 years to pay bonuses and \nspecial pay which are so critical to both recruiting and retention of \nour military members, and we strongly support this amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, before we vote, I want to recognize that \nSenator Cleland is my ranking member on the Personnel Subcommittee. He \nis working hard. And I am looking forward to continuing to work on \nthese issues that will come up during this year. I think our \nsubcommittee is going to have some of the toughest challenges of any \nsubcommittee on Armed Services. It is good to have somebody such as \nSenator Cleland out\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nthere to help, and have somebody who served in the military and who \nwalked in the shoes of the people whom we are passing legislation to \nhave an impact on.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The amendment (No. 4) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1755-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1762-S1771]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Presiding Officer. I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Michigan and my distinguished friend and colleague from \nColorado for their time.\n  This is sort of a news update on Kosovo, if I could describe it that \nway, because several Senators have indicated a strong desire to offer \namendments to this bill in regard to the United States' role in Kosovo. \nI hope that we won't do that. We need this bill to be expedited to send \na strong message to our American men and women in uniform. This is not \nto say, however, that we do not need a frank discussion of ongoing \ndiscussions about the United States' role in regard to Kosovo.\n  I have, as of 3 o'clock this afternoon--we are about an hour after \nthat--the latest report from the peace talks in Rambouillet, France. \nSecretary of State Albright has just indicated that:\n\n       After 17 days of laborious negotiations, Secretary of State \n     Madeleine Albright said today that ethnic Albanians have \n     agreed to sign a Kosovo peace agreement within two weeks but \n     the Serbs continue to balk at a deal.\n\n  I will go on with this very briefly.\n\n       According to senior U.S. officials, the Serbs still refuse \n     to permit ethnic Albanians to have a president and are \n     unwilling to cooperate with a war crimes tribunal looking \n     into atrocities against civilians.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       At a news conference by the six-nation Contact Group \n     overseeing the talks, French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine \n     announced that a new conference on the Kosovo conflict would \n     be held in France beginning March 15.\n\n  So we have a lull. So the peace talks can continue. A cynic might say \nwe drew a line in the sand. And yet, at another time we have gone \nbeyond that line in the sand and our credibility is at stake.\n  Robin Cook, Foreign Secretary of Great Britain, called for the \nparties to ``use these three weeks, use them to build peace. . . . We \nhave done a lot here, even if we have not done enough.''\n  The agreement came 1\\1/2\\ hours after the deadline for the peace \nconference had passed. However, in regard to the Serbs, the news is not \nthat good, to say the least. Their Deputy Prime Minister has described \nthe talks as a bust, blaming the United States officials, who he said \n``want the blood of the Serbs.''\n  He said, ``I am afraid the Rambouillet conference failed and we must \nsay very clearly who is guilty for that. But peace appeared as \nelusive''--right during these talks, Mr. President. ``New fighting''--\nor continued fighting. Actually, it is old and continued and new \nfighting--``broke out between the Yugoslav army troops and the Serb \npolice and the ethnic Albanian rebels.''\n  So we still have war.\n  The reason I brought all of that up is that there was an article in \nMonday's Washington Post written by Dr. Henry Kissinger. I think Dr. \nKissinger has pretty well summed up some of the concerns, at least, and \nthe frustrations that many Senators have in regard to the lack of \nclarity in regard to the situation in Kosovo. And, of course, it \naffects everything we do in the Balkans, not to mention Bosnia.\n  Dr. Kissinger said this:\n\n       In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing \n     dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will \n     require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we \n     change our objective to self-determination and permit each \n     ethnic group to decide its own fate.\n\n  But in Kosovo, Dr. Kissinger certainly pointed out that option \ndoesn't exist. There are no ethnic dividing lines and both sides \nactually claim the entire territory. Our attitude, the U.S. attitude \ntoward the Serbs attempts to insist that their claim has been made \nplain. It is the threat of bombing. But how do we and NATO react to \nAlbanian transgressions? Are we prepared to fight both sides and for \nhow long?\n  As a matter of fact, Secretary Albright indicated if the Albanians \ndidn't get along, we could not bomb the Serbs. That seems to me to be a \nlittle bit unprecedented and unique. As a matter of fact, I think it is \na little nutty.\n  But at any rate, are we prepared to fight both sides and for how \nlong?\n\n       In the face of issues such as these, the unity of the \n     contact group of powers acting on behalf of NATO is likely to \n     dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly emerge as the \n     supporter of the Serbian point of view.\n\n  And then Dr. Kissinger goes on, and I will not take the time of the \nSenate in regard to his entire statement, but he sums up by saying: \n``Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to weaken our \nability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North Korea.''\n  You draw the line in the sand. That time expires, and it is a problem \nin terms of our credibility.\n\n       The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each time \n     we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is \n     constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is \n     minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a \n     ``peace implementation force.''\n       Such comments have two unfortunate consequences: They \n     increase the impression among Americans that military force \n     can be used casualty-free,--\n\n  And obviously that is a big concern on the part of everyone--\n\n     and they send a signal of weakness to potential enemies. For \n     in the end our forces will be judged on how adequate they are \n     for peace imposition, not peace implementation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full statement of Dr. Kissinger be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 22, 1999]\n\n                   No. U.S. Ground Forces for Kosovo\n\n\n      leadership doesn't mean that we must do everything ourselves\n\n                          (By Henry Kissinger)\n\n       President Clinton's announcement that some 4,000 troops \n     will join a NATO force of 28,000 to help police a Kosovo \n     agreement faces all those concerned with long-range American \n     national security policy with a quandary.\n       Having at one time shared responsibility for national \n     security policy and the extrication from Vietnam, I am \n     profoundly uneasy about the proliferation of open-ended \n     American commitments involving the deployment of U.S. forces. \n     American forces are in harm's way in Kosovo, Bosnia and the \n     gulf. They lack both a definition of strategic purpose by \n     which success can be measured and an exit strategy. In the \n     case of Kosovo, the concern is that America's leadership \n     would be impaired by the refusal of Congress to approve \n     American participation in the NATO force that has come into \n     being largely as a result of a diplomacy conceived and \n     spurred by Washington.\n       Thus, in the end, Congress may feel it has little choice \n     but to go along. In any event, its formal approval is not \n     required. But Congress needs to put the administration on \n     notice that it is uneasy about being repeatedly confronted \n     with ad hoc military missions. The development and \n     articulation of a comprehensive strategy is imperative if we \n     are to avoid being stretched too thin in the face of other \n     foreseeable and militarily more dangerous challenges.\n       Before any future deployments take place, we must be able \n     to answer these questions: What consequences are we seeking \n     to prevent? What goals are we seeking to achieve? In what way \n     do they serve the national interest?\n       President Clinton has justified American troop deployments \n     in Kosovo on the ground that ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia \n     threatens ``Europe's stability and future.'' Other \n     administration spokesmen have compared the challenge to that \n     of Hitler's threat to European security. Neither statement \n     does justice to Balkan realities.\n       The proposed deployment in Kosovo does not deal with any \n     threat to American security as traditionally conceived. The \n     threatening escalations sketched by the president--to \n     Macedonia or Greece and Turkey--are in the long run more \n     likely to result from the emergence of a Kosovo state.\n       Nor is the Kosovo problem new. Ethnic conflict has been \n     endemic in the Balkans for centuries. Waves of conquests have \n     congealed divisions between ethnic groups and religions, \n     between the Eastern Orthodox and Catholic faiths; between \n     Christianity and Islam; between the heirs of the Austrian and \n     Ottoman empires.\n       Through the centuries, these conflicts have been fought \n     with unparalleled ferocity because none of the populations \n     has any experience with--and essentially no belief in--\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\n     Western concepts of toleration. Majority rule and compromise \n     that underlie most of the proposals for a ``solution'' never \n     have found an echo in the Balkans.\n       Moreover, the projected Kosovo agreement is unlikely to \n     enjoy the support of the parties for a long period of time. \n     For Serbia, acquiescing under the threat of NATO bombardment, \n     it involves nearly unprecedented international intercession. \n     Yugoslavia, a sovereign state, is being asked to cede control \n     and in time sovereignty of a province containing its national \n     shrines to foreign military force.\n       Though President Slobodan Milosevic has much to answer for, \n     especially in Bosnia, he is less the cause of the conflict in \n     Kosovo than an expression of it. On the need to retain \n     Kosovo, Serbian leaders--including Milosevic's domestic \n     opponents--seem united. For Serbia, current NATO policy means \n     either dismemberment of the country or postponement of the \n     conflict to a future date when, according to the NATO \n     proposal, the future of the province will be decided.\n       The same attitude governs the Albanian side. The Kosovo \n     Liberation Army (KLA) is fighting for independence, not \n     autonomy. But under the projected agreement, Kosovo, now an \n     integral part of Serbia, is to be made an autonomous and \n     self-governing entity within Serbia, which, however, will \n     remain responsible for external security and even exercise \n     some unspecified internal police functions. A plebiscite at \n     the end of three years is to determine the region's future.\n       The KLA is certain to try to use the cease-fire to expel \n     the last Serbian influences from the province and drag its \n     feet on giving up its arms. And if NATO resists, it may come \n     under attack itself--perhaps from both sides. What is \n     described by the administration as a ``strong peace \n     agreement'' is likely to be at best the overture to another, \n     far more complicated set of conflicts.\n       Ironically, the projected peace agreement increases the \n     likelihood of the various possible escalations sketched by \n     the president as justification for a U.S. deployment. An \n     independent Albanian Kosovo surely would seek to incorporate \n     the neighboring Albanian minorities--mostly in Macedonia--and \n     perhaps even Albania itself. And a Macedonian conflict would \n     land us precisely back in the Balkan wars of earlier in this \n     century. Will Kosovo then become the premise for a NATO move \n     into Macedonia, just as the deployment in Bosnia is invoked \n     as justification for the move into Kosovo? Is NATO to be the \n     home for a whole series of Balkan NATO protectorates?\n       What confuses the situation even more is that the American \n     missions in Bosnia and Kosovo are justified by different, \n     perhaps incompatible, objectives. In Bosnia, American \n     deployment is being promoted as a means to unite Croats, \n     Muslims and Serbs into a single state. Serbs and Croats \n     prefer to practice self-determination but are being asked to \n     subordinate their preference to the geopolitical argument \n     that a small Muslim Bosnian state would be too precarious and \n     irredentist. But in Kosovo, national self-determination is \n     invoked to produce a tiny state nearly certain to be \n     irredentist.\n       Since neither traditional concepts of the national interest \n     nor U.S. security impel the deployment, the ultimate \n     justification is the laudable and very American goal of \n     easing human suffering. This is why, in the end, I went along \n     with the Dayton agreement insofar as it ended the war by \n     separating the contending forces. But I cannot bring myself \n     to endorse American ground forces in Kosovo.\n       In Bosnia, the exit strategy can be described. The existing \n     dividing lines can be made permanent. Failure to do so will \n     require their having to be manned indefinitely unless we \n     change our objective to self-determination and permit each \n     ethnic group to decide its own fate.\n       In Kosovo, that option does not exist. There are no ethnic \n     dividing lines, and both sides claim the entire territory. \n     America's attitude toward the Serbs' attempts to insist on \n     their claim has been made plain enough; it is the threat of \n     bombing. But how do we and NATO react to Albanian \n     transgressions and irredentism? Are we prepared to fight both \n     sides and for how long? In the face of issues such as these, \n     the unity of the contact group of powers acting on behalf of \n     NATO is likely to dissolve. Russia surely will increasingly \n     emerge as the supporter of the Serbian point of view.\n       We must take care not to treat a humanitarian foreign \n     policy as a magic recipe for the basic problem of \n     establishing priorities in foreign policy. The president's \n     statements ``that we can make a difference'' and that America \n     symbolizes hope and resolve'' are exhortations, not policy \n     prescription. Do they mean that America's military power is \n     available to enable every ethnic or religious group to \n     achieve self-determination? Is NATO to become the artillery \n     for ethnic conflict? If Kosovo, why not East Africa or \n     Central Asia? And would a doctrine of universal humanitarian \n     intervention reduce or increase suffering by intensifying \n     ethnic and religious conflict? What are the limits of such a \n     policy and by what criteria is it established?\n       In my view, that line should be drawn at American ground \n     forces in Kosovo. Europeans never tire of stressing the need \n     for greater European autonomy. Here is an occasion to \n     demonstrate it. If Kosovo presents a security problem, it is \n     to Europe, largely because of the refugees the conflict might \n     generate, as the president has pointed out. Kosovo is no more \n     a threat to America than Haiti was to Europe--and we never \n     asked for NATO support there. The nearly 300 million \n     Europeans should be able to generate the ground forces to \n     deal with 2.3 million Kosovars. To symbolize Allied unity on \n     larger issues, we should provide logistics, intelligence and \n     air support. But I see no need for U.S. ground forces; \n     leadership should not be interpreted to mean that we must do \n     everything ourselves.\n       Soonor or later, we must articulate the American capability \n     to sustain a global policy. The desire to do so landed us in \n     the Vietnam morass. Even if one stipulates an American \n     strategic interest in Kosovo (which I do not), we must take \n     care not to stretch ourselves too thin in the face of far \n     less ominous threats in the Middle East and Northeast Asia.\n       Each incremental deployment into the Balkans is bound to \n     weaken our ability to deal with Saddam Hussein and North \n     Korea. The psychological drain may be even more grave. Each \n     time we make a peripheral deployment, the administration is \n     constrained to insist that the danger to American forces is \n     minimal--the Kosovo deployment is officially described as a \n     ``peace implementation force.''\n       Such comments have two unfortunate consequences: They \n     increase the impression among Americans that military force \n     can be used casualty-free, and they send a signal of weakness \n     to potential enemies. For in the end our forces will be \n     judged on how adequate they are for peace imposition, not \n     peace implementation.\n       I always am inclined to support the incumbent \n     administration in a forceful assertion of the national \n     interest. And as a passionate believer in the NATO alliance, \n     I make the distinctions between European and American \n     security interests in the Balkans with the utmost reluctance. \n     But support for a strong foreign policy and a strong NATO \n     surely will evaporate if we fail to anchor them in a dear \n     definition of the national interest and impart a sense of \n     direction to our foreign policy in a period of turbulent \n     change.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The reason that I brought this up is that we have \nseveral Senators who are considering amendments on Kosovo. One I think \nwould simply say that the Congress would have to vote before any \ndeployment of any American pilot in any kind of a military mission and/\nor ground troops would set foot on Kosovo. That is the extra step, if \nyou will, to certainly include the Congress in any decisionmaking. But \nI would point out to my colleagues, and I made mention of this when I \nspoke on behalf of this bill, i.e., the bill in regard to retirement \nreform and pay reform, and I pointed out that we have in the law--and \nlet me just point out it is Public Law 105-262, October 17, 1998. It is \na public law, and the President signed it. And there is section \n8115(a), and we say:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     under this Act may be obligated or expended for any \n     additional deployment of forces of the Armed Forces of the \n     United States to Yugoslavia, Albania, or Macedonia unless and \n     until the President, after consultation with the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives, the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, \n     and the minority of the Senate, transmits to Congress a \n     report on the deployment that includes the following:\n\n  And I want my colleagues to understand this. This is the law of the \nland. And the National Security Council is aware of this. As a matter \nof fact, my staff just an hour ago contacted the staff at the National \nSecurity Council, and we said, ``Where is the report?'' We keep hearing \nabout progress and incremental steps or lack of progress with the peace \ntalks and yet we have 4,000, 5,000, maybe 7,000 American troops ready \nto deploy in regard to Kosovo. This requires the administration to come \nto the Congress and report on the following things:\n\n       The President's certification that the presence of those \n     forces in each country to which the forces are to be deployed \n     is necessary in the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n\n  That is pretty basic. Does our involvement really involve our vital \nnational security interests? Can a case be made?\n  Now, the President spoke to it in terms of his radio address. I think \nthat is good. That is the first time he has spoken to it on national \nradio. But we really need to know why is our intervention in Kosovo in \nour vital national security interests? Is it the future of NATO? I \nthink so to some degree. Are we talking about we don't want another \nPalestine in the middle of Central Europe? I know that. But vital \nnational security interests? I don't know.\n\n       (2) The reasons why the deployment is in the national \n     security interests. . . .\n       (3) The number of United States military personnel to be \n     deployed. . . .\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\n       (4) The mission and objectives of forces to be deployed.\n       (5) The expected schedule for accomplishing the objectives \n     of the deployment.\n       (6) The exit strategy--\n\n  Mr. President, the exit strategy--\n\n     for United States forces engaged in the deployment.\n\n  We are talking about a 3-year engagement here. This is 4 years in \nregard to Bosnia.\n\n       The costs associated with the deployment and the funding \n     sources for paying those costs.\n\n  Now, I have quite a bit of blood pressure in this regard since we \nhave spent literally billions of dollars in Bosnia but we didn't pay \nfor it up front. We didn't pay for it with a supplemental. We do pay \nfor it when the pressure comes on the appropriators to come up with an \nemergency funding request. So we need to find out what the costs would \nbe in regard to this deployment.\n  And finally:\n\n       The anticipated effects of the deployment on the morale, \n     retention and effectiveness of United States forces.\n\n  I made mention that one of the considerations why the people are \nleaving the service today is the quality of mission, and we have the \nsituation where 60 percent of our service people today are married, \nobviously part of families, and they go to Bosnia, and perhaps Kosovo, \nand the Mideast and Korea, and we do not have enough people to really \nfill those billets now so they are deployed for 6 months, 9 months, \ncome back for a month, bang, they are right over there again, plus the \nReserve and the Guard. That is one of the considerations in regard to \noperation tempo, personnel tempo, as to why people are leaving the \nservice, but mission quality is also a good reason. That is No. 8 in \nregard to the anticipated effects of the deployment on the morale, the \nretention and effectiveness of U.S. forces.\n  Now, we say if there is an emergency here in terms of our national \nsecurity, obviously the President can intercede.\n  Now, I want to see this report. We met with Secretary Albright, \nSecretary Cohen, and our national security director, Sandy Berger, \nabout 2 weeks ago during the impeachment trial. It was early in the \nmorning. We made them aware of this particular provision in this \nreport. Now, I understand from staff of the NSC that a report will be \ncoming, because in the words of the staff member, ``There is a lull \nover in Kosovo.'' We have a 3 week time period to try to work something \nelse out in regard to the peace agreement.\n  Let me just point out something, Mr. President. The Secretary of \nState said that we would not commit American men and women to a \npeacekeeping role in Kosovo unless there were benchmarks for peace. I \nwould only remind this administration and my colleagues, on behalf of \nall those in the military, that if you are a peacekeeper, there better \nbe a peace to keep because when there is not a peace to keep, you \nbecome a target. That is a whole different situation.\n  So, consequently, I am very hopeful that the National Security \nCouncil will be coming forth with this report and giving the report to \nour leadership and the appropriate committee chairs. Since this is the \nlaw, perhaps we can think about delaying any other amendments to this \nbill in regard to the Kosovo situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator seek recognition?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are making progress on this bill. I \nhope in short order we can address the pending amendment by the \nSenators from Texas and North Carolina, but I am not ready yet. I am \ntrying my very, very best to determine what are the cost ramifications \nof each of these amendments as they come along. At the moment, we are \nclose to isolating the financial repercussions of the amendment of the \nSenators from Texas and North Carolina.\n  I see the Senator from Maine, so at this moment I will yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am honored to serve as an original co-sponsor of the \nSoldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 \nin the name of the hundreds of thousands of men and women trained to \ndeter, fight, and win our wars.\n  I also thank Senators Warner, Allard, Levin, and Cleland for their \nbipartisan support of the legislation's universal 4.8 percent pay raise \nand thrift savings proposals as well as the constructive amendments on \nG.I. bill reform incorporated in the committee-reported version of the \nbill.\n  The Bill of Rights Act legalizes the concept that military personnel \nshould receive the same retirement benefits based not on the arbitrary \nfactor of when they joined, but on the timeless standard of willingness \nto sacrifice.\n  It is notable, therefore, that the Senate's opening legislation of \nthe year increases soldier pay for the first time in a generation and \nstrips away the layers of unfairness in a military retirement system \nbased solely on the date of entry rather than the length of service. \nUnilke the current arrangement, which is more generous to active duty \npersonnel who started working before 1986, our proposal of benefits and \nbonuses offers the same retirement package to all men and women in \nuniform who build a military career of at least 20 years.\n  Today, we also commit ourselves to a comprehensive pay raise of 4.8 \npercent--the largest since 1982--that narrows the gap between military \nand civilian salaries.\n  We commit ourselves, as Secretary Cohen did last month in \nrecommending salary increases for noncommissioned and mid-grade \ncommissioned officers, to retention and promotion bonuses that reward \nthe skills of 21st century war fighters.\n  We commit ourselves for the first time ever to making long-term \nsavings plans available to uniformed service members so that they can \nbuild a foundation for family security.\n  We commit ourselves to increases the monthly G.I. benefit for Service \npeople who serve at least for 2 years while eliminating the punitive \n$1,200 entry fee for young men and women who want to take advantage of \na college education under this historic program.\n  And we commit ourselves to financial independence for the junior \nenlisted ranks by making available a special subsistence allowance of \n$180 per month as an alternative to food stamp subsidies. This \nprovision will remove from the welfare rolls an estimated 11,900 \nmilitary personnel in the lowest pay grades.\n  Beginning last September and continuing through the new year, the \ncommittee constructed a public record of the financial and operational \nstrains that our military people have endured in recent times.\n  We found that the total value of the Army's retirement package had \neroded by 25 percent since 1986. We also found that inadequate pay left \nthe Navy short of 7,000 sailors, the Air Force short of 2,000 pilots, \nand the Marine Corps short of combat engineers by a threshold of 30 \npercent.\n  Last month, General Henry Shelton, the nation's senior official in \nuniform, told the Armed Services Committee that ``reforming military \nretirement remains the Joint Chiefs highest priority.''\n  Echoing General Shelton, the Air Force Chief of Staff told the \ncommittee that ``restoring the retirement system as a retention \nincentive is our top priority.''\n  The Commandant of the Marine Corps told the committee that ``unit \ncommanders routinely cite dissatisfaction with . . . retirement . . . \nas one of the foremost reasons for separation.''\n  And the Chief of Naval Operations told the Committee that ``pay and \nretirement benefits rank among our sailors' top dissatisfiers.''\n  As the chairwoman of the Armed Services Seapower Subcommittee, I must \nreport that inadequate pay has directly strained our maritime Special \nOperations forces--famously known as the Navy SEALS.\n  The SEALS conduct vital intelligence-gathering and enemy infiltration \nactivities in advance of, or as an alternative to, higher risk \nconventional military campaigns. Intense training schedules and \nexciting missions have traditionally held SEAL recruitment and \nretention levels traditionally exceed those for most other naval \ncomponents by between 20 and 30 percent.\n  But today, the SEAL re-enlistment rate exceeds that for the rest of \nthe Service by only 2 percent. The SEALS now face an overall shortfall \nof 300 men, and the senior enlisted member of\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nthe organization told the San Diego Tribune last week that while morale \nwas still high, the pay was too low.\n  Beyond the SEALS, Mr. President, the Navy struggles with skilled \npersonnel shortages throughout the Service. Thirty-five percent of \nnaval aviators elect to take retention bonuses while the Pentagon's \ngoal in this area stands at 50 percent. Enlisted retention overall has \ndecreased 6 to 8 percent below normal requirements.\n  Finally, the most acute turnover rates faced by our sailors come from \nthe ranks of those who lead them: the mid-level officers who command \nour surface ships and submarines.\n  The Bill of Rights Act responds in an aggressive way to these \ndisturbing developments. With this law, we declare that while Congress \ncannot equalize the financial benefits of all Armed Services and \nprivate sector jobs, it can devise compensation plans upholding the \nvalue of military careers regardless of the state of the economy.\n  It's fair to ask, Mr. President, why the Joint Chiefs did not \nidentify problems like a ballistic missile strike from North Korea or \nIraq's chemical weapons as more serious threats to military \npreparedness than pay levels or retirement benefits.\n  The answer rests with a fundamental but overlooked fact: only people \ncan deliver the capabilities to protect America and her interests \noverseas. We must therefore ensure that the military's pay and \nretirement policies provide strong retention incentives to skilled and \nmotivated troops.\n  Military strength not only comes from adequate spending on technology \nand hardware. It also comes from compensation packages that inspire \nofficers and enlisted personnel alike to remain in service with fair \npay and to anticipate a secure retirement with a fair pension.\n  Because the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of \nRights Act of 1999 recognizes the critical human dimension of defense \npreparedness, I urge the Senate's enthusiastic support for this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in consultation with the ranking member \nhere, and with the respective offices of the leadership, it is our hope \nand expectation that we could have a vote at 5:30 on the amendment \nproposed by the Senator from Texas and the Senator from North Carolina. \nI urge all those who wish to address remarks concerning that amendment \nto proceed to the floor. And as they arrive, hopefully they can seek \nrecognition. This is a very important bill. It is one in which there \nwill be further discussion.\n  Our colleague from Minnesota has an amendment, it is my \nunderstanding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank both my \ncolleagues, the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 16\n\n(Purpose: To provide for enhanced protections of the confidentiality of \n  records of family advocacy services and other professional support \nservices relating to incidents of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and \n                           intrafamily abuse)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mrs. Murray, proposes an amendment numbered 16.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, after line 16, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 402. REPORT AND REGULATIONS ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   POLICIES ON PROTECTING THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF \n                   COMMUNICATIONS WITH PROFESSIONALS PROVIDING \n                   THERAPEUTIC OR RELATED SERVICES REGARDING \n                   SEXUAL OR DOMESTIC ABUSE.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Study.--(1) The Comptroller General \n     shall study the policies, procedures, and practices of the \n     military departments for protecting the confidentiality of \n     communications between--\n       (A) a dependent of a member of the Armed Forces who--\n       (i) is a victim of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or \n     intrafamily abuse; or\n       (ii) has engaged in such misconduct; and\n       (B) a therapist, counselor, advocate, or other professional \n     from whom the dependent seeks professional services in \n     connection with effects of such misconduct.\n       (2) The Comptroller General shall conclude the study and \n     submit to the Secretary of Defense a report on the results of \n     the study within such period as is necessary to enable the \n     Secretary to satisfy the reporting requirement under \n     subsection (d).\n       (b) Regulations.--The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe \n     in regulations the policies and procedures that the Secretary \n     considers necessary to provide the maximum possible \n     protections for the confidentiality of communications \n     described in subsection (a) relating to misconduct described \n     in that subsection, consistent with:\n       (1) the findings of the Comptroller General;\n       (2) the standards of confidentiality and ethical standards \n     issued by relevant professional organizations;\n       (3) applicable requirements of federal and state law;\n       (4) the best interest of victims of sexual harassment, \n     sexual assault, or intrafamily abuse; and\n       (5) such other factors as the Secretary in consultation \n     with the Attorney General, may consider appropriate.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment is simple and it is \nimportant. It calls on the Defense Department to issue new guidelines \nthat will strengthen the privacy rights of victims of domestic violence \nwho are spouses and children of our military employees.\n  Just a little bit of background. And it calls for this to be done in \nan expeditious manner, I think within a 9-month period.\n  Mr. President, domestic violence--actually, I am sorry to say on the \nfloor of the Senate--is a huge problem and a huge issue in our country. \nAbout every 15 seconds a woman is battered in her home. A home should \nbe a safe place, but all too often it is not. And this affects women \nand children. And I say this is nationwide, because I would not want \nany colleague to think that the focus here is just on the military.\n  Battering is one of the single greatest causes of injury to women. \nAccording to the Department of Justice statistics, of the 1.4 million \nhospital emergency room admissions in 1994, about a quarter of them \nwere treated for injuries from domestic violence. The prevalence of \nviolence against women associated with the U.S. Armed Forces is deeply \ndisturbing. The dependent victims of violent crimes in the Armed Forces \nare particularly vulnerable due to isolation, the mobile lifestyle, and \nfinancial security--some of which we are trying to deal with in our \nlegislation.\n  The Department of Defense data estimates that on average 23.2 per \n1,000 spouses of military personnel experienced domestic violence in \nthe last 5 years. According to an Army survey released to Time \nMagazine, spousal abuse is occurring in one of every three Army \nfamilies each year. So unfortunately it is a problem.\n  Here is the problem that we are trying to rectify: In civilian \nsociety we recognize the confidentiality of communications so that if a \nwoman sees a doctor or she sees someone else, a mental health worker or \nsomeone she needs to see to give her help, there is confidentiality. \nBut we do not have the same confidentiality for spouses of our Armed \nForces personnel and their children. And so what we are trying to do is \nto make sure that we have the same guarantees of confidentiality.\n  When you do not have the confidentiality--and, again, we believe and \nwe agree that our military is absolutely correct that when it comes to \nthose that are enlisted in the military, there is a problem with \nconfidentiality because you want to know what is going on with that \nsoldier if you are about to put that soldier in a combat situation. But \nI am not talking actually about the military; I am talking about the \nspouses and the children. We want to make sure that the victims are not \nretraumatized.\n  What happens too often, I say to my colleagues, right now--and I \nthink there is an acknowledgement of this; I\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\nthink this amendment is a positive step; I really do--what happens all \ntoo often is that many women are afraid to step forward because the \nconversation they have with their doctor, or wherever they go, is not \nconfidential; it becomes public, it becomes released to too many \npeople. And therefore what happens is she has to worry that her husband \nmay, in fact, take action against her. So many women are afraid. They \nare afraid to tell anyone about what is happening to them. They are \nafraid to tell anyone that they themselves are being battered or that \ntheir children are being battered.\n\n  So let me just kind of conclude with an example. Annette--I do not \nwant to use any full names--is the former wife of a naval chief petty \nofficer and the mother of two young children. She was routinely beaten \nby him from June 1994 through 1996. Military protective orders and \ncivilian restraining orders failed to protect her and her children. Her \nex-husband was charged with 21 offenses by the U.S. Navy, including \neight assault charges involving Annette. He was ultimately court-\nmartialed.\n  During the military's investigation of abuse, she was interviewed in \nthe presence of her batterer, and her batterer's command was notified, \nwhich resulted in a brutal escalation of the violence toward Annette. \nAt his court-martial proceedings, her dating and marital history were \nreviewed publicly by prosecuting attorneys.\n  We need to ensure that military wives and dependents like Annette are \ngiven the same rights of privacy and confidentiality as civilian \nvictims. That is what this is about. It calls on the Defense Department \nto basically issue some guidelines that will give these military wives \nand dependents the same rights of privacy and confidentiality that any \nother civilian victim has right now.\n  This will make an enormous difference, I say to my colleagues. We \nbring these amendments to the floor. I am so pleased it is supported. I \nthank both my colleagues for this. I certainly hope that we will keep \nthis in conference committee. I hope I will have their support because \nthis really will make an important difference. It is really very \nimportant.\n  I thank Senator Murray. I hope she will have time to come down. I \nthank both my colleagues for their support.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery will please refrain from \ncommenting on comments made by Senators.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge my Colleagues \nto support the pending Wellstone amendment. I want to thank Senator \nWellstone for his efforts on behalf of battered spouses in the military \nand commend him for his diligence on this issue.\n  As many of you know, both Senator Wellstone and I have worked hard to \naddress the needs of victims of domestic violence. Stopping domestic \nviolence should be a priority regardless of whether or not the batterer \nis a civilian or member of the military. Unfortunately, we have not yet \ndone enough to protect military dependants who are victims of abuse.\n  The Wellstone amendment would protect the privacy of military \ndependent's medical and counseling records. Currently, dependents of \nthe military are not afforded the same assumption of privacy as \ncivilian are for their medical records. If a spouse of a member of the \nmilitary is battered and she seeks health care services for the \ntreatment of the abuse, her records should not become public where they \ncould later be used against her.\n  We know one of the most important factors for domestic violence \nvictims is privacy. If a battered woman seeks help in an emergency room \nor through a counselor, her medical records remain private. The records \ncannot be released without her consent. This assumption of privacy is \ncrucial for women to come forward and ask for help. Because there is no \nassumption of privacy for military dependents, the chances that these \nwomen to will seek medical help and counseling is severely reduced.\n  We have heard from advocates that work with battered military \ndependents. They have seen how this lack of privacy protection affects \ntheir ability to help victims of domestic violence and their children. \nThey have told us that this change is necessary and important. I urge \nmy Colleagues to listen to the recommendations of those who are truly \non the front lines in preventing domestic violence. They know this is \nthe right thing to do.\n  This amendment has been adopted in the past by the Senate and I urge \nmy Colleagues to again send the message to battered military dependents \nthat they should never fear seeking medical help or counseling and that \nthey do not have to remain in violent, abusive relationships.\n  I urge my Colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. We thank the Senator for bringing this important \ninitiative to the attention of the committee. And the committee accepts \nthis amendment. I hope that it will be accepted by all of our \ncolleagues. Does the Senator require a rollcall or a voice vote?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased not to have a call for the yeas and nays, \nbut rather a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate our good friend from \nMinnesota for this amendment. This is a very, very, perceptive \namendment.\n  What he is doing here is requiring that the Comptroller General make \na study in a report to the Department of Defense on policies that would \nprotect the confidentiality of communications between military \ndependents who are victims of sexual harassment, sexual assault or \nintrafamily abuse or who have engaged in such misconduct; and \ntherapists, counselors and advocates from whom the victim seeks \nprofessional services. The Senator has pointed out that without this \nconfidentiality, the victims of this kind of abuse and behavior are a \nlot less likely to use what is available to them in terms of \ncounseling, medical services and protection. This becomes a very \nessential ingredient in protecting the victims of this kind of abuse. \nWithout this confidentiality, we don't have the necessary protection \nthat will give the assurance to these victims.\n  I want to commend Senator Wellstone and Senator Murray for this \namendment. I hope it has prompt and swift approval of this body.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleagues. Before we have the voice vote, \nI thank Charlotte Oldham-Moore of my staff for doing a lot of work, and \nI thank the people around the country for helping us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 16) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to advise colleagues that we are \nproceeding toward a vote at 5:30. I am anxious to receive the further \ncomments from those Senators actively supporting the bill of the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from North Carolina. I anticipate \ntheir appearance here very shortly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, leadership has now authorized the managers \nof the bill to advise the Senate that there will be a vote at 5:30 \ntonight on the amendments of the Senators from Texas and North \nCarolina. I see both Senators present. I yield the floor for their \nconcluding remarks.\n  I wonder if I might just propound a question that I hope the Senator \nwill address in the course of her remarks. My colleague and I, as \nmanagers of the bill, want to be careful about trying to limit the \namount of additional funds put on. After careful study of the Senator's \namendment, it is my view that\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nall authorization and funding is discretionary. Am I correct in that?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes. I say to the distinguished chairman that we are \nobviously saying to the Department of Defense that we want to improve \nthe TRICARE system if they find that it is feasible to do so. \nObviously, they are going to have to find it feasible. But the \npriorities that are set will improve TRICARE and particularly allow \nimmediately--well, when the amendment takes effect a year from now. But \nthere will be no cost to allowing people to be able to go to another \nbase and keep their TRICARE system in place. There is no cost in that.\n  Mr. WARNER. So the Secretary of Defense would have the discretion to \nexercise within his appropriated fund budget in the health care \naccount. Am I correct on that item?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is the Senator from North Carolina agreeing to that?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, it is the joint judgment of both sponsors that \nthere is no point of order.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Absolutely. In fact, I think what we are trying to \ndo, of course, is to give the Department the ability to do some of the \nthings that it would like to be able to do to improve the service.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank both of my colleagues. Thank you very much. I \nyield the floor. We will have a vote at 5:30.\n  First, has the Chair established that vote at 5:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator wish to make that in the form \nof a unanimous consent?\n  Mr. WARNER. I so make that request of the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 18\n\n               (Purpose: To improve the TRICARE program.)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Edwards, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Helms, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Coverdell, \n     Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Santorum, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 18.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 46, after line 16, add the following:\n\n                         TITLE V--MISCELLANEOUS\n\n     SEC. 501.

Mr. President, I want to announce the cosponsors for \nwhom I am offering this amendment. The cosponsors are Mr. Edwards, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. Helms, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nKennedy, Mr. Bingaman, and Mr. Santorum.\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that I think goes very well in \nthe bill before us. This is a military Bill of Rights. This bill is \ngoing to try to help alleviate a very bad situation that we have with \nour military. Right now we are having a hard time recruiting. We have \nhad the worst recruiting year in the Army for the United States since \n1979. We are having a hard time retaining our best people. For every \ntwo pilots that we lose, we are only gaining one to replace those \npilots. So you can see, if we are losing two pilots and gaining one, \npretty soon we are going to have a pilot shortage in the Air Force, and \nthe time has come.\n  It is also going to add to the expense of training the pilots in the \nAir Force. The Navy has had to lower its educational standards to \nrecruit. This is not good. So many of us in Congress on a bipartisan \nbasis said, What can we do? What can we do to make sure we are giving \nquality of life to those who are giving their lives to protect our \nfreedom? What can we do to make it worthwhile for them?\n  The basic things we have heard that are a problem that cause us to \nlose personnel are pay, health care, and pension benefits. This bill, \nwith our\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\namendment, will address all three. The bill before us today is a pay \nraise. It does increase pension benefits. But what it hasn't addressed \nuntil our amendment is health care. And when I go across my State or \nwhen I visit a base in Saudi Arabia, or Tuzla, Bosnia, I hear that \npeople are worried about health care. They are worried that their \nfamilies back home are not able to get the quality health care they \nneed.\n  So the amendment that Senator Edwards and I are proposing today, \nalong with all of our cosponsors, would reform the TRICARE system. It \nwould require that benefits be portable across the regions that are \nestablished in the current system.\n  We all know that military personnel have to move every 2 to 3 years. \nWe want them to be able to take the benefits of their TRICARE system \nwith them when they go to another base. That costs nothing, but it \ncertainly does help ease the transition for the military family.\n  We would ensure military coverage as comparable to the average \ncoverage available to civilian Government employees. Many times on our \nbases we have civilian Federal employees working side by side with \nmilitary personnel. We want them to have comparable health care. So \nwithin the bounds that the Department of Defense can produce, we want \nto try to make that comparable and equal if we can get it there. We \nwant to minimize the bureaucratic red tape and streamline the claims \nprocessing.\n  One of the big complaints of the doctors who serve our military \npersonnel from the community is that there is so much bureaucratic red \ntape that they can't get their claim, and it is not worth the hassle. \nSo what happens? The doctor says, ``I'm not going to serve military \nfamilies.''\n  Well, we want to stop that right now. We would increase the \nreimbursement levels to attract and retain quality health care \nproviders. Where a base city does not have the capability to attract \npediatricians or OB-GYN or key areas of specialty to serve the military \nfamilies, we want to authorize the Department of Defense to reimburse \nat greater levels in order to attract that service for our military \nfamilies. That is what the amendment does.\n  We also allow our military treatment facilities, our military \nhospitals, to be reimbursed at Medicare rates from third party givers. \nThis is not adding a cost. In fact, it will help these military \nhospitals to be reimbursed at a better rate so that they will be able \nto give better care to our military participants.\n  So that is what our amendment does. We think it is a good amendment, \nthat the Department of Defense will be able to do some of the things \nthey have said they want to be able to do to get better health care in \nthe TRICARE system, and our amendment will allow them to do it.\n\n  So I appreciate very much that the distinguished chairman and ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee are supporting this amendment. I \nthink it is essential to make a true improvement in the quality of life \nfor our military to improve their health care benefits at the same time \nthat we are giving them pay raises.\n  At this time, I would like to yield to the Senator from North \nCarolina, my cosponsor, Senator Edwards.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I thank the Chair.\n  It is a great honor for me to help cosponsor this particular piece of \nlegislation. The truth is that the TRICARE system, which covers over 6 \nmillion Americans and over 300,000 North Carolinians is broken and it \nneeds to be fixed.\n  Senator Hutchison's amendment goes a long way toward addressing the \nproblems of the TRICARE system. It begins by setting minimum standards \nwhich the system clearly needs.\n  What I would like to do is talk just briefly today about why this is \nso important to Americans, and why it is so important to the people of \nNorth Carolina. And there are three or four examples that I think show \nthat very clearly.\n  We have had lots of correspondence, lots of calls about problems with \nthe TRICARE system. Comdr. Ronald Smith, who is from the Greensboro \narea in North Carolina, Guilford County, which is one of the most \npopulous counties in North Carolina, tells us stories about the fact \nthat in Greensboro there is no primary care provider who is willing to \nprovide medical care for his soldiers and their dependents.\n  One example of the problem that creates is of a female soldier who \nhad to travel to a different county to be treated, and when she went \nthere, she had to actually write a check for a copayment before they \nwould allow her to leave.\n  A second problem that Commander Smith tells us about is the problem \npharmacies have getting reimbursed for their prescriptions. An example \nhe gave was a soldier who had a case of the flu, a bad case of the flu, \nand needed prescription medication. But when the soldier went to get \nthe prescription medication, she learned that she had to make a \npayment, cash payment, and didn't have the money. So this soldier had \nto actually go out and obtain a loan in order to get the prescription \nmedication that she needed to treat the flu.\n  Another example of this problem is a soldier who was taking blood \npressure medication that was critical to that soldier's health. The \nsoldier put off for over a week taking the blood pressure medication \nbecause she didn't have the money to pay the cash that was needed to \nget the prescription medication.\n  This is a serious problem. These are problems that need to be \naddressed. A Sergeant Williams, who is from Fayetteville, NC, where the \nWomack Army Hospital is located, told me a story about his daughter \nwhich was really amazing. His daughter had a problem with a small rash. \nShe went to the Womack Army Hospital and got a dermatology consult. \nThat was easy to do because the hospital is located nearby.\n  Then he tried to schedule a number of office appointments for his \ndaughter, but they kept being canceled. And then he decided, well, \nmaybe I need to take her to see a private physician, perhaps at Duke in \nDurham, which is a little over an hour away. And he was told if he did \nthat, he would have to make an out-of-pocket cash payment of $300 to \nhave her seen. He was finally able to get something scheduled for her. \nAt the time of his letter to me, it had been over 80 days since her \ninitial consult and this rash, which began as a very small, \ninconsequential rash, had then spread over her entire body.\n  This is a serious problem. It is one that needs to be addressed, and \nit is one that Senator Hutchison's amendment addresses very directly. I \ndo think that what we are here about is not increasing health care \ncosts, but increasing efficiency. I think Senator Hutchison has some \nwonderful provisions in this amendment to address that problem.\n  We have an obligation to honor the commitment that the soldiers and \ntheir dependents have made to this country, and we need to provide \nquality health care to these folks. They deserve it. They have made an \nextraordinary commitment to this country. This country needs to show \nits commitment to the soldiers who have served and are serving and \ntheir dependents. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for this \namendment. This TRICARE system needs to be fixed, and this amendment \ngoes a long way towards fixing it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I really appreciate the one-on-one \nexperiences that Senator Edwards has mentioned because that really \nbrings it home, when that poor child started with a small rash and by \nthe time she could get an appointment with a doctor the rash had \ncovered her body. That is a terrible story, and I have heard stories \nlike that as well. It is why I became interested in trying to fix a \nproblem that was really hurting the military families and our ability \nto retain those military families.\n  Just last week I toured Lackland Air Force Base. That is the basic \ntraining base for all Air Force personnel. A young drill instructor \ncame up to me and said, ``Senator, keep up the good work and fix \nTRICARE.'' I told him that we would. Certainly, this is the answer to \nthat drill instructor, because he clearly was having a hard time \ngetting care for his family.\n  In a letter that was written to me recently, a retired veteran \nexplained the difficulties he was experiencing with TRICARE. But, he \nsaid, ``Senator,\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nplease don't concentrate your efforts on my individual problems--this \nis a systemic problem * * *''\n  It is a problem. We are losing access to care because of the \nnightmare associated with claims processing and the dismal rate of \nreimbursement for services. In fact, if you go to a smaller community \nthat has a base, often you cannot see a heart surgeon because they just \nwill not see a military person because they know the rate of \nreimbursement is so low. We cannot allow that to be the case for our \nmilitary personnel.\n  General Dennis Reimer is the Chief of Staff of the Army. He recently \nsaid, ``This is about readiness and this is about quality of life \nlinked together. We must ensure that we provide those young men and \nwomen who sacrifice and serve our country so well * * * the quality \nmedical care that is the top priority for them * * *'' General Reimer \nsaid, ``We must help them or else we're not going to be able to recruit \nthis high quality force.''\n  When we are talking about readiness, we are talking about the high \nquality people that make up our Armed Forces and we are talking about \nkeeping them. The last thing we want is a lot of great equipment but \nnot people to run that equipment.\n  We have to realize that times have changed in the military. No longer \nare most of our military personnel unmarried. They are now married and \nthey have families. They expect to have health care for those families \nand housing and good pay. That is what they expect, and that is what \nthey deserve. We need to give it to them.\n  That is why our amendment is so important, to be part of adding to \nthe quality of life of our military. We cannot allow the retention \nproblems to continue to erode the powerful military that we have. Our \nmilitary strength is based on people, good people, quality people, \npeople who are dedicated, people who care about this country and want \nto protect it. They want to protect our freedom. If they are going to \ngive their lives to protect our freedom, I think in return they deserve \na quality of life for themselves and for their families that would make \nus all proud.\n  That is why Senator Edwards and I, Senator Hagel, Senator Helms, \nSenator Fitzgerald, Senator Coverdell, Senator Johnson, Senator \nSantorum, Senator Kennedy, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Sessions have \ncome together on this amendment to try to add quality health care and \nimprovements to the TRICARE system to the military pay raise and the \npension improvements that are already in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, there will be \nno further votes after the vote now scheduled to begin at 5:30. I wish \nto advise Senators that we are scheduling votes for tomorrow morning at \n9:45 a.m. It is a vote on an amendment by myself and Senator Sarbanes \nrelating to civil service pay. That would be followed--and I presume \nwith a 10-minute vote--by an amendment by Senator Cleland, who will \naddress that vote tonight. But it is a further expansion, and an \nimportant one, of the Montgomery GI bill provisions, which Senator \nCleland put in the basic bill.\n  So I just wished to give those pieces of information to our \ncolleagues.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Also, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow with Senator Jeffords, \nErnie Audino, be granted the privilege of the floor during the pendency \nof S. 4.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in just a moment we are about to request \nan order for the two votes in the morning. I say to my colleagues, I \ncertainly appreciate the cooperation of Senators. I think this bill has \nmoved along at a very good pace. We had good debate on important \nsubjects. I especially thank our two leaders, Senator Lott and Senator \nDaschle, for giving strong support to the managers.\n  Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent the Chair place an \norder that we will have two votes in the morning, at 9:45 a.m., on the \nWarner-Sarbanes amendment, and a second vote to follow thereafter, not \nto exceed 10 minutes, on an amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia, Senator Cleland. He will lay that down immediately following \nthe 5:30 vote. We will have a certain amount of debate, and it will be \npending the following day.\n  Do I have the concurrence of my colleague?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No objection. We support that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if there is a moment, I wish to commend the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from North Carolina again on their \namendment. The DOD has been working hard to improve the delivery of \nmedical care through the TRICARE program. This amendment gives strong \nencouragement to the Secretary of Defense to broaden the services which \nwere provided under the TRICARE system. It is important that these \nservices be provided to military members and their families. It is \nimportant to improve the claims and the reimbursement process, and to \nmake benefits under the TRICARE program uniform across the country. So, \nagain, I thank the Senators from Texas and North Carolina and their \nsupporters for their leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may, I associate myself with those \nremarks. Indeed, it is a very important contribution. I have counseled \nwith the good Senator from Texas for some several months. This has been \na very important part of her overall legislative goals for a period of \ntime.\n  Now is the time. I think we are about ready.\n  Mr. President, I think the hour of 5:30 having arrived--are the yeas \nand nays ordered on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nTexas. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced, yeas 100, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 21 Leg.]\n\n                               YEAS--100\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The amendment (No. 18) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have two Senators desiring to lay down \namendments tonight which will be voted on tomorrow, pursuant to an \norder entered into a short time ago, beginning at 9:45, back to back.\n  The first amendment is from my distinguished colleague, the Senator \nfrom\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\nMaryland, and I am his principal cosponsor; the second amendment is \nfrom the Senator from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that there should continue \nto be parity between the adjustments in the compensation of members of \n   the uniformed services and the adjustments in the compensation of \n                civilian employees of the United States)\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Sarbanes], for himself, Mr. \n     Warner, Mr. Robb, and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 19.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 104. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING PARITY BETWEEN \n                   ADJUSTMENTS IN MILITARY AND CIVIL SERVICE PAY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Members of the uniformed services of the United States \n     and civilian employees of the United States make significant \n     contributions to the general welfare of the United States.\n       (2) Increases in the levels of pay of members of the \n     uniformed services and of civilian employees of the United \n     States have not kept pace with increases in the overall \n     levels of pay of workers in the private sector so that there \n     is now up to a 30 percent gap between the compensation levels \n     of Federal civilian employees and the compensation levels of \n     private sector workers and a 9 to 14 percent gap between the \n     compensation levels of members of the uniformed services and \n     the compensation levels of private sector workers.\n       (3) In almost every year of the past two decades, there \n     have been equal adjustments in the compensation of members of \n     the uniformed services and the compensation of civilian \n     employees of the United States.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     there should continue to be parity between the adjustments in \n     the compensation of members of the uniformed services and the \n     adjustments in the compensation of civilian employees of the \n     United States.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President I will be very brief. I appreciate the \ncourtesy of the distinguished Senator from Georgia in allowing me to \npresent this amendment before he presents his. We will take this up in \nthe morning. There will be a very limited amount of time.\n  Very simply, this is a sense-of-the-Congress resolution that there \nshould be parity between the adjustments and the compensation of \nmembers of the uniformed services and the adjustments and the \ncompensation of civilian employees of the United States. In almost \nevery year over the past two decades, there have been equal adjustments \nin the compensation of members of the uniformed services and the \ncompensation of civilian employees of the United States, and this \nexpresses the sense of the Congress that this parity in adjustments \nshould continue.\n  I know a number of Members wish to join in cosponsoring, and I add \nSenators Robb and Senator Mikulski as cosponsors at this point. Members \nwill obviously have a chance to do that first thing in the morning. \nSenator Warner and I can speak to it briefly in the morning.\n  It is a very straightforward amendment. I don't know of any \nopposition to it. I very strongly urge my colleagues to be supportive \nof this amendment.\n  I again thank the Senator from Georgia for his kindness, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is my 21st year in the Senate, and I \nhave had the privilege to work with my good colleague and other members \nof the delegation from Maryland and Virginia through these many years. \nI think we have done our duty as trustees to protect the parity of the \ncivil servants who are just as key players in defense and other areas \nas any other individuals. So many of them have made their lifetime \ncareers serving the country. Many of them are very highly technically \nqualified.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a sense of Congress \namendment to S. 4 along with my colleagues Senator Sarbanes, Senator \nMikulski, and Senator Robb on behalf of the hard working federal \ncivilian employees.\n  This sense-of-Congress amendment states that there should continue to \nbe parity between the adjustments in the compensation of members of the \nuniformed services and the adjustments in the compensation of civilian \nemployees of the United States. In the past, military employees and \nfederal civilian employees have received equal pay adjustments in \ncompensation.\n  Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have fought to ensure the fair \nand equitable treatment of all of our federal employees. Our federal \nemployees play an important role in the efficient and intelligent \noperation of our government. These dedicated public servants should be \ncompensated justly.\n  Mr. President, increases in the levels of pay of members of the \nuniformed services and of civilian employees of the United States have \nnot kept pace with increases in the overall levels of pay of workers in \nthe private sector so that there is now up to a 30 percent gap between \nthe compensation levels of Federal civilian employees and the \ncompensation levels of private sector workers. Retention and labor \nshortage issues in areas related to high technology jobs, and \nspecialized trade occupants in the current economy poses significant \ngaps in pay for our federal civilian employees from their private \nsector counterparts. This is particularly prevalent in the Greater \nMetropolitan Washington area due to the high demand for high tech \nworkers in the private sector where salaries continue to increase.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I want to add that there was a time not too far back \nwhen Maryland and Virginia watermen used to shoot at each other on the \nPotomac River and the Chesapeake Bay. I am happy to report that has \nnever been the tenor of the relationship between myself and the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia. I have enjoyed working in \ncooperation with him on a whole range of issues which have been to the \nbenefit of our respective constituencies, and, indeed, to the benefit \nof the country. I am delighted to be aligned with him once again on an \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague.\n  It is quite true, there were vicious battles--over oysters primarily. \nI hope now the striped bass matter--and crabs--will not further \nengender that type of dispute.\n  Mr. President, that will be the first vote in the morning.\n  The distinguished Senator from Georgia has been patiently waiting, \nand therefore I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 6\n\n (Purpose: To permit members of the Ready Reserve to contribute to the \n Thrift Savings Plan for compensation attributable to their service in \n                           the Ready Reserve)\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland], for himself, Mr. \n     Jeffords, Mr. Bingaman, and Ms. Landrieu, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 6.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 33, line 16, strike ``for a period of more than 30 \n     days'' and insert ``and a member of the Ready Reserve in any \n     pay status''.\n\n       On page 34, beginning on line 10, strike ``on active duty'' \n     and insert ``: members on active duty; members of the Ready \n     Reserve''.\n\n       On page 35, strike lines 3 through 6 and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(c) Maximum Contribution.--(1) The amount contributed by \n     a member of the uniformed services for any pay period out of \n     basic pay may not exceed 5 percent of such member's basic pay \n     for such pay period.\n       ``(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the amount \n     contributed by a member of the Ready Reserve for any pay \n     period for any compensation received under section 206 of \n     title 37 may not exceed 5 percent of such member's \n     compensation for such pay period.\n       ``(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     subchapter, no contribution may be made under this paragraph \n     for a member of the Ready Reserve for any year to the extent \n     that such contribution, when added to prior contributions for \n     such member for such year under this subchapter, exceeds any \n     limitation under section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986.\n\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\n\n       On page 35, line 9, insert ``, or out of compensation under \n     section 206 of title 37,'' after ``out of basic pay''.\n\n       On page 35, line 12, strike ``308a, 308f,'' and insert \n     ``308a through 308h,''.\n\n       On page 36, in the matter following line 15, strike ``on \n     active duty'' and insert ``: members on active duty; members \n     of the Ready Reserve''.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to offer an \namendment to S. 4 with my colleagues, Senator Jeffords, Senator \nBingaman, and Senator Landrieu. Of course, S. 4 is the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This \nlegislation will give the men and women of the National Guard and \nReserve the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. S. 4 \noffers this benefit to their active duty counterparts. Our amendment \nwill offer this to men and women of the National Guard and Reserve.\n  The Thrift Savings Plan is an excellent way for military families to \nsave for the future. It is not meant to take the place of a retirement \nsystem. It is a tax-deferred savings plan that will grow while a \nservice member is actually serving, unlike the delayed benefits of the \nmilitary retirement system. Furthermore, the Thrift Savings Plan is a \nportable benefit that can be rolled over into a civilian 401(k) plan, \nin the event the service member, for whatever reason, must leave \nmilitary service.\n  In my opinion, the men and women of the Guard and Reserve must be \ngiven the same opportunity to participate in this excellent savings pan \nas their active duty counterparts. Although the amount of money they \nwill be able to deposit in the Thrift Savings Plan may not be \nsubstantial at first, every dollar counts. The Thrift Savings board \nthemselves allows contributions ``as little as a dollar each pay \nperiod.''\n  With the increase in worldwide taskings, Guardsmen and Reservists are \nparticipating significantly above and beyond their mandatory one-\nweekend-a-month and two-weeks-a-year duty, their contributions will \ngrow over time. While some Guardsmen and Reservists may have savings \nplans through their civilian employers, allowing them to participate in \nthe Thrift Savings Plan allows them to contribute based on their \nmilitary earnings. For many Guardsmen and Reservists, their military \nduty has become a second job.\n\n  Since the end of the cold war, the services have increasingly relied \nupon their Reserve components to meet worldwide obligations. The active \nduty force has been reduced by one-third, yet worldwide commitments \nhave increased dramatically.\n  In recent years, thousands of Reservists and Guardsmen have supported \ncontingencies, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions around \nthe world: in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya, just \nto name a few. Guard and Reserve units responded immediately to \nrequests for assistance after Hurricane Mitch, delivering over 10 \nmillion pounds of humanitarian aid to devastated areas in Central \nAmerica.\n\n  Closer to home, Reserve and National Guard personnel answered the \ncries for help after devastating floods struck in our Nation's \nheartland. They braved high winds and water to fill sandbags, provide \nsecurity, and transport food, fresh water, medical supplies, and \ndisaster workers to affected areas. The Air Force Reserve's ``Hurricane \nHunters'' routinely fly into tropical storms and hurricanes in \nspecially configured C-130s to collect data to improve forecast \naccuracy, which dramatically minimizes losses due to the destructive \nforces of these storms.\n  As we transition into the high-tech 21st century, the Guard and \nReserve will continue to take on new and exciting roles. The Guard and \nReserve now have units performing satellite control and security \nfunctions in order to maintain our country's lead in space-based \ntechnology. And, because our country faces the increased threat \nof chemical and biological weapons, the White House, the Department of \nDefense, and Congress have joined to develop a ``Homeland Defense'' \npolicy designed to respond to threats against the United States. The \nGuard and Reserve will play a significant role in the implementation of \nthe policy, because their knowledge of local emergency response plans \nand infrastructure is critical to an effective response.\n\n  The days of holding our Reserve Component forces ``in reserve'' are \nlong gone.\n  Just who are these citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines? \nThey are doctors, they are lawyers. They are farmers, grocers, teachers \nand small business owners. They have longstanding roots in communities \nacross our great country. And, like their active-duty counterparts, \nthey have volunteered to serve. Remarkably, they must balance their \nservice with the demands of their full-time civilian jobs and families.\n  In September 1997, Secretary of Defense Cohen wrote a memorandum \nacknowledging an increased reliance on the Reserve Components. He \ncalled upon the services to remove all remaining barriers to achieving \na ``seamless Total Force.'' He has also said that without Reservists, \n``we can't do it in Bosnia, we can't do it in the Gulf, we can't do it \nanywhere.\n\n  Giving the men and women who serve in the Reserve Components the \nopportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan would carry on \nthe spirit of Secretary Cohen's Total Force policy. This amendment has \nreceived the resounding support of the Reserve Officers Association, \nthe National Guard Association of the United States, the Enlisted \nAssociation of the National Guard of the United States, and other \nmembers of the military coalition representing 5.5 million active and \nretired members.\n  The Reserve Components face many of the same challenges and dangers \nas their active duty counterparts in this time of high operations \ntempo. We should give them the same opportunity to participate in the \nThrift Savings Plan. It is important to send the right message to our \ncitizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines: that we recognize and \nappreciate their sacrifices. It's the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I, first, want to state my complete \nsupport and concurrence for the amendment which we will have tomorrow \nmorning by our distinguished colleague and member of the Armed Services \nCommittee jointly. The provisions relating to the GI bill, this \nbenefit, originated with our colleague. I thank him for his \nparticipation. He has this Senator's strong support, and I anticipate \nthe Senate's as a whole. I thank our colleague very much.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had intended to offer a joint \nresolution on the subject of the use of force in Kosovo for this bill, \nbut events have overtaken this issue as the picture is now unfolding. I \ndid want to put this joint resolution in the Record. I did want to talk \nabout it for a few minutes. I discussed it with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  The concern I have is on the repeated use of force that constitutes \nacts of war by the President of the United States without authorization \nby Congress, in violation of the constitutional provision that only the \nCongress of the United States has the authority to involve the United \nStates in war.\n  We have seen an erosion of the congressional authority in modern \ntimes on many, many occasions. Perhaps the strongest, sharpest example \nis the Korean war, a subject on which I have questioned nominees for \nthe Supreme Court of the United States, trying to get a delineation on \nthe power of the Commander in Chief under the Constitution, contrasted \nwith the authority of Congress. But where we have had the air and \nmissile strikes recently in Iraq, I raised the same question \nchallenging or questioning the authority of the President. And as it \nhas appeared in the past several days, there has been discussion of \nusing force, air-strikes, perhaps missile strikes, in Kosovo, and it \nseems to me this is a matter that ought to be decided by the Congress.\n  I do think there is a good bit to be said in support of the United \nStates participating in the air-strikes in light of what has gone on \nthere, and I shall not speak at any length. The issues are submitted in \nthis joint resolution. I\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\nwould like to engage my colleague, the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, as to his sentiments on this subject.\n  Mr. WARNER. Senator, you and I came to this marvelous institution \nroughly two decades ago, give or take a year or so. We have witnessed \non this floor spirited debates on the very issues that you raise, more \nor less circling around the War Powers Act legislation that followed \nthe war in Vietnam and legislation which, in the judgment of many, is \nquestionable to constitutional standing. I think it is time that we had \nanother debate on this issue because it is very important.\n  Mr. President, had we used force in Kosovo, it would have been the \nfourth time President Clinton has directed force against a sovereign \nnation. Now, I must say, in the course of the deliberations in \nRambouillet, France, and prior thereto, I think the administration \ntried to take an almost unmanageable situation and do the best they \ncould. Frankly, I am relieved that force at this moment is not to be \nused. I have not had the opportunity in the last 4 or 5 hours to get \nthe latest situation, given that I have been on the floor managing this \nbill. But I believe the talks are at a virtual stalemate; am I not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think the Senator is correct. It does not appear that \nthe United Nations, with the United States' participation, will engage \nin strikes.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, I think it is timely that the Senate \nwent back and, once again, as we did in years past, take a look at the \nWar Powers Act, take a look at the proposal that the distinguished \nSenator from Pennsylvania has, not by way of criticism at the moment of \nthe President, because you have two situations--one in Kosovo, and, of \ncourse, the parallel in Bosnia, and then you have Iraq.\n  I have said from time to time, as we have had deliberations among \nourselves in small groups, if anybody has a better idea how to manage \nit, come forward. They are the most complex situations that I have had \nin my tenure here in the Senate, and prior thereto in the Department of \nDefense, in terms of the complexity and the difficulty to resolve it.\n  I would encourage the Senator, and I would be happy to participate in \nthat debate at some future date.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Virginia for \nthose comments. It was 8 years ago in early January--I believe January \n10--where we had a much publicized debate on this floor about the use \nof force in the gulf war. A number of the people who are on the floor \ntoday, the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Virginia, and I, \nparticipated in that debate with our distinguished then-colleague, \nSenator Nunn.\n  I do believe, as I have said, there is much to recommend of U.S. \nparticipation in Kosovo. But I do not like to see further erosion of \nthe congressional authority. I think too often the Congress stepped \naside.\n  About a year ago this time there was a key issue about the use of \nforce against Iraq. We discussed it on the floor to some extent. We had \na winter recess. By the time we got back, the issue had not matured. \nBut force was used in Iraq in December. It was not authorized by the \nCongress. I think that the Congress ought to take a stand one way or \nanother before force is used in accordance with the Constitutional \nprovisions.\n  In the interest of brevity, Mr. President, I send this joint \nresolution to the desk and ask that it be printed since it makes a \nfuller statement on this subject.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 12\n\n       Whereas, Congress strongly supports the men and women of \n     our military forces;\n       Whereas, bomber and missile strikes constitute acts of war;\n       Whereas, only Congress has the Constitutional prerogative \n     to authorize war;\n       Whereas, the unilateral Presidential authorization of \n     military strikes, however well-intentioned, undercuts that \n     power established clearly in the Constitution for Congress to \n     make such decisions;\n       Whereas, the autonomy of Kosovo, a region in southern \n     Serbia, was abolished by the Serbian leader, Yugoslav \n     President, Slobodan Milosevic in 1989 and 1990;\n       Whereas, conflict between ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and \n     Serbian police led by President Slobodan Milosevic has \n     resulted in over 2000 deaths since the end of February 1998 \n     and has displaced nearly 400,000 people;\n       Whereas, over one-third of Kosovo's villages and an \n     estimated 4,000 homes have been deliberately damaged or \n     destroyed;\n       Whereas, the assault on the civilian population has been \n     reported to include atrocities which could be considered war \n     crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide;\n       Whereas, the international community has spoken out \n     repeatedly against Serbian human rights abuses in Kosovo;\n       Whereas, the instability in the Kosovo represents a \n     significant regional threat;\n       Whereas, Yugoslav and Serbian officials, reportedly led by \n     Slobodan Milosevic, similarly instigated, organized and \n     directed aggressive action against civilians in Croatia in \n     1991, and in Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995;\n       Whereas, peace was only restored to the region of the \n     former Yugoslavia in 1995 when Yugoslav and Serbian \n     officials, including Slobodan Milosevic, were confronted with \n     the clear resolve of the international community to use force \n     against them;\n       Whereas, on Jan. 30, 1999, the NATO allies authorized \n     Secretary-General Solana to order air-strikes anywhere in \n     Yugoslavia, if a peace settlement was not accepted by the \n     deadline of February 20, 1999 and subsequently extended to \n     February 23, 1999;\n       Whereas, the United States participation in NATO military \n     operations is important in maintaining the strength of the \n     NATO alliance generally;\n       Whereas, Congressional support and cooperation with our \n     NATO allies will send an important signal of national resolve \n     that would strengthen the ability of the United States to \n     bring the two sides together toward a peace agreement in \n     Kosovo;\n       Resolved, by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America Congress assembled, That the \n     President is authorized to conduct air operations and missile \n     strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia \n     and Montenegro) for the purpose of bringing about a peaceful \n     resolution of the conflict in Kosovo.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator departs, I think the \nRecord should reflect that in connection with the action taken against \nIraq in the fall, and then in connection with the proposed sending of \nground troops as part of the NATO force and U.S. contingent of up to \n4,000, there was confrontation with leadership in the Senate and the \nHouse in both instances. I think there has been a level--whether it is \nup to the expectations of my colleagues, it is individually for them to \nsay --a level of confrontation in both sequences. We must bear in mind \nthat under the Constitution, the President is the Commander in Chief. \nHe has the right to direct the deployment of our Armed Forces in harm's \nway when he thinks hopefully it protects the vital security interests \nof the United States, and only under those situations because \noftentimes the Congress has dispersed--it is in recess, and the like--\nand those decisions have to be made quickly. Nevertheless, we have a \ncoequal responsibility with the President regarding the welfare and the \nstate of our men and women in uniform and the circumstances under which \nthey are employed, particularly in harm's way.\n  I commend the Senator.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, by way of a very brief supplemental \ncomment, it is true that the President has authority as Commander in \nChief. When he exercises his authority in the deployment of some 4,000 \nU.S. troops, it is another question. He has a stronger claim to do that \nunder his power as Commander in Chief than he does to have air-strikes \nor missile strikes, in my opinion. Those air-strikes and missile \nstrikes are acts of war. If he deploys U.S. troops, if they go into a \nhostile situation, that may trigger the War Powers Act, which is a \nlittle different consideration with the Constitutional provision which \nauthorizes only the Congress to declare war. But I do think that we in \nthe Congress do need to consider these issues, debate them, and make \ndecisions about them. We have the authority by restraining spending in \nthe Department of Defense to stop the deployment of troops. I am not \nsaying we should do it, but I think there is too much of a tendency on \nthe part of Congress to sit back and not to make these kind of tough \ndecisions. If things go wrong, there is always the President to blame. \nIf things go right, we haven't impeded Presidential action.\n  But these raise very, very serious Constitutional issues. There is a \ncontinuing erosion. Before the President\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nuses force, we have a chance to intervene. If it is an emergency \nsituation, that is different; he has to act as Commander in Chief.\n  But we have had ample opportunity to consider this Kosovo issue. And \nit is on the back burner now. But if it reappears, I will reactivate my \nresolution.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again commend our colleague. I thank him \nfor recalling the history of the 1991 debate. I recall it well because \nI was one of the floor managers. It was legislation that I had drawn up \nin accordance with the directions of Senator Dole, then-leader. We had \na vigorous debate for some 3 days, and it is interesting. There we had \nin place a half million men and women in the Armed Forces. We had seen \nthe most atrocious form of aggression by Saddam Hussein down through \nthe gulf region, primarily Kuwait. Yet, that debate took 3 days. And by \nonly a mere margin of five votes did the Senate of the United States \nexpress its approval for the President of the United States, in the \nrole as Commander in Chief, to use force in that situation.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1771-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, today I recognize the Tukwila School \nDistrict from my home state of Washington and the district's ``New \nFriends & Families'' program.\n  The Tukwila School District has seen its ethnic diversity grow by \nmore than 1,000 percent in the last seven years. Out of the district's \n2,500 pupils, 50% are students of color, 20% are enrolled in bilingual \neducation, and all told, they speak about 30 different languages. To \nmeet the challenge of integrating this immigrant population into the \nschool system and the community, the Tukwila School District, the City \nof Tukwila, and the local Rotary Club created ``New Friends & \nFamilies.'' It is a one-night, once a year program designed to engage \nthese hard-to-reach immigrant and refugee students and their families \nto make them aware of community services and to encourage parental \ninvolvement in their children's education.\n  Clearly, when more than 20% of Tukwila's students are unfamiliar with \ntheir new surroundings, they face a serious impediment to quality \nlearning. The ``New Friends & Families'' program has met this challenge \nhead on with local creativity, local initiative, and local resources. \nThis shows that local communities know best how to deal with unique \nlocal problems. By teaming up with local government and local \nbusinesses, the school district has found innovative ways to turn its \nchallenges into successful education.\n  It is programs like ``New Friends & Families'' that illustrate that \nlocal innovation works in our schools. The answer to improving our \nlocal schools is not more intrusion and red tape from Washington, DC \nbureaucracies but rather, more freedom and more flexibility for local \neducators to use federal resources to meet the unique needs of each \ncommunity in teaching our kids. During last week's recess, I visited \nFoster High School in the Tukwila District and presented my first \n``Innovation in Education Award'' to Superintendent Michael Silver in \nrecognition of the creative work he and his district have accomplished \nthrough ``New Friends & Families.''\n  To recognize the importance of local communities in educating our \nchildren, I will be presenting this ``Innovation in Education Award'' \nonce a week to recognize individuals, schools, and educational programs \nin Washington state that demonstrate the importance of local control in \neducation. I will also take to the floor of the Senate every week to \nshare with my colleagues these examples of locally driven successes in \neducation in an effort to remind all of us working here in Washington, \nDC that local communities really do know best.\n  For the past 35 years, Washington, DC's response to crises in public \neducation has been to create one new program after another--\nsystematically increasing the federal role in classrooms across the \ncountry. While the federal government has a role in targeting resources \nto needy populations and in holding schools accountable for results, it \nshould not tie the hands of districts like Tukwila. That only serves to \nstifle the local innovation that is fundamental to educational success. \nI have long been an advocate of local control in education and I plan \nto introduce legislation this spring that will transfer more control \nfrom federal agencies back to local educators where it belongs.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Jeffords and Mr. Specter pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 445 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1773-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1773-S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT OF '96\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is \nanother year older and another year stronger. As Congress recognizes \nthe third anniversary this month, it now becomes appropriate to reflect \non some of the Act's goals and on some of its accomplishments.\n  First, let me remind my colleagues that the Telecommunications Act \nwas 10 years in the making. It took time for Congress to understand \nexactly what was needed to reach consensus and balance among all \nsectors of the industry and to update America's telecommunications \npublic policy. Congress took a deliberate path to make sure that, at \nthe end of the day, consumers would have new and real choices. Time is \nstill needed before passing final judgment, but clearly the Act has \nproduced positive, tangible results.\n  I am proud to say that I worked closely with Senator Pressler, then \nthe Chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator Stevens, Senator \nHollings, and others on the act. It took time, it took patience, it \ntook compromise. But in the end, the act boldly embodied Congress' \nvision for competition and for choice. More choices and better choices \nin a new age of communication.\n  When the act was drafted, a number of delicate balances were struck \nto transform our monopolistic market into many competitive ones. The \nbottom line for Congress was based on a simple principle: consumers \nbenefit from competition. As simple as this sounds, creating \ncompetition in the local telephone market is a fairly complicated \nprocess. Competitive carriers require things like collocation, dialing \nparity and unbundled network elements. Congress knew it would not be \neasy. That is why the act was structured to provide a centerpiece, a \nset of instructions on ways for opening the local markets to force \ncompetition.\n  Mr. President, the act is working. Americans are beginning to see the \nfruits of the seeds sown three years ago.\n  Many critics point to the lack of local competition or the absence of \nincumbent local carriers in long distance as the only way to measure or \ngrade the bill. This is wrong. Consumer choices, new choices, and new \ntechnologies are the true tests of success.\n  As far as local competition goes, several state public utility \ncommissions are working closely and collaboratively with incumbents and \nnew entrants. A multitude of competitors have gained authority to \nprovide local telephone service. This choice is a reality for \nbusinesses nationwide, and it will be a reality for residents too--not \njust for basic dial tone but for advanced services such as broadband \naccess to the Internet. It takes significant capital and commitment to \nbuild the necessary infrastructure, but numerous companies and Wall \nStreet are answering the challenge by investing billions of dollars to \nbuild this foundation for competition. This level of resource \ndeployment does not happen overnight, but it is happening, and in ways \nCongress intended--with cable television companies revamping their\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nnetworks to provide two-way telephone service and with utilities and \nfixed wireless companies getting into the business. In fact, I would \nsay this shifting of assets in under three years is a fitting testament \nto the act's ability to move America's telecommunications policy \nforward--a true commitment and investment by Wall Street.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe the act's goals of local competition \nand consumer choices will be fulfilled, and America will be better off. \nThe best way to ensure that investment continues is to keep the law in \nfull force.\n  When the act passed in 1996, Congress also knew that it would take a \nwhile to sort out the rules to produce local competition. More \nimportantly, Congress knew that whatever rules the FCC adopted would be \nchallenged in court. Congress was correct on both counts. This does not \nmean the law is flawed. To the contrary, this reflects the complexity \nof the issues and the intensity of the competition. Remember, it took a \ndecade to write the law, and it will take time to implement it. I \nbelieve, though, that the majority of Members who worked on the act \nunderstand its success cannot be measured over a one or two year \nperiod. Courtroom battles did cloud the course toward local \ncompetition. This litigation did slow the pace for customer choice, but \nI am pleased to report that just 2 weeks ago the Supreme Court upheld \nmost of the FCC's local telephone interconnection rules and affirmed \nthat the local phone companies must open their markets in a meaningful \nway. It is my hope that opportunities for competition will now move \nforward swiftly and be afforded a proper chance to flourish in the \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, Americans today are witnessing a convergence of \ntechnologies that was but a dream in 1996. Cable lines will provide \nAmerican households with local telephone service and high speed \nInternet access. This is good. Traditional telephone companies will \noffer cable video service. This is good. More Americans are using \nwireless phones for personal and professional convenience. This is \ngood. More Americans have personal computers with an ever-growing range \nof capabilities. This is good. The Internet is exploding as a means of \ncommerce, research, or for just saying hello to a far-away friend. This \nis good. Television viewing will become an interactive experience with \ndigital transmission, enabling consumers to personalize their own video \nprogramming or to go directly to a web site. This is good.\n  Mr. President, all of these significant and solid activities tells me \nsomething--Congress got it right 3 years ago. Patience will lead to \nother applications in the future that I, and some of my other \ncolleagues, cannot even imagine right now. Mr. President, this is the \nkind of communications marketplace Americans deserve.\n  During this continued period of transition, it will be important for \nCongress to make sure that the Federal Communications Commission is \nproperly structured. That it has the right tools to foster and further \nthe ongoing evolution. Chairman Kennard's analogy--old regulatory \nmodels are a thing of the past, much like the old, black rotary \nphones--rings true. The FCC indeed must change, and Congress should \nstart empowering the FCC rather than criticizing its individual \ndecisions.\n  Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act is beginning to deliver the \nbenefits of competition to the American consumer. The process of \nachieving the act's central goals is well on its way. I do not believe \nany of us want to turn back the clock to 1996 and take away all the new \ntechnologies, new companies, and new choices that have emerged and are \nnow coming our way. Let's not put stumbling blocks on this path to \nprogress. Let's keep America moving forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1773-3", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE SANDRA K. STUART ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF \n                    DEFENSE FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the outstanding work of the Honorable Sandra K. Stuart as the \nAssistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. After nearly \nfive years in this position, Ms. Stuart is leaving government service \nto pursue other opportunities in the private sector. She definitely \nwill be be missed by many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  I have enjoyed working with Ms. Stuart on a wide range of matters \naffecting the Department of Defense. I always found her to be extremely \nknowledgeable and very effective in representing the Department's \nviews. Despite the sometimes contentious nature of national security \nmatters, Ms. Stuart always maintained a friendly and constructive \napproach to her work which served our Nation very well.\n  Ms. Stuart had the difficult tasks of coordinating the Department of \nDefense's legislative agenda. She has deftly balanced a wide range of \nDefense-related issues, including Bosnia, missile defense, health care, \nreadiness, acquisition reform, and modernization. Because Ms. Stuart \nearned the trust and confidence of those with whom she worked, she was \nable to promote the Department's views very effectively in Congress.\n  Ms. Stuart's experience with the Congress predated her current \nposition as the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Legislative Affairs. \nBefore joining the Department of Defense in 1993, Ms. Stuart served as \nChief of Staff to Representative Vic Fazio of California who recently \nretired from Congress. In addition to managing his Congressional staff, \nMs. Stuart handled appropriations matters before the House Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Ms. Stuart's legislative experience also includes work as an \nAssociate Staff Member of the House Budget Committee and as the Chief \nLegislative Assistant to Representative Bob Matsui of California.\n  Ms. Stuart is a graduate of the University of North Carolina at \nGreensboro and attended the Monterey College of Law. She is the mother \nof two sons, Jay Stuart, Jr. and Timothy Scott Stuart. She is married \nto D. Michael Murray.\n  Ms. Stuart earned the respect of every Member of Congress and their \nstaffs through hard work and her straightforward nature. As she now \ndeparts to share her experience and expertise in the civilian sector, I \ncall upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her \noutstanding and dedicated public service and wish her all the very best \nin her new challenges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1774-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1774-S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Some ``surplus''!\n  Congress and the Administration have been BUSILY creating new federal \nprograms which in turn appear to absorb more taxpayer money than \nproduce desired benefits for the American people. If we continue with \nthis spend--spend--spend mentality, the American people's average \nportion of the federal debt will further escalate from its present sum \nof $20,650.78.\n  With these thoughts in mind, Mr. President, I begin where I left off \nin the 105th Congress:\n  At the close of business yesterday, Monday, February 22, 1999, the \nfederal debt stood at $5,617,212,277,099.84 (Five trillion, six hundred \nseventeen billion, two hundred twelve million, two hundred seventy-\nseven thousand, ninety-nine dollars and eighty-four cents).\n  Five years ago, February 22, 1994, the federal debt stood at \n$4,540,132,000,000 (Four trillion, five hundred forty billion, one \nhundred thirty-two million).\n  Ten years ago, February 22, 1989, the federal debt stood at \n$2,722,208,000,000 (Two trillion, seven hundred twenty-two billion, two \nhundred eight million).\n  Fifteen years ago, February 22, 1984, the federal debt stood at \n$1,454,396,000,000 (One trillion, four hundred fifty-four billion, \nthree hundred ninety-six million).\n  Twenty-five years ago, February 22, 1974, the federal debt stood at \n$467,489,000,000 (Four hundred sixty-seven billion, four hundred \neighty-nine million) which reflects a debt increase of more than $5 \ntrillion--$5,149,723,277,099.84 (Five trillion, one hundred forty-nine \nbillion, seven hundred twenty-three million, two hundred seventy-seven \nthousand, ninety-nine dollars and eighty-four cents) during the past 25 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1774-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1775-S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              COUNTLESS FRIENDS MOURN VINEGAR BEND MIZELL\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one doesn't lose a friend like Wilmer \nMizell without experiencing a deep and penetrating sadness. And, by the \nway, Mr. President, my reference to ``Wilmer'' just now is one of the \nfew times I have ever called him that. Sure, that's the name on his \nbirth certificate; he was officially identified as Wilmer for the very \ngood reason that Wilmer is the name given him by his parents.\n  At least 95 percent of his thousands of friends knew him as ``Vinegar \nBend'', or sometimes as just ``Vinegar''. And everybody who knew him \nloved him. (He was born in Vinegar Bend, Alabama, 68 years ago.)\n  Vinegar Bend died this past Sunday while visiting his wife's family \nin Texas. He suffered a severe heart attack some weeks ago, but had \nbounced back and was apparently feeling well until the fatal attack on \nSunday.\n  Vinegar Bend Mizell served three terms in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives from 1969 through 1974. His first wife, Nancy, was \nexceedingly popular among Members of the House and Senate until her \ndeath several years ago. He and his second wife, Ruth Cox Mizell, were \na devoted couple.\n  Mr. President, I have at hand a newspaper account regarding Vinegar \nBend's death. I ask unanimous consent that the article, published \nMonday in The Greensboro (N.C.) News and Record, headed ``Former \nBallplayer; N.C. Congressman Mizell Dies at 68'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       [From the Greensboro (NC) News and Record, Feb. 22, 1999]\n\n         Former Ballplayer, N.C. Congressman Mizell dies at 68\n\n                     (From Staff and Wire Reports)\n\n       Wilmer ``Vinegar Bend'' Mizell spent 10 years in the majors \n     and three terms in Congress.\n\n       High Point.--Former congressman and Major League Baseball \n     pitcher Wilmer ``Vinegar Bend'' Mizell died Sunday while \n     visiting his wife's family in Texas. He was 68.\n       Mizell, whose folksy, country-boy ways made him popular \n     with voters in central North Carolina and with baseball fans \n     in St. Louis and Pittsburgh, may have died from lingering \n     effects of a heart attack suffered last October while \n     attending a highs school football game, said his son, David \n     Mizell who is coach at High Point Andrews High School.\n       David Mizell's team was playing North Davidson in Welcome, \n     near the Midway community where Mizell has lived since the \n     early 1950s when he pitched for the minor league team in \n     Winston-Salem.\n       Mizell, after a 10-year career in the Major Leagues, became \n     a Davidson County commissioner and then served three terms in \n     Congress from the 5th Congressional District which included \n     Davidson and Forsyth counties. He was defeated in 1974 by \n     Democrat Stephen Neal, a year in which Republican candidates \n     nationwide suffered losses in the aftermath of the Watergate \n     scandal.\n       Mizell later held sub-cabinet posts in the Commerce and \n     Agricultural departments under President Ford and Reagan. For \n     Reagan, Mizell was the agricultural department's top lobbyist \n     in the halls of Congress.\n       Mizell was known for his flat-top haircut. His nickname \n     came from his hometown of Vinegar Bend, Ala. In the majors, \n     Mizell pitched for the St. Louis Cardinals from 1952 until \n     1960 when he was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates. He helped \n     the Pirates win the National League pennant that year. Mizell \n     pitched a losing game in the World Series that followed.\n       He finished his career with the New York Mets in 1962. His \n     career record was 90 wins and 88 losses, with an earned run \n     average of 3.85.\n       Mizell died in Kerrville, Texas, while he and his second \n     wife, Ruth Cox Mizell, were visiting her family. Besides \n     Midway, the couple also had a home in Alexandria, Va., David \n     Mizell said.\n       Funeral services will be Thursday in Midway.\n\n  (Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement of February 12, 1999, \npertaining to the impeachment proceedings, the following statements \nwere ordered to be printed in the Record:)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, in just a few moments, \neach of us will be called upon to do something that no one has done in \nAmerican history. We will be voting on two articles of impeachment \nagainst an elected President of the United States.\n  Having listened carefully to nearly 50 of our colleagues who share my \npoint of view, it is both difficult and unnecessary to attempt to \nreiterate the powerful logic and the extraordinary eloquence of many of \ntheir presentations.\n  I share the view expressed by so many that this body must be guided \nby two fundamental principles. I recognize that we are not all guided \nby these principles, but I and others have been guided, first, by this \nquestion: Has the prosecution provided evidence beyond a reasonable \ndoubt; and, second, if so, do the President's offenses rise to the \nlevel of gravity laid out by our founders in the Constitution?\n  After listening to both sides of these arguments now for the past 5 \nweeks, I believe--I believe strongly--that the record shows that on \nboth principles the answer is no--no, the case has not been proven \nbeyond a reasonable doubt, and, no, even if it had been it would not \nreach the impeachable level.\n  I also share the view expressed by many of my colleagues on the \nprocess which brought us here: an investigation by an independent \ncounsel which exceeded the bounds of propriety; a decision by the \nSupreme Court subjecting sitting Presidents to civil suits--it is my \nprediction that every future President will be faced with legal trauma \nas a result--a deeply flawed proceeding in the House Judiciary \nCommittee, which in an unprecedented fashion effectively relinquished \nits obligation to independently weigh the case for impeachment; the \ndisappointing decision to deny Members of the Senate and the House the \nopportunity to vote on a censure resolution, even though I believe it \nwould be supported by a majority in both Houses; and finally, the \nbitterly partisan nature of all the actions taken by the House of \nRepresentatives in handling this case.\n  But as deeply disappointed as I am with the process, it pales in \ncomparison to the disappointment I feel toward this President. Maybe it \nis because I had such high expectations. Maybe it is because he holds \nso many dreams and aspirations that I hold about our country. Maybe it \nis because he is my friend. I have never been, nor ever expect to be, \nso bitterly disappointed again.\n  Abraham Lincoln may have been right when he said, ``I would rather \nhave a full term in the Senate, a place in which I would feel more \nconsciously able to discharge the duties required, and where there is \nmore chance to make a reputation and less danger of losing it, than 4 \nyears of the Presidency.''\n  Maybe it is because of my disappointment that I was all the more \ndetermined to help give the Senate its chance to make a reputation, as \nLincoln put it, at this time in our Nation's history.\n  The Senate has served our country well these past 2 months. And I now \nhave no doubt that history will so record. There are clear reasons why \nthe Senate has succeeded in this historic challenge.\n  First is the manner in which the Chief Justice has presided over \nthese hearings. We owe him a big, big debt of gratitude. He has \npresented his rulings with clarity and logic. He has tempered the long \nhours and temporary confusion with a fine wit. In an exemplary fashion, \nhe has done his constitutional duty and has made it possible for us to \ndo ours.\n  The second reason is our majority leader. Perhaps more than anyone in \nthe Chamber, I can attest to his steadfast commitment to a trial \nconducted with dignity and in the national interest. He has \ndemonstrated that differences--honest differences--on difficult issues \nneed not be dissent, and in that end the Senate can transcend those \ndifferences and conclude a constitutional process that the country will \nrespect, and I do.\n  Third is our extraordinary staff--the Chaplain, my staff in \nparticular, Senator Lott's staff, the floor staff, the \nParliamentarians, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of the Senate. \nThey have served us proudly. Their professionalism and the quality that \nthey have demonstrated each and every hour ought to make us all proud.\n  Finally, if we have been successful, it has been because of each of \nyou--your diligence, your deportment, your thoughtful arguments on \neither side of these complex, vexing questions. This experience and \neach of you--each of you--have made me deeply proud to be a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Growing up in South Dakota, I learned so much, as many of us have, \nfrom relatives and from the people in\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nmy hometown, and my parents especially. Something my father admonished \nme to do so many, many times in growing up is something I still \nremember so vividly today. He said, ``Never do anything that you \nwouldn't put your signature on.'' I thought of that twice during these \nproceedings--once when we signed the oath right here, and again last \nnight when I signed the resolution for Scott Bates.\n  I will hear Scott Bates' voice when I hear my name called this \nmorning. My father passed away 2 years ago. He and Scott are watching \nnow. And I believe they will say that we have a right to put our \nsignature on this work, on what we have done in these past 5 weeks, for \nwith our votes today we can now turn our attention to the challenges \nconfronting our country tomorrow. And, as we do, I hope for one thing: \nThat we will soon see a new day in politics and political life, one \nfilled with the same comity and spirit that I feel in the room today, \none where good governance is truly good politics, one which encourages \nrenewed participation in our political system. It is a hope based upon \na fundamental belief which is now 210 years old, a belief that here in \nthis country with this Republic we have created something very, very \nspecial, a belief so ably articulated by Thomas Paine as he wrote \n``Common Sense.''\n\n       The sun will never shine on a cause of greater worth. This \n     is not the affair of a city, a county, a province, or a \n     kingdom, but of a continent. This is not the concern of the \n     day, a year, or an age.\n       Posterity is are virtually involved in the contest, and \n     will be more or less affected even to the end of time by the \n     proceedings now.\n\n  So it is as we cast our votes today and begin a new tomorrow.\n  Each of us understands that the decision we must make is the most \ndemanding assigned to us, as Senators, by the Constitution. The Framers \ndid not believe it a simple matter to remove a President. They did not \nintend that it occur easily.\n  Only a certain class of offenses--treason, bribery and other high \ncrimes and misdemeanors--could justify the President's removal. Only a \nsupermajority--two-thirds of the Senate--could authorize it.\n  The Framers made as plain as they could that each Senator must judge, \non all the circumstances of the case, whether the facts support this \nextraordinary remedy.\n  As I look at this case, I am compelled to consider it from beginning \nto end--from the circumstances under which the House fashioned and \napproved the articles, to the trial here in the Senate when the House \npressed its arguments for conviction. And I find a case troubled from \nbeginning to end--one marked by constitutional defects, inconsistencies \nin presentation, surprising concessions by the Managers against their \nown position, and even damage done to that position by their own \nwitnesses.\n  In short, the case I have seen is one that I do not believe can bear \nthe weight of the profound constitutional consequences it is meant to \ncarry.\n  Its constitutional defects began in the House.\n  Rather than initiating its own investigation, and making its own \nfindings, the House rested on the referral from Independent Counsel \nKenneth Starr.\n  Never before has the House effectively relinquished its obligation to \nindependently weigh the case for impeachment.\n  But this time it did, relinquishing that obligation to Mr. Starr.\n  Mr. Starr's 454-page referral became the factual record in the House. \nThe arguments he made in that referral served almost exclusively as the \nbasis for the articles prepared and voted by the House.\n  The House called no independent fact witness. The only witness was \nMr. Starr. And it is telling that Mr. Starr's own ethics adviser, \nProfessor Sam Dash, resigned his position with the Office of \nIndependent Counsel to protest the improper role played by Mr. Starr in \nthe impeachment process.\n  The House proceedings set a dangerous constitutional precedent, and \nthe decision to follow this course has reverberated throughout the \ntrial here in the Senate.\n  Because Mr. Starr carried the case in the House, the House did not \ndevelop or explain its own case until the time came to prepare for \ntrial in the Senate. Those explanations, when they came, were replete \nwith inconsistencies--not technical or minor inconsistencies, but \nrather inconsistencies that struck at the heart of their position.\n  On the one hand, the Managers charged the President with serious \ncrimes. Yet, they also argued that they should not be required to prove \n``beyond a reasonable doubt'' that the President committed those \ncrimes--that they need not meet the standard that applies throughout \nour criminal justice system.\n  On the one hand, the Managers acknowledged that the House rejected an \narticle based on President Clinton's deposition in the Jones case. Yet, \nthroughout their presentations, including their videotaped presentation \non February 6, they repeatedly relied on the President's statements in \nthat civil deposition.\n  On the one hand, the Managers insisted that the record received from \nthe House provided clear and irrefutable evidence of the President's \nguilt. Yet, one Manager declared that reasonable people could differ on \nthe strength of the case, and another stated that he could not win a \nconviction in court based on that record.\n  On the one hand, the Managers originally claimed a record so clear \nthat the House was not required to call a single fact witness--other \nthan Mr. Starr. Yet, in the Senate, they insisted that their case \ndepended vitally on witnesses.\n  In the end, the Senate authorized the deposition of witnesses, two of \nwhom--Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan--were central to the core allegations \nof perjury and obstruction of justice. These were witnesses identified \nby the House--witnesses the Managers expected to help support their \ncase.\n\n  This is not, however, how it turned out.\n  In the final blow to the case for removal brought by the Managers, \nthose very witnesses provided the Senate with clear and compelling \ntestimony--in the President's defense.\n  It cannot have escaped many of us that the defense showed more and \nlonger segments of this testimony than the Managers who sought these \nwitnesses in the first place.\n  What did Ms. Lewinsky say about the false affidavit she filed in the \nJones case? That she never discussed the contents with the President. \nThat she thought she might be able to file a truthful, but limited \naffidavit and still avoid testifying. That she had reasons completely \nindependent from the President's for wanting to avoid testimony. That \nthe President did not ask her to lie or promise her a job for her \nsilence.\n  What did Ms. Lewinsky say about the return of the gifts given to her \nby the President? That she raised with the President whether she should \nturn the gifts over to Ms. Currie. That she recalls that the President \nmay have advised her to turn them all over to the Jones lawyers. That \nshe told an FBI agent of this advice, but it somehow was omitted from \nthe Independent Counsel's investigative report. That six days before \nher White House meeting with the President, she had already made an \nindependent decision to withhold gifts from her own lawyer.\n  What did Ms. Lewinsky and Mr. Jordan say about the job search for Ms. \nLewinsky? That it was never connected to the preparation of her \naffidavit, much less conditioned on her making any false statements to \na court.\n  What did Mr. Jordan say about any pressure placed on the companies he \ncontacted to hire Ms. Lewinsky? That he only recommended her. That two \ncompanies he contacted would not hire her. That the third company, \nwhich did hire her, did so on the strength of an interview in which she \nmade a strong personal impression--much like the one she made to the \nManagers in their first meeting with her.\n  These witnesses--the House's witnesses--made it impossible, I \nbelieve, for the Managers to sustain a case already weakened by a \ndefective House process, serious inconsistencies in their arguments, \nand doubts about its merits that even some of the Managers themselves \ncandidly expressed.\n  Surely a case for removal of the President must be stronger.\n  Surely a case for conviction must be strong enough to unite the \nSenate and the public behind the most momentous of constitutional \ndecisions.\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n  Surely a case to remove the President from office must be strong \nenough to meet the high standards established with such care by the \nConstitution's framers.\n  In requiring that the Senate remove only for ``high'' crimes and \nmisdemeanors, the framers acted with care. As the House Judiciary \nCommittee stated in its Watergate report 25 years ago, ``[I]mpeachment \nis a constitutional remedy addressed to serious offenses against the \nsystem of government.'' Its purpose is to protect our constitutional \nform of government, not to punish a President.\n  It is for this reason that the framers made clear that not all \noffenses by a Chief Executive are ``high'' crimes--and that even a \nPresident who may have violated the law, but not the Constitution, \nremains subject to criminal and civil legal process after he or she \nleaves office.\n  Whatever legal consequences may follow from this President's actions, \nthe case made by the House Managers does not satisfy the exacting \nstandard for removal.\n  For all of these reasons, I will vote to acquit on both articles.\n  This is my constitutional judgment about whether the Senate should \nremove the President from office. My personal judgment of the \nPresident's actions is something altogether different, reflecting my \nvalues and those of South Dakotans and millions of Americans.\n  Like them, I am extraordinarily disappointed, and angered, by the \nPresident's behavior. Since I have long considered the President a \nfriend, my own sense of betrayal could not run more deeply.\n  There is no question that the President's deplorable actions should \nbe condemned by the Senate.\n  I fervently hope that the Senate will do what the House would not--\npermit the people's elected representatives to express themselves and \nreflect their constituents' views on the President's conduct, for the \nbenefit of our generation and those still to come.\n  So let us proceed now to a vote and resolve this constitutional task \nafter these long and arduous months. Then the time will have come to \nreturn to the urgent work of the country.\n  When we do, I believe that all of us--members of the majority and \nmembers of the minority, however we choose to cast our votes--will be \nable to agree on this:\n  That in 1999, 100 Senators acted as the Constitution required, \nhonoring their oath to do impartial justice and acting in the best \ninterests of this country they so dearly love.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, I do not intend to give a \ncomprehensive statement, nor do I intend to use all of the time \nallotted. But I feel it is very important to answer some of the points \nthat have been raised. And let me deal with just a few of those.\n  When I spoke to you in a previous session here, I mentioned the cover \nstory, and said that while the cover story was not impeachable--the \ncover story which was admitted by counsel for the White House--it is a \nframework and a context in which we judge other actions.\n  Objection has been made by my friends primarily on this side of the \naisle that on occasion we have cited evidence where the President may \nnot have been truthful, and we may have raised other arguments that go \nbeyond the boundaries of the articles of impeachment as grounds for \nimpeachment. Let me hasten to add that I hope that no one would vote \nfor a conviction on anything other than the items set forth in article \nI and the items set forth in article II. If there are other activities \nthat may bear upon or indicate a pattern of conduct, that is one thing. \nBut we must make our decision on the basis of that which has been \npresented to us by the House.\n  On the other side, we have heard some very spirited and enthusiastic \nattacks on the independent counsel and on the House managers and even \non the Paula Jones case itself. Let me make just a few points.\n  No. 1, we threw Judge Alcee Hastings out of office as a judge for \nlying in a grand jury proceeding where he was not convicted. The \nobjective is not to say that you can only commit perjury when a case is \nwon or someone is convicted.\n  No. 2, the independent counsel got into this because the attorney \ngeneral felt that there were grounds to pursue the potential violations \nof law by the President in the Monica Lewinsky case. And a three-judge \ncourt agreed, and the independent counsel was assigned to pursue this.\n  Whatever you may think about what the House did, or what the Paula \nJones attorneys did, or what the independent counsel did, that is not \nthe question before us. That can be addressed, as some of my colleagues \nsaid, if there are investigations by the Department of Justice on \nimproper activities by the OIC. Let that proceed in its own realm. We \nare here to judge on the evidence before us.\n  As I said, we have a cover story. We have a cover story that was \nutilized regularly throughout by this President and by Monica Lewinsky.\n  Objection has been made that, while we have the clear testimony that \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton never said you should lie, he never said \nexpressly you should file a false affidavit. Well, of course, he \ndidn't. Of course, he didn't. He is a very sophisticated, very able \nlawyer. And, if you are concocting a scheme to obstruct justice, you \ndon't tell somebody who is to be part of that scheme with you that you \nshould lie under oath, that you should file a false affidavit because \nthose people might just get called to testify under oath at some point, \nas they were in this case. But Mr. Clinton didn't have to do that, \nbecause Monica Lewinsky understood very clearly that she was to stay \nwith the cover story until she was told not to. She filed the false \naffidavit that he sought. He and his counsel used it in the deposition.\n  Why was it filed? To keep him from having to testify truthfully in \nthe deposition. Was he surprised by it? I do not believe it has one \niota of credibility to say that after he went out and procured that \nfalse affidavit, he didn't know that his attorney was going to use it, \nand he was not going to rely on it. He got her to do the felonious deed \nof filing a false affidavit so he could avoid the danger of having to \nlie himself in a deposition.\n  Mr. Clinton didn't engage in a conspiracy with his lawyer, Mr. \nBennett. We hear about the one-man conspiracy. No. He foisted that on \nhis attorney. And Mr. Bennett, when he found out about the falsity of \nthat affidavit, had to do what no attorney ever wants to do--he had to \nwrite a letter to the judge, and say, ``Disregard it. Disregard it. I \nwas part, inadvertently, of a scheme to defraud the court.'' And you \nnotice he is not in the case any longer. He could not be part of that.\n  We know that Mr. Clinton enlisted his loyal secretary to violate the \nlaw to go pick up gifts, and she and Monica Lewinsky, once again, \ncommitted felonies to continue the story to protect the President. And \nthe gifts wound up under Betty Currie's bed.\n  Mr. Clinton went to Betty Currie on a Sunday and 2 days later and \ntold her things that he hoped she would say before the grand jury. He \ntold his other subordinates things that he hoped they would say. He \neven trashed her when it appeared that she might be a hostile witness.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I suggest to you that when you \nhave this clear-cut evidence of a scheme carried out with direct \nevidence, testimony of Monica Lewinsky and others, Betty Currie and his \nsubordinates, an Audrain County jury would not have any trouble finding \nhim guilty of tampering with a witness or obstructing justice.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chief Justice and fellow Senators, I appreciate \nthis proceeding. And I appreciate the process we have gone through. I \nhope my remarks will be in the spirit of deliberation, and that some of \nwhat I say will be of value to you.\n  If there was a mistake made in this case, it is that we have treated \nthis more like a piece of legislation than a trial. It probably would \nhave been better to have just allowed the House to have a week or 8 \ndays to present evidence and the other side present their evidence and \nthen vote and we would have been out of here. As it is, we have been \ninvolved in the managing of it. And I have been impressed that together \nwe have somehow gotten through it in a way that I think I can defend. \nIt is marginal, but I think we have conducted a trial that I feel we \ncan defend.\n\n[[Page S1778]]\n\n  The impeachment came from the House so we have to have a trial and a \nvote, in my opinion. Judging on matters like this is not easy, but we \nall have had to do it. Juries make decisions like this every day. The \nPresident has to grant pardons and make appointments and remove \nappointments. Senators have to vote on nominations and so forth. I have \nhad the adventure of appearing before Senators judging me on a previous \noccasion. And now I am in this body and the other day the Chief Justice \ndeclared that we were all a court, and I thought, ``My goodness, I am a \nFederal judge and a Senator, how much better can life get than that?''\n  Now, someone suggested that this is a political trial. But the more \nwe make it like a real trial, the better off we are going to be and the \nbetter the people are going to like it and the more they will respect \nit. Our responsibility is to find the facts, apply the Constitution, \nthe law, and the Senate precedent to those facts. And precedent is \nimportant. We should follow it unless we clearly articulate a reason to \nchange. Unless we do so we are failing in our duty. If we want to \nchange our precedent, we obviously have that power. But we don't come \nat this with a blank slate since the 1700s and Federalist 65. We have \nhad a lot of impeachments since then, and this Senate has established \nsome precedent during that time. I think the dialogue between Madison \nand Mason suggests a somewhat different view of things than Federalist \n65, in the mind of many. But I would just say to you we have had \nimpeachment trials of Judges Claiborne, Nixon and Hastings since then. \nThat is our precedent, in recent years, about what we believe are our \nlaws and how they should be interpreted.\n  I would say this about the case. Others may see it differently. But \nwith regard to the obstruction article, I might have a bit of a quibble \nwith the way the case was presented. I think there was a lot of time \nand effort spent on trees and not enough on the plain forest. Let me \njust say to you why I believe the proof of obstruction of justice is so \ncompelling, beyond a reasonable doubt, to a moral certainty. And that \nis, because the President received interrogatories, he got a subpoena \nto a deposition, and he knew his day was coming. He knew he was going \nto have to tell the truth or he was going to have to tell a lie, and it \nwasn't going away.\n  He tried to avoid the day. He went all the way to the Supreme Court \nto try to stop that case from going forward, and the U.S. Supreme Court \nunanimously ruled ``No, you don't get special privileges. You have to \ngo forward with the case.'' So, here he is having to do something. If \nhe states he did not have a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, \nif he files an answer to an interrogatory, which he did in December, in \nwhich he flatout stated that he had never had sex with a State or \nFederal employee in the last decade, that would be false. He filed such \na false answer to a lawful interrogatory.\n  Then he is at a deposition, and what happens at the deposition? His \nattorney tries to keep him from being asked about Monica Lewinsky. They \nproduce her affidavit and the attorney says that the President has seen \nthat affidavit and had the opportunity to study it. The President \ntestifies later in that deposition: It is ``absolutely true.'' That is \nwhen it all occurred, right there, and talking with Monica beforehand \nwas critical because if she didn't confirm the lie he was going to tell \nhe couldn't tell it. She wanted a job and the President got it for her. \nIf they didn't submit the Lewinsky affidavit, the President was going \nto be asked those questions. If they talked about the gifts, the cat \nwas going to be out of the bag. It is just that simple. The wrong \noccurred right there.\n  Then, when he left that deposition, he was worried. He called Betty \nCurrie that night, right after that deposition, the same day, because \nhe knew he had used her name and she was either going to have to back \nhim up or he was in big trouble. So, he coached her. That is what it is \nall about. You can talk about the facts being anything you want to, but \nthat is the core of this case and it is plain and it is simple for \nanybody to see who has eyes to see with, in my view. So I think that is \na strong case. The question is whether or not, if you believe that \nhappened, you want to remove him from office, and I would like to share \na few thoughts on that.\n  Having been a professional prosecutor for 12 years as U.S. attorney, \nand I tried a lot of cases myself, I really have felt pain for Ken \nStarr. I had occasion to briefly get to know him. I knew that his \nreputation within the Department of Justice as Solicitor General was \nunsurpassed. He was given a responsibility by the Attorney General of \nthe United States and a court panel to find out what the truth was. The \nPresident lied, resisted, attacked him, attacked anybody Mr. Starr \ndealt with, virtually, in seeking the truth. And Ken Starr gets blamed \nfor that, and then 7 months later we find out that the President was \nlying all the time. He was lying all the time. And somehow this is Ken \nStarr's fault that he pursued the matter? I am sure he suspicioned the \nPresident was lying but it couldn't be proven until the dress appeared \nand then we finally got something like the truth.\n  Now, one of the most thunderous statements made by counsel--I am \nsurprised it didn't make more news than it did--was the representation \nby White House counsel that judges hold office on good behavior.\n  Those of you who fight tenaciously for the independence of the \njudiciary, know that this is not the standard for removal of judges. \nThe courts have gone through it in some detail. Law reviews have been \nwritten about it. Judge Harry T. Edwards, Court of Appeals for D.C. \nCircuit, wrote in a Michigan law review that:\n\n       Under article II, a judge is subject to impeachment and \n     removal only upon conviction by the Senate of treason, \n     bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n  This is because he is a civil officer. The President, Vice President \nand Judges are civil officers of the United States. There is only one \nstandard for impeachment.\n\n  The Constitution is a marvelous document. We respect it. To do so, we \nmust enforce it as it is written. It says that civil officers, judges \nare removed for only those offenses. There are no distinctions between \nthe President and judges. Just because one official is elected and one \nis not elected, one's term is shorter, or there are more judges than \nPresidents--makes no difference--that is not what the Constitution \nsays. They face the same standard for impeachment.\n  I really believe we are making a serious legal mistake if we suggest \notherwise. If the standard is the same, then we have a problem, because \nwe removed a bunch of judges for perjury.\n  Of course, a President gets elected, but the President holds office \nsubject to the Constitution. One of the limitations on your office as \nan elected official is don't commit a high crime or misdemeanor and if \nyou commit a high crime or misdemeanor, you are to be removed. I don't \nthink there is a lot of give in this, frankly.\n  With regard to precedent, precedent is important because it helps us \nbe objective, less political, less personal and do justice fairer. That \nis what the Anglo-American common law is all about. Judges have \nestablished precedent, and judges tend to follow that precedent unless \nthere is a strong reason not to. This is important for the rule of law.\n  Perjury and its twin, obstruction of justice, do amount to \nimpeachable crimes and our precedent in the Judge Nixon case proves \nthat. I believe we set a good standard in that case, finding that \nperjury is a high crime, clearly, and we ought to stay with this \nstandard.\n  Some have argued that the House Judiciary Committee on the President \nNixon matter declared that tax evasion was not an impeachable offense \nbecause it was not directly related to one of the President's duties. I \ndon't think that is clear at all. As a matter of fact, as I recall a \nfew House Members and minority Members signed a statement to that \neffect. But let me ask you this, and think about this, if a minority on \nthe House Judiciary Committee voted on something, or Gerald Ford said \nsomething when he was in the House about impeachment, such is not \nprecedent for the U.S. Senate. It is our precedent that counts. It is \nthe precedent established by Judge Hastings, Judge Nixon, and Judge \nClaiborne that we ought to be concerned about.\n\n[[Page S1779]]\n\n  I do not believe the Constitution says that the standard for removal \nis whether somebody is a danger to the Republic's future. The \nConstitution says if you commit bribery, treason, or other high crimes \nor misdemeanors, you are out, unless there are some mitigating \ncircumstance somebody can find, but the test is not whether or not the \nofficial is going to continue to do the crime in the future. What if it \nis a one-time bribery that is never again going to happen. Mr. Ruff \nadvocated the ``danger'' standard, and it really disturbed me because \nit is not in the Constitution.\n  If we were to reject the standard we use for judges for impeachment, \nI do believe that would mean a lowering of our standards. We will not \nbe holding the President to the same standards we are holding the \njudges in this country, and I don't think the Constitution justifies a \ndual standard.\n  As a prosecutor who has been in the courtroom a lot, I am not as \ncynical as some have suggested today about the law. I have been in \ngrand juries hundreds of times--thousands really. I have tried hundreds \nof cases. I have seen witnesses personally. I have been with them \nbefore they testified and have seen them agonize over their testimony. \nI know people who file their tax returns and pay more taxes than they \nwant to, voluntarily, because they are men and women of integrity. I \nhave seen it in grand juries. I have seen people cry because they did \nnot want to tell the truth, but they told it. They filed motions to \nobject to testifying, but when it came right down to it, they told the \ntruth.\n  I believe truth is a serious thing. Truth is real and falsehood is \nreal. This is, in my view, a created universe and we have a moral order \nand when we deny the truth we violate the moral order and bad things \nhappen. Truth is one of the highest ideals of Western civilization \ncommitment to it defines us as a people. As Senator Kyl said, you will \nnever have justice in a court of law if people don't tell the truth.\n  So this is a big deal with me. I have had that lecture with a lot of \npeople who were about to testify. I believe we ought not to dismiss \nthis lightly.\n  There was a poignant story about Dr. Battalino and her conviction for \nlying about a one-time sex act and the losses she suffered. Let me tell \nyou this personal story, and I will finish.\n  I was U.S. attorney. The new police chief had come to Mobile. He was \na strong and aggressive leader from Detroit. He was an African-\nAmerican. He shook up the department, established community-based \npolicing, and caused a lot of controversy. A group of police officers \nsued him. His driver, a young police officer, testified in a deposition \nthat the chief had asked him to bug other police officers illegally. \nNot only that, he said, ``I've got a tape of the chief telling me to \nbug.''\n  It leaked to the newspapers, all in the newspapers. They wanted to \nfire the chief. The FBI was called because it is illegal to bug \nsomebody if there is not a consenting person in the room.\n  It is different with Linda Tripp. Let me just explain the law. If you \ncan remember and testify to what you hear in conversation, you can \nrecord that conversation and play it later under law of virtually every \nState in America. Maryland apparently is different.\n  Here, the driver's action would be illegal. Anyway, the young officer \nfinally, under pressure of the FBI, confessed. The lawsuit hadn't \nended. The civil suit was still going on. He went back and changed his \ndeposition and recanted. His lawyer came to me and said, ``Don't \nprosecute him, Jeff. He's sorry. He finally told the truth. He went \nback. The case wasn't over.''\n  We prosecuted him. I felt like he had disrupted the city, caused \ngreat turmoil and violated his oath as a police officer, and that we \ncould not just ignore that. The case was prosecuted. He was convicted, \nand it was affirmed on appeal.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. Chief Justice and fellow colleagues, in the \nCapitol's Mansfield Room where our Conference has met over the last few \nweeks, there is a picture of our first president--George Washington--\nwho celebrates a birthday this Monday. I was reminded that, from \nchildhood through adulthood, George Washington carried around with him \na copy of the Rules of Civility. The rules could be seen as a roadmap \nof how one should conduct himself or herself appropriately in society. \nAs the Senate began its course through uncharted waters, civility has \nbeen our goal, if not our duty. We have done our best to work together, \nto be respectful of each other's views and to do justice according to \nthe Constitution. Had we not started with this goal in mind, I fear the \ndebate would have quickly descended into rancor doing a disservice to \nour Nation.\n  In the next few minutes, I want to explain how this trial unfolded \nfor me, as well as the rationale behind some of the votes I've cast, \nincluding on the Articles of Impeachment.\n  When the historians write their accounts of the impeachment trial of \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton, I trust that, regardless of where one comes \ndown on the facts of the case, they will agree that the Senate did it \nright. We conducted a trial that was fair to all sides, correct \naccording to the Constitution and expeditious in accordance with the \nwishes of the American people. We also did our best to conduct our \ndeliberations on a bipartisan basis.\n  We began this process by taking a second and most solemn oath of \noffice: to do impartial justice. For me, as a Senator, I can think of \nno more somber and important a constitutional duty than the one that \nwas given us. Our first task was to draft a blueprint of how we would \nproceed in the trial. We met in closed session in the Old Senate \nChamber where the discussions were civil, respectful and frank on both \nsides. In the end, it was Senator Gramm of Texas, joined by Senator \nKennedy of Massachusetts, two opposite sides of the political spectrum, \nthat led us to a unanimous bipartisan agreement on how to proceed. The \nsupport of all 100 Senators was important because it opened the door to \na trial that was conducted in a professional and judicious manner and \nwithout the discord that so many of the Washington wisemen had \npredicted.\n  After hearing the opening arguments made by both sides, Senator \nRobert Byrd offered a motion to dismiss the case against the President. \nIf successful, this would have been the first dismissal of an \nimpeachment trial in our Nation's history.\n  My vote against this dismissal motion was premised on my sworn \nConstitutional obligation to hear the facts and evidence, and consider \nthe law before I rendered a decision on whether the Articles warranted \nthe President's conviction and removal from office. Indeed, this was \npart of the oath we took--to do impartial justice. The Senate would not \nhave been able to render a fair and correct judgment on the Articles \nwithout receiving and objectively assessing the wealth of evidence \npresented by the House of Representatives and the White House. In \nshort, dismissal was premature and inappropriate.\n  Consistent with our duty to consider all the evidence fully, I \nsupported an effort to allow both the House Managers and the White \nHouse the opportunity to depose a limited number of key witnesses to \nresolve inconsistencies in testimony. After reviewing the depositions, \nI supported a bipartisan motion to make all of this information--both \nthe videotapes and written transcripts--part of the permanent record so \nthat each and every American could examine the evidence and draw their \nown conclusions. I also voted to allow both the House Managers and the \nWhite House to use the videotaped deposition testimony on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n\n  Although I did support deposing a limited number of witnesses, I did \nnot support an attempt to allow Ms. Lewinsky to testify as a live \nwitness on the floor of the Senate. In my judgment, we provided the \nHouse Managers a more than adequate opportunity to present their case: \nallowing for witnesses to be deposed, for House Managers to ask any \nquestions necessary to resolve inconsistencies in testimony and to \nallow any portion of these tapes to be used on the floor to argue the \ncase against the President. Consequently, I thought it inappropriate \nand unnecessary for Ms. Lewinsky to testify on the Senate floor. \nSeventy Senators felt similarly on this issue.\n  The presentation with videotaped excerpts, rather than live \nwitnesses, allowed both sides to make their arguments cogently. In my \nopinion, witnesses questioned on the floor, under a time agreement, \nwould have made for a\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\nmore fragmented process--objections by counsel would have disrupted the \nflow of presentations considerably. I believe that our decision to \nexclude live witness testimony was appropriate, fair and improved the \nnature of closing arguments.\n  It is the same sense of obligation and a desire to maintain decorum \nthat guided me in my vote to uphold the Senate's time-tested tradition \nof deliberating impeachment trials in private. Opening the doors of the \nSenate during these final deliberations would have been a tragic \nmistake that would ignore years of precedent on this issue. For 2,600 \nyears, since the ancient Athenian lawgiver Solon, trials have been open \nand jury deliberations have been private. Throughout our own history in \nevery courthouse in America, we have open trials, we have public \nevidence, we have public witnesses, but when the jury deliberates, it \nmeets in private. Jury deliberations are held in private for the \nprotection of all parties, and to ensure for a frank and open \ndiscussion of the evidence.\n  Private jury deliberations have also been part of the Senate rules \nfor 130 years. Some argue that these rules are outdated and need to be \nrevised. However, in 1974 and 1986, when the Senate had an opportunity \nto vote on changes to these rules, it chose to leave intact the \nprecedent that the deliberations should remain closed.\n  Our private deliberations have promoted civil discussion on this \ngrave matter of impeachment. Some of the most profound and thoughtful \nstatements I've heard have come during these private meetings--where \nthe absence of cameras has had the effect of turning politicians into \nstatesmen. These private deliberations set a tone of civility and \nallowed the healing process to begin.\n  After hearing all evidence and deliberations, at the end, I voted for \nboth impeachment articles. Setting all the legal contortions aside, as \nvote against the Articles, or to acquit, would be to ratify that there \nare two sets of law in our country--one set for our citizens, and \nanother for the President of the United States. This is a conclusion I \ncould not reach or support. Therefore, my vote on both Articles says in \nthe simplest terms that no American is above the law and there must be \none law that applies to us all.\n  Today's outcome should be a surprise to no one. From the beginning, \nour two parties approached this issue in fundamentally different ways. \nWhile Democrats and Republicans agree that President Clinton committed \nvery serious offenses, the disagreement is over whether or not these \nissues rise to the level that he should be removed from office. To some \nextent, the die had been cast when the Democrat Party decided to rally \naround the President. Like President Nixon's fate was sealed when his \nparty fell against him, President Clinton's presidency was secured by \nhis party's allegiance.\n  My hope is that no future Senate will ever be required to consider \nArticles of Impeachment against the President of the United States. \nBut, if they do, I have every confidence that we have left behind an \nappropriate roadmap for them to fulfill their constitutional \nresponsibilities. I am proud of the Senate and its Members. The Senate \nshould be proud of the way it has conducted itself: we have done our \njobs right by being fair to all parties, correct according to the \nConstitution and expeditious in accordance with the wishes of the \nAmerican people.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank the leaders on both sides. In \nparticular, I would like to single out Senator Lott for his \nleadership--this has clearly been one of his finest hours as our \nMajority Leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished Senators, Daniel \nWebster once observed that a ``sense of duty pursues us ever. It is \nomnipresent like the Deity. If we take to ourselves the wings of \nmorning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, duty performed or \nduty violated is still with us. . . .'' The duty which has faced each \nUnited States Senator is the obligation to do impartial justice in a \nmatter of significant historical import with lasting consequences for \nour constitutional order--the consideration of the impeachment articles \nagainst President William Jefferson Clinton.\n  Our duty calls on us to answer a serious question--whether the \nPresident's actions warrant his removal from office. Fundamentally, in \narriving at our individual decisions, we must consider what is in the \nbest interests of the American people. The President engaged in \nconduct, that even his defenders recognize, was reprehensible and \nwrong. A bipartisan majority of the House also found that he committed \nserious, impeachable crimes.\n  So, the test for the Senate must be to do what's in the best interest \nof our nation. It is not a matter of what is easiest or cleanest. It is \na matter of what is in the immediate and long term national interest. \nThis has been, and it will continue to be, a subjective and difficult \nstandard and one which I will discuss in greater detail later in my \nremarks.\n  First, however, I wish to speak on the Senate's procedural \nresponsibility when sitting as a Court of Impeachment, the \nconstitutional law concerning impeachable offenses, and the Articles of \nImpeachment at issue in the present case; finally, I will conclude with \na discussion of whether--assuming the facts alleged have been proven--\nthe best interests of the country would be served by removing President \nClinton from office.\n\n\n                          I. The Senate's Role\n\n  Let me begin by explaining what the role of the Senate is in the \nimpeachment process.\n  Simply put, the Senate's role in the impeachment process is to try \nall impeachments. As Joseph Story wrote:\n\n       The power [to try impeachments] has been wisely deposited \n     with the Senate. . . . That of all the departments of the \n     government, `none will be found more suitable to exercise \n     this peculiar jurisdiction than the Senate.' . . . Precluded \n     from ever becoming accusers themselves, it is their duty not \n     to lend themselves to the animosities of party, or the \n     prejudices against individuals, which may sometimes \n     unconsciously induce'' the other body. In serving as the \n     tribunal for impeachments, we must strive to attain and \n     demonstrate impartiality, integrity, intelligence and \n     independence. If we fail to do so, the trial and our judgment \n     will be flawed.--Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \n     Constitution of the United States, Section 386.\n\n  In short, impeachment trials require Senators to act, wherever \npossible, with principled political neutrality. One question I have \nrepeatedly asked myself during this scandal--when faced with questions \nconcerning the interpretation of the relevant law, the process, the \ncalls for resignation, or forgiveness--has been whether I would have \ntaken the same position were this a Republican President. I have done \nthis throughout the past year I and expect many of my colleagues have \ndone the same.\n  In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in the case of United States versus \nNixon that the process by which the Senate tries impeachments was \nnonjusticiable. As a result of the Nixon decision, the Senate has a \nheightened constitutional obligation in impeachment cases. As \nconstitutional scholar Michael Gerhardt notes in his 1996 book, The \nFederal Impeachment process, ``Congress may make constitutional law--\nthat is, make judgments about the scope and meaning of its \nconstitutionally authorized impeachment function--subject to change \nonly if Congress later changes its mind or by constitutional amendment. \nThus, Nixon raised an issue about Congress's ability, in the absence of \njudicial review, to make reasonably principled constitutional \ndecisions.''\n  I believe the Senate has conducted this trial in a fair manner and \nthat we have made principled constitutional decisions. I want to \ncommend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--in particular the \nMajority Leader, Trent Lott--for the impartial and proficient manner in \nwhich we have conducted our constitutional obligation.\n  At the core of our deliberations was the tension between, on the one \nhand, our shared interest in putting this matter behind us and getting \non with the Nation's business, and, on the other hand, our interest in \naffording the President, and the weighty matter of impeachment, that \nprocess which is due and fair. While there are decisions the Senate \nreached with which I differed, I want to make clear my view that the \nSenate has ably balanced these competing interests. A fair and full \ntrial that we were once told would take one year has been completed in \nless than six weeks. The credit for this process rests with every \nMember of the Senate, with the House Managers, counsel for the \nPresident, and the Chief Justice.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n\n\n\n                      ii. the impeachment standard\n\n  Of great concern to me is what the standard should be for impeachment \nin this and future trials. The President's Counsel has argued that the \nPresident can only be removed for constituting, what Oliver Wendell \nHolmes termed in free speech cases, a ``clear and present danger.'' It \nwas contended that a President can only be removed if he is a danger to \nthe Constitution. As such, according to the President's Counsel, \nremovable conduct must relate to egregious conduct related to \nperformance in office. Even if the House's allegation--that President \nClinton committed acts of perjury and obstruction of justice is proven \ntrue--it was argued--than such behavior does not rise to impeachable \noffenses because it was private, not public, conduct. In this case an \ninappropriate sexual relation with a subordinate employee--was the \npredicate of the charged offenses.\n\n  But such a standard establishes an impossibly high bar as to render \nimpotent the impeachment clauses of the Constitution. I hope that no \nmatter the outcome of this trial, President Clinton's view of what \nconstitutes an impeachable offense does not become precedent. If it \ndoes, I fear the moral framework of our Republic will be frayed. If it \ndoes, the legitimacy of our institutions may very well become tattered. \nIt would create the paradox of being able to convict and jail an \nofficial for committing, let's say, homicide, but not to be able to \nremove that official from holding positions of public trust. Committing \ncrimes of moral turpitude, such as perjury and obstruction of justice, \ngo to the very heart of qualification for public office.\n  The overwhelming consensus of both legal and historical scholars is \nthat the Constitution mandates the removal of the ``President, Vice \nPresident, and all civil Officers of the United States''--which \nincludes federal judges--``upon impeachment by the House and conviction \nby the Senate of ``treason, bribery or other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors.'' (U.S. Const. Art. II. Sec. 4). The precise meaning of \nthis latter clause is critical to the outcome of the impeachment trial.\n  The President's advocates agree with their critics that this standard \nis the sole standard for presidential impeachment, but contend that the \n``or other'' phrase indicates that grounds for impeachment must be \ncriminal in nature because treason and bribery are crimes or acts \ncommitted against the state.\n  Such crimes or acts must be heinous, they contend, because the term \n``crimes and misdemeanors'' is preceded by the descriptive adjective \n``high'' in the impeachment clause. These advocates also claim that \nthere exists no proof of criminal wrongdoing, that we have evidence of \nonly a private affair unrelated to performance in public office, and \nthat abuse of power related to official conduct--not present here--is a \nprerequisite for impeachment.\n  Many learned scholars oppose this view. Looking at the debates in the \nConstitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787, they note that the \nConvention originally chose treason and bribery as the sole standard \nfor impeachment. George Mason argued that this standard was too \nstringent and advocated that ``maladministration'' be added to the \nlist. James Madison objected, believing that no coherent definition of \n``maladministration'' existed and that such a lenient standard would \nmake the President a pawn of the Senate. The Convention, as a result, \nsettled on the phrase ``treason, bribery or other high crime or \nmisdemeanor.'' It is clear that the phrase ``high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' was considered by the Framers to have a more narrow and \nspecific meaning and, indeed, it is a term taken from English \nprecedent.\n  Accordingly, many scholars, including Raoul Berger, the dean of \nimpeachment scholars (Impeachment: the Constitutional Problems (1973)), \ncontend that the phrase ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is a common \nlaw term of art that reaches both private and public behavior. Treason \nand bribery are acts that harm society in that they constitute a \ncorruption on the body politic. Consequently, ``other high crimes and \nmisdemeanors'' encompasses similar acts of corruption or betrayals of \ntrust, and need not constitute formal crimes. Indeed, Alexander \nHamilton in The Federalist No. 65 makes clear that impeachment is \npolitical, not criminal, in nature and reaches conduct that goes to \nreputation and character. In the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries \nthe term ``misdemeanor'' refers not to a petty crime, but to bad \ndemeanor.\n\n  History thus demonstrates that acts or conduct that demeans the \nintegrity of the office, or harms an individual's reputation in such a \nway as to engender a lack of public confidence in the office holder or \nthe political system is an impeachable offense. Justice Joseph Story, \nin his celebrated Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \nSec. 762 (1835), made this abundantly clear when he wrote that \nimpeachment lies for private behavior that harms the society or demeans \nits institutions:\n\n       In the first place, the nature of the functions to be \n     performed: The offences, to which the power of impeachment \n     has been, and is ordinarily applied, as a remedy, are of a \n     political character. Not but that crimes of a strictly legal \n     character fall within the scope of the power, (for, as we \n     shall presently see, treason, bribery, and other high crimes \n     and misdemeanors are expressly within it;) but that it has a \n     more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed, \n     political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct, or \n     gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the \n     public interests, in the discharge of the duties of political \n     office.\n\n  Even though the Framers rejected the English model of impeachment as \na form of punishment and promulgated removal as the remedy for \nconviction, most scholars contend that the Framers looked to English \nprecedent to define ``high crimes and misdemeanors.'' There is a wealth \nof evidence that a betrayal of public trust or reckless conduct that \nplaces a high office in disrepute constitutes ``high misdemeanors.'' \nThe modifier ``high'' refers to acts against the state or commonwealth. \nIn the eighteenth century, the term ``political'' also encompassed our \nmodern term of ``social.'' So conduct that harmed society as a whole, \nor denigrated the public respect and confidence in governmental \ninstitutions, constituted ``high crimes and misdemeanors.''\n  As such, both English and American officials have been impeached for \ndrunkenness, for frequenting prostitutes, even for insanity, in other \nwords private conduct that is unrelated to official acts. Such behavior \nis seen as defaming the office that the accused held and diminishing \nthe people's faith in government. Impeachment is thus seen by many \nscholars as a means of removing unqualified office holders.\n  Thus, impeachment and removal does not have to be predicated upon \ncommission of a crime. Consequently, impeachment and removal is not in \nessentially a criminal punishment, a conclusion that is also textually \ndemonstrated by the fact that the Framers expressly provided for later \nindictment and criminal conviction of an impeached and removed \nPresident.\n  A high crime and misdeameanor--according to this view--does not have \nto amount to a crime or be related to official conduct. Even if \nPresident Clinton's acts of perjury were predicated upon lying about a \nprivate sexual relation, they still must be considered high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. The fact that the underlying behavior was private in its \ngenesis is irrelevant. Such private acts demean the Office of the \nPresident, and betray public trust. Those acts therefore are \nimpeachable.\n\n  But I must emphasize that even if the President's Counsel is correct \nin that private acts unrelated to performance in office are not \nimpeachable offenses, I believe the gravamen of what President Clinton \ncommitted are public, not private, acts that are unambiguous breaches \nof public trust. Perjury and particularly obstruction of justice are \nconduct that attack the very veracity of our justice system. \n(Furthermore, I vehemently disagree that the underlying conduct was a \npurely private concern because the conduct involved a federal employee \nin a work environment).\n  Lying under oath, hiding evidence, and tampering with witnesses \ndestroy the truth-finding function of our investigatory and trial \nsystem. Perjury and obstruction of justice are particularly pernicious \nif committed by a President of the United States, who has sworn \npursuant to the oath of office to protect the Constitution and laws of \nthe United States. Whether perjury and obstruction of justice can be \nconsidered private or public acts is of no moment.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\nThey are twin ``high crimes'' harming the political order and requiring \nimpeachment and removal from office.\n  A related argument made by the President's Counsel is that a \nPresident should be held to a less stringent standard than federal \njudges in impeachment trials. Because many judges have been removed for \nconduct unrelated to performance in office, such as Judges Clairborne \nand Nixon, who were convicted and removed for perjurious statements \nunrelated to their performance in office, the President is almost \ncompelled to make this argument.\n  In essence, The President's Counsel contend that Article III's \nrequirement that judges hold office for ``good behavior'' is not simply \na description of the term of office, but a grounds for impeachment if \nviolated. Presidents--and other civil officers--are subject to the more \nstringent high crimes and misdemeanor standard.\n  Most scholars reject this view. For instance, Michael J. Gerhardt \n(The Federal Impeachment Process (1996)) testified in the House \nConstitutional Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee in November that \nthe impeachment standard of high crimes and misdemeanors applies to all \ncivil officers, including judges as well as the President. This is the \nsole constitutional ground for impeachment. Article III's good behavior \nprovision for judges simply sets the duration for judicial office \n(lifetime unless impeached). There are simply no differing standards \nfor judges and the President.\n\n\n                       iii. article one--perjury\n\n  Let me now turn to the facts of this case. The House alleges in \nArticle I that the President should be removed because he committed \nacts of perjury. The House alleges in Article II that the President \nshould be removed because he obstructed and interfered with \nthe mechanisms and duly constituted processes of the justice system.\n\n  To demonstrate why I believe it is so, it is necessary to discuss \nboth the legal standards and how the facts meet the requirements of \nthose standards. I will first discuss perjury, and, next, turn to \nobstruction of justice.\n\n\n       Article I of the Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton\n\n  In his conduct while President of the United States, William \nJefferson Clinton, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully \nto execute the office of President of the United States and, to the \nbest of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States, and in violation of his constitutional duty to take \ncare that the laws be faithfully executed, has willfully corrupted and \nmanipulated the judicial process of the United States for his personal \ngain and exoneration, impeding the administration of justice, in that:\n  On August 17, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton swore to tell the \ntruth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth before a Federal \nGrand Jury of the United States. Contrary to that oath, William \nJefferson Clinton willfully provided perjurious, false and misleading \ntestimony to the grand jury.\n\n\n      I. Statements before the Grand Jury that constitute perjury\n\n                                Overview\n\n  ``Whoever under oath . . . in any proceeding before or ancillary to \nany court or grand jury knowingly makes any false material declaration \n. . . shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five \nyears, or both.'' See 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623(a). In a prosecution for \nperjury under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623(a), the prosecution must prove the \nfollowing elements: (1) the declarant was under oath, (ii) the \ntestimony was given in a proceeding before a court of the United \nStates, (iii) the witness knowingly made, (iv) a false statement, and \n(v) the testimony was material. United States v. Whimpy, 531 F.2d 768 \n(1976). The first two elements are not at issue here because it is \nundisputed that President Clinton testified under oath before a Grand \nJury of the United States. As the discussion below reveals, the House \nManagers proved the remaining elements of perjury beyond a reasonable \ndoubt for key aspects of President Clinton's Grand Jury testimony.\n\n\n           A. Statements to Betty Currie on January 18, 1998\n\n  President Clinton committed perjury before the Grand Jury when he \ntestified falsely concerning his motivation for making five statement \nto Betty Currie. Hours after his deposition in the Jones case, \nPresident Clinton called his secretary Betty Currie and asked her to \ncome to the White House the next day, January 18. See Currie 1/27/98 GJ \nat 65-66. On that Sunday afternoon, the President made the following \nfive statements to Ms. Currie about Monica Lewinsky: (1) ``You were \nalways there when she was there, right?''; (2) ``We were never really \nalone.''; (3) ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, \nright?''; (4) ``You can see and hear everything, right?''; and (5) \n``She wanted to have sex with me, and I cannot do that.'' Id. at 71-74. \nPresident Clinton repeated these same questions and statements to Betty \nCurrie a few days later. See BC 1/27/98 GJ at 80-81. When he discussed \nhis deposition testimony regarding Ms. Lewinsky with Betty Currie on \nthese two occasions, President Clinton violated Judge Wright's strict \norder prohibiting any discussion of the Jones deposition.\n\n\n                                falsity\n\n  President Clinton lied to the Grand Jury when he testified about his \nmotivation for making these statements. When asked before the Grand \nJury about these statements to Betty Currie, the President testified \nthat he asked these ``series of questions'' in order to ``refresh [his] \nmemory about what the facts were.'' See WJC 8/17/98 GJ at 131. He \nfurther testified that he wanted to ``know what Betty's memory was \nabout what she heard, what she could hear'' and that he was ``trying to \nget as much information as quickly as I could * * * [a]nd I was trying \nto figure [it] out * * * in a hurry because I knew something was up.'' \nSee WJC 8/17/98 at 56. Immediately following extensive questioning on \nthis issue, a different prosecutor from the Office of Independent \nCounsel asked the President that ``[i]f I understand your current line \nof testimony, you are saying that your only interest in speaking with \nMs. Currie in the days after your deposition was to refresh your own \nrecollection.'' (Emphasis added.) See WJC 8/17/98 GJ at 141-142. \nPresident Clinton answered: ``Yes.'' Id.\n  President Clinton's testimony that he was ``only'' trying to \n``refresh [his] memory about what the facts were'' is perjury because a \nperson cannot ``refresh'' his memory with statements and questions that \nhe knows are false. Each of President Clinton's five statements to \nCurrie is either an outright lie or extremely misleading. President \nClinton knew the facts of his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, and he \nknew his statements to Betty Currie were false. By definition, these \nfalse questions and statements could not have helped President Clinton \naccurately refresh his memory.\n  In addition, Betty Currie could not possibly have known the answers \nto some of these questions. For example, how could Betty Currie have \nknown whether the President ever ``touched'' Ms. Lewinsky or whether \nMs. Currie was ``always there when [Ms. Lewinsky] was there?'' Common \nsense defies the President' explanation: if one is trying to refresh \nhis memory or gather information quickly, he does not ask questions of \na person to which the person could not know the answers. The fact that \nBetty Currie could not have known the answers to these questions \nfurther undermines President Clinton's testimony that he was trying to \nrefresh his memory or gather information quickly.\n  If the President was merely trying to refresh his recollection or \ngather information quickly why did he repeat these questions and \nstatements to Currie a few days later? As the House Managers noted \nduring the trial, instead of asking a series of specific leading \nquestions, why didn't President Clinton ask Currie a general question \nabout what she recalled about Ms. Lewinsky's activity at the White \nHouse? Moreover, President Clinton's blatant violation of Judge \nWright's order prohibiting any discussion of the Jones deposition casts \nfurther doubt on his testimony on this issue. The President's testimony \nregarding his motivation for these statements is false. He did not make \nthese statements to refresh his recollection. Rather, as the following \nsection explains, the President made these statements to Ms. Currie in \norder to influence her potential testimony in the Jones suit and to \ninfluence her possible responses to the media.\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\n\n\n\n                               Knowingly\n\n  In a perjury case under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623, the prosecution must \nprove that the defendant ``knowingly'' made the false statement. Under \nthis statute, ``knowingly'' means merely that the defendant made the \nfalse statement ``voluntarily and intentionally, and not because of \nmistake or accident or other innocent reason.'' United States v. \nFawley, 137 F.3d 458, 469 (7th Cir. 1998); United States v. Watson, 623 \nF.2d 1198, (7th Cir. 1980).\n  The President knowingly made these false statements about his \nmotivation for speaking to Betty Currie after his deposition. He did \nnot make these statements by ``mistake or accident or other innocent \nreason.'' Rather, President Clinton lied about his motivation to \nconceal his true purpose in making these statements to Currie. In \nreality, President Clinton was attempting to corroborate his deceitful \ntestimony in the Jones deposition with a prospective witness. When he \nmade these statements to Currie, the President knew that she was a \nlikely witness in the Jones case because he repeatedly referred to \nCurrie when asked about Ms. Lewinsky by the Jones lawyers. See Clinton \n1/17/98 Dep. at 58. President Clinton actually told the Jones lawyers \nto ``ask Betty'' in response to one question in the deposition. Id. at \n64-66. In fact, Betty Currie was subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers only \ndays after the President's deposition.\n  Moreover, in addition to influencing a prospective witness in the \nJones suit, the President had another motivation for coaching Ms. \nCurrie: She was a probable target of press inquiries about this \ncontroversy. In fact, a prominent reporter from Newsweek had already \ncalled Currie on January 15, 1998 and asked her about Ms. Lewinsky. See \nCurrie 5/6/98 GJ at 120-121. The President had a motive to influence \ninformation Currie might give to the media--in addition to testimony \nshe might give as a witness in Jones versus Clinton. The President \nknowingly made these statements to Ms. Currie in order to influence \nboth her potential testimony and her possible responses to the media.\n\n\n                              Materiality\n\n  ``Because the Grand Jury's function is investigative, materiality in \nthat context is broadly construed.'' United States v. Gribbon, 984 F.2d \n471 (2d Cir. 1993). Courts have consistently held that in a Grand Jury, \n``a false declaration is `material' within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] \nSec. 1623 when it has a natural effect or tendency to influence, impede \nor dissuade the Grand Jury from pursuing its investigation.'' United \nStates v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751 (2d Cir. 1994).\n  President Clinton's false statements to the Grand Jury regarding his \nJanuary conversations with Betty Currie are material to the Grand \nJury's investigation of obstruction of Justice. To determine whether \nthe President obstructed justice in the Jones case, it was critical for \nthe Grand Jury to ascertain whether President Clinton attempted to \ninfluence the testimony of Currie, a potential witness in that case. \nPresident Clinton's statements to Currie the day after his deposition \nstrongly indicate that he was seeking to influence her testimony. The \nPresident's false statements about his motivation for making these \nstatements to Currie had the ``natural effect or tendency'' to ``impede \nor dissuade the Grand Jury from pursuing its investigation'' of \nobstruction of justice in the Jones case.\n\n\n                        The President's Defense\n\n  In his trial brief, the President offers only a brief defense to this \nperjury allegation. First, the President argues that ``Ms. Currie's \ntestimony supports the President's assertion that he was looking for \ninformation as a result of his deposition'' when he made these \nstatements to Currie. See President's Trial Brief at 53. As discussed \nearlier, however, this is implausible. A person cannot accurately \ngather information by making false or misleading statements to another \nperson.\n  Second, in his brief, the President refers to Currie's Grand Jury \ntestimony in which she testified that she felt no pressure to agree \nwith the President when he made these questions and statements. See \nPresident's Trial Brief at 51-53. However, the fact that Ms. Currie \ntestified that she did not feel pressured is completely irrelevant to \nwhether the President committed perjury concerning these statements. \nPresident Clinton's state of mind--not Ms. Currie's--is at issue here \nbecause he is the one accused of perjury.\n  In sum, the House Managers proved beyond a reasonable doubt that \nPresident Clinton (1) knowingly (2) lied about his motivation for \nmaking these deceitful statements to Betty Currie (3) concerning a \nmaterial matter under investigation by the Grand Jury (4) while under \noath before a federal Grand Jury.\n\n\n  B. The nature and extent of the physical relationship with Lewinsky\n\n  Another example of perjury before the Grand Jury concerns President \nClinton's testimony that he did not engage in ``sexual relations'' with \nMs. Lewinsky even under his alleged understanding of the definition \nused in the Jones case. Even under his purported interpretation of the \nterm, however, Clinton admitted to the Grand Jury that if the person \nbeing deposed touched certain enumerated body parts of another person, \nthen that would constitute ``sexual relations.'' See WJC 8/17/98 at 95-\n96. When asked if he denied engaging in such specific conduct, Clinton \nanswered ``[t]hat's correct.'' Id.\n\n\n                                Falsity\n\n  President Clinton lied to the Grand Jury when he testified concerning \nthe nature and extent of the sexual relationship. First, human nature \nand common sense strongly undermine President Clinton's testimony. It \nis undisputed that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in \nsexual activity on at least ten occasions over the course of 16 months. \nPresident Clinton's testimony to the Grand Jury that he never touched \nMs. Lewinsky in certain areas with the intent to arouse is simply not \nbelievable given the nature and extent of their contact.\n\n  In addition, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony directly contradicts the \nPresident. She testified in detail repeatedly before the grand jury \nabout each of their sexual encounters. According to Ms. Lewinsky's \ntestimony, she and President Clinton engaged in conduct that \nconstituted ``sexual relations'' even under the President's purported \nunderstanding of the term during 10 encounters. It is important to note \nthat Ms. Lewinsky's testimonty about the extent of their sexual conduct \noccurred before the President's Grand Jury testimony made these precise \nsexual details important. Moreover, Ms. Lewinsky's friends, family \nmembers, and medical therapists corroborated her account by testifying \nto the Grand Jury that Lewinsky made near-contemporaneous statements to \nthem that President Clinton fondled her in a variety of ways during \ntheir encounters. Finally, the fact that President Clinton lied to the \nAmerican people about this tawdry affair badly undermines his \nimplausible testimony on this issue.\n\n\n                               Knowingly\n\n  As mentioned earlier, in a perjury case under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1623, \nthe prosecution must prove that the defendant ``knowingly'' made the \nfalse statement. Under this statute, ``knowingly'' means merely that \nthe defendant made the false statement ``voluntarily and intentionally, \nand not because of mistake or accident or other innocent reason.'' \nUnited States v. Fawley, 137 F.3d 458, 469 (7th Cir. 1998), United \nStates v. Watson, 623 F.2d 1198 (7th Cir. 1980).\n  President Clinton knowingly made these false statements about the \nnature and extent of his sexual relationship. He did not make these \nstatements by ``mistake or accident or other innocent reason.'' \nInstead, the President had a strong motive to lie about the extent of \nthe sexual contact in order to avoid being accused of perjury in the \nJones deposition. After Ms. Lewinsky's dress was discovered, President \nClinton could no longer deny a sexual affair. However, because he \nrepeatedly denied having ``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the \nJones deposition, the President was trapped. As mentioned earlier, the \nPresident was forced to admit that fondling Ms. Lewinsky in certain \nways would constitute ``sexual relations'' even under his purported \ninterpretation of the term. Consequently, President Clinton had to deny \nsuch fondling before the Grand Jury to prevent an admission that he \ncommitted perjury in his civil deposition, despite how implausible this \ndenial is. In summary, President Clinton committed perjury before the \nGrand jury by insisting that his testimony in the Jones deposition on \nthis key matter was true.\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nPerhaps due to fear of being charged with perjury in the Jones \ndeposition, President Clinton committed the more serious offense of \nperjury before a Grand Jury.\n\n\n                              Materiality\n\n  As mentioned earlier, ``because the Grand Jury's function is \ninvestigative, materiality in that context is broadly construed.'' \nUnited States v. Gribbon, 984 F.2d 471 (2d Cir. 1993). Courts have \nconsistently held that in a Grand Jury, ``a false declaration is \n`material' within the meaning of [18 U.S.C.] Sec. 1623 when it has a \nnatural effect or tendency to influence, impede or dissuade the Grand \nJury from pursuing its investigation.'' United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d \n751 (2d Cir. 1994).\n\n  The President's false statements about the extent of his sexual \nconduct with Ms. Lewinsky are material to the Grand Jury's \ninvestigation of whether the President committed perjury in the Jones \ndeposition. In an effort to determine whether President Clinton \ntestified truthfully in his deposition, the Office of Independent \nCounsel questioned the President at length before the Grand Jury about \nthe nature and extent of his sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The \nPresident's tortured definition of sexual relations makes these details \nmaterial to whether he committed perjury in the Jones deposition. \nSimply put, if the President touched Ms. Lewinsky in certain ways, he \nis guilty of perjury in the Jones deposition. Obviously, President \nClinton's false statements on this matter had the ``natural effect or \ntendency to influence, impede or dissuade the Grand Jury from pursuing \nits investigation'' of perjury in the Jones deposition.\n\n\n                        The President's Defense\n\n  In President Clinton's trial brief, the only rebuttal to his \nallegation of perjury is that ``[t]his claim comes down to an oath \nagainst an oath about immaterial details concerning an acknowledged \nwrongful relationship.'' See Clinton Trial Brief at 44. Even this one \npithy sentence, however, is inaccurate. First, as the earlier \ndiscussion reveals, there is more evidence than an oath against an \noath. Human nature and common sense badly undermine the President's \ntestimony. In addition, Ms. Lewinsky testified in detail repeatedly \nbefore the Grand Jury about the extent of the sexual relationship, \nwhile the President reverted to his prepared statement 19 times to \navoid answering specific sexual questions. Moreover, the testimony of \nMs. Lewinsky's family, friends, and medical therapists provide \nadditional evidence of the President's perjury. Finally, the fact that \nPresident Clinton lied to the entire nation about this sordid affair--\nand only acknowledged the affair when confronted with evidence of Ms. \nLewinsky's dress--devastates his credibility on this issue.\n  In sum, the House Managers provide beyond a reasonable doubt that \nPresident Clinton (1) knowing (2) lied about the extent of his sexual \nactivity with Ms. Lewinsky (3) concerning a material matter under \ninvestigation by the Grand Jury (4) while under oath before a federal \nGrand Jury.\n\n\n                    Other Lies before the Grand Jury\n\n  In addition, I have concluded that President Clinton lied in other \ninstances before the Grand Jury. While these lies might not sustain a \nconviction for perjury in a court of law, they are profoundly troubling \nnonetheless. For instance, it strongly appears that President Clinton \nlied to the Grand Jury when he testified that he did not believe \ncertain acts that he and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in were covered by any of \nthe terms and definitions used in the Jones suite. The following \ndefinition of ``Sexual Relations'' was used at the Jones deposition:\n\n       For the purposes of this deposition, a person engages in \n     `sexual relations' when the person knowingly engages in or \n     causes contact with . . . [certain enumerated body parts] of \n     any person with the intent to arouse . . .'' (Emphasis \n     added.)\n\nAmazingly, President Clinton testified to the Grand Jury that he does \nnot believe and did not believe at the Jones deposition that this \ndefinition includes certain acts which I will not specify. Without \naddressing these lurid details, Clinton interprets ``any person'' to \nmean ``any other person'' under the definition. There is no legal basis \nfor him to interpret the definition in this manner.\n  I do not believe that President Clinton can reasonably claim this \ninterpretation. First, under the President's interpretation, one person \ncan engage in sexual relations, while his or her partner in the same \nactivity is not engaged in sexual relations. Obviously, this is an \nimplausible and absurd conclusion. Second, no reasonable person would \nhave understood the definition in the Jones suit not to encompass the \nparticular activity that President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky engaged in. \nIt is important to remember that the underlying allegation in the Jones \nsuit concerned the same particular acts involved in the Lewinsky \naffair. Why would the Jones' lawyers use a definition that did not \ninclude the very conduct alleged by their client? Given this context, \nthe President's testimony that he did not believe the definition \nincluded certain conduct is not believable.\n  Finally, the President had a clear motive to lie about his \nunderstanding of the definition of sexual relations. After Ms. \nLewinsky's dress was discovered, the President could no longer deny his \nsexual affair. However, the President repeatedly denied having ``sexual \nrelations'' with Ms. Lewinsky in the Jones deposition. President \nClinton's absurd interpretation of the definition of sexual relations \nallowed him to admit to a sexual relationship--which he had to do given \nthe dress--without simultaneously admitting to perjury in the Jones \ndeposition. Because perjury is such a difficult crime to prove, I have \nconcluded that the President might not be convicted in a court of law \nfor perjury concerning his testimony on this issue. I am convinced, \nhowever, that President Clinton lied to the Grand Jury about this \nmatter. While this testimony might not generate a conviction in a court \nof law, it was clearly contrived and is profoundly troubling.\n\n\n                IV. Article Two--Obstruction of Justice\n\n  Let me now turn to the facts of the second article of impeachment \nalleging obstruction of justice. Article Two alleges that:\n\n       In his conduct while President of the United States, \n     William Jefferson Clinton, in violation of his oath \n     faithfully to execute the office of President of the United \n     States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, \n     and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in \n     violation of his constitutional duty to take care that the \n     laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and \n     impeded the administration of justice, and has to that end \n     engaged personally, and through his subordinates and agents, \n     in a course of conduct or scheme designed to delay, impede, \n     cover up, and conceal the existence of evidence and testimony \n     related to a Federal civil rights action brought against him \n     in a duly instituted judicial proceeding.\n\n  In order to determine whether the President has engaged in the type \nof acts charged, it is important that the law be first addressed in \norder to guide us in understanding how the facts relate to the \nviolations alleged.\n  A. The Law of Obstruction of Justice:\n  1. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1503:\n  The Federal obstruction of justice statute punishes ``[w]hoever . . . \ncorruptly . . . influences, obstructs, or impedes, or endeavors to \ninfluence, obstruct, or impede, the due administration of justice.'' 18 \nU.S.C.A. Sec. 1503(a). Known as the ``omnibus clause,'' Sec. 1503(a) \n``clearly forbids all corrupt endeavors to obstruct or impede the due \nadministration of justice,'' United States v. Williams, 874 F.2d 968, \n976 (5th Cir. 1989), which is defined as ``the performance of acts \nrequired by law in the discharge of duties such as appearing as a \nwitness and giving truthful testimony when subpoenaed.'' United States \nv. Partin, 552 F.2d 621, 641 (5th Cir. 1977). The statute has \nalternatively been interpreted as forbidding ``interferences with . . . \njudicial procedure'' and aiming ``to prevent a miscarriage of \njustice.'' United States v. Silverman, 745 F.2d 1386, 1398 (11th Cir. \n1984).\n  ``There are three core elements that the government must establish to \nprove a violation of the omnibus clause of section 1503: (1) there must \nbe a pending judicial proceeding; (2) the defendant must have knowledge \nor notice of the pending proceeding; and (3) the defendant must have \nacted corruptly with the specific intent to obstruct or impede the \nproceeding in its due administration of justice.'' United States v. \nWilliams, 874 F2d 968, 976 (5th Cir. 1989). Accord United States v. \nGrubb, 11 F.3d 426, 437 (4th Cir. 1993) (adding the word ``influence'' \nto the terms ``obstruct or impede'' in the intent element).\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\n  The purpose of the statute, according to the Supreme Court is not \ndirected at the success of the corruptive effort, ``but at the \n`endeavor' to do so.'' United States v. Russell, 255 U.S. 138, 143 \n(1921) (opining that the word ``endeavor'' was used instead of \n``attempt'' in order to avoid the technical distinctions between \nattempts, which are punishable, and preparation for attempts, which are \nnot). See also United States v. Aguilar 515 U.S. 593, 599 (1995) \n(holding that while the endeavor must have the `natural and probable \neffect' of interfering with the due administration of justice, the \ndefendant's actions need not be successful, citing Russell).\n  2. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512.\n  The statute criminalizing witness tampering prohibits, inter alia, \nthe use or attempted use of corrupt persuasion or misleading conduct \nwith the intent of influencing delaying, or preventing testimony in an \nofficial proceeding, causing a person to withhold testimony or \ndocumentary evidence, alter or destroy physical evidence, evade legal \nprocess, or be absent from an official proceeding to which such person \nhas been legally summoned. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512(b). ``To sustain its \nburden of proof for the crime of tampering with a witness . . . the \nGovernment must prove . . . that the [d]efendant knowingly, corruptly \npersuaded or attempted to corruptly persuade . . . a witness; and \nsecond, that the [d]efendant . . . did so intending to influence the \ntestimony of [that witness] at the [g]rand [j]ury proceeding.'' United \nStates v. Thompson, 76 F.3d 442, 452-453 (2d Cir. 1996).\n  The witness tampering statute's prohibition of corruptly persuading \nsomeone with intent to ``influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of \nany person in an official proceeding,'' has been interpreted to mean \nexhorting a person to violate his legal duty to testify truthfully in \ncourt. United States v. Morrison, 98 F.3d 619, 630 (D.C. Cir. 1996) \n(rejecting defendant's argument that a simple request to testify \nfalsely was outside the scope of Sec. 1512(b)), cert. denied, 117 S.Ct. \n1279 (1997). As the Second Circuit explained: ``Section 1512(b) does \nnot prohibit all persuasion but only that which is `corrupt.' The \ninclusion of the qualifying term `corrupt' means that the government \nmust prove that the defendant's attempts to persuade were motivated by \nan improper purpose to . . . . A prohibition against corrupt acts `is \nclearly limited to . . . constitutionally unprotected and purportedly \nillicit activity.' United States v. Thompson 76 F.3d 442, 452 (2d Cir. \n1996) (quoting United States v. Jeter, 775 F2d 670, 679 (6th Cir. \n1985)).\n  Apart from corrupt persuasion with intent to influence a person's \ntestimony, Sec. 1512(b) proscribes engaging in misleading conduct with \nintent to influence such testimony. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512(b)(1). As one \ncourt described it, ``[t]he most obvious example of a section 1512 \nviolation may be the situation where a defendant tells a potential \nwitness a false story as if the story were true, intending that the \nwitness believe the story and testify to it before the grand jury. \nUnited States v. Rodolitz, 786 F.2d 77, 81-82 (2d Cir. 1986).\n  Some courts have interpreted conduct that was not misleading to the \nperson at whom it was directed, even if it was intended to misled the \ngovernment, as outside the scope of Sec. 1512. See e.g. United States \nv. King, 762 F.2d 232, 237-238 (2d Cir. 1985). However, the Rodolitz \ncourt distinguished the facts in King, where there was insufficient \nevidence that the witness was actually misled, from the situation where \nthe declarant makes false statements to a witness who is ignorant of \ntheir falsity. See Rodolitz, 786 F2d at 81-82 (``In giving the \nstatutory language its fair meaning, the court must find that making \nfalse statements to convince another to lie falls squarely within the \ndefinition of `engaging in misleading conduct toward another person' \nunder section 1512.'').\n  The witness tampering statute explicitly states that ``an official \nproceeding need not be pending or about to be instituted at the time of \nthe offense.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1512(e)(1). However, courts have implied \nsome state of mind element. E.g. United States v. Kelly, 36 F.3d 1118, \n1128 (D.C.Cir. 1994) (``It therefore follows that Sec. 1512 does not \nrequire explicit proof of [defendant's] knowledge . . . that such \nproceedings were pending or were about to be instituted. . . . The \nstatute only requires that the jury be able reasonably to infer from \nthe circumstances that [defendant], fearing that a grand jury \nproceeding had been or might be instituted, corruptly persuaded persons \nwith the intent to influcence their possible testimony in such a \nproceeding.'')\n  B. The Facts Related to Obstruction of Justice.\n  1. Subparts (1) and (2) of Article II:\n  In Subpart (1) of Article II, it is averred that:\n  On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly \nencouraged a witness in a federal civil action brought against him to \nexecute a sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be \nperjurious, false and misleading.\n  Subpart (2) alleges that:\n  On or about December 17, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly \nencouraged a witness in a Federal civil rights action brought against \nhim to give perjurious, false and misleading testimony if and when \ncalled to testify personally in that proceeding.\n  Subparts (1) and (2) are flip sides of the same coin. In essence, the \ntwo subparts charge that the President's 2:30 a.m. phone call to Ms. \nLewinsky on December 17, 1997, informing her of her presence on a \nwitness list in the Jones case was designed to encourage her to provide \na false affidavit in the case to avoid testifying, or failing that, \nthat she give false testimony hiding the true nature of their \nrelationship. What does the evidence show?\n  It should be recalled that the presence of Ms. Lewinsky's name on the \nJones witness list first came to the attention of the President no \nlater than December 17, 1997. See WJC 8/17/98 at 83-84. He was \ncertainly aware of the true nature of their relationship, and it can be \ninferred that he knew that knowledge of the existence of that \nrelationship would be detrimental to his case. It is also known that a \ncover story had been developed earlier to hide the relationship from \nothers that included the false representation that Ms. Lewinsky's \nvisits to the oval office were for the purpose of bringing the \nPresident papers or to visit Ms. Currie. See WJC 8/17/98 at 83-84.\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that in the same 2:30 a.m. conversation in \nwhich he informed her of the presence of her name on the witness list, \nthe President told her that she could always say she was bringing him \npapers or visiting Ms. Currie, consistent with their previous cover \nseries. See ML 2/1/99 at Cong. Rec. S1219. Ms. Lewinsky and the \nattorneys for the President have argued that since Ms. Lewinsky did in \nfact ``see'' Ms. Currie on those visits to the President and since she \nwas ``carrying'' papers, that story was not untruthful and therefore \ncould not have been designed to obstruct justice. However, that \nrationale defies logic and common sense.\n  In the first place, the purpose of the visits was not to see Ms. \nCurrie. Secondly, the papers she carried were just props, not to be \nhanded over to the President, but to falsely characterized as papers \nfor the President if questioned. Therefore, were she to testify in a \ndeposition that the purpose of her trips to the Oval Office to visit \nthe President were actually to deliver papers or visit Ms. Currie, \nthose would be false representations. The creation of a cover story \nfollowed by actions consistent with that cover story do not make the \nstory any more truthful. Therefore, the President's instruction to her \nto rely on the cover story is in fact an instruction to her to lie.\n  Other evidence supports this conclusion, not the least of which is \nthe affidavit filed by Ms. Lewinsky in the case after those discussions \nwith the President took place, an affidavit she herself later testified \nas being false. How else could she have characterized it? In that \naffidavit, Ms. Lewinsky stated that she ``never had a sexual \nrelationship with the President.'' This was false. She swore that \n``[t]he occasions I saw the President after I left my employment at the \nWhite House in April, 1996, were official receiptions, formal functions \nor events related to the U.S. Department of Defense, where I was \nworking at the time. There were other people present on those \noccasions.'' This statement too was false. She also averred that ``I do \nnot possess any information that could possibly be relevant to the \nallegations made by Paula Jones or lead to admissible evidence in this \ncase.'' Once again, this statement\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nwas false, as the President was aware, since he knew of the gifts he \nhad given to Ms. Lewinsky. See WJC 8/17/98 at 32-35.\n\n  The President repeatedly said that he thought that Ms. Lewinsky \n``could,'' and he emphasizes the word ``could,'' have been able to \ndraft a narrow truthful affidavit. See WJC 8/17/98 at 69, 116-17. The \nproblem is that although she ``could'' have been able to draft such an \naffidavit, the end product was not a truthful affidavit. Thus the \nPresident's intentional failure to prevent his attorney from using that \nfalse affidavit at his deposition provides further evidence of his \ncorrupt intention during the December 17, 1997, phone call to Ms. \nLewinsky.\n  Given these facts, the House has proven beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the President endeavored to corruptly influence the affidavit and \npotential testimony of Ms. Lewinsky in his December 17, 1997, 2:30 a.m. \ncall to her.\n  2. Subpart (3) of Article II:\n  In Subpart (3), it is alleged that:\n  On or about December 28, 1997, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly \nengaged in, encouraged, or supported a scheme to conceal evidence that \nhad been subpoenaed in a Federal civil rights action brought against \nhim.\n  This allegation relates to the obstruction of justice by Ms. Lewinsky \nand Ms. Currie in hiding gifts provided to Ms. Lewinsky by the \nPresident under the bed of Ms. Currie. The only question that needs to \nbe answered here in whether the President participated in that effort.\n  What does the evidence show? By December 28, 1997, Ms. Lewinsky had \nbeen subpoenaed to appear as a witness in the Jones case. In addition \nto demanding her appearance to testify, the subpoena also required that \nMs. Lewinsky turn over any gifts given to her by the President. See ML \n2/1/99 at Cong. Rec. S1221. Under the pretense of meeting with Ms. \nCurrie, Ms. Lewinsky went to the White House on Sunday, December 28, \n1997, to discuss her subpoena with the President. Now at the time of \nthat visit, there is no indication that the President was aware that \nparticular items had been subpoenaed by the Jones lawyers from Ms. \nLewinsky. Without the benefit of that information, the President freely \ngave Ms. Lewinsky a number of additional gifts. See ML 2/1/99 at Cong. \nRec. S1224. So when Ms. Lewinsky informed the President of that fact, \none can infer that he must have been at the very least, surprised, and \nprobably, somewhat troubled. When asked by Ms. Lewinsky at that meeting \nwhether she should hide the gifts or give them to someone else like Ms. \nCurrie for safekeeping, the President either failed to respond or said \nhe needed to think about it. See ML 2/1/99 at Cong. Rec. S1224.\n\n  Ms. Lewinsky testified that she left the White House and later \nreceived a phone call from Ms. Currie stating that she understood Ms. \nLewinsky had something for her, or, the President said you have \nsomething for me. Ms. Lewinsky immediately understood that statement by \nMs. Currie to refer to the gifts from the President she had discussed \nwith him earlier in the day. See ML 2/1/99 at Cong. Rec. S1225. She \nthen proceeded to gather up all those gifts. However, according to Ms. \nLewinsky, she unilaterally withheld some of those gifts from Ms. Currie \nwhich were of sentimental value to her.\n  The President's first defense to this allegation is based upon a \nminor discrepancy in Ms. Lewinsky's testimony concerning the time that \nthe gifts were retrieved by Ms. Currie. The argument is that if Ms. \nLewinsky was mistaken by one and one half hours in her recollection of \nwhen the gifts were retrieved by Ms. Currie, then her recollection of \nwho initiated the retrieval is also suspect. See Statement of Cheryl \nMills 1/20/99 at Cong. Rec. S826-27.\n  This is a red herring. The timing itself is unimportant. What is \nimportant is the fact that the call came from Ms. Currie. See ML 2/1/99 \nat Cong. Rec. S1225. Ms. Currie's cell phone records tend to support \nthe notion that Ms. Lewinsky's memory is accurate as to who called whom \nabout the gifts. After all, the only way that Ms. Currie would have \nknown about the gifts and made the call is if the other party to those \ndiscussions, the President, apprised her of that conversation and asked \nher to pick up the gifts.\n  The fall-back defense of the President is based upon the fact that he \nhad given her more gifts that same day, the idea being that his giving \nother gifts to Ms. Lewinsky is inconsistent with a plan to hide those \ngifts. See Statement of Cheryl Mills 1/20/99 at Cong. Rec. S827. This, \nhowever, is belied by the fact that the President provided her with \nthose gifts before the issue of the gifts being subpoenaed came up in \ntheir conversation that day. See ML 2/1/99 at Cong. Rec. S1224. It is \nreasonable to infer that the President's understanding of the gift \npickup was unrestricted. He expected Ms. Lewinsky to give all the gifts \nto Ms. Currie for safekeeping, even the ones she had received that day. \nThe fact that Ms. Lewinsky kept some of the gifts does not change the \nnature of the intended scheme.\n  The evidence adduced as to Subpart (3) shows beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that the President corruptly engaged in, encouraged or supported \na scheme to conceal evidence in the Jones case.\n  3. Subpart (4) of Article II:\n  Subpart (4) makes the accusation that:\n  Beginning on or about December 7, 1997, and continuing through and \nincluding January 14, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton intensified and \nsucceeded in an effort to secure job assistance to a witness in a \nFederal civil rights action brought against him in order to corruptly \nprevent the truthful testimony of that witness in that proceeding at a \ntime when the truthful testimony of that witness would have been \nharmful to him.\n  It is uncontroverted that Vernon Jordan did not actively seek to find \na job for Ms. Lewinsky until she was on the witness list in the Jones \ncase. Once she was on the witness list, she engaged in a high level job \nsearch under the guidance of the President and reported his progress in \nthat regard directly to the President. See VJ 2/2/99 at Cong. Rec. \nS1231-36. Moreover, he knew at the time of his job search that Ms. \nLewinsky was a potential witness in the Jones case and, according to \nMs. Lewinsky, was apprised by her of the sexual nature of her \nrelationship with the President. See ML 8/6/98 GJ at 138-39. And of \ncourse, in that very same time frame, he procured for her an attorney \nto help her file a false affidavit freeing her from testifying in the \ncase and to prepare that false affidavit in time for it to be used in \nthe President's deposition in the Jones case. See VJ 2/2/99 at Cong. \nRec. S1240-41.\n  One could speculate that the President's use of one of the most \npowerful attorneys in Washington, and a close friend of the President, \nto find a lowly Defense Department employee and former intern a \nlucrative and prestigious job by contacting some of the most powerful \nexecutives in the country was just an act of kindness unrelated to her \npending testimony in the Jones case. One could conclude that the \nnumerous calls made by Mr. Jordan to the President and Ms. Currie, the \ncalls made by the President to Mr. Jordan, and the calls made by Mr. \nCarter to Mr. Jordan, calls which coincided with the effort to get Ms. \nLewinsky to file a false affidavit and secure her a job, were simply \ncoincidental.\n  One could surmise that Mr. Jordan's call to Ronald Perelman after Ms. \nLewinsky felt she had a bad interview, which call led to a second \nsuccessful interview, was unrelated to her cooperation in signing the \naffidavit only a day earlier. One could believe that Mr. Jordan had a \ngreat interest in assisting Ms. Lewinsky to find a job prior to her \nname showing up on the witness list in the Jones case and only failed \nto do so because he had no time, but was somehow able to find and \ndevote substantial time to that effort, coincidentally, after her name \nshowed up on the witness list. One could undertake such speculation. \nBut that would defy common sense and reason.\n  The President became personally engaged in the effort to find Ms. \nLewinsky a job only after her name appeared on the Jones witness list. \nHe then used his powerful friend to find Ms. Lewinsky a job because he \nbelieved out of gratitude for his help in obtaining a job, she would \ncontinue to hide their relationship. He kept in constant direct contact \nwith Mr. Jordan up until the time that the affidavit was completed and \nshe had received and accepted a job offer from Revlon. Indeed, the \nPresident actually spoke to Mr. Jordan during a meeting between her and \nMr. Jordan on December 19, 1997. See ML 8/6/98 GJ at 131. Mr. Jordan \nimmediately\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\ncalled the President to report his fears the moment he thought Ms. \nLewinsky may have turned government witness when he learned Mr. Carter \nhad been relieved of his representation by her. See VJ 6/9/98 GJ at 45-\n46.\n  One need only look at the contrary actions by the President once he \nbelieved Ms. Lewinsky may have decided to cooperate with the \nIndependent Counsel investigation. Once he believed that she may have \nbeen cooperating with the Office of the Independent Counsel, he began \nto disparage her to aides like Sidney Blumenthal. See SB 2/3/99 at \nCong. Rec. S1248. After that date, the President discussed the wisdom \nof destroying her credibility and reputation with Dick Morris. See DM \n8/18/98 GJ at 35. Can anyone doubt that her favorable testimony was \ntied into the President's efforts to conceal his relationship with her \nand that the intensified job search was the President's endeavor to \nkeep her from telling the truth? Put another way, does anyone believe \nthat the President would have used Vernon Jordan to help get her a job \nafter she agreed to tell the truth to the Jones attorneys or to the \nIndependent Counsel? Of course not. It was not in the President's \ninterest to reward her for the truth--she was only rewarded for her \nfailure to tell the truth. Her reward for telling the truth was to be \nsmeared by the President and his spin machine.\n  The President's attorneys repeat the mantra that Ms. Lewinsky \nbelieves that she was not promised a job for her false testimony in the \nJones case. But that really isn't the issue. The law requires an \nendeavor to corruptly influence her testimony. Regardless of how Ms. \nLewinsky perceived or misperceived the reasons for the high level \nassistance she received, there was no such misconception on the part of \nthe President and Mr. Jordan. The corrupt endeavor by the President was \nconfirmed by two powerful and compelling words that cannot be parsed or \nstripped of meaning. Those two words summed up the month long effort to \nprotect the President: ``Mission Accomplished.'' There can be no other \nmeaning of those words in the context used by Mr. Jordan other than the \ncompletion of a crucial and time sensitive task by him on behalf of the \nPresident.\n  The proof as to subpart (4) is sustained beyond a reasonable doubt \nthat the President intensified and succeeded in an effort to secure job \nassistance to a witness in a Federal civil rights action brought \nagainst him in order to corruptly prevent the truthful testimony of \nthat witness in that proceeding at a time when the truthful testimony \nof that witness would have been harmful to him.\n  4. Subpart (5) of Article II:\n  Subpart (5) alleges that:\n  On January 17, 1998, at his deposition in a Federal civil rights \naction brought against him, William Jefferson Clinton corruptly allowed \nhis attorney to make false and misleading statements to a Federal judge \ncharacterizing an affidavit, in order to prevent questioning deemed \nrelevant by the judge. Such false and misleading statements were \nsubsequently acknowledged by his attorney in a communication to that \njudge.\n  There is no question that during the deposition of the President by \nthe Jones attorneys, the President's attorney, Mr. Bennett, made the \nfollowing statement.\n\n     . . . Counsel is fully aware that Ms. Lewinsky has filed, has \n     an affidavit which they are in possession of saying that \n     there is absolutely no sex of any kind, in any manner, \n     shape or form, with President Clinton . . . \n\n  Mr. BENNETT made this statement in an effort to cut off any \nquestioning of the President about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. \nThat statement was false, as was later admitted by Mr. Bennett, even \ngiven the contorted reading of the definition of sexual relations as \npurportedly understood by the President. It is equally clear that the \nPresident did not correct this assertion by his attorney.\n  The President's primary defense to this allegation is that he wasn't \npaying attention to what was said by his attorney. This statement can \nnot be believed. The videotape of that deposition clearly shows the \neyes of the President shifting from person to person as each spoke or \nargued their perspective on the issue. As each spoke, the President \nfocused on the speaker. It is ludicrous to assert that when the name \nMonica Lewinsky was brought up, the President was not keenly aware of \nthe significance of that line of questioning.\n  The President's primary defense to this allegation is that he wasn't \npaying attention to what was said by his attorney. This statement can \nnot be believed. The videotape of that deposition clearly shows the \neyes of the President shifting from person to person as each spoke or \nargued their perspective on the issue. As each spoke, the President \nfocused on the speaker. It is ludicrous to assert that when the name \nMonica Lewinsky was brought up. the President was not keenly aware of \nthe significance of that line of questioning.\n  He knew the work that had been done to get her affidavit completed \nbefore the deposition. He understood the disclosure of that \nrelationship could do irreparable damage to his case and to his \nPresidency. There is nothing to indicate he was anything less than \ncompletely aware of what was said and of his failure to correct that \nrecord to his detriment. I choose to believe my own eyes and common \nsense, not the implausible explanation put forward by the attorneys for \nthe President.\n  The secondary defense offered by the President, that Mr. Bennett's \nuse of the word ``is'' precluded the necessity to reveal any sexual \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky not occurring, essentially, in that room \nduring the deposition, is not worthy of a detailed refutation or \nresponse.\n  The evidence demonstrates that the President allowed his attorney to \nmake false and misleading statements to a Federal judge characterizing \nan affidavit, in order to prevent questioning deemed relevant by the \njudge, thus obstructing the administration of justice.\n  5. Subpart (6) of Article II:\n  In Subpart (6), the House makes the contention that:\n  On or about January 18, 1998, and January 20-21, 1998, William \nJefferson Clinton related a false and misleading account of events \nrelevant to a Federal civil rights action brought against him to a \npotential witness in that proceeding, in order to corruptly influence \nthe testimony of that witness.\n  This allegation relates to the statements made to Ms. Currie by the \nPresident in his unusual Sunday meeting with her after the Jones \ndeposition, and in his repetition of those statements the following \nTuesday or Wednesday after the Starr investigation had become public. \nThe President has not contested the fact that the statements made to \nMs. Currie were false and misleading. Nor has he provided any answer as \nto why the statements, if designed to help refresh his recollection, \nwere false and had to be repeated to her again several days later. \nAfter being confronted with the subpoena issued to Ms. Currie by the \nJones attorneys in the days after his deposition, and the revised \nwitness list containing her name, the President's attorneys have now \nbacked off the notion that no one could have thought Ms. Currie would \nbe a witness at the time of these statements. Despite this, the \nPresident still asserts that those false and misleading statements were \ndesigned to refresh his recollection and that he personally did not \nbelieve that she would become a witness. Once again, this defense \ndefies credulity.\n\n  When these statements were made, the President was defying a court \norder not to discuss his testimony. See WJC 1/17/98 DT at 212-13. He \nknew it was essential to do so regardless of that order because he had \nblatantly inserted Ms. Currie into the case as a fact witness. He \nmentioned her name during his deposition no less than six times, on one \noccasion even stating that the Jones attorneys would have to ``ask \nBetty.'' See generally WJC 1/17/98 DT. Clearly, the Jones attorneys got \nthe message; they added Ms. Currie to the witness list and subpoenaed \nher the following week. So did the President. Having ``brought'' her \ninto the case, the President realized the absolute need to make sure \nher testimony would dovetail with his assertions that he had no \nimproper relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.\n  It is apparent that the Sunday meeting was designed to corruptly \nmislead Ms. Currie when she would be called as a witness in the Jones \ncase. What was left unanswered by the President, but for which there \ncan be but one answer,\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\nwas why the President repeated the false statements to Ms. Currie on \nTuesday or Wednesday.\n  The answer lies in the record. By Tuesday, the president had learned \nthat Judge Starr was investigating the case. See VJ 6/9/98 GJ at 55-74. \nHe knew that the evidence in the Jones case would lead Judge Starr to \nMs. Currie, just as surely as he knew it would lead the Jones attorneys \nto her. So he had to reinforce the false statements he had told Ms. \nCurrie the previous Sunday because the stakes had just risen \nsubstantially. The President needed to be sure he was covered by Ms. \nCurrie for both the Jones case and for the Independent Counsel \ninvestigation to come.\n  Once again the evidence shows that the President related a false and \nmisleading account of events relevant to a Federal civil rights action \nbrought against him to a potential witness in that proceeding, in order \nto corruptly influence the testimony of that witness.\n  6. Subpart (7) of Article II:\n  The House asserts in Subpart (7) that:\n  On or about January 21, 23 and 26, 1998, William Jefferson Clinton \nmade false and misleading statements to potential witnesses in a \nFederal grand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence the \ntestimony of those witnesses. The false and misleading statements made \nby William Jefferson Clinton were repeated by the witnesses to the \ngrand jury, causing the grand jury to receive false and misleading \ninformation.\n\n  This subpart relates to the President's discussions with Erskine \nBowles, John Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal concerning the nature of his \nrelationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Now the President does not deny the \ntestimony of Mr. Podesta where he related that the President said that \nhe had no sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, including oral sex. \nNor does he deny the testimony of Sidney Blumenthal that he \ncharacterized Ms. Lewinsky as a stalker who had threatened him, and \nwhose seduction he had declined. The President also admits that he knew \nit was likely they would be grand jury witnesses when he made those \nstatements to them.\n  Their client having conceded the basic facts of this allegation, the \nPresident's attorneys first try to make the argument that the President \ncould not have been intending to influence the grand jury since he did \nnot tell his aides anything different than he had told any other person \npublicly. However, the evidence is unrefuted that his denials to his \naides were fundamentally different from his public pronunciations in \nthat they departed from even his tortured definition of sexual \nrelations. Moreover, he created a false impression of Ms. Lewinsky in \norder to besmirch her character and credibility in a blatant attempt to \nboth misguide the grand jurors, and it can be inferred by the fact such \ninformation was provided to his communications aide, to publicly \ndisparage her character.\n  The second defense offered is that the President's attempts to keep \nhis aides our of the grand jury show he was not trying to corruptly \ninfluence that body. However, this argument loses force in light of the \nfact that only specious arguments were made to prevent their testimony. \nKnowing they would fail, they were arguably designed to serve his \nprivate interest in delaying the investigation and creating an \nimpression of Judge Starr as overreaching and out of control. Moreover, \nthe President had months to correct his misstatements to Mr. Blumenthal \nprior to his grand jury testimony, but failed to do so even when he \nknew he would be called before the grand jury to repeat the earlier \nlies told to him by the President. See SB 2/3/99 at Cong. Rec. S1249.\n  In effect, the President killed two birds with one stone. His \nchimeric fight to prevent his aides from testifying was used \neffectively in a public relations campaign to impugn the Independent \nCounsel investigation. And when he lost the ``battle'' that he knew \nwould inevitably fail, he was aware the false and slanderous testimony \npreordained to be given by his aides would be of assistance to him in \nmisleading the grand jury.\n  There is substantial proof as to Subpart (7) that the President made \nfalse and misleading statements to potential witnesses in a Federal \ngrand jury proceeding in order to corruptly influence the testimony of \nthose witnesses.\n  For the reasons I have just outlined, the evidence proves beyond a \nreasonable doubt, that the President is guilty of Article II.\n\n\n                            v. why removal?\n\n  This impeachment trial is of momentous constitutional consequence. A \nremoval of the President--a coequal branch of government--must not be \ntaken lightly. But that--now that we have decided to end the trial by a \nfinal vote--does not negate the duty that each Senator has, as \nindividual conscience dictates, to vote to acquit or convict based upon \nthe evidence. Posterity demands that each of us justify the votes \nSenators render in the impeachment trial of the President.\n  Future generations of Americans will look to what we do as precedents \nfor impeachments. This is particularly true since our Nation has faced \nonly one impeachment trial of a President--that of Andrew Johnson in \n1868. But it is also true for judges and other federal officials as \nwell. Let me thus explain in some detail why I shall vote for \nconviction.\n  The Constitution vests great discretion in the Senate in determining \nwhether to remove an impeached official. The Framers intentionally \nfollowed the English model where the House of Commons possessed the \npower to impeach or indict officials and the House of Lords the \nauthority to try the impeached official. As such, the House of \nRepresentatives was delegated the authority to impeach and the Senate \nthe power to try, convict, and remove. The Senate was chosen as the \nrepository of this awesome power because it was considered the more \nmature chamber of Congress. Serving six year terms instead of the two \nyears for the House, the Senate was seen as a bulwark against the \nshifting tides of public opinion.\n  The age qualification differences--30 for the Senate and 25 for the \nHouse-- demonstrates that maturity in the Senate would dominate over \nyouthful passion. And most important, while the House was prone to \npassionate factional rifts, because Representatives are elected from \nsmall sometimes single-issue districts, Senators are elected state-wide \nwhere, it was hoped, factions would counteract factions. Thus, the \nSenate was designed to be more attuned to the public interest than to \nthe special interest.\n  Consequently, when the Senate sits as a court of impeachment, it does \nnot have to rubber-stamp the House's view as to what is an impeachable \noffense. As recognized by the Supreme Court in the Nixon case, the \nSenate was vested by the Framers with the sole power to try \nimpeachments. The Senate is thus vested with independent judgment as to \nwhat process to employ in the trial.\n  It also follows that the Senate was granted the discretion to \ndetermine whether the factual allegations made by the House are true \nand whether such findings by the Senate rise to the level of high \ncrimes and misdemeanors. Furthermore, the Senate, as the Upper Chamber \ninsulated against popular passions and the factions of special \ninterests, could make a subjective determination of the public good in \ndefining high crimes and misdemeanors and in removing an official.\n  In the words of my esteemed colleague, Robert Byrd, the answer of \nwhether a person is fit to remain in office requires both detached \nobjectivity and subjective judgment rising above temporary popular \npassions of whether continuation in office ``brings the political (or \njudicial) system into disrepute and undermines the people's trust and \nconfidence in government.''\n\n  Supportive of this discretionary authority to remove officials--an \nauthority that must be divorced from the fleeting and flaming emotions \nof the times--is the constitutional supermajority safeguard of a \\2/3\\ \nvote of the Senate needed to remove officials. This requirement is a \nfurther guarantee against the tide of popular passion and tilts the \nimpeachment process towards acquittal.\n  Accordingly, a Senator in impeachment trials must consider two \nfactors: (1) whether the allegations are true; and (2) whether the \nfacts proven rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors--\nimpeachable offenses. In determining the second prong--whether the \nfacts proven rise to the level of\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\nhigh crimes and misdemeanors--the subjective intent of Senators of what \nis in the public interest is a factor to consider. I have already \ndiscussed the facts and the standard for impeachable offenses. Now I \nwill discuss whether the public interest--in other words what is best \nfor the country--requires that the acts committed by President Clinton \nrise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors requiring his \nremoval.\n  I believe that it has. Some of my colleagues, particularly those on \nthe other side of the aisle, contend that it is not in the public \ninterest to remove President Clinton, because the economy is doing \nwell, or because of his foreign policy successes, or because he is \nextremely popular in the polls. But these factors--no matter how \nimportant--do not justify ignoring the constitutional mandate of \nremoval upon proving that impeachable acts were committed.\n  Polls should not be a factor in this trial. Our system of government \nis not a pollocracy. It is a representative republic where the people, \nas a constitutional matter, speak only through elections of their \nrepresentatives. America is thus a constitutional republic, and will \nremain so ``if''--in the words of Benjamin Franklin--``you can keep \nit.'' The only way to ``keep it'' is to respect the processes \nestablished by the Constitution itself.\n  Simply put, the Constitution mandates the conviction and removal of \ncivil officers, including the President, upon proving ``treason, \nbribery, and other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' I believe that the \nHouse Managers have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that President \nClinton has committed acts of perjury and obstruction of justice. I \nbelieve that Senators should come to the same subjective determination, \nas I have, that these acts of perjury and obstruction of justice so \nerodes our civil and criminal justice system as to conclude that the \npublic good is served by removal.\n  A President of the United States is not simply a political leader. A \nPresident is a head of state and a role model for Americans, \nparticularly our children. What kind of message will we send to our \nposterity if President Clinton's conduct is not considered worthy of \nremoval? What amount of cynicism and disrespect for our governmental \ninstitutions will we engender if we impose one set of rules for the \ncommon man--imprisonment for acts of perjury and obstruction of \njustice--and another for the President of the United States--who \nreceives a pass from removal because he is powerful or has done a \n``good job'' in some eyes?\n\n  Our children are extremely vulnerable to the growing cynicism \nsurrounding this trial. We have all heard stories that some children \njustify their deceits by claiming that the President of the United \nStates lied as well. Many wise philosophers have exclaimed that a \nrepublic can survive only if its citizens are moral. I am afraid that \nour children may not learn that lesson.\n  Not to remove here is to diminish the rule of law. As Manager Rogan \nwarned in his closing argument, ``[u]p until now, the idea that no \nperson is above the law has been unquestioned. And yet this standard is \nnot our inheritance automatically. Each generation of Americans \nultimately has to make the choice for themselves. Once again, it is \ntime for choosing. How will we respond?'' We should respond by \nsafeguarding the rule of law by voting to remove the President.\n  Whether President Clinton has done a ``good job'' is a matter of \npartisan debate. In fact, adopting a ``god job'' exception--a term that \nis so flexible and vague as to be meaningless as a constitutional \nstandard--merely exasperates the partisan tensions ever present in \nimpeachment trials.\n  The same analysis applies for the ``good economy means no removal'' \ntheory. It is intuitive that economic growth can never justify crime or \nacts rising to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors warranting \nremoval. If President Clinton is removed, our economy will not suffer. \nThe world will still spin on its axis. Our Constitution provides for \norderly succession and stable government. Removal will not overturn an \nelection, as some have argued. The constitutional impeachment \nprocedures were designed simply to remove unqualified or corrupt \nofficials. Vice President Gore, pursuant to the Constitution, will \nbecome President and life will go on.\n  Let me emphasize that by requiring removal upon proving the \ncommission of impeachable offenses, the Framers believed that it is in \nthe public good to remove the official.\n  President Clinton is guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors and his \npoll numbers, no matter how lofty, cannot insulate him from the \ndictates of the Constitution. The President believes that a rule of \npolls should govern the Senate's decision. But as Manager Rogan \ncorrectly observed, ``the personal popularity of any President pales \nwhen weighed against the fundamental concept that forever distinguishes \nus from every nation on the planet. No person is above the law. There \nis no escaping the Senate's duty enshrined in the impeachment oath that \nwe do ``impartial justice'' and remove the President if we believe that \nhis actions amounted to high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n\n                             vi. conclusion\n\n  I do not take pleasure or gain any sense of gratification for the \ndecision I must make today. For literally months, night and day, I have \nanguished over the serious accusations against President Clinton and \nwhat they mean for our country, our society, and our children.\n\n  I know none of us enjoys sitting in judgment of the President, our \nfellow human-being, but that is our job and we cannot ignore our \nresponsibility. I believe most of us will do a sincere job of trying to \nfulfill our oath to do impartial justice.\n  I have diligently strived to extend my deepest respect to the \nPresident--indeed, to the Presidency--throughout this process. I wanted \nto be able to support President Clinton. I believe that I have been \nmore than fair. I have tried not to rush to judgment.\n  All of my life I've been taught to forgive and forget. I've always \ntried to live up to that belief. As a leader in my church, I have dealt \nwith a great number of human frailties, people with a wide variety of \nproblems, and I've always believed that good people can repent of their \nsins and be forgiven.\n  Indeed, to the dismay of some, I had expressed a hope and a desire \nearly on in this constitutional drama that the President would \nacknowledge his untruthful statements. He chose to do otherwise and \nperpetuated his untruthfulness. Although some believe this is solely a \nprivate matter, I feel this is really about the President's fidelity to \nthe oath of office and the rule of law.\n  I have always been prepared to vote my conscience. Indeed, my \nconcerns regarding the bad precedent a likely acquittal would set have \nbeen somewhat calmed by something the great constitutional scholar, \nJoseph Story, once wrote about acquittal in impeachment cases. Mr. \nStory noted that in cases in which two-thirds of the Senate is not \nsatisfied that a conviction is warranted, ``it would be far more \nconsonant to the notions of justice in a republic, that a guilty person \nshould escape than that an innocent person should become the victim of \ninjustice from popular odium * * * ''\n  Nonetheless, I am reminded of a quote by President Theodore \nRoosevelt, a statement that applies to the matter before the Senate:\n\n       Honesty is not so much a credit as an absolute prerequisite \n     to efficient service to the public. Unless a man is honest, \n     we have no right to keep him in public life; it matters not \n     how brilliant his capacity * * *.\n       `Liar' is just as ugly a word as `thief,' because it \n     implies the presence of just as ugly a sin in one case as in \n     the other. If a man lies under oath or procures the lie of \n     another under oath, if he perjures himself or suborns \n     perjury, he is guilty under the statute law. Under the higher \n     law, under the great law of morality and righteousness, he is \n     precisely as guilty if, instead of lying in a court, he lies \n     in a newspaper or on the stump; and in all probability the \n     evil effects of his conduct are infinitely more widespread \n     and more pernicious.\n\n  President Theodore Roosevelt's words cannot be ignored--nor can the \nConstitution. After weighing all of the evidence, listening to \nwitnesses, and asking questions, I have concluded that President \nClinton's actions warrant removal from office.\n  Committing crimes of moral turpitude such as perjury and obstruction \nof justice go to the heart of qualification for public office. These \noffenses were committed by the chief executive of our country, the \nindividual who swore to faithfully execute the laws of the United \nStates.\n  This great nation can tolerate a President who makes mistakes. But it\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\ncannot tolerate one who makes a mistake and then breaks the law to \ncover it up. Any other citizen would be prosecuted for these crimes.\n  But, President Clinton did more than just break the law. He broke his \noath of office and broke faith with the American people. Americans \nshould be able to rely on him to honor those values that have built and \nsustained our country, the values we try to teach our children--\nhonesty, integrity, being forthright.\n  For 13 miserable months, we have struggled with the question of what \nto do about President Clinton's actions. The struggle has divided the \nnation.\n  To those of us who have ourselves taken an oath to uphold the \nConstitution--which represents the rule of law and not of men--it \nshould not matter how brilliant or popular we feel the President is. \nThe Constitution is why we goven based on the principle of equality and \nnot emotion. The Constitution is what guides us as a nation of laws and \nnot personalities. The Constitution is what enables us to live in \nfreedom.\n  I will vote for conviction on both articles of impeachment--not \nbecause I want to--but because I must. Upholding our Constitution--a \nsacred document that Americans have fought and died for--is more \nimportant than any one person, including the President of the United \nStates.\n  When all is said and done, I must fulfill my oath and do my duty. I \nwill vote ``Guilty'' on both Article One and Article Two.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1775-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1790-S1791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SENATOR DODD'S HISTORIC SPEECH IN THE OLD SENATE CHAMBER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to submit a statement \ndelivered by our colleague Senator Dodd on January 8th at the \ncommencement of the impeachment trial of President Clinton.\n  This statement, like the others delivered that day, is remarkable in \nseveral respects.\n  First, it captures the rich history that has transpired over the \nyears in the Old Senate Chamber--a history marked often by greatness, \nbut occasionally by shame.\n  Second, it wonderfully expresses Senator Dodd's own personal sense of \nthe history of the Senate. His reflections on past Senators--from Roger \nSherman, the Founding Father whose seat Senator Dodd occupies, to his \nown father, former Senator Thomas Dodd--remind us that the Senate is an \ninstitution made up of individuals, and that the totality of their \nactions shapes the destiny not just of the Senate itself but indeed of \nthe entire country.\n  Third, and most importantly, Senator Dodd's statement stands as a \npowerful plea for cooperation and bipartisanship in the discharge of \nthe Senate's profound responsibility in this trial. Senator Dodd's \nstatement played a critical role in setting the stage for the historic \nbipartisan agreement reached at the outset of the trial, and for the \nspirit of civility that prevailed throughout this ordeal. I commend \nSenator Dodd's statement to all citizens who in the future may wish to \nlearn something of how the Senate was inspired to conduct the \nimpeachment trial of President Clinton in a noble and dignified manner.\n  I am beginning my 25th year in the Senate. After Senator Dodd spoke I \ntold him his speech was one of the finest I had heard in those years.\n  No Senator ever spoke more directly--or more persuasively--to other \nSenators about the duty we all have to the Constitution and the Senate. \nI am proud to serve with him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of Senator Dodd's statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n\nRemarks by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Old Senate Chamber, January 8, \n                                  1999\n\n       Mr. DODD. Let me begin by thanking our two leaders. While \n     none of us can say with any certainty how this matter will be \n     concluded, if we, like every other institution that has \n     brushed up against this lurid tale, end up in a raucous \n     partisan brawl, it will not be because of the example set by \n     Tom Daschle and Trent Lott. The graces have once again \n     blessed this extraordinary body by delivering two noble and \n     decent men to lead us.\n       I want to express a special thanks to you, Tom, for asking \n     me to share my thoughts this morning on the issue before us.\n       On a light note, it was in this very room four years ago \n     that I lost the Democratic leader's post to Tom Daschle. Of \n     the forty-seven members of the Democratic Caucus, forty-six \n     were here that morning to vote. When the ballots were \n     counted, Tom and I had each received 23 votes- a dead heat. \n     The absent Democratic colleague who voted for Tom with a \n     proxy ballot was Ben Nighthorse Campbell. Several weeks later \n     I received a very late night call from Ben in which he shared \n     with me his decision to change political parties. Ben and I \n     have been good friends for some time, and I told him he ought \n     to do what he felt was right. The next morning I decided to \n     have some fun with our Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, by \n     sending him a note asking that in light of Ben's decision to \n     become a Republican, did Tom think a recount of the leader's \n     race might be in order?\n       Considering the wonderful job our leader Tom has done, \n     particularly over these last several weeks, I'm glad he did \n     not even consider the offer.\n       Allow me further to note a point of personal privilege. I \n     am deeply proud to share the representation of my state in \n     the Senate with Joe Lieberman. Over these past couple of \n     weeks Joe and Slade Gorton have once again demonstrated the \n     value of their presence in the Senate. While many of us, from \n     time to time, have claimed to speak for the Senate--few \n     rarely do. On that day in September, Joe, your remarks \n     delivered on the Senate floor about the President's behavior \n     were, I believe, the sentiments of the entire Senate. We \n     thank you.\n       Joe and I represent the Constitution State. Joe sits in the \n     seat once held by Oliver Ellsworth, the second Chief Justice \n     of the Supreme Court. I sit in the seat of Roger Sherman, the \n     only founding father to sign all four of our cornerstone \n     documents : The Declaration of Independence, The Articles of \n     Confederation, The Constitution and The Bill of Rights. Roger \n     Sherman was also the author of the Connecticut Compromise \n     which created this Senate in which we now serve.\n       So by institutional lineage, I feel a special connection \n     with the Senate. But, on a personal level, I am also very \n     much a product of the Senate. Forty years ago this week, I \n     was a very proud 14 year old watching from the family gallery \n     as my father took the same oath I took on Wednesday. I also \n     remember that day meeting another new Senator, Robert C. Byrd \n     of West Virginia.\n       I only mention these facts because I am overwhelmed by a \n     profound sense of history as we embark on this perilous \n     journey over the coming weeks. I want my institutional \n     forebearer, Roger Sherman, and my father to judge that on my \n     watch, as a temporary custodian of this Senate seat, I did my \n     best.\n       I want to express a special thanks to Trent Lott for having \n     the wisdom of choosing this most historical room for our \n     joint caucus.\n       Trent could have chosen any number of other venues, larger \n     more accommodating rooms around the Capitol for this meeting. \n     But either by divine inspiration or simple choice he decided \n     to bring us--Democrats and Republicans--together here.\n       It is one hundred and forty years ago this week--January 4, \n     1859--that our Senate predecessors moved from this room to \n     the chamber we now occupy.\n       While in use, this room was the stage of some of the \n     Senate's most worthy and memorable moments.\n       The Missouri Compromise was brokered here. So was the \n     Compromise of 1850. And the famous Webster-Hayne debate took \n     place here in 1830. The spirits of Henry Clay, John Calhoun \n     and Daniel Webster--great statesmen, great compromisers, \n     giants of our Senate--are here with us today. And maybe one \n     day, those who come after us will add this joint meeting to \n     the list of those other great moments in the history of the \n     United States Senate.\n       But this chamber also witnessed one of the Senate's most \n     regrettable moments--the caning in 1856 of Senator Charles \n     Sumner by Representative Preston Brooks.\n       Congressman Brooks walked right through this center door \n     and proceeded to beat Senator Sumner.\n       That tragic incident was precipitated by a strong anti-\n     slavery speech from Senator Sumner in which Representative \n     Brooks felt Sumner had accused his colleague and Brook's \n     cousin, Senator Andrew Butler of South Carolina, of having an \n     illicit sexual relationship with a young woman who was a \n     slave.\n       Far from being a momentary bitter, personal dispute, the \n     Sumner caning, according to many historians, effectively \n     ended the thin shred of comity and compromise that existed in \n     the Senate. Forty-eight months later our great Civil War \n     began.\n       We are now gathered in this revered room in the face of a \n     great Constitutional question. Which of the spirits that \n     inhabit this chamber will prevail as we begin this process? \n     Can we find the common ground of Clay, Calhoun and Webster? \n     Or will we assault each other by resorting to a rhetorical \n     caning?\n       I would urge our two leaders to try once more before the \n     scheduled vote of 1pm to find a solution to the issue of \n     witness testimony.\n       It has been argued that there is little or no difference \n     between the two proposals, and, while they may seem slight, I \n     believe our failure to make the right choice puts the conduct \n     of this process and the public confidence in the Senate at \n     grave risk.\n       The President's conduct was deplorable; the conduct of the \n     Office of Independent\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n     Counsel has raised grave concerns on all sides; and the \n     highly partisan spectacle in the House has provoked public \n     revulsion. We are the court of last resort--the only hope of \n     restoring public confidence rests with us.\n       The issue of whether to exclude witnesses altogether or \n     leave open the possibility of their testimony rests on how we \n     weigh the relative risk of prohibiting witnesses against \n     the risk of severely damaging or destroying the shared \n     goals and desires of all Senators.\n       Over the past several weeks, in telephone conversations, \n     meetings and joint appearances on news programs, I have \n     concluded there are six points of common agreement:\n       (1) There is the sincere desire for this profound burden we \n     did not ask for to be devoid of partisanship;\n       (2) We must act with total fairness, and we must be \n     perceived by the public as having acted fairly;\n       (3) We must act with deliberate speed and not flounder;\n       (4) We must assure that the Senate retains sole custody of \n     how this matter is conducted and concluded;\n       (5) We must demonstrate appropriate respect for the \n     Judicial Branch, the Executive Branch and the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (6) We must jealously protect the dignity of the Senate as \n     we consider what most Americans believe to be, at the very \n     least, the most undignified personal behavior of an American \n     President.\n       If we permit the House managers and the White House to call \n     witnesses, do we not risk the partisan brawling through \n     party-line voting that will surely ensue? And does not that \n     risk outweigh the risk that some of us may not benefit from \n     body language or voice inflection that some witnesses may \n     provide? I think not.\n       A process as proposed by Senators Gorton and Lieberman that \n     allows a full explanation of the House managers case over \n     several days and an equal amount of time allocated for the \n     President's defense, in addition to two days of questions \n     from Senators, would meet any reasonable person's standard of \n     fairness. The added fact that we will have at our disposal \n     more than 60,000 pages of Grand Jury testimony, hearings and \n     evidence should satisfy any objective analysis that we can \n     conduct this process fairly.\n       There is no more important business before the Senate than \n     the conduct and conclusion of this impeachment trial. I am of \n     the view that no other business ought to intervene while this \n     matter is pending. As I have said, we must act fairly--but we \n     must also act expeditiously--not rush--but act with \n     deliberate speed and purpose.\n       Any first semester law student knows that once witnesses \n     are subpoenaed, fundamental fairness allows for depositions \n     and discovery. Depending on the number of witnesses, the \n     delays will undoubtedly be lengthy.\n       I readily acknowledge that there are some risks in \n     excluding the testimony of live witnesses--but does that risk \n     exceed the almost certain risk of causing the Senate to be \n     unnecessarily tied up with this matter for weeks if not \n     months?\n       As I have stated, this unsolicited task of disposing of \n     this impeachment is paramount, but we would all agree it is \n     not our only responsibility.\n       There are urgent matters, both foreign and domestic, that \n     we must attend to in the 106th Congress. Pete Domenici's \n     concern about the budget and not repeating the budget debacle \n     of last year, social security reform, Ted Stevens' concern \n     about the accuracy of our weapons in Iraq, and the Brazilian \n     economic crisis are just a small sample of the agenda this \n     Senate must address. The risk of not dealing with these \n     matters must be weighed against the wisdom of calling live \n     witnesses in this proceeding.\n       The Constitution is clear--only the Senate has the power to \n     try impeachments. We and we alone must be the custodians of \n     our own procedures. While the calling of live witnesses does \n     not necessarily mean the Senate would lose control of the \n     proceedings, there is the undeniable risk that once the \n     witness parade begins, the ability of the Senate, and the \n     Senate alone, to manage these proceedings fairly, \n     expeditiously, and in a non-partisan fashion could be lost.\n       We Senators have a serious responsibility to be respectful \n     of the Judicial Branch in the presence of Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist, the Executive Branch in the presence of counsel \n     for the President, and the House of Representatives in the \n     presence of the House managers. Being respectful and \n     deferential to these institutions should not be confused with \n     deferring to these institutions. Chief Justice Rehnquist has \n     indicated to our leaders that he intends to be a passive \n     presiding officer, except in some narrow instances. The White \n     House, through their counsel, indicated that it would prefer \n     to avoid calling witnesses. Only the House managers are \n     insisting on the use of witnesses. Furthermore, the House \n     managers agree that the exclusion of witnesses by the Senate \n     would deprive them of the ability to make their case and be \n     taken as an act of disrespect by the Senate.\n       I find it stunningly ironic that the House Judiciary \n     Committee saw no similar disrespect to their fellow House \n     members when they presented their Articles of Impeachment \n     before the full House without the benefit of a single witness \n     appearing before their panel. When asked why no witnesses had \n     been called before the House Judiciary Committee, some \n     members argued that the calling of witnesses would have \n     unduly delayed their proceedings and the presence of some \n     witnesses could have reflected poorly on the dignity of the \n     House.\n       The obvious question occurs that if the House managers were \n     unwilling to risk an expeditious handling of their procedures \n     and unwilling to risk the potential for a lewd and lurid \n     spectacle in their chamber, why then should we in the Senate \n     submit our chamber to similar risks when there is no \n     compelling benefit to be gained?\n       A process that would allow either side in this matter to \n     call witnesses- with the approval of a bare majority--risks \n     setting in motion a Senate proceeding where we Senators would \n     sit in muted silence, as my friend Mitch McConnell has \n     pointed out, while our chamber becomes the stage for the most \n     lurid and salacious testimony of which we and the American \n     people are all too painfully aware and of which the public \n     wants to hear no more.\n       Would whatever marginal benefit this testimony could \n     provide outweigh the cost to the reputation of the Senate or \n     the dignity of this institution?\n       I submit that we should not run the risk of allowing this \n     institution to be used by anyone as a forum to appeal to the \n     basest instincts of a few.\n       For these reasons, I would strongly urge you, my \n     colleagues, not to run all the substantial risks to the \n     conduct of this process and the reputation of our Senate by \n     permitting the unnecessary procession of witness in the well \n     of our chamber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1790-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1791-S1793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IMPEACHMENT TRIAL OF PRESIDENT WILLIAM JEFFERSON CLINTON\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the Constitution of the United States \nrequires the Senate to convict and remove the President of the United \nStates if it is proven that he has committed high crimes while in \noffice. It has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral \ncertainty that President William Jefferson Clinton has persisted in a \ncontinuous pattern to lie and obstruct justice. The chief law officer \nof the land, whose oath of office calls on him to preserve, protect and \ndefend the Constitution, crossed the line and failed to protect the \nlaw, and, in fact, attacked the law and the rights of a fellow citizen. \nUnder our Constitution, such acts are high crimes and equal justice \nrequires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt \ncompelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office.\n\n\n                               THE FACTS\n\n  Facing a lawsuit the United States Supreme Court had upheld against \nhim, President Clinton had to make a decision. He could tell the truth \nor lie and obstruct justice. He took the course of illegality. This \ncase is not about an isolated false statement, it is about the \nPresident of the United States using his office, his power, his staff, \nand his popularity to avoid providing truthful answers and evidence \nthat was relevant to a civil lawsuit. President Clinton's actions \ndemonstrated a pattern of untruth and disdain for the legal system he \nhad sworn to uphold.\n\n\n                         OBSTRUCTION OF JUSTICE\n\n  President Clinton resisted the lawsuit from the time it was filed. \nAmong other defenses, he argued that he, as the President, was not \nsubject to the civil legal system while in office. The Supreme Court \nunanimously rejected this proposition. His legal arguments having \nfailed, the President began to use illegal means to defeat the action. \nSince the truth would be damaging, he took steps to see that the truth \nconcerning his relationship with Monica Lewinsky would never come out.\n  President Clinton began his obstruction of justice by denying to the \ncourt material truths. He first filed with the court false answers to \nwritten questions, interrogatories, under oath. He then bolstered his \nlies to the court by procuring from Monica Lewinsky a supporting false \naffidavit which he filed with the court. When questioned at his \ndeposition about the truthfulness of the Lewinsky affidavit, President \nClinton, without any hesitation, told the court that it was \n``absolutely true''. The President then proceeded, confident in his \nobstruction of the truth, to lie repeatedly under oath about their \nrelationship in the deposition.\n  Indeed, the President orchestrated a scheme to deceive the court, the \npublic and the grand jury. The facts are disturbing and compelling on \nthe President's intent to obstruct justice. When Monica Lewinsky \nreceived a subpoena for the gifts, the President knew that if they were \nproduced, his relationship would be revealed. I believe Monica \nLewinsky's testimony that she discussed with the President what to do\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nwith the gifts. I also believe that Betty Currie got the gifts from \nMonica Lewinsky and hid them under her bed only after approval from the \nPresident. Secreting evidence under subpoena is a crime. The President \nsecured a job for Ms. Lewinsky in large part because he wanted her to \nfile a false affidavit and to continue to cover up their true \nrelationship. The President coached his personal secretary twice to \nensure that if she were called as a witness in the civil case she would \nnot contradict his testimony given the day before. The President \nintentionally lied to aides in an effort to have them mislead the \npublic and the grand jury. This is to me a clear pattern of obstruction \nof justice.\n  The most conclusive proof of obstruction of justice, however, is the \nmost obvious. Clearly, the President succeeded at defeating the right \nof the Paula Jones attorneys to get discovery as they were entitled. He \ngot away with it. But for the indisputable DNA evidence that was only \nproduced when Ms. Lewinsky confessed seven months later, the \nobstruction would have continued to be successful. Even when confronted \nwith this evidence at the grand jury in August the President chose to \nconfuse the definition of words that have plain meanings instead of \ntelling the truth.\n\n\n                                PERJURY\n\n  From a strictly legal point of view the perjury count was not as \nclear as it might first appear. In fact, standing alone these perjury \ncharges may have failed to be impeachable. However, the President made \nhis false statements as part of a continuous pattern to obstruct \njustice and deceive. This pattern establishes the necessary criminal \nintent. The President before the grand jury continued to deny facts and \ndetails that are by their very nature important in a sexual harassment \nsuit. The President also intentionally deceived the grand jury \nregarding his participation in the concealing of the gifts and lied \nregarding his effort to obstruct justice by coaching Betty Currie. His \nadmissions, though significant, steadfastly failed to cover any issues \nthat would establish that his previous actions were in violation of the \nlaw. The President denies that these statements are false. However, he \nhas no reservoir of credibility left after he so persistently lied to \npublic for seven months. In my judgment these statements, which were \naggravated by continuous lying to the American people, are sufficient \nunder the circumstances of this case to warrant conviction on this \narticle. The President was not obligated to appear before the grand \njury, but if he chose to do so, he was obligated to tell the complete \ntruth.\n  Each statement must be individually evaluated in a perjury case. The \nPresident's statements that he did not believe he had violated the law \nand that he was not paying ``a great deal of attention'' to his lawyers \nwhen they gave false information to the court are not credible. Even \nso, I believe they are too subjective in nature to be defined as clear \nacts of perjury under the law. The President's response to clearly \nworded questions were intentionally designed to be misleading and \ndeceptive; however, the Supreme Court has held in Bronston v. United \nStates 409 U.S. 352 (1973) that it is not perjurious for a witness to \ngive an unresponsive answer even if the witness intends to mislead his \nquestioner. With this in mind, I conclude that the other charged \nstatements, not delineated above, are misleading and false but not \nperjurious. I wish it were not so, but the President is a practiced \nliar. In summary, this President has deliberately, premeditatedly, and \nwith calculation set about to defeat the justice system by criminal \nacts which include perjury and obstruction of justice.\n\n\n                         THE LAW AND PRECEDENT\n\n  Contrary to the stunning argument by the President's attorneys, there \nis just one impeachment standard for Presidents and judges. It is found \nin Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution, which states,\n\n       The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of \n     the United States, shall be removed from office on \n     impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or \n     other high crimes and misdemeanors.\n\n  Advocates on both sides of this case agree that federal judges are \ncivil officers of the United States. As civil officers, they ``shall be \nremoved'' on impeachment and conviction of high crimes and \nmisdemeanors. The President's attorneys in this case have argued that \nthere is a different standard for impeachment and removal of federal \njudges.\n  The President's attorneys made a clever argument that the ``good \nbehavior'' clause, which refers to a judge's tenure, sets a separate \nstandard of impeachable conduct for federal judges. They cite in \nsupport of this proposition Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution, \nwhich states:\n\n       The Judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall \n     hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated \n     times, receive for their services, a compensation, which \n     shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.\n\n  Historical research clearly shows that when the Constitution was \ndrafted and ratified, the phrase ``good behavior'' had nothing to do \nwith impeachment. The clause simply referred to the term of office and \ncompensation for a federal judge. It is generally accepted that the \nlegislative branch's power to actually remove a federal judge, a member \nof a separate and co-equal branch of government, is limited to \nimpeachment.\n  Before the American Revolution, American colonial judges were not \nindependent. They served at the pleasure of the British king and could \nbe dismissed at his command. The British monarch also controlled the \nsalaries of colonial judges. Americans recognized that an independent \njudiciary was a fundamental component of a free society. In fact, they \nincluded the lack of an independent judiciary as part of the ``long \ntrain of abuses'' in the Declaration of Independence: ``[King George \nIII] has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of \ntheir offices, and the amount of payment of their salaries.'' In \nresponse, the framers of the Constitution delineated through Article \nIII, Section I, that federal judges would not serve at the whims of \nCongress or the President.\n  Moreover, Alexander Hamilton, a drafter of the Constitution, \naddressed the impeachment standard for judges in Federalist #79, one of \na series of essays explaining the Constitution. In that essay he \nwrites:\n\n       The precautions for [federal judges'] responsibility are \n     comprised in the article respecting impeachments. . . . This \n     is the only provision on the point, which is consistent with \n     the necessary independence of the judicial character, and it \n     is the only one which we find in our own constitution in \n     respect to our own judges.\n\n  Thus, the Constitution provided but one standard of removal of judges \nand it is the same one applied to the President.\n  In our history there has been only one effort to impeach a judge on \nthe ``good behavior'' standard, and that effort failed. In 1805, the \nJefferson administration encouraged an impeachment of Justice Samuel \nChase, an outspoken justice of the Supreme Court and member of the \nopposition Federalist party. Chase was impeached for his conduct while \nsitting as a circuit judge. The Senate acquitted Justice Chase and thus \nredeemed the drafters' original intent that judges can only be \nimpeached for high crimes and misdemeanors.\n  So let any notion that judges may be impeached under a different \nstandard be put to rest. That conclusion is inconsistent with the \nConstitution and not supported by history.\n  It is easy to understand why the President's attorneys found it \nnecessary to argue that federal judges may be removed under a different \nimpeachment standard. The reason is that if the President is guilty of \nthe same conduct that has led to the impeachment, conviction, and \nremoval of three federal judges in the last thirteen years, and if the \nconstitutional standard is the same, and if the substance of the \nallegations are the same, then he too must be removed.\n  In 1986, the Senate convicted federal judge Harry E. Claiborne of \nthree articles of impeachment that involved fundamental dishonesty: \nJudge Claiborne was convicted for knowingly filing false tax returns. \nLike every American who pays income tax, Judge Claiborne certified \nunder penalty of perjury that his tax returns were true. For two years, \nhe submitted such returns when he knew them to be false. He was \nsubsequently impeached, convicted and removed. The President's lies in \nthis case were, in my opinion, worse because\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nthey constituted a frontal assault on the integrity of the justice \nsystem. The President did not lie on a form to hide income from the \ngovernment; he lied under oath before a federal judge in an official \nproceeding to defeat a civil rights lawsuit filed by an American \ncitizen. Under Senate precedent, that is impeachable conduct.\n\n  Another example of recent Senatorial precedent is the Hastings case. \nIn 1989, the Senate convicted Judge Alcee Hastings of Florida on seven \nof twelve articles of impeachment that were presented by the House. \nJudge Hastings was alleged to have taken a bribe to alter the outcome \nin a case before his court. Judge Hastings was convicted in the Senate \non seven articles of impeachment. Judge Hastings was convicted for \nknowingly making false statements to the jury in his own bribery trial \nat which he was acquitted. In the same year, Judge Walter Nixon was \nconvicted by the Senate for lying under oath before a grand jury. Judge \nNixon corruptly attempted to obstruct justice by denying his efforts to \nintervene in a state court prosecution for a friend--a case unrelated \nto his duties as a federal judge.\n  In the present impeachment case, we are not dealing with a blank \nslate. The Senate's actions in earlier cases are our clearest guide on \nhow to proceed in the trial of President Clinton. The Senate has \ndemonstrated three times in the last thirteen years that perjury by \ncivil officers of the United States requires removal. It is \ninconceivable that equally reprehensible conduct by the President in \nthis case should not also lead to his conviction and removal. By not so \nacting, the result will be an immediate lowering of our standards for \nimpeachment and that standard will apply to judges as well. This \nargument defines us down, reducing the dignity of the Presidency and \nthe Congress.\n\n\n                         PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS\n\n  As one who loves the law and who has spent the better part of his \nprofessional career trying cases, I understand in a profound way just \nhow important it is for justice that citizens tell the truth in court. \nAs a federal prosecutor, I presented thousands of cases to a grand jury \nand tried hundreds. On many occasions I have seen witnesses tell the \ntruth, even when it was very painful for them. Many have been driven to \ntears but still they honored their oath. Millions of Americans honestly \nfill out their tax returns and pay large sums of money simply because \nthey are honest and believe in the rule of law. Such integrity is a \nsource of great strength for our country.\n  The rule of law and the need for integrity in our justice system is \nwhy perjury cases are prosecuted in America. About seven years ago when \nI was still the United States Attorney for the Southern District of \nAlabama, a case came before me. My own city of Mobile had as its chief \nof police a strong African-American who aggressively worked to reform \nthe office, establish community-based policing, and work to create a \nnew level of discipline. Opposition grew and lawsuits were filed \nagainst him. A young police officer, who had been the Chief's driver, \ntestified in a deposition in a federal lawsuit against the Chief. He \nstated that the chief of police had ordered him to ``bug'' the patrol \ncars of other police officers and that he had a secret tape recording \ngiving him this illegal order to commit a crime. The deposition was \nreleased quickly to the newspapers. The city council, police \ndepartment, and the people were in an uproar. Under careful questioning \nby an experienced FBI agent, the young officer admitted that he had \nlied in the deposition regarding the tape recording.\n  As United States Attorney, it was my decision whether the officer \nwould be prosecuted for his perjury. His counsel argued that he was \nyoung, that he did lie but had corrected his false testimony at a later \ntime. He argued that we should decline to prosecute. After reflection \nand review, I concluded that a sworn police officer who had told a \nplain lie under oath, even a young officer, should be prosecuted in \norder to preserve the rule of law and the integrity of the system. Our \noffice prosecuted that case. The officer was convicted, and that \nconviction was later affirmed by the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe Eleventh Circuit. For me personally, I have concluded that I cannot \nhold a young police officer to a different and higher standard than the \nPresident of the United States.\n  In sum, it is crucial to our system of justice that we demand the \ntruth. I fear that an acquittal of this President will weaken the legal \nsystem by suggesting that being less than truthful is an option for \nthose who testify under oath in official proceedings. Whereas the \nhandling of the case against President Nixon clearly strengthened the \nnation's respect for law, justice and truth, by sending a crystal clear \nmessage about the requirement for honesty, the Clinton impeachment may \nunfortunately have the opposite result.\n  Finally, it is important to pause a moment to reflect on truth \nitself. I believe that we live in a created and ordered universe and \nthat truth and falsehood are real. They are capable of being \nascertained. I reject the doctrine of relativism that suggests \neverything is OK. We must always strive to hold the banner of truth \nhigh. Indeed, the pursuit of truth wherever it leads has been a \nhallmark of our civilization and is the single quality that has made us \nsuch a vibrant and productive nation. Of course, none of us are perfect \nand we often fail in our personal affairs, but when it comes to going \nto court, and its comes to our justice system, a great nation must \ninsist on honesty and lawfulness. Our country must insist upon that for \nevery citizen. The chief law officer of the land, whose oath of office \ncalls on him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution, crossed \nthe line and failed to defend the law, and, in fact, attacked the law \nand the rights of a fellow citizen. Under our Constitution, equal \njustice requires that he forfeit his office. For these reasons, I felt \ncompelled to vote to convict and remove the President from office.\n  Some will not agree with my conclusion. In that case, or if I have \notherwise offended you in any way during this process, I ask for your \nforgiveness. I have sincerely tried to bring to bear the training and \nexperience that I have had, along with the values with which we were \nraised in Alabama, to decide this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1791-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1793-S1794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CENSURE RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the Senate has just discharged its duty \nunder the Constitution to try the impeachment of President Clinton. We \nhave rendered our judgment.\n  We have been asked to consider another, albeit lesser, form of \npunishment of the President--a resolution of censure. That resolution \nis authored by the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, and the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. Senator Feinstein attempted to bring it \nbefore the Senate by way of a motion to suspend the rules in order to \npermit her motion to proceed. The Senator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, \nobjected, and then moved to indefinitely postpone consideration of Mrs. \nFeinstein's motion. Since two-thirds of the Senate failed to vote in \nthe negative, his point of order was sustained, and the motion to \nproceed failed.\n  I did not support Senator Gramm's motion for the simple reason that I \ndid not believe it appropriate to deny to Senator Feinstein and others \nthe opportunity to bring before the Senate a resolution of censure \nfollowing the conclusion of the impeachment trial of the President. Had \nthis resolution or something similar to it--say, a proposal to make \n``findings of fact'' about the President's conduct--been offered during \nthe impeachment trial, I would have strenuously opposed its \nconsideration.\n  In my view, such a proposal is not permitted by the Constitution when \nraised as part of an impeachment trial. The Constitution is clear on \nthis point. Article I, Section 3 states that ``Judgment in Cases of \nImpeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and \ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust, or \nProfit under the United States. . . .'' Our sole choice when trying an \nimpeachment case is whether or not to convict and remove (and then \ndisqualify from holding any further office) the individual in question. \nThe Framers decided not to give Senators leeway to create additional \njudgment options--no matter how creative, convenient, or compelling \nthey may be.\n  Because Senator Feinstein's motion was made after the conclusion of \nthe trial, during legislative session, I believed it was appropriate \nand timely for the Senate's consideration.\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\n  That is not to say, however, that I would have supported the \nresolution had the motion to proceed carried. On the contrary, I would \nhave opposed it--as I would have opposed each of the several proposed \ncensure resolutions that have circulated in recent days. The President \nhas acted in a manner worthy of censure. No one denies that.\n  However, I have serious misgivings about a censure resolution \nemanating from this body and this body alone. I am concerned about what \nit may mean--not for this President, but for the institution of the \npresidency. I understand the passion to voice--loudly and \nunmistakably--disapproval of the President's conduct. But it must \nbe tempered by an even greater passion for the office he holds, and for \nthe constitutional balance of power between the executive and \nlegislative branches of government.\n\n  The Federalist Number 73 speaks of ``the propensity of the \nlegislative department to intrude upon the rights, and to absorb the \npowers, of the other departments.'' It warns of a presidency ``stripped \nof [its] authorities by successive resolutions, or annihilated by a \nsingle vote.''\n  My colleagues, we must qualify our understandable disdain for this \npresident's conduct with the admonition to protect the office that he \nwill occupy for a mere 23 months longer.\n  Nowhere does the Constitution expressly permit us to take up such a \nresolution. Nor does it expressly prohibit such a step. Yet the Senate, \nand the Congress as a whole, has been remarkably restrained in even \nconsidering censure resolutions. It has been even more reluctant to \nadopt them. Only once, in 1834, was a president formally censured by \nresolution. Three years later, that resolution was expunged.\n  The President at that time was Andrew Jackson. The driving force \nbehind his censure was Henry Clay. Jackson had defeated Clay in the \npresidential election of 1832. In 1834, they remained bitter political \nadversaries.\n  Jackson argued that the resolution was repugnant to the \nconstitutional principle of checks and balances between the branches of \ngovernment. If the Senate wanted to punish him, he said, it had only \none avenue acceptable under the Constitution: it would have to wait for \nthe House to send an impeachment.\n  I am not convinced that a resolution censuring a president is \nunconstitutional. But I certainly agree that it is, at least in the \ncontext of the present case, unwise. There have been numerous instances \nwhere presidents behaved in a manner deemed outrageous and even \ndangerous to the country. Franklin Roosevelt was roundly criticized for \nhis efforts to ``pack'' the Supreme Court. President Truman seized the \nsteel mills. President Reagan and then-Vice President Bush presided \nover the executive branch while an illegal scheme, run out of the White \nHouse, was conducted to sell arms to Iran and use proceeds from those \nsales to support armed rebellion in Nicaragua. The behavior of these \nindividuals arguably was at least as egregious as President Clinton's. \nBut the Senate did not pursue a censure resolution against any of them.\n  Ours is not a parliamentary system. In the United States, we do not \nentertain votes of ``no confidence'' against our chief executive. We \nelect presidents, not prime ministers.\n  A censure resolution in the present instance will seem modest, \nperhaps even insignificant, in relation to the impeachment conducted by \nthe House. However, future generations may well come to view censure as \nan American-made vote of ``no confidence'' against future occupants of \nthe Oval Office. We may pave the way to a new form of executive \npunishment. And it may be used not only in cases of personal \nmisconduct. It could be used against a president who simply makes an \nunpopular or unwise, but nevertheless lawful and well-intended, \ndecision.\n  Ultimately, we could subject future presidents, who have not been \nimpeached, to this form of punishment. In doing so, we risk eroding the \nindependence and authority of the presidency. I do not want to see the \nSenate take such a risk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1793-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1794-S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPRECIATION OF SERVICE OF CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to extend a word of thanks to Chief \nJustice Rehnquist for his distinguished service in presiding over this \ntrial.\n  The Supreme Court sits just a few short yards from this Chamber. Yet, \nits Justices and its working remain largely unknown to those of us who \nserve here. Perhaps that conceptual distance successfully reflects the \nFramers' construct of legislative and judicial branches that act for \nthe most part independently of one another.\n  Suffice it to say that our knowledge of the Chief Justice was rather \nlimited prior to the commencement of the impeachment trial. We knew of \nhis reputation as a formidable intellect, as a scholar--including on \nthe topic of impeachment--, and as an efficient manager of courtroom. \nWe did not as a group know much more about him.\n  What we learned during that course of that trial is that the Chief \nJustice brought his many estimable qualities to bear on this unique \nlegal challenge. He brought a deep historical understanding of the \nimpeachment process. He instilled confidence in each Senator that he \nwould conduct himself in a manner faithful to the role prescribed for \nthe chief justice by the Framers. All all times, he guided the trial \nwith a firm and fair hand-not hesitating to use his judgment and common \nsense when appropriate, but never pressing a point of view on matters \nbetter left to the collective judgment of the Senate. He demonstrated a \ncontinuing respect and appreciation for the workings of this body. Last \nbut not least, he brought a refreshing sense of humor to his task, \nwhich made our task as triers of fact somewhat more bearable.\n  Although this was an historic occasion, no one who took part in it \nrelished doing so. There is collective relief, I think, that this \nconstitutional ordeal is now behind us. But as we look back at these \npast remarkable weeks, we can all take comfort and pride in knowing \nthat this second impeachment trial in our nation's history was presided \nover by an individual of great intelligence, historical knowledge, and \nwit.\n  These qualities made him uniquely suited to his task. The Senate and \nthe entire nation owe a debt of thanks to Chief Justice Rehnquist for \nrendering such value and distinguished service.\n\n   APPENDICES A-L TO SENATOR LEVIN'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL STATEMENT OF \n                           FEBRUARY 12, 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we close this chapter in the Senate's \nlife and prepare our records for the annals of history, there are \nseveral points which I wish to highlight in a series of appendices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the appendices be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the appendices were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n       The indisputable, underlying reality of the impeachment \n     case was that Monica Lewinsky's denial of a sexual \n     relationship with the President was part of a long-term \n     understanding and pattern, long before the subpoena in the \n     Paula Jones case.\n       ``Q: Had you talked with him earlier about these false \n     explanations about what you were doing visiting him on \n     several occasions?\n       A: Several occasions throughout the relationship. Yes.

Something \n     to the effect that if two people who are involved say it \n     didn't\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\n     happen, it didn't happen. Do you recall him saying that to \n     you?\n       A: Sitting here today, very vaguely . . . And this was--I \n     mean, this was early--obviously not something we discussed \n     too often, I think, because it was--it's a somewhat \n     unpleasant thought of having to deny it, having it even come \n     to that point.\n       A Juror: Is it possible that you also had these discussions \n     after you learned that you were a witness in the Paula Jones \n     case?\n       A: I don't believe so.

Neither the Pres. nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on \n     their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L to lie.

But Monica Lewinsky did write a threatening letter \n     to President Clinton.\n       ``If you believe the aides testified truthfully to the \n     grand jury about what the President told them about his \n     relationship, the President told them many falsehoods, \n     absolute falsehoods. So when the President described them \n     under oath to the grand jury as truths, he lied and committed \n     the crime of perjury. One example of this comes from Deputy \n     Chief John Podesta. . . [a]nother is Sidney Blumenthal. His \n     testimony was that on January 23 the President told him that. \n     . .

The President's lawyers argued that calling \n     witnesses would require them to engage in extensive discovery \n     and would significantly stretch-out the trial. It is relevant \n     in evaluating that claim to look at the impeachments of Judge \n     Nixon and Judge Alcee Hastings. In both of those cases, the \n     Judges' attorneys were given extensive discovery, including \n     Justice Department files, to prepare their defense. See \n     letter of Senator Wyche Fowler, Chairman of the Senate \n     Impeachment Trial Committee, and letter of Professor Terence \n     Anderson, University of Miami School of Law, below:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1989.\n     John C. Keeney,\n     Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, \n         Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Keeney: As Chairman of the Senate Impeachment \n     Trial Committee on the Articles of Impeachment against Judge \n     Nixon, I write to request the Department's assistance in the \n     Committee's efforts to assure that Judge Nixon receives a \n     fair trial in the Senate. The Committee has determined that \n     it would make a useful contribution to the trial process if \n     the Department were willing to permit the Committee, through \n     its staff, to review the documents (excluding grand jury \n     materials governed by Rule 6(e)) in the possession of the \n     Department, including those possessed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, that were requested by Judge Nixon in his \n     June 1, 1989 letter to the Attorney General, which was the \n     subject of your response on June 21, 1989.\n       The review would be consistent with that conducted in the \n     case of the Hastings impeachment matter. That is, the focus \n     of the review would be to determine if there is evidence that \n     the investigations were conducted in a manner intended to \n     mislead a court or trier of fact as to Judge Nixon's guilt or \n     innocence. In the event that it is determined that particular \n     documents should properly be made part of the pending \n     impeachment proceedings, and accordingly made available to \n     the parties for use at trial, the committee would hear from \n     the Department prior to disclosing any documents that you \n     believe contain particularly sensitive matters, so that we \n     may address any continuing concerns that you have. No \n     documents or portions of documents would be made available to \n     the parties without the consent of the Department.\n       Your expeditious response to this request would be most \n     helpful to the committee in attempting to complete discovery \n     by July 31st.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wyche Fowler, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n                            The University of Miami School of Law,\n                               Coral Gables, FL, January 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                   Discovery Precedents From Hastings\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: Ms. Linda Gustitus asked that I \n     describe the process by which and the materials to which I \n     was given access as counsel for then Judge Hastings during \n     the impeachment trial proceedings before the United States \n     Senate. After the matter was referred to an Impeachment Trial \n     Committee, I submitted requests for production of documents \n     to the House, to the Investigating Committee of the Judicial \n     Council of the Eleventh Circuit, to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Justice Department. Over the initial \n     objections of the House Managers, at the ``request'' of the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee I received documents from all but \n     the Justice Department. In lieu of direct production, the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee examined the sensitive Justice \n     Department materials to determine what should be supplied. I \n     was also permitted to take at least three discovery \n     depositions. The proceedings that resulted in this production \n     are reported in Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial \n     Committee on the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge Alcee \n     L. Hastings, S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I (Pretrial Matters).\n       By way of illustrations I enclose an appendix to a \n     memorandum that I submitted to the Impeachment Trial \n     Committee. That appendix describes in some detail the \n     materials that I received from the FBI and my estimate that \n     in the aggregate the production amounted to about 16,000. The \n     enclosed copy was reproduced from S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I at \n     433-436. Please let me know if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Terence J. Anderson.\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n                               Appendix E\n\n       Many of us in the Senate thought the House of \n     Representatives failed to meet its responsibilities by not \n     calling witnesses before the House Judiciary Committee. A \n     review of impeachments shows that in every impeachment but \n     the one (where the subject of the impeachment was mentally \n     incompetent and the House relied on the record of his \n     decisions as a judge), the House called fact witnesses. \n     According to information obtained by my staff from the \n     Congressional Research Service, there have been 16 \n     impeachments by the House. 14 of those impeachments have \n     resulted in trials in the Senate; two did not because the \n     impeached officials resigned.\n       15 of those impeachments had fact witnesses in the House; \n     one didn't. That was the case of Judge Pickering. He was \n     impeached for being mentally incapacitated. There were \n     charges of drunkenness and ``ungentlemanly language'' in the \n     courtroom. The articles against him, however, all dealt with \n     his rulings and decisions that ``proved'' he was mentally \n     incompetent. During the House inquiry, a number of affidavits \n     were presented.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix F\n\n       Independent counsel Kenneth Starr intervened in the Senate \n     impeachment trial by obtaining a court order addressed to \n     Monica Lewinsky requiring her to meet privately with House \n     Managers, based on a motion and ex parte hearing with no \n     notice to the Senate counsel or White House counsel. The \n     independent counsel then mischaracterized his own action in \n     seeking that order, describing it as seeking an \n     ``interpretation'' rather than an ``order''.\n       See the letters to Kenneth Starr, Robert Bittman, Jacob \n     Stein, & Robert Bittman; the Emergency Motion on Immunity \n     Agreement; the letter to Congressman Henry Hyde; the letter \n     to Sen. Daschle; Congressman Hyde's press release; the order \n     of Judge Norma Holloway Johnson and the transcript of Mr. \n     Starr's remarks as follow:\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Kenneth W. Starr,\n     Office of Independent Counsel,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: Interview of Monica Lewinsky.\n\n       Dear Independent Counsel Starr: I am writing to you as the \n     Lead Manager of the Managers of the Impeachment Trial of \n     William Jefferson Clinton, currently underway in the United \n     States Senate. We are in the\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\n     process of selecting witnesses for testimony in these \n     proceedings. The attorneys for Monica Lewinsky have declined \n     to make her available for an interview.\n       We have reviewed a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's Immunity \n     Agreement. Pursuant to paragraph 1(c) of that Agreement, it \n     would appear that she is required to submit to interviews and \n     debriefings if so requested by the Office of Independent \n     Counsel.\n       We would like to arrange an interview with Ms. Lewinsky \n     prior to any such testimony. We would be happy to accommodate \n     her wishes as to the precise time and location of that \n     interview. However, it is important that this interview be \n     scheduled to take place on the earliest possible date, \n     specifically Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Your assistance \n     with this interview will be appreciated.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Henry H.

Bittman, Esquire\n     Deputy Independent Counsel, Office of the Independent \n         Counsel, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: In your call today you mentioned that the \n     managers requested Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation by way of an \n     interview. As I told you, we believe it is inappropriate for \n     Ms. Lewinsky to be placed in the position of a partisan--\n     meeting with one side and not the other--in this unique \n     proceeding. Therefore, we have recommended against interviews \n     with either side.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jacob A. Stein.\n     Plato Cacheris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Independent Counsel,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 1999.\n     Jacob A. Stein, Esq.\n     Stein, Mitchell & Mezines,\n      Washington, DC.\n     Plato Cacheris, Esq.\n     Law Offices of Plato Cacheris,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jake and Plato: Pursuant to her Immunity Agreement \n     with this Office, we hereby request that Monica Lewinsky meet \n     for an interview with the House of Representatives' \n     Impeachment Managers this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, \n     January 22, 23, or 24, 1999.\n       As you will recall, both parties contemplated congressional \n     proceedings at the time we entered into the Immunity \n     Agreement. The Agreement specifically requires Ms. Lewinsky \n     to ``testify truthfully . . . in any . . . congressional \n     proceedings.'' It further requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request,'' and stipulates that these interviews may include \n     ``representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require.''\n       While I understand Ms. Lewinsky's misgivings, I must \n     disagree with one statement in your letter to me today: your \n     assertion that submitting to an interview would make Ms. \n     Lewinsky into a partisan. The Managers are acting on behalf \n     of the House of Representatives as a whole, not on behalf of \n     a political party. There task is constitutional in nature.\n       Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert J. Bittman,\n     Deputy Independent Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Stein, Mitchell & Mezines,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1999.\n     Robert J. Bittman, Esquire\n     Office of the Independent Counsel\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: \n       1. We have your January 21, 1999 letter.\n       2. The Agreement does not require Ms. Lewinsky to be \n     interviewed by the House Managers or any Congressional body.\n       3. Paragraph 1.C. of the Agreement states: ``Ms. Lewinsky \n     will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of and \n     participation in any activities within the OIC's \n     jurisdiction. This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, \n     including attorneys, law enforcement agents, and \n     representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself available for any \n     interviews upon reasonable requests.''\n       4. This paragraph deals with OIC debriefings, not OIC's \n     acting as an agent for others.\n       5. The Senate itself has provided its own rules for witness \n     interviews. As we understand them, there first must be a \n     deposition with equal access. As of now the Senate has not \n     voted for depositions.\n       6. Ms. Lewinsky will, of course, respond to a subpoena to \n     appear and testify before the Senate. Yesterday, we raised \n     with you the issue of immunity for any proposed congressional \n     testimony. You opined that your office could grant such \n     immunity in conformance with Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6002, \n     6005. It is our understanding that only the Senate by \n     majority vote can do that. We would appreciate your supplying \n     your legal authority for your position.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jabob A. Stein.\n     Plato Cacheris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [In the United District Court for the District of Columbia, Misc. No. \n                              99-  (NHJ)]\n\n                      In Re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n\n  emergency motion of the united states of america for enforcement of \n                           immunity agreement\n\n       The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, \n     Independent Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her \n     Immunity Agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel (``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an \n     OIC request that she be debriefed by the House of \n     Representatives, as required by the Agreement. The United \n     States respectfully requests that this Court orders Ms. \n     Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself to \n     be debriefed.\n     I. Factual background\n       As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate \n     is currently conducting an Impeachment Trial of the President \n     of the United States. According to public reports, it is \n     expected that the House will be required to submit to the \n     Senate its motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, \n     January 25. Again according to public reports, some potential \n     witnesses have spoken with the House Managers as the Managers \n     attempt to determine which witnesses should be mentioned in \n     their motion to the Senate.\n       On January 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Henry J. Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as \n     represented by its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the \n     OIC's assistance in having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the \n     House. See Letter from Henry J. Hyde to Kenneth W. Starr \n     (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment A). The House stressed that it \n     needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, January \n     24.\n       That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     counsel requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be \n     debriefed by the House Managers. See Letter from Robert J. \n     Bittman, Deputy Independent Counsel, to Jacob A. Stein, Esq. \n     and Plato Cacheris, Esq. (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment C). At \n     approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. Lewinsky informed \n     the OIC that she does not intend to comply with this request. \n     See Letter from Jacob A. Stein and Plato Cacheris to Robert \n     J. Bittman (Jan. 22, 1999) (Attachment D).\n     II. The immunity agreement plainly requires Ms. Lewinsky to \n         be debriefed by any institution that the OIC specifies\n       Ordinary contract law principles govern immunity \n     agreements. See In re Federal Grand Jury Proceedings, Misc. \n     No. 98-59 (NHJ), slip op. at 12 (D.D.C. May 1, 1998) (under \n     seal) (``Courts generally interpret immunity and proffer \n     agreements, like plea agreements, under principles of \n     contract law.''), appeal dismissed sub nom. In re Sealed \n     Case, 144 F.3d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam); accord \n     United States v. Black, 776 F.2d 1321, 1326 (6th Cir. 1985) \n     (``Like a plea agreement, an immunity agreement is \n     contractual in nature and may be interpreted according to \n     contract law principles.''); United States v. Irvine, 756 \n     F.2d 708, 710 (9th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (``Generally \n     speaking, a cooperation-immunity agreement is contractual) in \n     nature and subject to contract law standards.''); United \n     States v. Hembree, 754 F.2d 314, 317 (10th Cir. 1985) \n     (characterizing an immunity agreement as ``simply a \n     contract'').\n       Under contract law, an agreement is interpreted according \n     to its plain terms. See Nicholson v. United States, 29 Fed. \n     Cl. 180, 191 (1993). The operative portion of the Immunity \n     Agreement states: ``C. Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed \n     concerning her knowledge of and participation in any \n     activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. This debriefing \n     will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, law \n     enforcement agents, and representatives of any other \n     institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' Immunity Agreement para. 1.C (emphasis added) \n     (Attachment E). This provision follows paragraph 1.B, which \n     expressly requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``testify truthfully . . . \n     in . . . congressional proceedings.''\n       By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has \n     agreed to be debriefed by representatives of any institution, \n     when so required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' The duly-appointed House Managers represent the \n     House of Representatives, which plainly is an institution. \n     The OIC has unambiguously requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit \n     to each debriefing. Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow \n     herself to be debriefed by the House Managers or she will \n     have violated the Agreement.\n       To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her \n     ``debriefing . . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of \n     course, is fully willing to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. \n     Lewinsky so desires. The suggestion in her counsel's letter \n     that this provision is void if the OIC is ``acting as an \n     agent for other,'' Attachment D at para. 4, is contrary to \n     the Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. \n     Lewinsky's duties. A party to an agreement may not invent \n     clauses to a contract that are not contained therein.\n       In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the \n     House Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to \n     provide the House with information relating to impeachment. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 595(c).\n       Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion--that a \n     debriefing would be contrary to\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n     Senate Rules, see Attachment D at para. 5--is equally without \n     merit. Senate Resolution 16 (106th Cong.) states, in relevant \n     part: ``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the \n     President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be \n     deposed and the Senate shall decide after deposition which \n     witnesses shall testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' \n     Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted \n     absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution \n     restricts the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a \n     non-deposition setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the \n     Senate to prohibit the House and the President from doing the \n     investigation necessary to determine whether they wish to \n     call witnesses and which witnesses to list in their motions.\n     III. This court should grant an order requiring Ms. Lewinsky \n         to comply with the immunity agreement or forfeit its \n         protection\n       Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to \n     determine whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision \n     of this Agreement.'' Immunity Agreement para. 30. ``[A] \n     declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only when it \n     will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal \n     relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the \n     uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving right to the \n     proceeding.'' Tierney v. Schweiker, 718 F.2d 456 (D.C. Cir. \n     1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, a \n     declaratory judgment will resolve the uncertainty arising \n     from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. Lewinsky by \n     settling whether she has the right to refuse to be debriefed \n     without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement.\n       Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a \n     party to a contract intends conduct that may be a breach: `` \n     `(A) party to a contract is not compelled to wait until he \n     has committed an act which the other party asserts will \n     constitute a breach, but may seek relief by declaratory \n     judgment and have the controversy adjudicated in order that \n     he may avoid the risk of damages or other untoward \n     consequence.' '' (Application of President & Directors of \n     Georgetown College, Inc.) 331 F.2d 1000, 1002 n.6 (D.C. Cir. \n     1964) (quoting Keener Oil & Gas v. Consolidated Gas Utilities \n     Corp., 190 F.2d 985, 989 (10th Cir. 1951)); see Gilbert, \n     Segall & Young v. Bank of Montreal, 785 F. Supp. 453. 462 \n     (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Fine v. Property Damage Appraisers, Inc., \n     393 F. Supp. 1304, 1309-10 (E.D. La. 1975). Accordingly, this \n     Court has the power to issue a declaratory judgment before \n     Ms. Lewinsky's actions become irreversible.\n     IV. Conclusion\n       The Immunity Agreement plainly requires that Ms. Lewinsky \n     allow herself to be debriefed by any institution at the \n     request of the OIC. Ms. Lewinsky has the right to insist that \n     the OIC conduct the debriefing, but she must comply with the \n     plain terms of the Immunity Agreement. Accordingly, the \n     United States respectfully requests that this Court enter an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to debriefing by the \n     House.\n       The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its \n     motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House \n     has stressed its need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend. \n     Accordingly, the United States respectfully requests that \n     this Court act on this motion as an emergency matter. \n     Specifically, we request a hearing on this matter today.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n     Kenneth W.

Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Manager Hyde: We understand that the Office of \n     Independent Counsel, on behalf of the House Managers, sought \n     a court order to compel Ms. Lewinsky to submit to an \n     interview with the Managers in preparation for her possible \n     testimony. We further understand that Chief Judge Norma \n     Holloway Johnson has granted the order sought by the \n     Independent Counsel.\n       As you know, Senate Resolution 16, which was passed by a \n     100-0 vote just over two weeks ago, expressly deferred any \n     consideration or action related to additional witness \n     testimony until after opening presentations, a question-and-\n     answer period and an affirmative vote to compel such \n     testimony. These actions by the Managers, undertaken without \n     notice to the Senate or the President's Counsel, raise \n     profound questions of fundamental fairness and undermine the \n     ability of this body to control the discovery procedures that \n     will take place under the imprimatur of its authority.\n       In light of these concerns, we ask that you withdraw any \n     and all requests to Mr. Starr that he assist your efforts to \n     interview Ms. Lewinsky. The Senate, in a matter of days, will \n     have an opportunity to formally address this issue pursuant \n     to the procedures established by Senate Resolution 16. \n     Moreover, we insist that you take no action related to the \n     proposed interview of any witness until such time as the \n     Senate has given you the authority to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid.\n       [Also signed by 43 Senators.]\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Democratic Leader: I am in receipt of your letter \n     of today expressing your concern with the House of \n     Representatives' request to interview Monica Lewinsky.\n       It has always been the position of the House Managers that \n     a full trial with the benefit of relevant witnesses is in the \n     best interest of the Senate and the American people. \n     Representatives of President Clinton and many Senators have \n     publicly stated that they want the Senate to preclude the \n     testimony of witnesses. Many other Senators have made it \n     clear that they prefer the witness lists for both sides to be \n     sharply focused and limited to only the most relevant \n     witnesses. The Managers have been mindful of these Senators' \n     concerns.\n       It is clear that the two most important witnesses in this \n     trial are President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. Yesterday, I \n     wrote to Majority Leader Lott and you to express the \n     Managers' willingness to participate in the fair examination \n     of the President if the Senate chooses to invite him to \n     testify. The presentation of the President's counsel ended \n     just two days ago. We are in the process of evaluating that \n     presentation and determining what witnesses we will request \n     the Senate to call. We believe that interviewing Ms. Lewinsky \n     will help us make this determination. Counsel for the \n     President may have already interviewed witnesses or may wish \n     to interview witnesses they will propose to the Senate. That \n     is their prerogative. The Senate has required us to submit a \n     proffer of anticipated testimony of any proposed witnesses. \n     Interviews of potential witnesses will assist the parties in \n     providing the Senate with informative proffers.\n       The House of Representatives has not violated S. Res. 16. \n     When the House passed H. Res. 10 appointing the Mangers, it \n     authorized that the Managers may ``in connection with the \n     preparation and the conduct of the trial, exhibit the \n     articles of impeachment to the Senate and take all other \n     actions necessary, which may include * * * sending for \n     persons and papers . . . .'' Implicit in this authority is \n     the ability to conduct interviews and gather additional \n     information relevant to the articles of impeachment.\n       The Managers, who represent the House of Representatives, \n     retain powers separate and apart from the Senate. The \n     Managers are not, just as the President's Counsel are not, an \n     office or subset of the Senate. The Managers, like the \n     President's Counsel, may conduct activities, such as further \n     investigation and legal research, that are not specifically \n     authorized by the Senate.\n       Senate Resolution 16 does not prohibit the Managers from \n     conducting further investigation or interviews of witnesses. \n     If the resolution was intended to restrict the Managers in \n     this way, we believe that it would violate principles of \n     bicameralism, the ability of each House to establish its own \n     rules of procedure, and would therefore be an \n     unconstitutional infringement on the prerogatives of the \n     House.\n       Implicit in the right of the Managers to report to the \n     House amendments to articles of impeachment, is the right of \n     the Managers to receive and evaluate additional information. \n     For example, if the Managers received additional exculpatory \n     or inculpatory information, they could file amendments to the \n     articles of impeachment in the House.\n       Senate Resolution 16 set a schedule for deciding whether to \n     depose witnesses. The decision to depose witnesses is subject \n     to a request from the House Managers. The House Managers have \n     decided that they need to talk with Ms. Lewinsky before \n     making a recommendation to the Senate to depose her. The \n     action of the House Managers is not unusual. It is not \n     unfair, and it is not contrary to the rules of the Senate.\n       With all due respect to the Senate, the rules and the \n     constitutional principles of bicameralism do not require that \n     the House obtain the permission of the Senate merely to \n     conduct an interview of a potential witness. A decision to \n     merely interview a witness as opposed to conducting a \n     deposition, does not interfere with the Senate's ability to \n     control the procedures set forth under S. Res. 16.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Henry J. Hyde,\n\n                                  On behalf of the Managers on the\n                             Part of the House of Representatives.\n\n [From the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, \n                        Henry J. Hyde, Chairman]\n\n                  Managers' Response to Judge's Ruling\n\n       (Washington, D.C.)--Paul McNulty, chief spokesman for the \n     House Managers, made the following statement today following \n     Judge Johnson's ruling that Monica Lewinsky must cooperate \n     with the managers' request for an interview, in keeping with \n     her immunity agreement:\n       ``Monica Lewinsky received extraordinary protection in \n     exchange for her truthful testimony. Judge Johnson ruled that \n     she has an obligation to cooperate in the search for truth.\n       ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important \n     than it is now.

And we \n     responded as I felt that we were obligated to do to that \n     request. And we then took what I felt was the appropriate \n     action and we went to court.\n       I want to make it very clear that Chief Judge Johnson has \n     only interpreted the agreement between Ms. Lewinsky, who's \n     advised by her very able lawyers, and our office. She did not \n     direct an order in any sense other than to interpret the \n     meaning of the agreement, which we asked her to interpret. \n     So, I want it to be very, very clear that the judge was \n     simply acting at our request to interpret the terms of the \n     agreement, which we believe are quite clear.\n       QUESTION: Senator Harkin said yesterday that Judge Johnson \n     may not have acted on, you know, constitutionally. Do you \n     have any comment on that?\n       STARR: Well we think that we have taken the appropriate \n     action in going to the court and the court acted \n     appropriately in interpreting the agreement, which is all \n     that she did. So if there is an issue, the issue has to be \n     one that's entrusted to the wisdom of the Senate.

Three and half years later--and after what appears \n     to be the most thorough criminal investigation of a sitting \n     President, Mr. Starr was unable to find any criminal \n     wrongdoing on the part of the President in what came to be \n     known as ``Whitewater.'' A similar conclusion was reached by \n     Mr. Starr with respect to additional investigations assigned \n     to Mr. Starr along the way--namely, allegations with respect \n     to the White House use of FBI files and the discharge of \n     White House employees from the White House Travel Office.\n       A year ago Mr. Starr's investigation was coming to an end. \n     That's when Linda Tripp walked through Mr. Starr's door with \n     promises of taped phone conversations between Ms. Tripp and \n     Monica Lewinsky about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with \n     President Clinton. And what was the alleged crime? That \n     President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were about to lie about \n     their relationship--if they were asked about it by the \n     attorneys for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case \n     against President Clinton. Mr. Starr had to know that the \n     relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky \n     had been a consensual one. Mr. Starr had to know that, \n     because Ms. Tripp was informed by Ms. Lewinsky of every \n     aspect of her relationship with President Clinton. And at \n     this point--January 12, 1998--neither Monica Lewinsky nor \n     President Clinton had been deposed.\n       I am convinced that no ordinary federal prosecutor, if \n     confronted with the same situation involving a private \n     citizen, would have pursued this case. But Mr. Starr was no \n     ordinary federal prosecutor. Without jurisdiction with \n     respect to these matters, he immediately gave Ms. Tripp \n     immunity in exchange for access to her tapes, and he wired \n     her to tape a private luncheon conversation with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. Shortly after Mr. Starr wired Ms. Tripp, he \n     confronted Ms. Lewinsky and, according to her, threatened her \n     with 27 years in prison and the prosecution of her mother in \n     order to get her cooperation and to tape Betty Currie, the \n     President, and/or Vernon Jordan. Mr. Starr brought his \n     enormous criminal investigative resources to bear on \n     testimony yet to be given in a civil lawsuit involving a \n     consensual, sexual relationship.\n       At the time Ms. Lewinsky was threatened by Mr. Starr, her \n     affidavit in the Jones case had not been filed. She was still \n     in a position to retrieve it or amend it. Also, President \n     Clinton had not been deposed. He had not given his testimony \n     in the Paula Jones suit. In effect, Mr. Starr and his agents \n     lay in wait--waiting for the President to be surprised at the \n     Jones deposition with information about Monica Lewinsky. And \n     how did that information about Monica Lewinsky get in the \n     hands of the Jones attorneys? Ms. Tripp gave them the \n     information. And she was able to do that even though she was \n     under an immunity arrangement with Mr. Starr, because--as Mr. \n     Starr acknowledged to the House Judiciary Committee under \n     questioning--Mr. Starr's agents never directed Ms. Tripp to \n     keep her information confidential, even though Mr. Starr had \n     a major concern that the Lewinsky matter would leak to the \n     press. Mr. Starr's agents did not tell Ms. Tripp not to talk \n     to the Jones attorneys or anyone else in order to ensure that \n     the story would not leak to the press.\n       So the enormous criminal investigative resources of the \n     federal government were brought to bear on the President of \n     the United States to catch him by surprise in a future \n     deposition in a civil proceeding on a matter peripheral to \n     the lawsuit, prior to any of the suspected unlawful conduct.\n       Once the President testified in that civil suit, Mr. Starr \n     convened a grand jury to investigate the truthfulness of Mr. \n     Clinton's testimony. Again, using the virtually unlimited \n     resources of the federal government with respect to a \n     criminal investigation, Mr. Starr called countless witnesses \n     before the grand jury--recalling numerous witnesses multiple \n     times. Betty Currie testified on 5 different occasions; so \n     did Vernon Jordan. Monica Lewinsky testified 3 times and was \n     interviewed over 20 separate times. I don't believe any \n     regular prosecutor would have invested the time and money and \n     resources in the kind of investigation that Kenneth Starr \n     did.\n       At the end, Mr. Starr wrote a report arguing for \n     impeachment to the House of Representatives. He didn't just \n     impartially forward evidence he thought may demonstrate \n     possible impeachable offenses.\n       The Starr report spared nothing. Lacking good judgment and \n     balance, the Starr report contained a large amount of \n     salacious detail, and skipped over or dismissed important \n     exculpatory evidence, such as Monica Lewinsky's statement \n     that no one asked her to lie and no one promised her a job \n     for her silence. Mr. Starr violated the standards enunciated \n     by Judge Sirica when he addressed the status of the grand \n     jury report in the Watergate matter. In that case, Judge \n     Sirica wrote in granting Leon Jaworski, the Watergate \n     prosecutor, the right to forward grand jury information to \n     the House of Representatives:\n\n       ``It draws no accusatory conclusions. . . It contains no \n     recommendations, advice or statements that infringe on the \n     prerogatives of other branches of government. . . It renders \n     no moral or social judgments. The Report is a simple and \n     straightforward compilation of information gathered by the \n     Grand Jury, and no more. . . The Grand Jury has obviously \n     taken care to assure that its Report contains no \n     objectionable features, and has throughout acted in the \n     interests of fairness. The Grand Jury having thus respected \n     its own limitations and the rights of others, the Court ought \n     to respect the Jury's exercise of its prerogatives.''

The Starr Report violates almost every one of the \n     standards laid out by Judge Sirica in the Watergate case.\n       The House of Representatives the Judiciary Committee then \n     almost immediately released the Starr report and the \n     thousands of pages of evidence to the public.\n       Because of that release--enormous damage had been done to \n     the public's sense of decorum and to appropriate limits \n     between public and private life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1794-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1794-S1799]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           APPRECIATION OF SERVICE OF CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to extend a word of thanks to Chief \nJustice Rehnquist for his distinguished service in presiding over this \ntrial.\n  The Supreme Court sits just a few short yards from this Chamber. Yet, \nits Justices and its working remain largely unknown to those of us who \nserve here. Perhaps that conceptual distance successfully reflects the \nFramers' construct of legislative and judicial branches that act for \nthe most part independently of one another.\n  Suffice it to say that our knowledge of the Chief Justice was rather \nlimited prior to the commencement of the impeachment trial. We knew of \nhis reputation as a formidable intellect, as a scholar--including on \nthe topic of impeachment--, and as an efficient manager of courtroom. \nWe did not as a group know much more about him.\n  What we learned during that course of that trial is that the Chief \nJustice brought his many estimable qualities to bear on this unique \nlegal challenge. He brought a deep historical understanding of the \nimpeachment process. He instilled confidence in each Senator that he \nwould conduct himself in a manner faithful to the role prescribed for \nthe chief justice by the Framers. All all times, he guided the trial \nwith a firm and fair hand-not hesitating to use his judgment and common \nsense when appropriate, but never pressing a point of view on matters \nbetter left to the collective judgment of the Senate. He demonstrated a \ncontinuing respect and appreciation for the workings of this body. Last \nbut not least, he brought a refreshing sense of humor to his task, \nwhich made our task as triers of fact somewhat more bearable.\n  Although this was an historic occasion, no one who took part in it \nrelished doing so. There is collective relief, I think, that this \nconstitutional ordeal is now behind us. But as we look back at these \npast remarkable weeks, we can all take comfort and pride in knowing \nthat this second impeachment trial in our nation's history was presided \nover by an individual of great intelligence, historical knowledge, and \nwit.\n  These qualities made him uniquely suited to his task. The Senate and \nthe entire nation owe a debt of thanks to Chief Justice Rehnquist for \nrendering such value and distinguished service.\n\n   APPENDICES A-L TO SENATOR LEVIN'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL STATEMENT OF \n                           FEBRUARY 12, 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as we close this chapter in the Senate's \nlife and prepare our records for the annals of history, there are \nseveral points which I wish to highlight in a series of appendices.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the appendices be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the appendices were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                               Appendix A\n\n       The indisputable, underlying reality of the impeachment \n     case was that Monica Lewinsky's denial of a sexual \n     relationship with the President was part of a long-term \n     understanding and pattern, long before the subpoena in the \n     Paula Jones case.\n       ``Q: Had you talked with him earlier about these false \n     explanations about what you were doing visiting him on \n     several occasions?\n       A: Several occasions throughout the relationship. Yes. It \n     was a pattern of the relationship to sort of conceal it.''--\n     Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky, Part One; \n     Independent Counsel Appendices, Page 844.\n       ``A Juror: Did you ever discuss with the President whether \n     you should deny the relationship if you were asked about it?\n       A: I think I always offered that.''--Grand Jury Testimony \n     of Monica Lewinsky, Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, \n     Page 1077.\n       ``A: And she [Linda Tripp] told me that I should put it in \n     a safe deposit box because it could be evidence one day. And \n     I said that was ludicrous because I would never--I would \n     never disclose that I had a relationship with the President. \n     I would never need it.''--Grand Jury Testimony of Monica \n     Lewinsky, Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, Page \n     1107.\n       ``A Juror: And what about the next sentence also? Something \n     to the effect that if two people who are involved say it \n     didn't\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\n     happen, it didn't happen. Do you recall him saying that to \n     you?\n       A: Sitting here today, very vaguely . . . And this was--I \n     mean, this was early--obviously not something we discussed \n     too often, I think, because it was--it's a somewhat \n     unpleasant thought of having to deny it, having it even come \n     to that point.\n       A Juror: Is it possible that you also had these discussions \n     after you learned that you were a witness in the Paula Jones \n     case?\n       A: I don't believe so. No.\n       A Juror: Can you exclude the possibility?\n       A: I pretty much can.''--Grand Jury Testimony of Monica \n     Lewinsky, Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, Page \n     1119.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix B\n\n       Did Ms. Lewinsky think her affidavit in the Paula Jones \n     case was false when she signed it?\n       ``Ms. L had a physically intimate relationship with the \n     President. Neither the Pres. nor Mr. Jordan (or anyone on \n     their behalf) asked or encouraged Ms. L to lie. Ms. L was \n     comfortable signing the affidavit with regard to the `sexual \n     relationship' because she could justify to herself that she \n     and the Pres. did not have sexual intercourse.''--Proffer of \n     Monica Lewinsky to the Independent Counsel.\n       ``Q: When he said that you might sign an affidavit, what \n     did you understand it to mean at that time?\n       A: I thought that signing an affidavit could range from \n     anywhere between maybe just somehow mentioning, you know, \n     innocuous things or going as far as maybe having to deny any \n     kind of relationship.''--Grand Jury Testimony of Monica \n     Lewinsky, Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, Page 844.\n       ``Q: You were trying to be truthful throughout [the \n     proffer]?\n       A: Exactly.''--Grand Jury Testimony of Monica Lewinsky, \n     Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, Page 1142.\n       ``A: But I did some justifying in signing the affidavit, \n     so--\n       Q: Justifying--does the word `rationalizing' apply as well?\n       A: Rationalize, yes.''--Grand Jury Testimony of Monica \n     Lewinsky, Part One; Independent Counsel Appendices, Page 925.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix C\n\n       House Managers implied that when the President allegedly \n     told John Podesta Ms. Lewinsky threatened him, the President \n     was lying. But Monica Lewinsky did write a threatening letter \n     to President Clinton.\n       ``If you believe the aides testified truthfully to the \n     grand jury about what the President told them about his \n     relationship, the President told them many falsehoods, \n     absolute falsehoods. So when the President described them \n     under oath to the grand jury as truths, he lied and committed \n     the crime of perjury. One example of this comes from Deputy \n     Chief John Podesta. . . [a]nother is Sidney Blumenthal. His \n     testimony was that on January 23 the President told him that. \n     . .

The President's lawyers argued that calling \n     witnesses would require them to engage in extensive discovery \n     and would significantly stretch-out the trial. It is relevant \n     in evaluating that claim to look at the impeachments of Judge \n     Nixon and Judge Alcee Hastings. In both of those cases, the \n     Judges' attorneys were given extensive discovery, including \n     Justice Department files, to prepare their defense.

Keeney,\n     Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, \n         Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Keeney: As Chairman of the Senate Impeachment \n     Trial Committee on the Articles of Impeachment against Judge \n     Nixon, I write to request the Department's assistance in the \n     Committee's efforts to assure that Judge Nixon receives a \n     fair trial in the Senate. The Committee has determined that \n     it would make a useful contribution to the trial process if \n     the Department were willing to permit the Committee, through \n     its staff, to review the documents (excluding grand jury \n     materials governed by Rule 6(e)) in the possession of the \n     Department, including those possessed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, that were requested by Judge Nixon in his \n     June 1, 1989 letter to the Attorney General, which was the \n     subject of your response on June 21, 1989.\n       The review would be consistent with that conducted in the \n     case of the Hastings impeachment matter. That is, the focus \n     of the review would be to determine if there is evidence that \n     the investigations were conducted in a manner intended to \n     mislead a court or trier of fact as to Judge Nixon's guilt or \n     innocence. In the event that it is determined that particular \n     documents should properly be made part of the pending \n     impeachment proceedings, and accordingly made available to \n     the parties for use at trial, the committee would hear from \n     the Department prior to disclosing any documents that you \n     believe contain particularly sensitive matters, so that we \n     may address any continuing concerns that you have. No \n     documents or portions of documents would be made available to \n     the parties without the consent of the Department.\n       Your expeditious response to this request would be most \n     helpful to the committee in attempting to complete discovery \n     by July 31st.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wyche Fowler, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n                            The University of Miami School of Law,\n                               Coral Gables, FL, January 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                   Discovery Precedents From Hastings\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: Ms. Linda Gustitus asked that I \n     describe the process by which and the materials to which I \n     was given access as counsel for then Judge Hastings during \n     the impeachment trial proceedings before the United States \n     Senate. After the matter was referred to an Impeachment Trial \n     Committee, I submitted requests for production of documents \n     to the House, to the Investigating Committee of the Judicial \n     Council of the Eleventh Circuit, to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Justice Department. Over the initial \n     objections of the House Managers, at the ``request'' of the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee I received documents from all but \n     the Justice Department. In lieu of direct production, the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee examined the sensitive Justice \n     Department materials to determine what should be supplied. I \n     was also permitted to take at least three discovery \n     depositions. The proceedings that resulted in this production \n     are reported in Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial \n     Committee on the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge Alcee \n     L. Hastings, S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I (Pretrial Matters).\n       By way of illustrations I enclose an appendix to a \n     memorandum that I submitted to the Impeachment Trial \n     Committee. That appendix describes in some detail the \n     materials that I received from the FBI and my estimate that \n     in the aggregate the production amounted to about 16,000. The \n     enclosed copy was reproduced from S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I at \n     433-436. Please let me know if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Terence J. Anderson.\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n                               Appendix E\n\n       Many of us in the Senate thought the House of \n     Representatives failed to meet its responsibilities by not \n     calling witnesses before the House Judiciary Committee. A \n     review of impeachments shows that in every impeachment but \n     the one (where the subject of the impeachment was mentally \n     incompetent and the House relied on the record of his \n     decisions as a judge), the House called fact witnesses. \n     According to information obtained by my staff from the \n     Congressional Research Service, there have been 16 \n     impeachments by the House. 14 of those impeachments have \n     resulted in trials in the Senate; two did not because the \n     impeached officials resigned.\n       15 of those impeachments had fact witnesses in the House; \n     one didn't. That was the case of Judge Pickering. He was \n     impeached for being mentally incapacitated. There were \n     charges of drunkenness and ``ungentlemanly language'' in the \n     courtroom. The articles against him, however, all dealt with \n     his rulings and decisions that ``proved'' he was mentally \n     incompetent. During the House inquiry, a number of affidavits \n     were presented.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix F\n\n       Independent counsel Kenneth Starr intervened in the Senate \n     impeachment trial by obtaining a court order addressed to \n     Monica Lewinsky requiring her to meet privately with House \n     Managers, based on a motion and ex parte hearing with no \n     notice to the Senate counsel or White House counsel. The \n     independent counsel then mischaracterized his own action in \n     seeking that order, describing it as seeking an \n     ``interpretation'' rather than an ``order''.\n       See the letters to Kenneth Starr, Robert Bittman, Jacob \n     Stein, & Robert Bittman; the Emergency Motion on Immunity \n     Agreement; the letter to Congressman Henry Hyde; the letter \n     to Sen.

Pursuant to paragraph 1(c) of that Agreement, it \n     would appear that she is required to submit to interviews and \n     debriefings if so requested by the Office of Independent \n     Counsel.\n       We would like to arrange an interview with Ms. Lewinsky \n     prior to any such testimony. We would be happy to accommodate \n     her wishes as to the precise time and location of that \n     interview. However, it is important that this interview be \n     scheduled to take place on the earliest possible date, \n     specifically Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.

As I told you, we believe it is inappropriate for \n     Ms. Lewinsky to be placed in the position of a partisan--\n     meeting with one side and not the other--in this unique \n     proceeding.

The Agreement specifically requires Ms. Lewinsky \n     to ``testify truthfully . . . in any . . . congressional \n     proceedings.'' It further requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request,'' and stipulates that these interviews may include \n     ``representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require.''\n       While I understand Ms. Lewinsky's misgivings, I must \n     disagree with one statement in your letter to me today: your \n     assertion that submitting to an interview would make Ms. \n     Lewinsky into a partisan. The Managers are acting on behalf \n     of the House of Representatives as a whole, not on behalf of \n     a political party. There task is constitutional in nature.\n       Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert J. Bittman,\n     Deputy Independent Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Stein, Mitchell & Mezines,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1999.\n     Robert J. Bittman, Esquire\n     Office of the Independent Counsel\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: \n       1. We have your January 21, 1999 letter.\n       2. The Agreement does not require Ms. Lewinsky to be \n     interviewed by the House Managers or any Congressional body.\n       3. Paragraph 1.C. of the Agreement states: ``Ms. Lewinsky \n     will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of and \n     participation in any activities within the OIC's \n     jurisdiction. This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, \n     including attorneys, law enforcement agents, and \n     representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself available for any \n     interviews upon reasonable requests.''\n       4. This paragraph deals with OIC debriefings, not OIC's \n     acting as an agent for others.\n       5. The Senate itself has provided its own rules for witness \n     interviews. As we understand them, there first must be a \n     deposition with equal access. As of now the Senate has not \n     voted for depositions.\n       6. Ms. Lewinsky will, of course, respond to a subpoena to \n     appear and testify before the Senate. Yesterday, we raised \n     with you the issue of immunity for any proposed congressional \n     testimony. You opined that your office could grant such \n     immunity in conformance with Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6002, \n     6005. It is our understanding that only the Senate by \n     majority vote can do that. We would appreciate your supplying \n     your legal authority for your position.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jabob A. Stein.\n     Plato Cacheris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [In the United District Court for the District of Columbia, Misc. No. \n                              99-  (NHJ)]\n\n                      In Re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n\n  emergency motion of the united states of america for enforcement of \n                           immunity agreement\n\n       The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, \n     Independent Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her \n     Immunity Agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel (``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an \n     OIC request that she be debriefed by the House of \n     Representatives, as required by the Agreement. The United \n     States respectfully requests that this Court orders Ms. \n     Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself to \n     be debriefed.\n     I. Factual background\n       As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate \n     is currently conducting an Impeachment Trial of the President \n     of the United States. According to public reports, it is \n     expected that the House will be required to submit to the \n     Senate its motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, \n     January 25. Again according to public reports, some potential \n     witnesses have spoken with the House Managers as the Managers \n     attempt to determine which witnesses should be mentioned in \n     their motion to the Senate.\n       On January 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Henry J. Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as \n     represented by its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the \n     OIC's assistance in having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the \n     House. See Letter from Henry J. Hyde to Kenneth W. Starr \n     (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment A). The House stressed that it \n     needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, January \n     24.\n       That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     counsel requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be \n     debriefed by the House Managers. See Letter from Robert J. \n     Bittman, Deputy Independent Counsel, to Jacob A. Stein, Esq. \n     and Plato Cacheris, Esq. (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment C). At \n     approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. Lewinsky informed \n     the OIC that she does not intend to comply with this request. \n     See Letter from Jacob A. Stein and Plato Cacheris to Robert \n     J. Bittman (Jan. 22, 1999) (Attachment D).\n     II. The immunity agreement plainly requires Ms. Lewinsky to \n         be debriefed by any institution that the OIC specifies\n       Ordinary contract law principles govern immunity \n     agreements. See In re Federal Grand Jury Proceedings, Misc. \n     No. 98-59 (NHJ), slip op. at 12 (D.D.C. May 1, 1998) (under \n     seal) (``Courts generally interpret immunity and proffer \n     agreements, like plea agreements, under principles of \n     contract law.''), appeal dismissed sub nom. In re Sealed \n     Case, 144 F.3d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam); accord \n     United States v. Black, 776 F.2d 1321, 1326 (6th Cir. 1985) \n     (``Like a plea agreement, an immunity agreement is \n     contractual in nature and may be interpreted according to \n     contract law principles.''); United States v. Irvine, 756 \n     F.2d 708, 710 (9th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (``Generally \n     speaking, a cooperation-immunity agreement is contractual) in \n     nature and subject to contract law standards.''); United \n     States v. Hembree, 754 F.2d 314, 317 (10th Cir. 1985) \n     (characterizing an immunity agreement as ``simply a \n     contract'').\n       Under contract law, an agreement is interpreted according \n     to its plain terms. See Nicholson v. United States, 29 Fed. \n     Cl. 180, 191 (1993). The operative portion of the Immunity \n     Agreement states: ``C. Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed \n     concerning her knowledge of and participation in any \n     activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. This debriefing \n     will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, law \n     enforcement agents, and representatives of any other \n     institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' Immunity Agreement para. 1.C (emphasis added) \n     (Attachment E). This provision follows paragraph 1.B, which \n     expressly requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``testify truthfully . . . \n     in . . . congressional proceedings.''\n       By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has \n     agreed to be debriefed by representatives of any institution, \n     when so required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' The duly-appointed House Managers represent the \n     House of Representatives, which plainly is an institution. \n     The OIC has unambiguously requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit \n     to each debriefing. Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow \n     herself to be debriefed by the House Managers or she will \n     have violated the Agreement.\n       To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her \n     ``debriefing . . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of \n     course, is fully willing to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. \n     Lewinsky so desires. The suggestion in her counsel's letter \n     that this provision is void if the OIC is ``acting as an \n     agent for other,'' Attachment D at para. 4, is contrary to \n     the Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. \n     Lewinsky's duties. A party to an agreement may not invent \n     clauses to a contract that are not contained therein.\n       In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the \n     House Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to \n     provide the House with information relating to impeachment. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 595(c).\n       Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion--that a \n     debriefing would be contrary to\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n     Senate Rules, see Attachment D at para. 5--is equally without \n     merit. Senate Resolution 16 (106th Cong.) states, in relevant \n     part: ``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the \n     President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be \n     deposed and the Senate shall decide after deposition which \n     witnesses shall testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' \n     Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted \n     absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution \n     restricts the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a \n     non-deposition setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the \n     Senate to prohibit the House and the President from doing the \n     investigation necessary to determine whether they wish to \n     call witnesses and which witnesses to list in their motions.\n     III. This court should grant an order requiring Ms. Lewinsky \n         to comply with the immunity agreement or forfeit its \n         protection\n       Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to \n     determine whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision \n     of this Agreement.'' Immunity Agreement para. 30. ``[A] \n     declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only when it \n     will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal \n     relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the \n     uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving right to the \n     proceeding.'' Tierney v. Schweiker, 718 F.2d 456 (D.C. Cir. \n     1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, a \n     declaratory judgment will resolve the uncertainty arising \n     from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. Lewinsky by \n     settling whether she has the right to refuse to be debriefed \n     without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement.\n       Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a \n     party to a contract intends conduct that may be a breach: `` \n     `(A) party to a contract is not compelled to wait until he \n     has committed an act which the other party asserts will \n     constitute a breach, but may seek relief by declaratory \n     judgment and have the controversy adjudicated in order that \n     he may avoid the risk of damages or other untoward \n     consequence.' '' (Application of President & Directors of \n     Georgetown College, Inc.) 331 F.2d 1000, 1002 n.6 (D.C. Cir. \n     1964) (quoting Keener Oil & Gas v. Consolidated Gas Utilities \n     Corp., 190 F.2d 985, 989 (10th Cir. 1951)); see Gilbert, \n     Segall & Young v. Bank of Montreal, 785 F. Supp. 453. 462 \n     (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Fine v. Property Damage Appraisers, Inc., \n     393 F. Supp. 1304, 1309-10 (E.D. La. 1975). Accordingly, this \n     Court has the power to issue a declaratory judgment before \n     Ms. Lewinsky's actions become irreversible.\n     IV. Conclusion\n       The Immunity Agreement plainly requires that Ms. Lewinsky \n     allow herself to be debriefed by any institution at the \n     request of the OIC. Ms. Lewinsky has the right to insist that \n     the OIC conduct the debriefing, but she must comply with the \n     plain terms of the Immunity Agreement. Accordingly, the \n     United States respectfully requests that this Court enter an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to debriefing by the \n     House.\n       The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its \n     motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House \n     has stressed its need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend. \n     Accordingly, the United States respectfully requests that \n     this Court act on this motion as an emergency matter. \n     Specifically, we request a hearing on this matter today.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n     Kenneth W. Starr,\n       Independent Counsel.\n     Robert J. Bittman,\n       Deputy Independent Counsel.\n     Joseph M. Ditkoff,\n       Associate Independent Counsel.\n     Richard C. Killough,\n       Assistant Independent Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Manager Hyde: We understand that the Office of \n     Independent Counsel, on behalf of the House Managers, sought \n     a court order to compel Ms. Lewinsky to submit to an \n     interview with the Managers in preparation for her possible \n     testimony. We further understand that Chief Judge Norma \n     Holloway Johnson has granted the order sought by the \n     Independent Counsel.\n       As you know, Senate Resolution 16, which was passed by a \n     100-0 vote just over two weeks ago, expressly deferred any \n     consideration or action related to additional witness \n     testimony until after opening presentations, a question-and-\n     answer period and an affirmative vote to compel such \n     testimony. These actions by the Managers, undertaken without \n     notice to the Senate or the President's Counsel, raise \n     profound questions of fundamental fairness and undermine the \n     ability of this body to control the discovery procedures that \n     will take place under the imprimatur of its authority.\n       In light of these concerns, we ask that you withdraw any \n     and all requests to Mr. Starr that he assist your efforts to \n     interview Ms. Lewinsky. The Senate, in a matter of days, will \n     have an opportunity to formally address this issue pursuant \n     to the procedures established by Senate Resolution 16. \n     Moreover, we insist that you take no action related to the \n     proposed interview of any witness until such time as the \n     Senate has given you the authority to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid.\n       [Also signed by 43 Senators.]\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Democratic Leader: I am in receipt of your letter \n     of today expressing your concern with the House of \n     Representatives' request to interview Monica Lewinsky.\n       It has always been the position of the House Managers that \n     a full trial with the benefit of relevant witnesses is in the \n     best interest of the Senate and the American people. \n     Representatives of President Clinton and many Senators have \n     publicly stated that they want the Senate to preclude the \n     testimony of witnesses. Many other Senators have made it \n     clear that they prefer the witness lists for both sides to be \n     sharply focused and limited to only the most relevant \n     witnesses. The Managers have been mindful of these Senators' \n     concerns.\n       It is clear that the two most important witnesses in this \n     trial are President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. Yesterday, I \n     wrote to Majority Leader Lott and you to express the \n     Managers' willingness to participate in the fair examination \n     of the President if the Senate chooses to invite him to \n     testify. The presentation of the President's counsel ended \n     just two days ago. We are in the process of evaluating that \n     presentation and determining what witnesses we will request \n     the Senate to call. We believe that interviewing Ms. Lewinsky \n     will help us make this determination. Counsel for the \n     President may have already interviewed witnesses or may wish \n     to interview witnesses they will propose to the Senate. That \n     is their prerogative. The Senate has required us to submit a \n     proffer of anticipated testimony of any proposed witnesses. \n     Interviews of potential witnesses will assist the parties in \n     providing the Senate with informative proffers.\n       The House of Representatives has not violated S. Res. 16. \n     When the House passed H. Res. 10 appointing the Mangers, it \n     authorized that the Managers may ``in connection with the \n     preparation and the conduct of the trial, exhibit the \n     articles of impeachment to the Senate and take all other \n     actions necessary, which may include * * * sending for \n     persons and papers . . . .'' Implicit in this authority is \n     the ability to conduct interviews and gather additional \n     information relevant to the articles of impeachment.\n       The Managers, who represent the House of Representatives, \n     retain powers separate and apart from the Senate. The \n     Managers are not, just as the President's Counsel are not, an \n     office or subset of the Senate. The Managers, like the \n     President's Counsel, may conduct activities, such as further \n     investigation and legal research, that are not specifically \n     authorized by the Senate.\n       Senate Resolution 16 does not prohibit the Managers from \n     conducting further investigation or interviews of witnesses. \n     If the resolution was intended to restrict the Managers in \n     this way, we believe that it would violate principles of \n     bicameralism, the ability of each House to establish its own \n     rules of procedure, and would therefore be an \n     unconstitutional infringement on the prerogatives of the \n     House.\n       Implicit in the right of the Managers to report to the \n     House amendments to articles of impeachment, is the right of \n     the Managers to receive and evaluate additional information. \n     For example, if the Managers received additional exculpatory \n     or inculpatory information, they could file amendments to the \n     articles of impeachment in the House.\n       Senate Resolution 16 set a schedule for deciding whether to \n     depose witnesses. The decision to depose witnesses is subject \n     to a request from the House Managers. The House Managers have \n     decided that they need to talk with Ms. Lewinsky before \n     making a recommendation to the Senate to depose her. The \n     action of the House Managers is not unusual. It is not \n     unfair, and it is not contrary to the rules of the Senate.\n       With all due respect to the Senate, the rules and the \n     constitutional principles of bicameralism do not require that \n     the House obtain the permission of the Senate merely to \n     conduct an interview of a potential witness. A decision to \n     merely interview a witness as opposed to conducting a \n     deposition, does not interfere with the Senate's ability to \n     control the procedures set forth under S. Res. 16.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Henry J. Hyde,\n\n                                  On behalf of the Managers on the\n                             Part of the House of Representatives.\n\n [From the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, \n                        Henry J.

Judge Johnson ruled that \n     she has an obligation to cooperate in the search for truth.\n       ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important \n     than it is now.

She did not \n     direct an order in any sense other than to interpret the \n     meaning of the agreement, which we asked her to interpret. \n     So, I want it to be very, very clear that the judge was \n     simply acting at our request to interpret the terms of the \n     agreement, which we believe are quite clear.\n       QUESTION: Senator Harkin said yesterday that Judge Johnson \n     may not have acted on, you know, constitutionally. Do you \n     have any comment on that?\n       STARR: Well we think that we have taken the appropriate \n     action in going to the court and the court acted \n     appropriately in interpreting the agreement, which is all \n     that she did. So if there is an issue, the issue has to be \n     one that's entrusted to the wisdom of the Senate. And their \n     relationship with the House managers.\n       But from our standpoint, the agreement we felt was clear, \n     we asked the judge to determine whether our interpretation of \n     the agreement was clear.

Chase, who was acquitted, are relevant to the \n     impeachment of President Clinton.\n       On the day that Justice Chase was acquitted in 1805, John \n     Quincy Adams wrote the following:\n       ``. . . This was a party prosecution, and is issued in the \n     unexpected and total disappointment of those by whom it was \n     brought forward. It has exhibited the Senate of the United \n     States fulfilling the most important purpose of its \n     institution. . . It has proved that a sense of justice is yet \n     strong enough to overpower the furies of factions; but it \n     has, at the same time, shown the wisdom and necessity of that \n     provision in the Constitution which requires the concurrence \n     of two-thirds for conviction upon impeachments.''\n\n                               Appendix L\n\n\n Additional Statement of Senator Carl Levin regarding the Independent \n                                Counsel\n\n       Mr. President, four and one half years ago, the Special \n     Court under the independent counsel law appointed Kenneth \n     Starr to investigate certain specific and credible \n     allegations concerning President Clinton's involvement in the \n     Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association of Little Rock, \n     Arkansas. Three and half years later--and after what appears \n     to be the most thorough criminal investigation of a sitting \n     President, Mr. Starr was unable to find any criminal \n     wrongdoing on the part of the President in what came to be \n     known as ``Whitewater.'' A similar conclusion was reached by \n     Mr. Starr with respect to additional investigations assigned \n     to Mr. Starr along the way--namely, allegations with respect \n     to the White House use of FBI files and the discharge of \n     White House employees from the White House Travel Office.\n       A year ago Mr. Starr's investigation was coming to an end. \n     That's when Linda Tripp walked through Mr. Starr's door with \n     promises of taped phone conversations between Ms. Tripp and \n     Monica Lewinsky about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with \n     President Clinton. And what was the alleged crime? That \n     President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were about to lie about \n     their relationship--if they were asked about it by the \n     attorneys for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case \n     against President Clinton. Mr. Starr had to know that the \n     relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky \n     had been a consensual one. Mr. Starr had to know that, \n     because Ms. Tripp was informed by Ms. Lewinsky of every \n     aspect of her relationship with President Clinton. And at \n     this point--January 12, 1998--neither Monica Lewinsky nor \n     President Clinton had been deposed.\n       I am convinced that no ordinary federal prosecutor, if \n     confronted with the same situation involving a private \n     citizen, would have pursued this case. But Mr. Starr was no \n     ordinary federal prosecutor. Without jurisdiction with \n     respect to these matters, he immediately gave Ms. Tripp \n     immunity in exchange for access to her tapes, and he wired \n     her to tape a private luncheon conversation with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. Shortly after Mr. Starr wired Ms. Tripp, he \n     confronted Ms. Lewinsky and, according to her, threatened her \n     with 27 years in prison and the prosecution of her mother in \n     order to get her cooperation and to tape Betty Currie, the \n     President, and/or Vernon Jordan. Mr. Starr brought his \n     enormous criminal investigative resources to bear on \n     testimony yet to be given in a civil lawsuit involving a \n     consensual, sexual relationship.\n       At the time Ms. Lewinsky was threatened by Mr. Starr, her \n     affidavit in the Jones case had not been filed. She was still \n     in a position to retrieve it or amend it. Also, President \n     Clinton had not been deposed. He had not given his testimony \n     in the Paula Jones suit. In effect, Mr. Starr and his agents \n     lay in wait--waiting for the President to be surprised at the \n     Jones deposition with information about Monica Lewinsky. And \n     how did that information about Monica Lewinsky get in the \n     hands of the Jones attorneys? Ms. Tripp gave them the \n     information. And she was able to do that even though she was \n     under an immunity arrangement with Mr. Starr, because--as Mr. \n     Starr acknowledged to the House Judiciary Committee under \n     questioning--Mr. Starr's agents never directed Ms. Tripp to \n     keep her information confidential, even though Mr. Starr had \n     a major concern that the Lewinsky matter would leak to the \n     press. Mr. Starr's agents did not tell Ms. Tripp not to talk \n     to the Jones attorneys or anyone else in order to ensure that \n     the story would not leak to the press.\n       So the enormous criminal investigative resources of the \n     federal government were brought to bear on the President of \n     the United States to catch him by surprise in a future \n     deposition in a civil proceeding on a matter peripheral to \n     the lawsuit, prior to any of the suspected unlawful conduct.\n       Once the President testified in that civil suit, Mr. Starr \n     convened a grand jury to investigate the truthfulness of Mr. \n     Clinton's testimony. Again, using the virtually unlimited \n     resources of the federal government with respect to a \n     criminal investigation, Mr. Starr called countless witnesses \n     before the grand jury--recalling numerous witnesses multiple \n     times. Betty Currie testified on 5 different occasions; so \n     did Vernon Jordan. Monica Lewinsky testified 3 times and was \n     interviewed over 20 separate times. I don't believe any \n     regular prosecutor would have invested the time and money and \n     resources in the kind of investigation that Kenneth Starr \n     did.\n       At the end, Mr. Starr wrote a report arguing for \n     impeachment to the House of Representatives. He didn't just \n     impartially forward evidence he thought may demonstrate \n     possible impeachable offenses.\n       The Starr report spared nothing. Lacking good judgment and \n     balance, the Starr report contained a large amount of \n     salacious detail, and skipped over or dismissed important \n     exculpatory evidence, such as Monica Lewinsky's statement \n     that no one asked her to lie and no one promised her a job \n     for her silence. Mr. Starr violated the standards enunciated \n     by Judge Sirica when he addressed the status of the grand \n     jury report in the Watergate matter. In that case, Judge \n     Sirica wrote in granting Leon Jaworski, the Watergate \n     prosecutor, the right to forward grand jury information to \n     the House of Representatives:\n\n       ``It draws no accusatory conclusions. . . It contains no \n     recommendations, advice or statements that infringe on the \n     prerogatives of other branches of government. . . It renders \n     no moral or social judgments. The Report is a simple and \n     straightforward compilation of information gathered by the \n     Grand Jury, and no more. . . The Grand Jury has obviously \n     taken care to assure that its Report contains no \n     objectionable features, and has throughout acted in the \n     interests of fairness. The Grand Jury having thus respected \n     its own limitations and the rights of others, the Court ought \n     to respect the Jury's exercise of its prerogatives.''

The Starr Report violates almost every one of the \n     standards laid out by Judge Sirica in the Watergate case.\n       The House of Representatives the Judiciary Committee then \n     almost immediately released the Starr report and the \n     thousands of pages of evidence to the public.\n       Because of that release--enormous damage had been done to \n     the public's sense of decorum and to appropriate limits \n     between public and private life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1794-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1794-S1799]\n   APPENDICES A-L TO SENATOR LEVIN'S IMPEACHMENT TRIAL STATEMENT OF \n                           FEBRUARY 12, 1999\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

In both of those cases, the \n     Judges' attorneys were given extensive discovery, including \n     Justice Department files, to prepare their defense. See \n     letter of Senator Wyche Fowler, Chairman of the Senate \n     Impeachment Trial Committee, and letter of Professor Terence \n     Anderson, University of Miami School of Law, below:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1989.\n     John C. Keeney,\n     Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, \n         Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Keeney: As Chairman of the Senate Impeachment \n     Trial Committee on the Articles of Impeachment against Judge \n     Nixon, I write to request the Department's assistance in the \n     Committee's efforts to assure that Judge Nixon receives a \n     fair trial in the Senate. The Committee has determined that \n     it would make a useful contribution to the trial process if \n     the Department were willing to permit the Committee, through \n     its staff, to review the documents (excluding grand jury \n     materials governed by Rule 6(e)) in the possession of the \n     Department, including those possessed by the Federal Bureau \n     of Investigation, that were requested by Judge Nixon in his \n     June 1, 1989 letter to the Attorney General, which was the \n     subject of your response on June 21, 1989.\n       The review would be consistent with that conducted in the \n     case of the Hastings impeachment matter. That is, the focus \n     of the review would be to determine if there is evidence that \n     the investigations were conducted in a manner intended to \n     mislead a court or trier of fact as to Judge Nixon's guilt or \n     innocence. In the event that it is determined that particular \n     documents should properly be made part of the pending \n     impeachment proceedings, and accordingly made available to \n     the parties for use at trial, the committee would hear from \n     the Department prior to disclosing any documents that you \n     believe contain particularly sensitive matters, so that we \n     may address any continuing concerns that you have. No \n     documents or portions of documents would be made available to \n     the parties without the consent of the Department.\n       Your expeditious response to this request would be most \n     helpful to the committee in attempting to complete discovery \n     by July 31st.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wyche Fowler, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n                            The University of Miami School of Law,\n                               Coral Gables, FL, January 28, 1999.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n                   Discovery Precedents From Hastings\n\n       Dear Senator Levin: Ms. Linda Gustitus asked that I \n     describe the process by which and the materials to which I \n     was given access as counsel for then Judge Hastings during \n     the impeachment trial proceedings before the United States \n     Senate. After the matter was referred to an Impeachment Trial \n     Committee, I submitted requests for production of documents \n     to the House, to the Investigating Committee of the Judicial \n     Council of the Eleventh Circuit, to the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, and the Justice Department. Over the initial \n     objections of the House Managers, at the ``request'' of the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee I received documents from all but \n     the Justice Department. In lieu of direct production, the \n     Impeachment Trial Committee examined the sensitive Justice \n     Department materials to determine what should be supplied. I \n     was also permitted to take at least three discovery \n     depositions. The proceedings that resulted in this production \n     are reported in Report of the Senate Impeachment Trial \n     Committee on the Articles of Impeachment Against Judge Alcee \n     L. Hastings, S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I (Pretrial Matters).\n       By way of illustrations I enclose an appendix to a \n     memorandum that I submitted to the Impeachment Trial \n     Committee. That appendix describes in some detail the \n     materials that I received from the FBI and my estimate that \n     in the aggregate the production amounted to about 16,000. The \n     enclosed copy was reproduced from S. Hrg. 101-194, Pt. I at \n     433-436. Please let me know if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Terence J. Anderson.\n                                                 Professor of Law.\n\n                               Appendix E\n\n       Many of us in the Senate thought the House of \n     Representatives failed to meet its responsibilities by not \n     calling witnesses before the House Judiciary Committee. A \n     review of impeachments shows that in every impeachment but \n     the one (where the subject of the impeachment was mentally \n     incompetent and the House relied on the record of his \n     decisions as a judge), the House called fact witnesses. \n     According to information obtained by my staff from the \n     Congressional Research Service, there have been 16 \n     impeachments by the House. 14 of those impeachments have \n     resulted in trials in the Senate; two did not because the \n     impeached officials resigned.\n       15 of those impeachments had fact witnesses in the House; \n     one didn't. That was the case of Judge Pickering. He was \n     impeached for being mentally incapacitated. There were \n     charges of drunkenness and ``ungentlemanly language'' in the \n     courtroom. The articles against him, however, all dealt with \n     his rulings and decisions that ``proved'' he was mentally \n     incompetent. During the House inquiry, a number of affidavits \n     were presented.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Appendix F\n\n       Independent counsel Kenneth Starr intervened in the Senate \n     impeachment trial by obtaining a court order addressed to \n     Monica Lewinsky requiring her to meet privately with House \n     Managers, based on a motion and ex parte hearing with no \n     notice to the Senate counsel or White House counsel. The \n     independent counsel then mischaracterized his own action in \n     seeking that order, describing it as seeking an \n     ``interpretation'' rather than an ``order''.\n       See the letters to Kenneth Starr, Robert Bittman, Jacob \n     Stein, & Robert Bittman; the Emergency Motion on Immunity \n     Agreement; the letter to Congressman Henry Hyde; the letter \n     to Sen. Daschle; Congressman Hyde's press release; the order \n     of Judge Norma Holloway Johnson and the transcript of Mr. \n     Starr's remarks as follow:\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 21, 1999.\n     Hon. Kenneth W. Starr,\n     Office of Independent Counsel,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Re: Interview of Monica Lewinsky.\n\n       Dear Independent Counsel Starr: I am writing to you as the \n     Lead Manager of the Managers of the Impeachment Trial of \n     William Jefferson Clinton, currently underway in the United \n     States Senate. We are in the\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\n     process of selecting witnesses for testimony in these \n     proceedings. The attorneys for Monica Lewinsky have declined \n     to make her available for an interview.\n       We have reviewed a copy of Ms. Lewinsky's Immunity \n     Agreement. Pursuant to paragraph 1(c) of that Agreement, it \n     would appear that she is required to submit to interviews and \n     debriefings if so requested by the Office of Independent \n     Counsel.\n       We would like to arrange an interview with Ms. Lewinsky \n     prior to any such testimony. We would be happy to accommodate \n     her wishes as to the precise time and location of that \n     interview. However, it is important that this interview be \n     scheduled to take place on the earliest possible date, \n     specifically Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. Your assistance \n     with this interview will be appreciated.\n       Thank you for your prompt attention.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Henry H.

Bittman, Esquire\n     Deputy Independent Counsel, Office of the Independent \n         Counsel, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: In your call today you mentioned that the \n     managers requested Ms. Lewinsky's cooperation by way of an \n     interview. As I told you, we believe it is inappropriate for \n     Ms. Lewinsky to be placed in the position of a partisan--\n     meeting with one side and not the other--in this unique \n     proceeding. Therefore, we have recommended against interviews \n     with either side.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jacob A. Stein.\n     Plato Cacheris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Independent Counsel,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 21, 1999.\n     Jacob A. Stein, Esq.\n     Stein, Mitchell & Mezines,\n      Washington, DC.\n     Plato Cacheris, Esq.\n     Law Offices of Plato Cacheris,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Jake and Plato: Pursuant to her Immunity Agreement \n     with this Office, we hereby request that Monica Lewinsky meet \n     for an interview with the House of Representatives' \n     Impeachment Managers this Friday, Saturday, or Sunday, \n     January 22, 23, or 24, 1999.\n       As you will recall, both parties contemplated congressional \n     proceedings at the time we entered into the Immunity \n     Agreement. The Agreement specifically requires Ms. Lewinsky \n     to ``testify truthfully . . . in any . . . congressional \n     proceedings.'' It further requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request,'' and stipulates that these interviews may include \n     ``representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require.''\n       While I understand Ms. Lewinsky's misgivings, I must \n     disagree with one statement in your letter to me today: your \n     assertion that submitting to an interview would make Ms. \n     Lewinsky into a partisan. The Managers are acting on behalf \n     of the House of Representatives as a whole, not on behalf of \n     a political party. There task is constitutional in nature.\n       Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert J. Bittman,\n     Deputy Independent Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Stein, Mitchell & Mezines,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 22, 1999.\n     Robert J. Bittman, Esquire\n     Office of the Independent Counsel\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bob: \n       1. We have your January 21, 1999 letter.\n       2. The Agreement does not require Ms. Lewinsky to be \n     interviewed by the House Managers or any Congressional body.\n       3. Paragraph 1.C. of the Agreement states: ``Ms. Lewinsky \n     will be fully debriefed concerning her knowledge of and \n     participation in any activities within the OIC's \n     jurisdiction. This debriefing will be conducted by the OIC, \n     including attorneys, law enforcement agents, and \n     representatives of any other institutions as the OIC may \n     require. Ms. Lewinsky will make herself available for any \n     interviews upon reasonable requests.''\n       4. This paragraph deals with OIC debriefings, not OIC's \n     acting as an agent for others.\n       5. The Senate itself has provided its own rules for witness \n     interviews. As we understand them, there first must be a \n     deposition with equal access. As of now the Senate has not \n     voted for depositions.\n       6. Ms. Lewinsky will, of course, respond to a subpoena to \n     appear and testify before the Senate. Yesterday, we raised \n     with you the issue of immunity for any proposed congressional \n     testimony. You opined that your office could grant such \n     immunity in conformance with Title 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 6002, \n     6005. It is our understanding that only the Senate by \n     majority vote can do that. We would appreciate your supplying \n     your legal authority for your position.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jabob A. Stein.\n     Plato Cacheris.\n                                  ____\n\n\n [In the United District Court for the District of Columbia, Misc. No. \n                              99-  (NHJ)]\n\n                      In Re Grand Jury Proceedings\n\n\n  emergency motion of the united states of america for enforcement of \n                           immunity agreement\n\n       The United States of America, by Kenneth W. Starr, \n     Independent Counsel, respectfully submits this motion for an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to comply with the terms of her \n     Immunity Agreement (the ``Agreement'') with the Office of the \n     Independent Counsel (``OIC''). Ms. Lewinsky has refused an \n     OIC request that she be debriefed by the House of \n     Representatives, as required by the Agreement. The United \n     States respectfully requests that this Court orders Ms. \n     Lewinsky to comply with the Agreement by allowing herself to \n     be debriefed.\n     I. Factual background\n       As this Court is no doubt aware, the United States Senate \n     is currently conducting an Impeachment Trial of the President \n     of the United States. According to public reports, it is \n     expected that the House will be required to submit to the \n     Senate its motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, \n     January 25. Again according to public reports, some potential \n     witnesses have spoken with the House Managers as the Managers \n     attempt to determine which witnesses should be mentioned in \n     their motion to the Senate.\n       On January 21, 1999, House Judiciary Committee Chairman \n     Henry J. Hyde, on behalf of the House of Representatives, as \n     represented by its duly-appointed Managers, asked for the \n     OIC's assistance in having Ms. Lewinsky debriefed by the \n     House. See Letter from Henry J. Hyde to Kenneth W. Starr \n     (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment A). The House stressed that it \n     needs this debriefing to occur no later than Sunday, January \n     24.\n       That same day, the OIC sent a letter to Ms. Lewinsky's \n     counsel requesting that Ms. Lewinsky allow herself to be \n     debriefed by the House Managers. See Letter from Robert J. \n     Bittman, Deputy Independent Counsel, to Jacob A. Stein, Esq. \n     and Plato Cacheris, Esq. (Jan. 21, 1999) (Attachment C). At \n     approximately 1:20 p.m. this afternoon, Ms. Lewinsky informed \n     the OIC that she does not intend to comply with this request. \n     See Letter from Jacob A. Stein and Plato Cacheris to Robert \n     J. Bittman (Jan. 22, 1999) (Attachment D).\n     II. The immunity agreement plainly requires Ms. Lewinsky to \n         be debriefed by any institution that the OIC specifies\n       Ordinary contract law principles govern immunity \n     agreements. See In re Federal Grand Jury Proceedings, Misc. \n     No. 98-59 (NHJ), slip op. at 12 (D.D.C. May 1, 1998) (under \n     seal) (``Courts generally interpret immunity and proffer \n     agreements, like plea agreements, under principles of \n     contract law.''), appeal dismissed sub nom. In re Sealed \n     Case, 144 F.3d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (per curiam); accord \n     United States v. Black, 776 F.2d 1321, 1326 (6th Cir. 1985) \n     (``Like a plea agreement, an immunity agreement is \n     contractual in nature and may be interpreted according to \n     contract law principles.''); United States v. Irvine, 756 \n     F.2d 708, 710 (9th Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (``Generally \n     speaking, a cooperation-immunity agreement is contractual) in \n     nature and subject to contract law standards.''); United \n     States v. Hembree, 754 F.2d 314, 317 (10th Cir. 1985) \n     (characterizing an immunity agreement as ``simply a \n     contract'').\n       Under contract law, an agreement is interpreted according \n     to its plain terms. See Nicholson v. United States, 29 Fed. \n     Cl. 180, 191 (1993). The operative portion of the Immunity \n     Agreement states: ``C. Ms. Lewinsky will be fully debriefed \n     concerning her knowledge of and participation in any \n     activities within the OIC's jurisdiction. This debriefing \n     will be conducted by the OIC, including attorneys, law \n     enforcement agents, and representatives of any other \n     institutions as the OIC may require. Ms. Lewinsky will make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' Immunity Agreement para. 1.C (emphasis added) \n     (Attachment E). This provision follows paragraph 1.B, which \n     expressly requires Ms. Lewinsky to ``testify truthfully . . . \n     in . . . congressional proceedings.''\n       By the plain terms of the Agreement, Ms. Lewinsky has \n     agreed to be debriefed by representatives of any institution, \n     when so required by the OIC. She is also required to ``make \n     herself available for any interviews upon reasonable \n     request.'' The duly-appointed House Managers represent the \n     House of Representatives, which plainly is an institution. \n     The OIC has unambiguously requested that Ms. Lewinsky submit \n     to each debriefing. Accordingly, Ms. Lewinsky must allow \n     herself to be debriefed by the House Managers or she will \n     have violated the Agreement.\n       To be sure, Ms. Lewinsky has the right to have her \n     ``debriefing . . . conducted by the OIC.'' The OIC, of \n     course, is fully willing to conduct these debriefings, if Ms. \n     Lewinsky so desires. The suggestion in her counsel's letter \n     that this provision is void if the OIC is ``acting as an \n     agent for other,'' Attachment D at para. 4, is contrary to \n     the Agreement, as there is no such limitation on Ms. \n     Lewinsky's duties. A party to an agreement may not invent \n     clauses to a contract that are not contained therein.\n       In any event, the OIC is not acting as an agent for the \n     House Managers. The OIC has its own, continuing duty to \n     provide the House with information relating to impeachment. \n     See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 595(c).\n       Ms. Lewinsky's counsel's other suggestion--that a \n     debriefing would be contrary to\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n     Senate Rules, see Attachment D at para. 5--is equally without \n     merit. Senate Resolution 16 (106th Cong.) states, in relevant \n     part: ``If the Senate agrees to allow either the House or the \n     President to call witnesses, the witnesses shall first be \n     deposed and the Senate shall decide after deposition which \n     witnesses shall testify, pursuant to the impeachment rules.'' \n     Although it is plain that depositions may not be conducted \n     absent a vote of the Senate, nothing in this resolution \n     restricts the ability of the House to debrief witnesses in a \n     non-deposition setting. Indeed, it would be strange for the \n     Senate to prohibit the House and the President from doing the \n     investigation necessary to determine whether they wish to \n     call witnesses and which witnesses to list in their motions.\n     III. This court should grant an order requiring Ms. Lewinsky \n         to comply with the immunity agreement or forfeit its \n         protection\n       Under the Agreement, this Court has the authority to \n     determine whether Ms. Lewinsky has ``violated any provision \n     of this Agreement.'' Immunity Agreement para. 30. ``[A] \n     declaratory judgment will ordinarily be granted only when it \n     will either serve a useful purpose in clarifying the legal \n     relations in issue or terminate and afford relief from the \n     uncertainty, insecurity, and controversy giving right to the \n     proceeding.'' Tierney v. Schweiker, 718 F.2d 456 (D.C. Cir. \n     1983) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, a \n     declaratory judgment will resolve the uncertainty arising \n     from this controversy between the OIC and Ms. Lewinsky by \n     settling whether she has the right to refuse to be debriefed \n     without forfeiting the protections of the Agreement.\n       Indeed, declaratory judgment is a common remedy when a \n     party to a contract intends conduct that may be a breach: `` \n     `(A) party to a contract is not compelled to wait until he \n     has committed an act which the other party asserts will \n     constitute a breach, but may seek relief by declaratory \n     judgment and have the controversy adjudicated in order that \n     he may avoid the risk of damages or other untoward \n     consequence.' '' (Application of President & Directors of \n     Georgetown College, Inc.) 331 F.2d 1000, 1002 n.6 (D.C. Cir. \n     1964) (quoting Keener Oil & Gas v. Consolidated Gas Utilities \n     Corp., 190 F.2d 985, 989 (10th Cir. 1951)); see Gilbert, \n     Segall & Young v. Bank of Montreal, 785 F. Supp. 453. 462 \n     (S.D.N.Y. 1992); Fine v. Property Damage Appraisers, Inc., \n     393 F. Supp. 1304, 1309-10 (E.D. La. 1975). Accordingly, this \n     Court has the power to issue a declaratory judgment before \n     Ms. Lewinsky's actions become irreversible.\n     IV. Conclusion\n       The Immunity Agreement plainly requires that Ms. Lewinsky \n     allow herself to be debriefed by any institution at the \n     request of the OIC. Ms. Lewinsky has the right to insist that \n     the OIC conduct the debriefing, but she must comply with the \n     plain terms of the Immunity Agreement. Accordingly, the \n     United States respectfully requests that this Court enter an \n     order requiring Ms. Lewinsky to submit to debriefing by the \n     House.\n       The Senate's schedule requires the House to submit its \n     motion to call witnesses as early as Monday, and the House \n     has stressed its need to debrief Ms. Lewinsky this weekend. \n     Accordingly, the United States respectfully requests that \n     this Court act on this motion as an emergency matter. \n     Specifically, we request a hearing on this matter today.\n       Respectfully submitted,\n     Kenneth W.

Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Manager Hyde: We understand that the Office of \n     Independent Counsel, on behalf of the House Managers, sought \n     a court order to compel Ms. Lewinsky to submit to an \n     interview with the Managers in preparation for her possible \n     testimony. We further understand that Chief Judge Norma \n     Holloway Johnson has granted the order sought by the \n     Independent Counsel.\n       As you know, Senate Resolution 16, which was passed by a \n     100-0 vote just over two weeks ago, expressly deferred any \n     consideration or action related to additional witness \n     testimony until after opening presentations, a question-and-\n     answer period and an affirmative vote to compel such \n     testimony. These actions by the Managers, undertaken without \n     notice to the Senate or the President's Counsel, raise \n     profound questions of fundamental fairness and undermine the \n     ability of this body to control the discovery procedures that \n     will take place under the imprimatur of its authority.\n       In light of these concerns, we ask that you withdraw any \n     and all requests to Mr. Starr that he assist your efforts to \n     interview Ms. Lewinsky. The Senate, in a matter of days, will \n     have an opportunity to formally address this issue pursuant \n     to the procedures established by Senate Resolution 16. \n     Moreover, we insist that you take no action related to the \n     proposed interview of any witness until such time as the \n     Senate has given you the authority to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Harry Reid.\n       [Also signed by 43 Senators.]\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 January 23, 1999.\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Democratic Leader: I am in receipt of your letter \n     of today expressing your concern with the House of \n     Representatives' request to interview Monica Lewinsky.\n       It has always been the position of the House Managers that \n     a full trial with the benefit of relevant witnesses is in the \n     best interest of the Senate and the American people. \n     Representatives of President Clinton and many Senators have \n     publicly stated that they want the Senate to preclude the \n     testimony of witnesses. Many other Senators have made it \n     clear that they prefer the witness lists for both sides to be \n     sharply focused and limited to only the most relevant \n     witnesses. The Managers have been mindful of these Senators' \n     concerns.\n       It is clear that the two most important witnesses in this \n     trial are President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. Yesterday, I \n     wrote to Majority Leader Lott and you to express the \n     Managers' willingness to participate in the fair examination \n     of the President if the Senate chooses to invite him to \n     testify. The presentation of the President's counsel ended \n     just two days ago. We are in the process of evaluating that \n     presentation and determining what witnesses we will request \n     the Senate to call. We believe that interviewing Ms. Lewinsky \n     will help us make this determination. Counsel for the \n     President may have already interviewed witnesses or may wish \n     to interview witnesses they will propose to the Senate. That \n     is their prerogative. The Senate has required us to submit a \n     proffer of anticipated testimony of any proposed witnesses. \n     Interviews of potential witnesses will assist the parties in \n     providing the Senate with informative proffers.\n       The House of Representatives has not violated S. Res. 16. \n     When the House passed H. Res. 10 appointing the Mangers, it \n     authorized that the Managers may ``in connection with the \n     preparation and the conduct of the trial, exhibit the \n     articles of impeachment to the Senate and take all other \n     actions necessary, which may include * * * sending for \n     persons and papers . . . .'' Implicit in this authority is \n     the ability to conduct interviews and gather additional \n     information relevant to the articles of impeachment.\n       The Managers, who represent the House of Representatives, \n     retain powers separate and apart from the Senate. The \n     Managers are not, just as the President's Counsel are not, an \n     office or subset of the Senate. The Managers, like the \n     President's Counsel, may conduct activities, such as further \n     investigation and legal research, that are not specifically \n     authorized by the Senate.\n       Senate Resolution 16 does not prohibit the Managers from \n     conducting further investigation or interviews of witnesses. \n     If the resolution was intended to restrict the Managers in \n     this way, we believe that it would violate principles of \n     bicameralism, the ability of each House to establish its own \n     rules of procedure, and would therefore be an \n     unconstitutional infringement on the prerogatives of the \n     House.\n       Implicit in the right of the Managers to report to the \n     House amendments to articles of impeachment, is the right of \n     the Managers to receive and evaluate additional information. \n     For example, if the Managers received additional exculpatory \n     or inculpatory information, they could file amendments to the \n     articles of impeachment in the House.\n       Senate Resolution 16 set a schedule for deciding whether to \n     depose witnesses. The decision to depose witnesses is subject \n     to a request from the House Managers. The House Managers have \n     decided that they need to talk with Ms. Lewinsky before \n     making a recommendation to the Senate to depose her. The \n     action of the House Managers is not unusual. It is not \n     unfair, and it is not contrary to the rules of the Senate.\n       With all due respect to the Senate, the rules and the \n     constitutional principles of bicameralism do not require that \n     the House obtain the permission of the Senate merely to \n     conduct an interview of a potential witness. A decision to \n     merely interview a witness as opposed to conducting a \n     deposition, does not interfere with the Senate's ability to \n     control the procedures set forth under S. Res. 16.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Henry J. Hyde,\n\n                                  On behalf of the Managers on the\n                             Part of the House of Representatives.\n\n [From the U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on the Judiciary, \n                        Henry J. Hyde, Chairman]\n\n                  Managers' Response to Judge's Ruling\n\n       (Washington, D.C.)--Paul McNulty, chief spokesman for the \n     House Managers, made the following statement today following \n     Judge Johnson's ruling that Monica Lewinsky must cooperate \n     with the managers' request for an interview, in keeping with \n     her immunity agreement:\n       ``Monica Lewinsky received extraordinary protection in \n     exchange for her truthful testimony. Judge Johnson ruled that \n     she has an obligation to cooperate in the search for truth.\n       ``Ms. Lewinsky's testimony has never been more important \n     than it is now.

And we \n     responded as I felt that we were obligated to do to that \n     request. And we then took what I felt was the appropriate \n     action and we went to court.\n       I want to make it very clear that Chief Judge Johnson has \n     only interpreted the agreement between Ms. Lewinsky, who's \n     advised by her very able lawyers, and our office. She did not \n     direct an order in any sense other than to interpret the \n     meaning of the agreement, which we asked her to interpret. \n     So, I want it to be very, very clear that the judge was \n     simply acting at our request to interpret the terms of the \n     agreement, which we believe are quite clear.\n       QUESTION: Senator Harkin said yesterday that Judge Johnson \n     may not have acted on, you know, constitutionally. Do you \n     have any comment on that?\n       STARR: Well we think that we have taken the appropriate \n     action in going to the court and the court acted \n     appropriately in interpreting the agreement, which is all \n     that she did. So if there is an issue, the issue has to be \n     one that's entrusted to the wisdom of the Senate.

Three and half years later--and after what appears \n     to be the most thorough criminal investigation of a sitting \n     President, Mr. Starr was unable to find any criminal \n     wrongdoing on the part of the President in what came to be \n     known as ``Whitewater.'' A similar conclusion was reached by \n     Mr. Starr with respect to additional investigations assigned \n     to Mr. Starr along the way--namely, allegations with respect \n     to the White House use of FBI files and the discharge of \n     White House employees from the White House Travel Office.\n       A year ago Mr. Starr's investigation was coming to an end. \n     That's when Linda Tripp walked through Mr. Starr's door with \n     promises of taped phone conversations between Ms. Tripp and \n     Monica Lewinsky about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with \n     President Clinton. And what was the alleged crime? That \n     President Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky were about to lie about \n     their relationship--if they were asked about it by the \n     attorneys for Paula Jones in her sexual harassment case \n     against President Clinton. Mr. Starr had to know that the \n     relationship between President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky \n     had been a consensual one. Mr. Starr had to know that, \n     because Ms. Tripp was informed by Ms. Lewinsky of every \n     aspect of her relationship with President Clinton. And at \n     this point--January 12, 1998--neither Monica Lewinsky nor \n     President Clinton had been deposed.\n       I am convinced that no ordinary federal prosecutor, if \n     confronted with the same situation involving a private \n     citizen, would have pursued this case. But Mr. Starr was no \n     ordinary federal prosecutor. Without jurisdiction with \n     respect to these matters, he immediately gave Ms. Tripp \n     immunity in exchange for access to her tapes, and he wired \n     her to tape a private luncheon conversation with Ms. \n     Lewinsky. Shortly after Mr. Starr wired Ms. Tripp, he \n     confronted Ms. Lewinsky and, according to her, threatened her \n     with 27 years in prison and the prosecution of her mother in \n     order to get her cooperation and to tape Betty Currie, the \n     President, and/or Vernon Jordan. Mr. Starr brought his \n     enormous criminal investigative resources to bear on \n     testimony yet to be given in a civil lawsuit involving a \n     consensual, sexual relationship.\n       At the time Ms. Lewinsky was threatened by Mr. Starr, her \n     affidavit in the Jones case had not been filed. She was still \n     in a position to retrieve it or amend it. Also, President \n     Clinton had not been deposed. He had not given his testimony \n     in the Paula Jones suit. In effect, Mr. Starr and his agents \n     lay in wait--waiting for the President to be surprised at the \n     Jones deposition with information about Monica Lewinsky. And \n     how did that information about Monica Lewinsky get in the \n     hands of the Jones attorneys? Ms. Tripp gave them the \n     information. And she was able to do that even though she was \n     under an immunity arrangement with Mr. Starr, because--as Mr. \n     Starr acknowledged to the House Judiciary Committee under \n     questioning--Mr. Starr's agents never directed Ms. Tripp to \n     keep her information confidential, even though Mr. Starr had \n     a major concern that the Lewinsky matter would leak to the \n     press. Mr. Starr's agents did not tell Ms. Tripp not to talk \n     to the Jones attorneys or anyone else in order to ensure that \n     the story would not leak to the press.\n       So the enormous criminal investigative resources of the \n     federal government were brought to bear on the President of \n     the United States to catch him by surprise in a future \n     deposition in a civil proceeding on a matter peripheral to \n     the lawsuit, prior to any of the suspected unlawful conduct.\n       Once the President testified in that civil suit, Mr. Starr \n     convened a grand jury to investigate the truthfulness of Mr. \n     Clinton's testimony. Again, using the virtually unlimited \n     resources of the federal government with respect to a \n     criminal investigation, Mr. Starr called countless witnesses \n     before the grand jury--recalling numerous witnesses multiple \n     times. Betty Currie testified on 5 different occasions; so \n     did Vernon Jordan. Monica Lewinsky testified 3 times and was \n     interviewed over 20 separate times. I don't believe any \n     regular prosecutor would have invested the time and money and \n     resources in the kind of investigation that Kenneth Starr \n     did.\n       At the end, Mr. Starr wrote a report arguing for \n     impeachment to the House of Representatives. He didn't just \n     impartially forward evidence he thought may demonstrate \n     possible impeachable offenses.\n       The Starr report spared nothing. Lacking good judgment and \n     balance, the Starr report contained a large amount of \n     salacious detail, and skipped over or dismissed important \n     exculpatory evidence, such as Monica Lewinsky's statement \n     that no one asked her to lie and no one promised her a job \n     for her silence. Mr. Starr violated the standards enunciated \n     by Judge Sirica when he addressed the status of the grand \n     jury report in the Watergate matter. In that case, Judge \n     Sirica wrote in granting Leon Jaworski, the Watergate \n     prosecutor, the right to forward grand jury information to \n     the House of Representatives:\n\n       ``It draws no accusatory conclusions. . . It contains no \n     recommendations, advice or statements that infringe on the \n     prerogatives of other branches of government. . . It renders \n     no moral or social judgments. The Report is a simple and \n     straightforward compilation of information gathered by the \n     Grand Jury, and no more. . . The Grand Jury has obviously \n     taken care to assure that its Report contains no \n     objectionable features, and has throughout acted in the \n     interests of fairness. The Grand Jury having thus respected \n     its own limitations and the rights of others, the Court ought \n     to respect the Jury's exercise of its prerogatives.'' (In re \n     Report and Recommendation of June 5, 1972, Grand Jury \n     Concerning Transmission of Evidence to the House of \n     Representatives, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, \n     March 18, 1974.)\n\n       What a far cry the Watergate grand jury report was from Mr. \n     Starr's. The Starr Report violates almost every one of the \n     standards laid out by Judge Sirica in the Watergate case.\n       The House of Representatives the Judiciary Committee then \n     almost immediately released the Starr report and the \n     thousands of pages of evidence to the public.\n       Because of that release--enormous damage had been done to \n     the public's sense of decorum and to appropriate limits \n     between public and private life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1794-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1799-S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEPOSITION OF VERNON JORDAN IN THE SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret to have to return to an unfinished \naspect of the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton.\n  On February 2, I attended the deposition of Vernon Jordan as one of \nthe Senators designated to serve as presiding officers. On February 4, \nthe Senate approved the House Managers' motion to include a portion of \nthat deposition in the trial record. Unfortunately, the House Managers \nmoved to include only a portion of the videotaped deposition in the \ntrial record and left the rest hidden from the public and subject to \nthe confidentiality rules that governed those proceedings.\n  On Saturday, February 6, at the conclusion of his presentation, Mr. \nKendall asked for permission to display the last segment of the \nvideotaped deposition of Vernon Jordan, in which, as Mr. Kendall \ndescribed it ``Mr. Jordan made a statement defending his own \nintegrity.'' The House Managers objected to the playing of the \napproximately 2-minute segment of the deposition that represented Mr. \nJordan's ``own statement about his integrity.''\n  I then rose to request unanimous consent from the Senate that the \nsegment of the videotaped deposition be allowed to be shown on the \nSenate floor to the Senate and the American people. There was objection \nfrom the Republican side.\n  I noted my disappointment at the time and in my February 12 remarks \nabout the depositions. After the conclusion of the voting on the \nArticles of Impeachment and before the adjournment of the court of \nimpeachment, unanimous consent was finally granted to include the \n``full written transcripts'' of the depositions in the public record of \nthe trial. As far as I can tell, however, the statement of integrity by \nMr. Jordan has yet to be published in the Congressional Record.\n  I regret that the Senate chose to prohibit the viewing of the \nvideotape of\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nthis powerful personal statement during the trial. I regret that it \ncontinues to be restricted from public viewing.\n  In order to be sure that the transcript that is being made a part of \nthe public trial record is readily available to the public, I ask \nunanimous consent that the following portion of the written transcript \nof the deposition of Vernon Jordan, that containing his statement of \nintegrity heretofore suppressed, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The Witness. Mr. Chairman, may I be just permitted a moment \n     of personal privilege? I don't know about the rules here, but \n     uh, I'd like to say something if you would permit.\n       Mr. Hutchinson. Mr. Chairman----\n       Senator Thompson. Well, Mr. Jordan, quite frankly, it \n     depends on what the subject matter is and what you'd like----\n       The Witness. Well, it won't be a declaration of war. \n     [Laughter.]\n       Senator Thompson. Counsel, did you have----\n       Mr. Hutchinson. I would reserve the objection. I think \n     that's permissible under the rules. So I would state my \n     objection, let him answer it, and if--we can debate that if \n     it becomes an issue in the Senate. I'd like to reserve the \n     objection.\n       Senator Thompson. All right.\n       The Witness. It's just something I want you, Mr. \n     Hutchinson, and the House Managers to understand about Vernon \n     Jordan. And that is, you know, it's a very long way from the \n     first public housing project in this country for black \n     people, where I grew up. It's a long way from there to a \n     corner office at Akin Gump. It's a long way from University \n     Homes to the corporate board rooms of America. It's a long \n     way from University Homes to the Oval Office. And I have made \n     that journey understanding one thing, and that is that the \n     only thing I have in this world that belongs to me is fee \n     simple absolute, completely and totally, is my integrity.\n       My corner office at Akin Gump is at best tenuous. My house, \n     my home, is at best tenuous. My bank account, my stocks and \n     my bonds, they are ultimately of no moment.\n       But what matters most to me, and what was taught to me by \n     my mother, is that the only thing that I own totally and \n     completely is my integrity. And my integrity has been on \n     trial here, and I want to tell you that nothing is more \n     important to me than that.\n       The Presdient is my friend. He was before this happened, he \n     is now, and he will be when this is over. But he is not a \n     friend in that I have no friends for whom I would sacrifice \n     my integrity. And I want you to understand that.\n       Senator Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Jordan.\n       If there is no further question, then this deposition is \n     completed, and we stand adjourned.\n       The  Witness. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1799-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1800-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING A WESTERN HEMISPHERE DRUG ALLIANCE--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 9\n\n  The Presiding Officer laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to provide the attached report on a Western Hemisphere \nDrug Alliance in accordance with the provisions of section 2807 of the \n``Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998.'' This report \nunderscores the Administration's commitment to enhancing multilateral \ncounternarcotics cooperation in the region.\n  Strengthening international narcotics control is one of my \nAdministration's top foreign policy priorities. Because of the \ntransnational nature of the Western Hemisphere drug trafficking threat, \nwe have made enhanced multilateral cooperation a central feature of our \nregional drug control strategy. Our counternarcotics diplomacy, foreign \nassistance, and operations have focused increasingly on making this \nobjective a reality.\n  We are succeeding. Thanks to U.S. leadership in the Summit of the \nAmericas, the Organization of American States, and other regional fora, \nthe countries of the Western Hemisphere are taking the drug threat more \nseriously and responding more aggressively. South American cocaine \norganizations that were once regarded as among the largest and most \nviolent crime syndicates in the world have been dismantled, and the \nlevel of coca cultivation is now plummeting as fast as it was once sky-\nrocketing. We are also currently working through the Organization of \nAmerican States to create a counternarcotics multilateral evaluation \nmechanism in the hemisphere. These examples reflect fundamental \nnarcotics control progress that was nearly unimaginable a few years \nago.\n  While much remains to be done, I am confident that the Administration \nand the Congress, working together, can bolster cooperation in the \nhemisphere, accelerate this progress, and significantly diminish the \ndrug threat to the American people. I look forward to your continued \nsupport and cooperation in this critical area.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to provide support for certain institutes and schools; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n   legislation to provide support for certain institutes and schools\n\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today Senator Frist and I are \nintroducing a bill to establish the Howard Baker School of Government \non the campus of the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.\n  The University of Tennessee has a long and proud tradition of \nproviding the highest quality education to students from Tennessee and \naround the world. The Howard Baker School of Government would be but \nthe latest installment in this institution's ongoing commitment to \npreparing its student body by giving them the tools and knowledge \nnecessary to succeed in the pursuit of their dreams.\n  With this said, I can think of no greater tribute to our friend and \ncolleague, the former Majority Leader of this body, Senator Howard \nBaker, than to further his legacy of promoting the best in our \npolitical system by establishing this School in his honor.\n  In many ways, Senator Baker's entire life has been a lesson in public \nservice. Those of us from his home state of Tennessee have matured in \nhis shadow and have been inspired by his vision. His positive influence \nhas not, however, been limited by Tennessee's borders. Senator Baker is \none of those rare individuals whose leadership has lifted the entire \nnation. Creating this School of Government in his name would not only \nbe a tribute to a man but a logical extension of that man's continuing \nlifework.\n  In 1966, Senator Baker became the first Republican popularly elected \nto the United States Senate in Tennessee's history. This was not \nbecause of a great rise in Tennessee's Republican population, but \nrather was an indication of Senator Baker's unique ability to reach out \nto people of different backgrounds with diverging views and spark in \nthem that all-encompassing common vision--that we live together in a \ngreat nation that has an even greater future.\n  Senator Baker served in this body from 1967 until January 1985, as \nMinority Leader from 1977 until 1981, and then as Majority Leader until \nhis retirement. After leaving the Senate, Senator Baker served \nadmirably as Chief of Staff to President Ronald Reagan and he continues \nto this day to provide us with a keen insight into the principles of \ntrue leadership.\n  Throughout each phase of Senator Baker's life he has clearly \ndemonstrated that statesmanship is not something relegated to our \nhistory books. It is alive and well. His continuing example is a call \nto each of us that we can and should rise to the challenge of \ncitizenship in a way that brings us together as a nation and further \nstrengthens this great experiment called the United States.\n  I can think of no better union than the ideals and example of Senator \nHoward Baker with the dedication to higher education of the University \nof Tennessee. The Howard Baker School of Government will be an \ninstitution each of us can be proud to have supported and one that will \nfurther the principles of good government to which each of us is \ncommitted.\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation to establish the Howard Baker School of Government at the \nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville. I am proud to introduce this \nlegislation with my colleague, Senator Thompson. Although the Senate \npassed this legislation last year, unfortunately it was not signed into \nlaw before the completion of the 105th Congress.\n  The bill we are introducing today would create a new academic program \nat the University of Tennessee, and authorize the appropriation of $10 \nmillion to establish the school and its endowment fund to provide long-\nterm funding for personnel and operations. I am pleased that this \nschool is to be named in honor of Senator Howard Baker, who is a \nUniversity of Tennessee alumnus. Senator Baker has enjoyed a \ndistinguished career in public service. He served in the U.S. Senate \nfor 18 years, held the positions of Minority and Majority Leader, was a \npresidential candidate, and has served as White House Chief of Staff to \nPresident Reagan. Senator Baker has been a long supporter of the \nUniversity of Tennessee, working diligently to raise funds for various \nfellowships and scholarships. He has served his State and country with \npride and integrity, and it is therefore fitting that we establish a \nSchool of Government in his name.\n  The Howard Baker School of Government would comprise the existing \npolitical science, public administration, regional planning, and social \nscience research programs, house manuscript collections from important \npublic figures such as Tennessee's three presidents and leading \ntwentieth-century\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\npolitical figures, and institute a lecture series on public issues. In \naddition, the school will establish a professorship to improve the \nteaching, research, and understanding of democratic institutions, \nestablish a fellowship program for students interested in pursuing a \ncareer in public affairs, and support the professional development of \nelected officials at all government levels. The School of Government \nwill be housed in the renovated former Hoskins Library, and will be \ndedicated to advancing the principles of democratic citizenship, civic \nduty, and public responsibility through the education and training of \ninformed citizenry and public officials.\n  Again, I am proud to introduce this legislation which I believe will \nbring greater prominance to the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, \nwhile simultaneously honoring one of our State's most distinguished \npublic servants.\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of \nimportant legislation that would create an endowment for a public-\npolicy institute in Columbus. This institute will embody the spirit of \nour recently-retired U.S. Senator, the Honorable John Glenn.\n  The bill would create an endowment fund for the John Glenn Institute \nfor Public Service and Public Policy at the Ohio State University in \nColumbus, Ohio. The bill also creates endowment funds for the Mark O. \nHatfield School of Government at Portland State University, the Paul \nSimon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University, and the \nHoward Baker School of Government at the University of Tennessee.\n  Mr. President, I have long believed that the study of politics would \nbenefit greatly if more statesmen were to contribute their hands-on \nexpertise. And not only that; it is the example of their supremely \npractical idealism that we really need if we are to understand and \nsolve the problems confronting tomorrow's America.\n  We in Ohio are proud to host the Glenn Institute, which will serve \nmany purposes: (1) ``To sponsor classes, internships, community service \nactivities, and research projects to stimulate student participation in \npublic service, in order to foster America's next generation of \nleaders.''\n  (2) ``To conduct scholarly research in conjunction with public \nofficials on significant issues facing society and to share the results \nof such research with decision-makers and legislators as the decision-\nmakers and legislators address such issues.''\n  (3) ``To offer opportunities to attend seminars on such topics as \nbudgeting and finance, ethics, personnel management, policy \nevaluations, and regulatory issues that are designed to assist public \nofficials in learning more about the political process and to expand \nthe organizational skills and policy-making abilities of such \nofficials.''\n  (4) ``To educate the general public by sponsoring national \nconferences, seminars, publications, and forums on important public \nissues.''\n  (5) ``To provide access to Senator John Glenn's extensive collection \nof papers, policy decisions, and memorabilia, enabling scholars at all \nlevels to study the Senator's work.''\n  All of these, Mr. President, are valuable goals. I understand the \ncenter plans to address specifically the consequences of media coverage \non public service; analyze the effectiveness of civics education \nclasses in our K-12 schools; design training programs for public \nofficials on issues such as policy evaluation, communications \nstrategies and ethics; and create an undergraduate major in public \npolicy.\n  Senator Glenn himself recently underscored the mission of the \nInstitute, saying, and I quote: ``What we do today will determine what \nkind of country our kids will live in tomorrow. And that's worth \nworking for.'' He also said, ``You can go to the National Archives in \nWashington, D.C., and it's almost a religious experience to look at the \nU.S. Constitution. But that piece of paper is not worth a thing without \npeople to make it real. I look at public service as being the personnel \ndepartment for the Constitution. People in public service are the ones \nwho make it work.''\n  Mr. President, I could not agree more, and that is why I'm backing \nthis bill. The bill provides an authorization of $10 million for the \nGlenn Institute, and the Ohio State University must match that \nendowment with an amount equal to one third the endowment.\n  It's a good investment in the future of our public life.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SARBANES (for himself, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 441. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe route of the War of 1812 British invasion of Maryland and \nWashington, District of Columbia, and the route of the American \ndefense, for study for potential addition to the national trails \nsystem; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   the star-spangled banner national historic trail study act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \ntogether with my colleague Senator Mikulski, which will help \ncommemorate and preserve significant sites associated with America's \nSecond War of Independence, the War of 1812. My legislation, entitled \n``The Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail Study Act of 1999,'' \ndirects the Secretary of the Interior to initiate a study to assess the \nfeasibility and desirability of designating the route of the British \ninvasion of Washington, D.C. and their subsequent defeat at Baltimore, \nMaryland, as a National Historic Trail. A similar companion bill is \nbeing sponsored by Congressmen Ben Cardin and Wayne Gilchrest in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Since the passage of the National Trail Systems Act of 1968, the \nNational Park Service has recognized historically significant routes of \nexploration, migration and military action through its National \nHistoric Trails Program. Routes such as the Juan Bautista de Anza, \nLewis and Clark, Pony Express and Selma to Montgomery National Historic \nTrails cross our country and represent important episodes of our \nnation's history, episodes which were influential in shaping the very \nfuture of this country. It is my view that the inclusion of the Star-\nSpangled Banner Trail will give long overdue recognition to another of \nthese important events.\n  The War of 1812, and the Chesapeake Campaign in particular, mark a \nturning point in the development of the United States. Faced with the \npossibility of losing the independence for which they struggled so \nvaliantly, the citizens of this country were forced to assert \nthemselves on an international level.\n  From the period of the arrival of the British forces at Benedict, in \nCharles County, Maryland, on August 18, 1814, to the American victory \nat Fort McHenry in Baltimore, on September 14, 1814, the war took a \ndramatic turn. The American forces, largely comprised of Maryland's \ncitizens, were able to slow the British advance through the state and \nsuccessfully defended Baltimore, leading to the retreat of the British.\n  The more than 30 sites along this trail mark some of the most \nhistorically important events of the War of 1812. The Star-Spangled \nBanner Trail, commemorating the only combined naval and land attack on \nthe United States, begins with the June, 1814 battles between the \nBritish Navy and the American Chesapeake Flotilla at St. Leonard's \nCreek in Calvert County, Maryland. It continues to the site of the \nBritish landing at Benedict, Maryland the starting point of the British \nmarch to the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. The trail follows the \ndefeat of the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg, the evacuation of \nthe United States Government, the burning of the nation's capital, \nincluding the White House and the Capitol Building, the battle at North \nPoint and the bombardment of Fort McHenry, site of the composition of \nour National Anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner, and the ultimate defeat \nof the British.\n  The route will also serve to bring awareness to several lesser known, \nbut equally important sites of the war, including St. Leonard's Creek \nin Calvert County, where Commodore Joshua Barney's Chesapeake Flotilla \nmanaged to successfully beat back two larger and more heavily armed \nBritish ships, the Upper Chesapeke Bay and related skirmishes there, \nBrookeville, Maryland, which served as the nation's capital for one \nday, and Todd's Inheritance, the signal station for the American \ndefenders at Fort McHenry. These sites, and\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\nmany like them, will only enrich the story told along the trail. \nAdditionally, the attention given to these sites should prove \nbeneficial in terms of efforts to preserve and restore them. Mr. \nPresident, at this time I ask unanimous consent that a more detailed \nlist of these sites, as well as a copy of this legislation and a letter \nof support from Governor Parris Glendening, be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, the designation of the route of the British invasion \nof Washington and American defense of Baltimore as a National Historic \nTrail will serve as a reminder of the importance of the concept of \nliberty to all who experience the Star-Spangled Banner Trail. It will \nalso give long overdue recognition to those patriots whose \ndetermination to stand firm against enemy invasion and bombardment \npreserved this liberty for future generations of Americans.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 441\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Star-Spangled Banner \n     National Historic Trail Study Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the British invasion of Maryland and Washington, \n     District of Columbia, during the War of 1812 marks a defining \n     period in the history of our Nation, the only occasion on \n     which the United States of America has been invaded by a \n     foreign power;\n       (2) the Star-Spangled Banner National Historic Trail traces \n     the route of the British naval attack on the Chesapeake \n     Flotilla at St. Leonard's Creek, the landing of the British \n     forces at Benedict, Maryland, the American defeat at the \n     Battle of Bladensburg, the siege of the Nation's capital, \n     Washington, District of Columbia (including the burning of \n     the United States Capitol and the White House), the British \n     expedition to and subsequent skirmishes within the upper \n     Chesapeake Bay, the route of the American troops between \n     Washington and Baltimore, the Battle of North Point, and the \n     ultimate victory of the Americans at Fort McHenry, on \n     September 14, 1814, where a distinguished Maryland lawyer and \n     poet, Francis Scott Key, wrote the words that captured the \n     essence of our national struggle for independence, words that \n     now serve as our national anthem, the Star-Spangled Banner; \n     and\n       (3) the designation of this route as a national historic \n     trail--\n       (A) would serve as a reminder of the importance of the \n     concept of liberty to all who experience the Star-Spangled \n     Banner National Historic Trail; and\n       (B) would give long overdue recognition to the patriots \n     whose determination to stand firm against enemy invasion and \n     bombardment preserved this liberty for future generations of \n     Americans.\n\n     SEC. 3.

While reading your letter, I was reminded \n     of how far we can go as a State if we combine our efforts and \n     work together to achieve our goals.\n       Additionally, I am aware of and very interested in the \n     National Historic Trail legislation you are re-introducing to \n     Congress this session. The designation of a multi-\n     jurisdictional National Historic Trail would have significant \n     impact on Maryland's War of 1812 Heritage Tourism Initiative. \n     My staff and I are ready to assist in the designation process \n     in anyway you deem necessary.\n       As always, it was a pleasure to hear from you, I look \n     forward to seeing you soon.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Parris N. Glendening,\n                                                         Governor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 443. A bill to regulate the sale of firearms at gun shows; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                    the gun show accountability act\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which \nwill close the loophole in our gun laws which allows criminals to buy \nand sell firearms at gun shows.\n  Last year, there were more than 4,400 gun shows across America. While \nmost of the citizens who participate in these gun shows are law-\nabiding, there is mounting evidence that criminals are using these \nevents for more sinister purposes.\n  The problem is that current law allows unlicensed dealers to sell \ncountless firearms without any background checks on the buyer or \ndocumentation of the sales. Criminals are aware of this loophole and \nexploit it. A study by the Illinois State Police showed at least 25 \npercent of illegally trafficked weapons came from gun shows. Militia \nmembers including Timothy McVeigh and Michael Fortier used gun shows to \neasily sell previously stolen guns and obtain a ready supply of \nfirearms in undocumented transactions.\n  Additionally, the gun show loophole is unfair to law-abiding Federal \nFirearms Licensees. When they participate in a gun show, they must \ncomply with all background checks and record-keeping, while an \nunlicensed dealer at the next table can make unlimited sales to any \nperson without the same requirements. The ease of these sales\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\ndrains significant business from law-abiding gun store owners and other \nlicensees, and penalizes them for following the law. Recognizing this \nproblem, the National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers recently \nendorsed tighter regulations of gun shows: ``[W]e want to make it clear \nthat persons attending Gun Shows to skirt laws and acquire guns for \ncriminal use are unwelcome patrons of these events and diminish their \npurpose and quality.''\n  During the 105th Congress, I introduced the Gun Show Sunshine Act in \nan effort to address this issue. Subsequently, President Clinton \ndirected the Attorney General to study gun show firearm transactions \nand make recommendations to crack down on illegal sales.\n  The Administration's recently released report confirmed what other \nlaw enforcement officials have been saying: gun shows are becoming \nillegal arms bazaars, where criminals buy and sell deadly weapons with \nimpunity. The report looked at 314 recent Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms (ATF) investigations involving 54,000 firearms linked to gun \nshows. Nearly half of the investigations involved felons buying or \nselling firearms, and in more than one-third of the cases, the firearms \nin question were known to have been used in subsequent crimes.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that proposes a simple approach \nto the gun show loophole--no background check, no gun, no exceptions. \nThis measure incorporates the recommendations made by the Department of \nJustice and the Treasury Department and I appreciate the \nAdministration's support.\n  This bill would take several steps designed to make it harder for \ncriminals to buy and sell weapons at gun shows. It would require gun \nshow promoters to register and notify ATF of all gun shows, maintain \nand report a list of vendors at the show, and ensure that all vendors \nacknowledge receipt of information about their legal obligations. Also, \nit would require that any firearms sales go through a Federal Firearms \nLicensee (FFL). The idea is that if an unlicensed person was selling a \nweapon, they would use a FFL at the gun show to complete the \ntransaction. The FFL would be responsible for conducting a Brady check \non the purchaser and maintaining records of the transactions. The FFL \ncould charge a fee for the service.\n  In order to make it easier for law enforcement to bring criminals to \njustice, the bill would also require FFLs to submit information \nnecessary to trace all firearms transferred at gun shows to ATF's \nNational Tracing Center, including the manufacturer/improper, model, \nand serial number of the firearms.\n  These reasonable requirements will make our streets safer by making \nit harder for criminals to get guns. At the same time, these \nregulations will not unduly burden those law-abiding Americans who \nenjoy gun shows.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me in this effort to close the gun \nshow loophole. We must do more to prevent the easy access to firearms \nwhich fuels the gun violence across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 443\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Show Accountability \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) more than 4,400 traditional gun shows are held annually \n     across the United States, attracting thousands of attendees \n     per show and hundreds of Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers;\n       (2) traditional gun shows, as well as flea markets and \n     other organized events, at which a large number of firearms \n     are offered for sale by Federal firearms licensees and \n     nonlicensed firearms sellers, form a significant part of the \n     national firearms market;\n       (3) firearms and ammunition that are exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at gun shows, flea markets, and other \n     organized events move easily in and substantially affect \n     interstate commerce;\n       (4) in fact, even before a firearm is exhibited or offered \n     for sale or exchange at a gun show, flea market, or other \n     organized event, the gun, its component parts, ammunition, \n     and the raw materials from which it is manufactured have \n     moved in interstate commerce;\n       (5) gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events at \n     which firearms are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     provide a convenient and centralized commercial location at \n     which firearms may be bought and sold anonymously, often \n     without background checks and without records that enable gun \n     tracing;\n       (6) at gun shows, flea markets, and other organized events \n     at which guns are exhibited or offered for sale or exchange, \n     criminals and other prohibited persons obtain guns without \n     background checks and frequently use guns that cannot be \n     traced to later commit crimes;\n       (7) many persons who buy and sell firearms at gun shows, \n     flea markets, and other organized events cross State lines to \n     attend these events and engage in the interstate \n     transportation of firearms obtained at these events;\n       (8) gun violence is a pervasive, national problem that is \n     exacerbated by the availability of guns at gun shows, flea \n     markets, and other organized events;\n       (9) firearms associated with gun shows have been \n     transferred illegally to residents of another State by \n     Federal firearms licensees and nonlicensed firearms sellers, \n     and have been involved in subsequent crimes including drug \n     offenses, crimes of violence, property crimes, and illegal \n     possession of firearms by felons and other prohibited \n     persons; and\n       (10) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to ensure, by enactment of this Act, that criminals \n     and other prohibited persons do not obtain firearms at gun \n     shows, flea markets, and other organized events.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nrequire the Secretary of Veterans Affairs and the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services to carry out a demonstration project to provide the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs with Medicare reimbursement for Medicare \nhealthcare services provided to certain medicare-eligible veterans; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Veterans' \nEqual Access to Medicare Act. This bill will give all our nations' \nveterans the freedom to choose where they receive their medical care. I \nam joined by the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Senators Specter and Rockefeller, as well as Senators \nThurmond, Murkowski, Campbell, Craig, Hutchinson, McCain, Snowe, \nDaschle, Graham, Akaka, Wellstone, Murray, Hollings, Cleland, Landrieu, \nJohnson, and my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy.\n  Known to some as ``Medicare Subvention,'' this legislation will \nauthorize the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to set up 10 pilot \nsites around the country where Medicare-eligible Veterans could get \nMedicare-covered services at a Veterans hospital. The VA would then be \nreimbursed at a slightly reduced rate for provision of those services. \nMany Medicare-eligible veterans want to receive their care at a VA \nfacility. This bill would allow certain veterans that option.\n  My legislation would implement a pilot project that is eagerly sought \nby both the Veterans Administration and the Veterans Service \nOrganizations. Veterans want the right to choose where they get their \nMedicare-covered services. Many of them would like to go to a Veterans \nAdministration facility where they would feel more comfortable. We want \nto make that option possible for those who have given so much of \nthemselves in service to their country.\n  Our legislation starts with a 10-site demonstration project, limiting \ntotal Medicare reimbursements to $50 million annually. The VA is \nrequired to maintain its current level of effort, and provisions in the \nbill prevent it from shifting any current costs to the Medicare Trust \nFund. In the event that the demonstration project in any way increased \nMedicare's costs, the VA would reimburse Medicare for these costs and \nsuspend or terminate the program.\n\n  An independent auditor would monitor the demonstration project \nannually and make reports to Congress on its findings. A final report \nto Congress three and a half years after commencement of the project \nfrom the Secretaries of Veterans Affairs and Health and Human Services \nwould recommend whether to terminate, continue or expand the program.\n  Almost two years ago, Senator Rockefeller and I successfully included \nsimilar legislation in the 1997 Balanced Budget Reconciliation Act. The \nfull Senate endorsed this measure. Unfortunately, our amendment was \nlater dropped in conference.\n  But we feel strongly that now is the time to enact this legislation. \nVeterans want and deserve this option, and the VA should be allowed to \nbecome a Medicare provider. The Department of Health and Human Services \nand the Veterans Administration have already reached an agreement on \nhow such a program would be implemented. It's time for us to give this \nproject the green light.\n  In 1997 the Department of Defense Medicare Subvention program \nalleviated what our country's military retirees call a ``lockout'' from \nthe military health care system. This bill will finish the job by \nallowing all our veterans access to the best and most appropriate \nhealth care facility of their choosing. Our nation's veterans deserve \nno less.\n  I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee, \nSecretary West and the Administration, the Veterans Service \nOrganizations and my colleagues here and in the House to get this \nlegislation signed into law this year.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, along with all the Members of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of a bill, which my colleague and friend, Senator Jim \nJeffords, is introducing today. Mr. President, this is a most welcome \nbill. When enacted, it would direct that the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) \nenter into an agreement establishing ten geographically dispersed \ndemonstration projects under which VA would provide health care \nservices to certain Medicare-eligible veterans, who would not have \notherwise received care in VA, in exchange for reimbursement from the \nMedicare trust fund. Thus, VA would be able to occupy the same basic \nposition as other health care providers which furnish care to Medicare-\neligible patients: VA would be reimbursed by Medicare for providing \nthis care, just as other providers may be reimbursed. The Department of \nDefense health care system is already authorized to provide such care \nfor reimbursement on a demonstration project basis, and this authority \nshould be extended to the VA as well.\n  Under the terms of this bill, VA is authorized to establish up to ten \nsubvention sites or health plans, including a site near a closed \nmilitary base and one that provides care predominately to rural \nveterans. These sites and plans would provide health care services to \nMedicare-eligible veterans. Medicare would reimburse VA for such \nservices--similar to the way the Federal Health Care Financing \nAdministration pays other providers in the private sector when they \nfurnish health care services to Medicare-eligible persons--but subject \nto certain cost-saving conditions. First, while fees paid to VA would \nbe based on those paid to other providers, they would be reduced, \nacross the board, by 5%. Second, reimbursements to VA would be further \nreduced for subsidies paid by Medicare to private facilities to cover \ntheir capital expense and medical education costs, and costs incurred \nby such providers, if any, in serving a disproportionate number of low-\nincome patients. Thus, Medicare would invariably save funds when care \nis provided to its patients by VA. In effect, VA would provide care to \nMedicare-eligible veterans at a discount to the Medicare trust fund.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) would not, however, \nbe required to refer Medicare-eligible patients to VA under this bill. \nEligible veterans would continue to be free to select their own health \ncare providers. It would be up to the VA ``demonstration program'' \nsites to entice Medicare-eligible patients to VA by offering services \nand care which are more attractive than those provided by community-\ncare providers. One of the underlying purposes of this legislation is \nto test VA's contention that it can provide the kind of care which will \nattract veteran-patients who have other alternatives and, at the same \ntime, provide care which is cost effective from the reimburser's, and \nVA's, viewpoints. Another purpose of the legislation will be to test \nthe hypothesis that VA can meet the needs of its priority patients--\nveterans with service-connected disabilities and veterans who are \npoor--while, simultaneously positioning itself to attract other \nveteran-patients who, due to Medicare eligibility, have the wherewithal \nto go elsewhere for care.\n  Whether VA can succeed in providing cost-effective care which \nattracts patients without causing it to neglect its primary mission is \nthe essence of the question that this bill is intended to answer. \nIndeed, time--and these demonstration projects--will tell whether \nproviding such care to non-priority veterans for reimbursement will \nenhance VA's ability, due to an infusion of new Medicare funds, to \nprovide better care to VA's mandated priority patients. Like the \nDepartment of Defense--which, as I have noted, already has authority \nfrom Congress to obtain reimbursement from Medicare--VA ought to have \nan opportunity to see if it can succeed in attracting and keeping \npatients by providing superior care. I can think of no better way to \ngauge VA quality than assessing the behavior of veterans who can ``vote \nwith their feet.''\n  I hope that these VA ``demonstration project'' sites will show that \nVA can, in fact, fully serve its priority patients--veterans with \nservice-connected disabilities and veterans who are poor--while also \nserving veteran-patients who are able to bring Medicare funding to the \nVA system. Budgetary constraints have required that VA operate under a \n``flat-line'' medical\n\n[[Page S1808]]\n\ncare appropriation for the past three years even as personnel and other \ninflationary costs continue to rise from year to year. VA has attempted \nto increase its collections from private sector, third-party insurers \nin order to supplement its funding base, but these collections have not \nbeen sufficient. I and my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs believe that VA ought to have parallel authority to collect \nreimbursement from Medicare when it provides non-service-connected care \nto these patients. I ask that my colleagues give the Department this \nauthority by approving this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my colleague and friend from Vermont for \nhis leadership on establishing this innovative and crucial legislation \nthat I believe will be an essential tool in the future for VA's care of \nveterans, and I urge my colleagues to give this bill high priority \nattention for early passage this year.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer my support to \nthe Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act. This bill will authorize a \npilot project to allow VA to bill Medicare for health care services \nprovided to certain dual beneficiaries. The legislation is known as VA \nMedicare subvention, which is a concept that has been discussed over \nthe years by those of us in Congress, by veterans service \norganizations, and by virtually every advisory body that has studied \nthe VA health care system. I join my colleague Senator Jeffords in this \ninitiative.\n  In the past, many VA hospitals and clinics have been forced to turn \naway middle income, Medicare-eligible veterans who sought VA care. \nThese hospitals simply did not have the resources to care for them. \nNow, with eligibility reform, all enrolled veterans will have access to \na uniform, comprehensive benefit package. Yet, resources for veterans' \nhealth care have not increased, and, in fact, have remained flatlined.\n  During the first session of the 105th Congress, Senator Jeffords and \nI successfully pushed a similar proposal through the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the full Senate. The basic tenets of the current bill \nremain the same. For veterans, enactment of the Veterans' Equal Access \nto Medicare Act would mean the infusion of new revenue and, thus, \nimproved access to care. For the Health Care Financing Administration \n(HCFA), a VA subvention demonstration project will provide the \nopportunity to assess the effects of coordination on improving \nefficiency, access, and quality of care for dual-eligible beneficiaries \nin a selected number of sites. Finally, Congress would receive the \nresults of this feasibility study, which, once and for all, would give \nus the necessary data to make rational policy decisions in the future \nabout Medicare and VA's involvement.\n  The four VA medical centers in my own State of West Virginia spent \nnearly $5 million caring for Medicare-eligible veterans with middle \nincomes last year. Although this is telling information, I cannot \nprovide my colleagues with the truly crucial piece of the story--that \nis, the number of these Medicare-eligible veterans who had been turned \naway over the years from the very facilities created to serve them \nbecause of lack of resources. This demonstration project would \nencourage these eligible veterans who have not previously received care \nfrom the Huntington, Beckley, Martinsburg, and Clarksburg VA Medical \nCenters to do so, while providing Medicare with cost-savings \nopportunities.\n  As in years past, the Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act is \ndesigned to be budget neutral. To that end, the VA would be required to \nmaintain its current level of services to Medicare-eligible veterans \nalready being served, and would be effectively limited to reimbursement \nfor additional care provided to new users. Payments from Medicare would \nbe at a reduced rate and would exclude Disproportionate Share Hospital \nadjustments, Graduate Medical Education payments, and a large \npercentage of capital-related costs. In effect, the VA would be \nproviding health care to Medicare-eligible veterans at a deeply \ndiscounted rate. The Department of Health and Human Services and VA \nwould have the ability to adjust payment rates, or to shrink or \nterminate the program if Medicare's costs increase. In the event that \nthese safeguards included in the proposal fail--an event which the VA \nhas declared unlikely--this proposal caps all Medicare payments to the \nVA at $50 million.\n  A HCFA representative testified before the last Congress and stated \nthat this proposal will provide quality service to certain dual-\neligible beneficiaries and, ``at the same time, preserve and protect \nthe Medicare Trust Fund for all Americans.'' I believe this.\n  Although the VA subvention proposal is a small effort compared to the \nother recent changes made to the Medicare program and the changes yet \nto come, it is enormously important to our veterans and the health care \nsystem they depend upon. And regardless of any policy changes resulting \nfrom the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, an excellent \nopportunity will remain to test the idea of Medicare subvention to VA.\n  Over the last couple of years, we have tried to enact this proposal. \nUnfortunately, we have continually met resistance. Others who favor the \nsubvention concept have even tried to turn this Medicare-cost saving \nproposal into a way to make sweeping policy changes about the delivery \nof VA health care. My goal this session is to overcome this resistance \nand enact this proposal without any extraneous measures.\n  Truly, this VA/Medicare proposal is a way to provide quality health \ncare to veterans who are also eligible for Medicare, while at the same \ntime preserving and protecting the Medicare Trust Fund. With a signed \nMemorandum of Agreement between VA and HCFA, VA is ready to move ahead \nwith this demonstration project. Finally, the Department of Defense \nMedicare Subvention test program--TRICARE Senior Prime--is progressing. \nLet us not delay VA any longer.\n  Mr. President, veterans deserve the opportunity to come to VA \nfacilities for their care and bring their Medicare coverage with them. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committees on \nFinance and Veterans' Affairs to make this long sought-after proposal a \nreality.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original co-sponsor of \nthe Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act, which would authorize a \ndemonstration of Medicare subvention within the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) health care system. Many of us supported similar \nlegislation sponsored by Senator Jeffords and incorporated into the \nSenate version of the 1997 Budget Resolution. Unfortunately, this \nmeasure was removed by the conferees to the bill and did not become \nlaw. In the 105th Congress, separate legislation authorizing a test of \nMedicare subvention for veterans passed the House of Representatives \nbut stalled in the Senate. The intervening period has only made more \napparent the benefits of allowing Medicare-eligible veterans to use \ntheir Medicare entitlement for care at local VA medical facilities.\n  The Veterans' Equal Access to Medicare Act would establish a three-\nyear demonstration project at up to 10 sites around the country, \nincluding a site near a military medical facility closed under the Base \nRealignment and Closure process and a site in an area where the target \npopulation is predominantly rural. The VA would bill Medicare for \nMedicare-covered services provided to eligible veterans at these sites. \nVeterans' participation would be voluntary, and participants would make \nthe same Medicare co-payments to the VA as at non-VA facilities.\n  The legislation also contains important safeguards. The VA's \nInspector General must certify the accounting and managerial \ncapabilities of participating facilities; the VA must maintain its \ncurrent level of effort to prevent cost shifting from the VA to the \nMedicare Trust Fund; the Comptroller General must audit the \ndemonstration project annually to ensure that the Medicare Trust Fund \ndoes not incur any additional costs; and Medicare payments to the VA \nmust be capped at $50 million annually. After three years, the \nSecretaries of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs would be \nrequired to submit recommendations to Congress on whether to extend or \nexpand the project.\n  By permitting the VA to collect and retain Medicare payments for \nhealth care provided to eligible veterans, our legislation would \ndemonstrate subvention's ability to enhance access to the VA medical \nsystem for veterans\n\n[[Page S1809]]\n\nand channel critical non-appropriated funding into the VA network \nwithout raising costs to the Medicare Trust Fund. But don't take my \nword for it. The Fiscal Year 2000 Independent Budget jointly proposed \nby AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand Veterans of Foreign Wars summarizes the virtues of VA Medicare \nsubvention as follows:\n\n       Medicare subvention will benefit veterans, taxpayers, and \n     ultimately VA. It would give veterans who currently do not \n     have access to VA health care the option of choosing the VA \n     system. VA believes it can deliver care to Medicare \n     beneficiaries at a discounted rate, which would save money \n     for the Medicare Trust Fund and stretch taxpayer dollars.\n\n  In other words, this is win-win legislation for all concerned \nparties. Veterans receive better access to quality health care; the VA \nbenefits from an inflow of non-appropriated funding; and VA provides \nmore efficient care than other Medicare providers, saving scarce \nresources in this era of balanced budgets.\n  Military retirees, but not veterans, currently qualify for an ongoing \nMedicare subvention demonstration project authorized by Congress in \n1997. In 1996, I had introduced legislation to authorize Medicare \nreimbursement to the Department of Defense for care provided to \nMedicare-eligible retirees and their families. Although the Senate \nincluded this provision in its version of the Fiscal Year 1997 Defense \nAppropriations bill, it was dropped in conference with the House.\n  A year later, I supported the current Medicare subvention \ndemonstration project for military retirees, which was included in the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. It is my hope that this project will \ndemonstrate the potential for Medicare subvention to defray the \nescalating costs of the Military Health Service System, slow the \ndepletion of the Medicare Trust Fund, and provide a more generous \nbenefit to retired service members seeking the quality health care our \ngovernment promised them.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues that we also promised medical \nbenefits to veterans who served for fewer than 20 years and are not \nentitled to retirement benefits. That the Department of Veterans \nAffairs manages the largest health care network in the United States is \ntestament to our continuing effort to make good on that promise. But \nthe quantity of health care providers for veterans is not at issue \ntoday; rather, the quality of care is among the most pressing items on \nthe agenda of America's veterans and their advocates.\n  The veterans from whom I am honored to hear on my travels across the \nUnited States and in my Senate office frequently remind me that the VA \nhealth care system does not always offer them the quality of care they \nhave clearly earned. Authorizing a test of Medicare subvention for \nveterans would hopefully demonstrate its ability to improve veterans' \naccess to VA facilities and enhance the quality of service there.\n  For this reason, the Department of Veterans Affairs supports a \nMedicare subvention demonstration. So do the major veterans' service \norganizations whose membership comprises the very individuals who would \nbe affected by this legislation. I would also note that a majority of \nboth houses of the 105th Congress voted in favor of legislation to \nauthorize a Medicare subvention demonstration for veterans, even though \nthe specific terms of that legislation differed somewhat.\n  Mr. President, I wish to conclude my remarks by once again drawing \nfrom the wisdom of the veterans' service organizations' Independent \nBudget, which warns that Medicare subvention funding must be a \nsupplement to, not a substitute for, an adequate VA appropriation. \nVeterans' care and benefits have been underfunded for years. \nImplementing a test of Medicare subvention for veterans is but one step \nin what must be a concerted campaign to honor the promises made to all \nwho have answered their country's call through their military service. \nLet no one forget the sacrifices made by every veteran to secure our \nliberty in what has been, and remains, a very dangerous world.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President. I would like to express my strong \nsupport for Senator Jefford's bill, the Veterans' Equal Access to \nMedicare Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation which would allow the VA to establish a Medicare subvention \ndemonstration project. At ten sites across the country, Medicare would \nreimburse the VA for Medicare-covered services provided to eligible \nveterans.\n  As a former member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and a \ncurrent member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have been \nand remain a strong advocate of the Medicare subvention concept. As a \nmember of the House, I was cosponsor of Representative Joel Hefley's \nbill to create a demonstration project of Medicare subvention. During \nthe 105th Congress, I was a cosponsor of Senator Jefford's bill, S. \n2054.\n  The last four years of flat-lined Administration budgets have \ndemonstrated the critical need for this legislation. To treat new \nveteran patients, the VA must be creative in finding new revenue \nsources. The perpetual volatility of the health care marketplace has \nmade it more and more difficult for VA to collect under the standard \nfee for service arrangements. Currently, 85% of all insured Americans \nare under some form of managed care, and many of these plans do not \nrecognize the VA as a network provider eligible for reimbursement. In \norder for the VA to be able to collect the millions that it needs to \nadequately serve veterans and to survive under the budget proposed by \nthe Administration for FY 2000, there must be a new revenue source. \nMedicare subvention legislation would be a step in the right direction.\n  Historically, higher income veterans have been locked out of the VA \nhealth care system because of a severe lack of resources. Under \nsubvention legislation, the VA would potentially be able to open its \ndoors to millions of veterans 65 years and older who want to choose VA \nas their primary care giver. Our legislation will be the first in truly \nsaving the Private Ryan's of WWII and the Korean conflict. Now more \nthan ever, the VA needs to be able to collect and compete in the health \ncare marketplace as an equal partner with other health plans. Medicare \nsubvention will allow it that opportunity. I am proud to again be a \ncosponsor of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 446. A bill to provide for the permanent protection of the \nresources of the United States in the year 2000 and beyond; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         PERMANENT PROTECTION FOR AMERICA'S RESOURCES 2000 ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Permanent \nProtection for America's Resources 2000 Act--Resources 2000. This \nlegislation is the most sweeping commitment to protecting America's \nnatural heritage in more than a generation. It will establish a \npermanent, dedicated funding source for resource protection. I am \nhonored to be working on this legislation with Congressman George \nMiller in the House of Representatives, and my Senate Colleagues, \nSenator John Kerry and Senator Robert Torricelli.\n  As we embark upon the 21st Century, it is time to make a new \ncommitment to our natural heritage--one that can take its place beside \nthe legacy left by President Teddy Roosevelt as we began this century. \nThat new commitment must go beyond a piecemeal approach to preserving \nour natural resources. It must be a comprehensive, long-term strategy \nthat enables us to ensure that when our children's children enter the \n22nd Century, they can herald our actions today, as we revere those of \nPresident Roosevelt.\n  Today our natural heritage is disappearing at an alarming rate. Each \nyear, nearly 3 million acres of farmland and more than 170,000 acres of \nwetlands disappear. Each day, over 7,000 acres of open space are lost \nforever.\n  All across America, we now see parks closing, recreational facilities \ndeteriorating, open space disappearing, historic structures crumbling.\n  Why is this happening? Because there is no dedicated fund for all \nthese noble purposes--which can be used only for these noble purposes.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today will address this problem \nin a comprehensive Resources 2000 in a bold, historic initiative to \nprovide substantial and permanent funding from\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\noffshore oil resources for the acquisition, improvement and maintenance \nof public resources throughout the United States: public lands, parks, \nmarine and coastal resources, historic preservation, fish and wildlife. \nResources 2000 will provide permanent, annual funding for historically \nunderfunded, high priority resources, preservation goals.\n  A major funding source for resource protection already exists. Each \nyear, oil companies pay the federal government billions of dollars in \nrents, royalties, and other fees in connection with offshore drilling \nin federal waters. In 1998 alone, the government collected over $4.6 \nbillion from oil and gas drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf.\n  My bill would allocate $1.4 billion every year for land acquisition, \npark and recreational development, historic preservation, land \nrestoration, ocean conservation, farmland preservation, and endangered \nspecies recovery.\n  Resources 2000 will also mandate full funding of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. In 1965, Congress established this Fund, which was \nto receive $900 million a year from federal oil revenues for \nacquisition of sensitive lands and wetlands.\n  The good news is that Fund has collected over $21 billion since 1965. \nThe bad news is that only $9 billion of this amount has been spent on \nits intended uses. More than $16 billion has been shifted into other \nfederal accounts.\n  On the ground, this means that we have purchased some key tracts of \nland in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, Redwood National \nPark, Tahoe National Forest, and Channel Islands National Park, among \nmany others.\n  At the same time, however, we missed golden opportunities to buy \ncritical open space because the Land and Water Conservation Fund was \nunderfunded. Some of these parcels--in the Santa Monica Mountains, \nalong the Pacific Crest Trail, and elsewhere throughout California--\nhave since been lost. If we had been able to use the entire Fund, these \nareas would have been protected.\n  To preserve meaningful tracts of open space, we must spend the entire \nFund to acquire land and water. Congress must move to take the Fund \n``off budget'' and use it all for its intended purposes.\n  Resources 2000 would fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund at \n$900 million per year, the full level authorized by Congress. Half of \nthis amount would be dedicated to federal acquisition of lands for our \nnational parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and other \npublic lands. The other half would go for matching grants to the states \nfor land acquisition, planning, and development of outdoor recreation \nfacilities.\n  Furthermore, this can be done without causing further harm to the \nenvironment. My bill does not contain any incentives for new offshore \noil drilling. All of the revenue would have to come from already \nproducing leases.\n  The bill contains eight titles as follows:\n\n\n Title I--Land and Water Conservation Fund Revitalization--$900 million\n\n  Federal: $450 million\n  Stateside: $450 million\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 would take the Land and Water \nConservation Fund (LWCF) ``off-budget'' and require the federal \ngovernment to spend the entire $900 million for its designated purpose \nof land acquisition.\n  One-half of the annual $900 million allocation of the LWCF would be \ndedicated to federal land acquisition purposes. These funds would be \nused to acquire lands or interests in lands authorized by Congress for \nour national parks, national forests, national wildlife refuges, and \npublic lands.\n  The other $450 million allocation of the LWCF would go for matching \ngrants to the States for the acquisition of lands or interests in \nlands, planning, and development of outdoor recreation facilities. Of \nthis $450 million, two-thirds will be allocated by formula of which 30 \npercent shall be distributed equally among the States, and 70 percent \napportioned on the basis of the population each state bears to the \ntotal population of all states. The remaining one-third would be \nawarded on the basis of competitive grants.\n\n\n  Title II--Urban Parks and Recreational Recovery Program Amendments--\n                              $100 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 would provide a mandatory $100 \nmillion a year of OCS revenue for the Urban Parks and Recreational \nRecovery program (UPARR). This funding would be used by the Secretary \nof the Interior to provide competitive matching grants to local \ngovernments to rehabilitate recreation areas and facilities, provide \nfor the development of improved recreation programs, and to acquire, \ndevelop, or construct new recreation sites and facilities.\n  This program is intended to encourage and stimulate local governments \nto revitalize their park and recreation systems and to make long-term \ncommitments to continuing maintenance of these systems. UPARR is also \ndesigned to improve recreation facilities and expand recreation \nservices in urban areas with a high incidence of crime and to help \ndeter crime through the expansion of recreation opportunities for at-\nrisk youth.\n\n\n          Title III--Historic Preservation Fund--$150 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Your bill would take the Historic Preservation Fund \n``off-budget'' and require the federal government to spend the entire \n$150 million a year of OCS revenue for the designated purposes of the \nHistoric Preservation Fund. Your bill would also require that 50 \npercent of the funds provided be used for physically preserving \nhistoric properties (so-called ``brick and mortar'' activities).\n  Under current law, the National Historic Preservation Act established \nthe Historic Preservation Fund (HPF) in 1977. The Act requires that \n$150 million in revenue from offshore oil drilling be placed in the HPF \neach year. Congress is authorized to appropriate money from the fund to \ncarry out the National Historic Preservation Act. Such activities \ninclude grants to states, maintaining the National Register of Historic \nPlaces, and administering numerous historic preservation programs. The \nAct allows up to one-third of the funds for priority preservation \nprojects of public and private entities, including preserving historic \nstructures and sites, as well as, significant documents, photographs, \nworks of art, etc.\n\n\n Title IV--Farmland, Ranchland, Open Space, and Forestland Protection--\n                              $150 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 establishes the Farmland, Ranchland, \nOpen Space, and Forestland Protection Fund to provide matching, \ncompetitive grants to state, local and tribal governments for purchase \nof conservation easements to protect privately owned farmland, \nranchland and forests from encroaching development. To help communities \ngrow in ways that maintain open space and viable agricultural sectors \nof their economies. Such grants could be used to match state or local \nlong term bond initiatives approved by voters to preserve green spaces \nfor conservation, recreation and other environmental goals.\n\n  The Fund has three basic sections. The first funds the Farmland \nProtection Program at $50 million a year. This funding would be used by \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide matching grants to eligible \nentities to purchase permanent conservation easements in land so that \nit can be maintained as farmland or open space.\n  The second funds a new program--the Ranchland Protection Program--at \n$50 million a year. Modeled after the Farmland Protection Program, the \nRanchland Protection Program would be used by the Secretary of the \nInterior to provide matching grants to eligible entities to purchase \npermanent conservation easements on ranchland that is in danger of \nconversion to nonagricultural uses and is pending offer for the \npreservation of open space and will yield a significant public benefit.\n  The third section funds the Forest Legacy Program at $50 million a \nyear. The Forest Legacy Program is a similar program for protecting \nenvironmentally important forest areas that are threatened by \nconversion to nonforest uses. Under this program, the Secretary of \nAgriculture will provide matching grants to eligible entities to \npurchase conservation easements for forest lands.\n  For the purposes of this title an eligible entity is an agency of a \nState or local government, a federally recognized Indian tribe, or a \nnon-profit environment/land trust organization.\n\n\n    Title V--Federal and Indian Lands Restoration Fund--$250 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 establishes a new fund to provide a \nmandatory $250 million a year to undertake\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\na coordinated program on Federal and Indian lands to restore degraded \nlands, protect resources that are threatened with degradation, and \nprotect public health and safety.\n  $150 million of the funding will be available to the Secretary of the \nInterior to carry out restoration activities within the National Park \nSystem, National Wildlife Refuge System, and public lands administered \nby the Bureau of Land Management.\n  $75 million of the funding will be available to the Secretary of \nAgriculture to carry out restoration activities in National Forests.\n  $25 million of the funding will be available to the Secretary of the \nInterior to carry out a competitive grant program for Indian tribes to \ncomplete restoration activities on reservations.\n\n\n   Title VI--Ocean Fish and Wildlife Conservation, Restoration, and \n                 Management Assistance -- $300 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 establishes a new fund, entitled the \nOcean Fish and Wildlife Conservation Fund, to provide a mandatory $300 \nmillion a year for the Department of Commerce to provide grants for the \nconservation, restoration and management of ocean fish and wildlife of \nthe United States. The Fund would be allocated in two ways: (1) formula \ngrants to States to develop and implement comprehensive state ocean \nfish and wildlife conservation plans, and (2) competitive grants to \npublic and private persons to carry out projects for the conservation, \nrestoration, or management of ocean fish and wildlife (Ocean \nConservation Partnership grants).\n  a. State Ocean Fish and Wildlife Conservation Plans:\n  In order for states to be eligible for funding under this title, \nStates would have to develop a comprehensive ``Ocean Fish and Wildlife \nConservation Plan.'' The plan must be approved by the Secretary of \nCommerce. In order for the plan to be approved, the plan must provide \nfor an inventory of the ocean fish and wildlife and their habitat; \nidentification of any significant factors which may adversely affect \nocean fish and wildlife species and their habitats; determination and \nimplementation of conservation actions; monitoring of species and the \neffectiveness of conservation actions; periodic plan review and \nrevision; and public input into plan development, revision and \nimplementation. The State does not need to complete all of these \nactivities for plan approval, it simply must have a plan in place that \nwill show how the State proposes to meet the conservation objectives.\n  Two-thirds ($200 million) of the total would be available to coastal \nstates (including Great Lakes States, territories, and possessions of \nthe U.S.) for the development, revision, and implementation of the \n``Ocean Fish and Wildlife Conservation Plans.'' Funds would be \nallocated to the states by a formula. Two-thirds (about $133 million) \nwould be distributed to states based on the ratio of the population of \nthe state to the population of all coastal states. One-third (about $66 \nmillion) would be distributed to states based on the ratio of the \nlength of a state's shoreline to the length of the total shoreline of \nall coastal states. No state can receive less than \\1/2\\ of one percent \nor more than 10 percent of the total funds allocated under this \nsection.\n  b. Ocean Conservation Partnerships :\n  The remaining one-third ($100 million) of funds would be awarded by \nthe Secretary of Commerce as competitive, peer-reviewed grants for \nliving marine resource conservation. High priority would be given to \nproposals involving public/private conservation partnerships, but any \nperson would be eligible to apply for a grant under this provision. \nPriority would also be given to proposals that assist in achieving the \nobjectives of National Marine Sanctuaries, National Estuaries, or other \nfederal or state marine protected areas. A maximum grant size (2 \npercent of funds available--about $2 million) will be established to \nensure that a small number of large projects do not consume the bulk of \nthe funding in a given fiscal year.\n\n\nTitle VII--Funding for State Native Fish and Wildlife Conservation and \n                       Restoration--$350 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 provides a permanent appropriation \nof $350 for the conservation of native fish, wildlife and plants. It \namends the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1980 (FWCA, 16 U.S.C. \n2901 et seq.) to make funding available to the states for the \ndevelopment and implementation of comprehensive native wildlife \nconservation plans.\n  This title is similar to the Ocean Fish and Wildlife Conservation, \nRestoration and Management title, except this is for terrestrial fish \nand wildlife conservation efforts. States that choose to participate in \nthe program would submit Fish and Wildlife Conservation Plans to the \nSecretary of the Interior for approval.\n  Funds are to be allocated on a formula. One-third of the funds would \nbe allocated based on the area of a state relative to the total area of \nall the states and two-thirds on the relative population of a state.\n  States are eligible for reimbursement of 75 percent of the cost of \ndeveloping and implementing state wildlife conservation plans. Federal \nfunds are only available for plan development costs for the first 10 \nyears. As an additional incentive, federal funds will pay for up to 90 \npercent of: plan development costs during the first three years; and \nconservation actions undertaken by two or more states. In addition, in \nthe absence of an approved plan, the Secretary may reimburse a state \nfor certain on-the-ground conservation actions during the first five \nyears of the program.\n\n\n  Title VIII--Endangered and Threatened Species Recovery--$100 million\n\n  Summary of Title: Resources 2000 establishes a new fund, entitled the \nEndangered and Threatened Species Recovery Fund, to provide a mandatory \n$100 million a year for the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National \nMarine Fisheries Service to implement a private landowners incentive \nprogram for the recovery of endangered and threatened species and the \nhabitat that they depend on.\n  Monies would be used by the Secretaries to enter into ``endangered \nand threatened species recovery agreements'' with private landowners, \nproviding grants to: (1) carry out activities and protect habitat (not \notherwise required by the law) that would contribute to the recovery of \na threatened or endangered species, or (2) to refrain from carrying out \notherwise lawful activities that would inhibit the recovery of such \nspecies. Priority will be given to small landowners who would otherwise \nnot have the resources to participate in such programs.\n  So it is time to act in a comprehensive way to permanently protect \nour heritage. It is time to heed the call that Teddy Roosevelt sent out \nso many years ago. It is time to build on the progress we have made and \nplan for the future.\n  Resources 2000 enjoys the enthusiastic support of major \nenvironmental, historic preservation, sporting, wildlife, and parks \norganizations throughout the nation.\n  I hope that my colleagues in the Senate take advantage of this \nhistoric opportunity by joining Senator Torricelli, Senator Kerry, and \nme in this effort to preserve America's heritage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a list of groups who \nsupport the legislation, as well as letters from several conservation \norganizations be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) By establishing the Land and Water Conservation Fund in \n     1965, Congress determined that revenues generated by \n     extraction of nonrenewable oil and gas resources on the Outer \n     Continental Shelf should be dedicated to conservation and \n     preservation purposes.\n       (2) The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been used for \n     over three decades to protect and enhance national parks, \n     national forests, national wildlife refuges, and other public \n     lands throughout the Nation. In past years, the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund has also provided States with vital \n     resources to assist with acquisition and development of local \n     park and outdoor recreation projects.\n       (3) In 1978, the Congress amended the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund to authorize $900,000,000 of annual oil and \n     gas receipts to be used for Federal land acquisition and \n     State recreation projects. In recent years, however, the \n     Congress has failed to appropriate funds at the authorized \n     levels to meet Federal land acquisition needs, and has \n     entirely eliminated State recreation funding, leaving an \n     unallocated surplus of over $12,000,000,000 for fiscal year \n     1999.\n       (4) To better meet land acquisition needs and address \n     growing public demands for outdoor recreation, the Congress \n     should assure that the Land and Water Conservation Fund is \n     used as it was intended to acquire conservation lands and, in \n     partnership with State and local governments, to provide for \n     improved parks and outdoor recreational opportunities.\n       (5) The premise of using oil and gas receipts to meet \n     conservation and preservation objectives also underlies the \n     National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.). \n     Revenues to the Historic Preservation Fund accumulate at a \n     rate of $150,000,000 annually, but because the Congress has \n     failed in recent years to appropriate the authorized amounts, \n     the fund has an unallocated surplus of over $2,000,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 1999. To reduce the growing backlog of \n     preservation needs, the Congress should assure that the \n     Historic Preservation Fund is used as was intended.\n       (6) Building upon the commitment to devote revenues from \n     existing offshore leases to resource protection through the \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 U.S.C. 460l-\n     4) and the National Historic Preservation Act (16 U.S.C. 470 \n     et seq.), the Congress should also dedicate revenues from \n     existing oil and gas leases to meet critical national, State, \n     and local preservation and conservation needs.\n       (7) Suburban sprawl presents a growing threat to open space \n     and farmland in many areas of the Nation, with an estimated \n     loss of 7,000 acres of farmland and open space every day. \n     Financial resources and incentives are needed to promote the \n     protection of open space, farmland, ranchland, and forests.\n       (8) National parks, national forests, national wildlife \n     refuges, and other public lands have significant unmet repair \n     and maintenance needs for trails, campgrounds, and other \n     existing recreational infrastructure, even as outdoor \n     recreation and user demands on these resources are \n     increasing.\n       (9) Urban park and recreation needs have been neglected, \n     with resulting increases in crime and other inappropriate \n     activity, in part because the Congress has failed in recent \n     years to provide appropriations as authorized by the Urban \n     Park and Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 (16 U.S.C. 2501 et \n     seq.).\n       (10) Although the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) has prevented the extinction of many plants and \n     animals, the recovery of most species listed under that Act \n     has been hampered by a lack of financial resources and \n     incentives to encourage States and private landowners to \n     contribute to the recovery of protected species.\n       (11) Native fish and wildlife populations have declined in \n     many parts of the Nation, and face growing threats from \n     habitat loss and invasive species. Financial resources and \n     incentives are needed for States to improve conservation and \n     management of native species.\n       (12) Ocean and coastal ecosystems are increasingly degraded \n     by loss of habitat, pollution, over-fishing, and other \n     threats to the health and productivity of the marine \n     environment. Coastal States should be provided with financial \n     resources and incentives to better conserve, restore, and \n     manage living marine resources.\n       (13) The findings of the 1995 National Biological Survey \n     study entitled ``Endangered Ecosystems of the United States: \n     A Preliminary Assessment of Loss and Degradation'', \n     demonstrate the need to escalate conservation measures that \n     protect our Nation's wildlands and habitats.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to expand upon the \n     promises of the Land and Water Conservation Act of 1965 (16 \n     U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.) and the National Historic Preservation \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.) by providing permanent funding \n     for the protection and enhancement of the Nations natural, \n     historic, and cultural resources by a variety of means, \n     including--\n       (1) the acquisition of conservation lands;\n       (2) improvement of State and urban parks;\n       (3) preservation of open space, farmland, ranchland, and \n     forests;\n       (4) conservation of native fish and wildlife;\n       (5) recovery of endangered species; and\n       (6) restoration of coastal and marine resources.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Coastline.--The term ``coastline'' has the same meaning \n     that term has in the Submerged Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1301 et \n     seq.).\n       (2) Coastal state.--The term ``coastal State'' has the \n     meaning given the term ``coastal state'' in the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1451 et seq.).\n       (3) Leased tract.--The term ``leased tract'' means a tract, \n     leased under section 8 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \n     Act (43 U.S.C. 1337) for the purpose of drilling for, \n     developing and producing oil and natural gas resources, which \n     is a unit consisting of either a block, a portion of a block, \n     a combination of blocks or portions of blocks (or both), as \n     specified in the lease, and as depicted on an Outer \n     Continental Shelf Official Protraction Diagram.\n       (4) Qualified outer continental shelf revenues.--The term \n     ``qualified Outer Continental Shelf revenues''--\n       (A) except as provided in subparagraph (B)--\n       (i) means all moneys received by the United States from \n     each leased tract or portion of a leased tract located in the \n     Western or Central Gulf of Mexico, less such sums as may be \n     credited to States under section 8(g) of the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1337(g)) and amounts \n     needed for adjustments and refunds as overpayments for rents, \n     royalties, or other purposes; and\n       (ii) includes royalties (including payments for royalty \n     taken in-kind and sold), net profit share payments, and \n     related late-payment interest from natural gas and oil leases \n     issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 \n     U.S.C. 1331) for such a lease tract or portion; and\n       (B) does not include any moneys received by the United \n     States under--\n\n[[Page S1813]]\n\n       (i) any lease issued on or after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act; or\n       (ii) any lease under which no oil or gas production has \n     occurred before January 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Congress ought \n     to lay down the law: federal lands must be kept safe, even \n     added to, instead of treated as a national yard sale for \n     wealthy corporations to raid for cheap resources.

There are a number of positive initiatives \n     underway that will increase this critical land acquisition \n     fund, as well as support numerous other land protection \n     programs such as farmland preservation and fish, wildlife and \n     land restoration programs.\n       In particular, I urge you to become an original cosponsor \n     of a new bill to be introduced shortly by Senator Barbara \n     Boxer (D-CA). The Permanent Protection for America's \n     Resources 2000 Act builds upon the Clinton Administration's \n     proposed new Land Legacy initiative by providing a secure \n     source of funding for natural resource protection programs.\n       Senator Boxer's bill provides full and permanent annual \n     funding of the LWCF, funding for local governments and States \n     for conservation and recreation purposes, special funding for \n     coastal states to conserve and restore marine resources; and \n     farmland and open space preservation incentives.\n       Senator Boxer's bill stands in contrast to S. 25, a bill \n     recently introduced by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and \n     Mary Landrieu (D-LA). The Murkowski/Landrieu bill shares the \n     goal of funding important natural resource protection and \n     wildlife programs, but unfortunately does this at the expense \n     of our coastal environment. We are strongly opposed to this \n     bill in its current form because it would encourage increased \n     oil drilling by providing financial incentives to states \n     based in part on the amount of drilling off their coasts.\n       Thre has been some confusion about the relationship of S. \n     25 to Teaming with Wildlife, a legislative proposal that \n     received significant support last year. The Sierra Club \n     supported the Teaming with Wildlife proposal, which also \n     generated funding for wildlife programs. However, we are \n     actively opposed to the Murkowski/Landrieu bill due to the \n     drilling incentives in this bill.\n       Please consider becoming an original cosponsor of Senator \n     Boxer's bill. We also urge you not to cosponsor S. 25 unless \n     the drilling incentives are completely removed from the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Melanie L.

Here in California, it will clearly benefit \n     our state's wonderful rivers and watersheds.\n       We greatly appreciate your leadership in trying to find and \n     direct the monies necessary to support the Land and Water \n     Conservation funds at the State and federal levels, urban \n     parks and recreation, endangered species recovery programs, \n     historic preservation, fishery restoration, and the like.\n       On behalf of Friends of the River's 8,000 members, we thank \n     you for your good work and pledge to help see it through to \n     success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Betsy Reifsnider,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Parks and Conservation Association Pacific \n           Regional Office,\n                                   Oakland, CA, February 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the National Parks and \n     Conservation Association (NPCA), I would like to thank you \n     for your leadership as you strive to achieve a fully funded \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund. The ``Permanent Protection \n     for America's Resources 2000'' legislation, which you will be \n     introducing with Congressman George Miller, represents a bold \n     step in resolving the long standing gap between the list of \n     lands identified as critical for the protection of our \n     nation's natural and cultural heritage and the funds \n     necessary to acquire and restore them. NPCA strongly endorses \n     the bill.\n       Since its inception, the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     has often been the court of last resort for sensitive lands \n     threatened by development. However, due to competing demands \n     for these revenues generated by offshore oil profits, the \n     Fund has never been allowed to fulfill its mandate. As such, \n     our national parks remain incomplete, native habitat for fish \n     and wildlife has been fragmented, and opportunities to \n     recover endangered species have been lost. With the number of \n     threats to our nation's heritage growing exponentially, it is \n     clearly time to renew our commitment to a permanent, fully \n     funded Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n       NPCA looks forward to working with you and Congressman \n     Miller in passing this important legislation. Thank you \n     again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Brian Huse,\n     Regional Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Society for American Archaeology,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: The Society for American Archaeology \n     enthusiastically supports the ``Permanent Protection for \n     America's Resources 2000'' legislation that you will be \n     introducing with Congressman George Miller. SAA believes this \n     legislation is a comprehensive approach to insure long-term \n     protection of not only natural resources, but archaeological \n     and historic sites as well.\n       SAA applauds your joint efforts to fully fund the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund, the Historic Preservation Fund, and \n     other programs that have long suffered from diminished \n     financial support from the Congress. SAA is particularly \n     enthusiastic about the proposed annual funding for programs \n     fundable through the Historic Preservation Fund at $150 \n     million, including grants to the states and National Park \n     Service.\n       Enactment of this legislation will offer a comprehensive \n     set of tools to help protect the cultural and natural \n     environment in the future, and fulfills the Congressional \n     intent of earlier laws, which mandated that income from \n     offshore oil leases be directed towards the preservation of \n     our country's rich and diverse cultural and natural \n     heritages.\n       SAA looks forward to working with you and your staff in \n     support of this legislation, and, ultimately, to securing its \n     passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Vin Steponaitis,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Preservation Action\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Preservation Action offers its support \n     of your Permanent Protection for America's Resources 2000 \n     legislation. For too long, the portion of the revenue from \n     offshore oil resources meant for natural and historic \n     resource protection has gone unappropriated. Your Resources \n     2000 legislation offers the hope that permanent, annual \n     funding will be secured for resource preservation goals.\n       In particular, Preservation Action supports Resources 2000 \n     because it includes consideration for the Historic \n     Preservation Fund (HPF). Established in 1977 and authorized \n     at $150 million dollars annually since 1980, the HPF over the \n     last twenty years has never received more than about one-\n     third its annual authorized amount. Indeed, near level \n     funding for most of the 1990s meant that appropriations were \n     not even keeping pace with cost of living increases. Your \n     bill will not only direct much-needed dollars to HPF's core \n     programs--tax credit certification, Section 106 review, \n     National Register survey work and nominations, and technical \n     assistance--but ensures that the fund can meet preservation \n     needs at all levels.\n       Preservation Action is a national grassroots organization \n     dedicated to advocating the goals of the historic \n     preservation community. Since 1974, Preservation Action has \n     worked to see historic preservation used to protect America's \n     past--its neighborhoods, landmarks, and architectural \n     treasures--and build healthier communities. The best way to \n     preserve and protect our historic resources is to keep them \n     viable for today. Resources 2000, including its consideration \n     of the HPF, is an important step towards this goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Susan West Montgomery,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Conference of State Historic Preservation \n           Officers,\n                                Washington, DC, February 16, 1999.\n     Re: Historic Preservation Fund.\n     Hon Barbara Boxer,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: On behalf of the State Historic \n     Preservation Officers, thank you for including the Historic \n     Preservation Fund in your legislation ``Permanent Protection \n     for America's Resources 2000,'' to be introduced with \n     Congressman George Miller.\n       Congress was extremely far-sighted two decades ago when it \n     created the Land and Water Conservation and Historic \n     Preservation Funds. The idea of dedicating a portion of the \n     revenues generated by depleting non renewable resources to \n     the conservation of irreplaceable natural and cultural \n     resources is as powerful now as it was then. The fact that so \n     little of the offshore oil revenues have been going for their \n     intended purposes has been very frustrating to those trying \n     to preserve the nation's heritage.\n       The National Historic Preservation Act programs, \n     administered by partners in State,\n\n[[Page S1822]]\n\n     local and tribal governments, provide the infrastructure for \n     every community to identify and protect significant \n     landmarks, to create incentives for reinvesting in existing \n     settled areas as opposed to abandonment and ``sprawl,'' and \n     to encourage sustainable industries such as heritage tourism. \n     These programs are an essential complement to greater \n     assistance for federal properties in order to achieve a truly \n     comprehensive program for America's heritage.\n       The National Conference of State Historic Preservation \n     Officers thanks you for your leadership on this issue and \n     looks forward to working with you and your staff in support \n     of this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Eric Hertfelder,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n              National Association of Police Athletic Leagues,\n\n                          North Palm Beach, FL, February 19, 1999.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: I am writing on behalf of the National \n     Association of Police Athletic Leagues (PAL) to support your \n     legislation to provide permanent funding for high priority \n     resource preservation objectives through the Permanent \n     Protection for America's Resources 2000.\n       National PAL believes that participation in outdoor \n     recreation provides important physical, mental, and social \n     benefits to young people. Continued growth in demand for \n     outdoor recreation opportunities has brought overcrowding to \n     some areas, while budgetary constraints, environmental \n     pollution, and open space availability to other uses has \n     further added to the challenges we face. To effectively meet \n     this challenge, federal recreation efforts must receive \n     permanent federal commitment to support public land \n     acquisition and improvements, fish and wildlife programs, \n     urban recreation and historic preservation, and farmland and \n     open space.\n       We share in your vision of safe, clean, planned, and well-\n     maintained recreation areas, available to all Americans. It \n     is essential that funding of state and local recreation areas \n     increase to meet demand. These areas in particular bear the \n     brunt of recreational use but have not seen the increases in \n     funding necessary to support the growth, rehabilitation, \n     development, acquisition and improvements of recreation land. \n     The Resources 2000 initiative addresses the need to target \n     funds and restore our national commitment to the protection \n     and preservation of our public resources.\n       PAL Police Officers and volunteers work with young people \n     and depend on public lands to provide diverse and high \n     quality opportunities for recreation. Your concern for \n     America's Resources and passage of the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund legislation will guarantee that our PAL \n     kids and future generations of Americans will be assured of \n     our precious natural resources.\n       We are proud to join you and Congressman George Miller in \n     advocating support for Resources 2000. If I may be of any \n     assistance, please do not hesitate to call me at 561-844-\n     1823.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Joe Wilson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Bay Area Open Space Council,\n\n                                                February 18, 1999.\n     Hon. George Miller,\n     United States House of Representatives, District Office, \n         Concord, CA.\n       RE: PERMANENT PROTECTION FOR AMERICA'S RESOURCES 2000\n       Congressman Miller: The Bay Area Open Space Council thanks \n     you for your bold leadership in introducing the Permanent \n     Protection for America's Resources 2000 legislation. We would \n     like to express our strongest support.\n       The legislation proposes a comprehensive and thoughtful \n     approach for effectively addressing national resource \n     conservation needs.\n       Utilizing offshore oil lease revenues for resource \n     conservation is reasonable, practical, and consistent with \n     the original intent and commitment of Congress in \n     establishing the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n       This legislation is urgently needed. Our rapidly growing \n     population is placing unprecedented pressure on a wide range \n     of irreplaceable resources. The balanced package of programs \n     in your legislation will enable our economy to grow, and our \n     communities to prosper, by providing funding for the \n     protection of many of the resources which underpin our \n     economy and quality of life.\n       The Bay Area Open Space Council is a cooperative effort of \n     approximately 40 land conservation organizations and agencies \n     with responsibilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. We \n     applaud your leadership in proposing Permanent Protection For \n     America's Resources 2000, and commit to doing all we can to \n     assist.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John Woodbury,\n                                                 Program Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 447. A bill to deem as timely filed, and process for payment, the \napplications submitted by the Dodson School Districts for certain \nImpact Aid payments for fiscal year 1999; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                  dodson school districts legislation\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that may \nnot impact our nation but will have an impact on 120 students in my \nstate of Montana. These students are victims of a bureaucratic \nbamboozle that should be an easily reconciled mistake.\n  I would like to request the compassion of my colleagues. We all make \nmistakes and sometimes these mistakes have a financial cost to us as \nindividuals. However, in the case of the Dodson Public School District, \na misdirected application could result in a loss of impact aid funding. \nAs you all know, Impact Aid funding is necessary for areas that have no \nlocal revenue raising mechanism.\n  This application was inadvertently sent to the wrong office within \nthe Department of Education by the deadline. Last year, we say how \nunbending the Internal Revenue Service was in terms of customer \nservice--I would like to think the rest of the federal government does \nnot follow suit. According to the Department of Education, deadlines \nare deadlines. During hearing last year, Congress determined this is \nnot the culture we would like to see in the Department of Education or \nany other arm of the nation's federal government.\n  The loss of funds would likely mean the demise of the entire public \nschool system--a system that serves many residents of the Fort Belknap \nIndian Reservation. The economic state of Montana's reservations is not \nwell and losing this school district would require many students \nadditional transportation costs and travel of over thirty miles. \nAdditionally, adjoining school districts and local governments would be \nextremely pressed to pick up the tab for additional education and \ntransportation costs with much less proportionate revenue share.\n  Dodson Public Schools in Dodson, Montana has a total enrollment of \n120 students in K-12. In grades K-8, 53% of the total 74 students \nreside on federal land. In grades 9-12, 31% of the total 46 students \nreside on federal land. Of the total enrollment, 75% of the students \nare eligible for our free and reduced lunch program.\n  Mr. President, I'm certain you'll agree not many schools in America \ncan rival the need for impact aid funds like Dodson's schools.\n  Now that you know the facts, I think you'll agree we cannot ignore \nthe plight of Dodson School District. This is a simple plea from a \nmodest Montana community that would like to continue their rich, \nhistoric culture and legacy.\n  Mr. President, as you know, it is the role of Congress to protect the \nstudents of our nation. This bill will fix an unfortunate situation \nthat could happen to any state in our nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S.J. Res. 11. A joint resolution prohibiting the use of funds for \nmilitary operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) unless Congress enacts specific authorization in law for \nthe conduct of those operations; read the first time.\n\n\n  prohibiting the use of funds for military operations in the Federal \n                         Republic of Yugoslavia\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as President Reagan would \nsay, ``Here we go again.'' This administration is now on the verge of \nmaking a commitment of American forces to another 911 humanitarian \ncrisis around the world, without the approval of Congress.\n  As I stand here today, the United States is poised to launch \nairstrikes against the sovereign nation of Federal Republic of \nYugoslavia. Given the apparent failure of the talks in France regarding \nthe issue of the peacekeeping force, there is a real possibility that \nairstrikes may be imminent and that American forces, as part of a NATO \nforce, may be committed in Kosovo. I would venture to say that many \nAmericans would be hard-pressed to find Kosovo on a map; yet here again \nour sons and daughters are going to be asked to put their lives on the \nline for this administration without approval of their elected \nrepresentatives in Congress, and without any declaration of war.\n  Mr. President, this is very, very disturbing. I have spoken out in \nthe past against the Bosnia operation. I have spoken out against our \noccupation of\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\nHaiti. But Kosovo is the last straw for me. Today I am introducing a \nbill to ensure that Congress exercises its constitutional right of \napproval before this administration commits us to an act of war against \na sovereign nation. If we are going to be taking offensive military \naction, I don't believe there ought to be any troops in any sovereign \nnation unless there is a declaration of war, or at least a specific \nauthorization by Congress.\n  The resolution I am introducing simply says that there will be no \ntroops committed in any force of any kind without a specific \nauthorization from the U.S. Congress. I am going to call on my \ncolleagues to join me in this effort before we get embroiled in another \nlong-term conflict that is not in the United States' interest.\n  I want to make a few points about this.\n  This administration apparently thinks nothing of committing an act of \nwar without congressional approval--they will commit troops first, and \ncome to us later and ask for our support.\n  On the contrary, when President Bush wanted to repel Iraq from \nKuwait, he came to the Congress--a Democrat-controlled Congress--and \nCongress authorized him to do that. He came here. He took his chance. \nHe did the right thing. But that is not happening now.\n  While this body has been wrestling with impeachment proceedings, \nPresident Clinton's administration has been preparing to wage war.\n  I want to repeat that. We were tied down here for almost 2 months \ntalking about the impeachment of the President of the United States, \nand while we were doing that, the same President who was nearly removed \nfrom office was preparing to wage war against a sovereign nation \nwithout congressional approval. That is absolutely outrageous, and I am \nnot going to stand by any longer and be silent about it.\n  The administration has crafted a plan to fix the internal problems of \na sovereign state. And it proceeds, then, to hold a so-called peace \nconference where it threatens to use lethal force against that \nsovereign state if they don't accept the deal. The two parties are not \neven interested in an agreement. They still want to fight. They have \nbeen fighting in that region of the world for centuries. So we jam an \nagreement down their throats. And here come U.S. forces, again in \nharm's way, with no approval from Congress.\n  Before we send our troops to another dangerous part of the world, \nwhich this President has been prone to do for a long time, we have a \nsacred responsibility to these men and women to consider the risks. We \ndid not fight and win the Cold War so that--as the sole remaining \nsuperpower--we would get bogged down in parts of the world that the \nvast majority of Americans have never heard of.\n  Kosovo is as much a part of Yugoslavia as New Hampshire is of the \nUnited States. We are dictating, under the threat of American military \naction, the internal policy of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It \nmay be a policy that I despise, that I hate, that I am upset about. But \ndo we have that right, without an act of war or some authorization from \nCongress? We may not like it. It may be horrible. But that alone is not \na reason to go to war. Should we go to war in Zimbabwe or Ethiopia or \nsome other nation where some other problems are occurring that we don't \nlike? Where do you draw the line?\n  The administration tells us we must become involved in the internal \naffairs of a sovereign nation to prevent the spread of this conflict \ninto neighboring nations, including perhaps NATO members. This is a \nbogey-man argument. It is meant to scare us into resolving the conflict \nwith the American military. This argument is false and it obscures the \nreal issue of placing troops at risk in an area of the world where were \nwe have no real interest to justify direct intervention. Frankly, I am \ntired of it. I am tired of risking American lives when we do not have \nAmerican interests at stake. The precedent we would be setting by \nintervening in Kosovo is far more dangerous to American interests than \nthe small risk that this conflict is going to spread somewhere. What \nother troubled Balkan region will we go to next? Montenegro? Macedonia? \nWhere do we stop, Mr. President?\n  There was a letter to the Washington Post on February 20, written \nfrom a gentleman by the name of Alex N. Dragnich. He said:\n\n       We are threatening to bomb the Serbs, not because they have \n     invaded a foreign country but because they refuse to accept \n     an agreement which we have crafted, to resolve a domestic \n     conflict inside Yugoslavia and to permit the entrance of NATO \n     troops to enforce it. . . .\n\n  That is what this is about\n\n       More serious [he says] in the long run will be the \n     precedent we would be creating. Our proposed actions would \n     provide the arguments to justify a power or a combination of \n     powers to invade some country in search of justice for a \n     minority or minorities. This could be some Arab states, \n     perhaps in agreement with Russia, or it could be China \n     seeking to take over Taiwan.\n\n  The administration has created a situation where, no matter how the \nnegotiations conclude, our military people will likely be placed at \nrisk. Let me correct that--they will be placed at risk. The \nrecklessness with which this administration treats our men and women in \nuniform is shameful--shameful. We had to fight in the Senate on this \nfloor 2 years ago to get the administration to give them a pay raise. \nWe fight on this floor to try to get a national missile defense to \nprotect our own Nation--and we still cannot get it. If the parties do \nagree to a foreign military presence, then our troops will be committed \nto peace enforcement for more years than the administration is ready to \nadmit; a lot more years than this administration has left in office. \nAnd they will be in great jeopardy from retaliation, not by one side, \nbut by both sides. They will be in the middle of a civil war.\n\n  If the Serbs do not agree, then this administration is prepared to \nsend our troops into combat against an aggressive nation that is well \nequipped to defend itself from attack. Let there be no doubt, American \nlives will be endangered. This is not Iraq where everything is out in \nthe open. There are SAM sites embedded in mountains. The Serbs have the \ncapability to shoot down American aircraft. Remember that.\n  We all remember the promises made by the administration about Bosnia. \nThey said the troops will be out in a year. It was one year, then \nanother year, then another; now it is 3 years, with no end in sight, \nand it's cost $10 billion. Most of the time the President didn't even \nfund the operation; he took it out of funds for the troops, he raided \ntheir equipment modernization accounts to fund it. One of the primary \nreasons given by the administration, justifying the Bosnia \nintervention, was it would stabilize the region--yet today we are about \nto commit American troops to intervening in a new unstable region, \nKosovo.\n  We field an army, not a Salvation Army. Our military is woefully \nunderfunded. We need $125 billion over the next 5 years just to recover \nfrom where this administration has cut us. There are mounting concerns \nabout readiness. Should a crisis emerge that truly does endanger \nAmerica's legitimate interests, what happens? By volunteering to send \nforces to Kosovo, the President is again stretching our military too \nthin. The President is not just risking the lives of soldiers sent to \nthe region, but also our troops around the world. And for what?\n  Later on today we are going to be debating pay increases and \nretirement benefits for our troops. That is a serious need. The \noperations tempo that we require from our troops is a serious concern \nas well. Yet as we try to help on these problems, the administration \nonce again overextends our forces. There are troops that have been in \nthree or four hot spots in the last 3 years. Some have been in Bosnia, \nsome have been in the Persian Gulf, some have been in Haiti, some have \nbeen in Korea, and there will probably be a fifth one, Kosovo, for some \npeople. How much more can we take?\n  The administration says the possible troop commitment for peace \nenforcement in Kosovo is only for 4,000 troops. In the military there \nis the three-times rule. Not only do we commit those 4,000 on the \nground, but 4,000 more are preparing to go and 4,000 are recovering \nfrom being deployed there. This 4,000-man operation ties up 12,000 \ntroops. In truth, a four-times rule is probably more realistic, so it \nis more like 16,000.\n  We are already facing serious problems in recruiting, spare parts, \nand\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nother results of this high operating tempo. The administration has \nstrained the budget of the Defense Department to the limit, and our \ntroops are going to be the losers because of it. We simply cannot ask \nour military to do more and more with less. That is what this President \nhas continued to do.\n  Mr. President, we are 7,000 troops down in recruitment for the U.S. \nNavy. We don't even have enough sailors to man our ships. We are short \n23,000 recruits in the U.S. Army. Spare parts bins are empty in \nmilitary bases all over this country. They cannot repair some \nvehicles-- they are just too old. And yet here is the administration, \nready to send them into Kosovo.\n  In conclusion, throughout the Cold War we fought to protect the \nrights of sovereign nations to conduct themselves according to their \nown laws. We fought World War II over the same thing. In the Gulf War \nwe sent American soldiers to war to turn back an unlawful and immoral \ninvasion of the sovereign nation of Kuwait. There was much disagreement \nover that policy, but it was an attack of one sovereign nation on \nanother. Now, look at what has happened in just 8 years. Today we find \nour commitment to sovereignty turned on its head.\n  Let me issue a warning. The KLA, the Kosovo Liberation Army--these \nare not Boy Scouts. Neither is Slobodan Milosevic. This is going to be \na bloody mess, and we are going to be right in the middle of it. The \nKLA started a war that it cannot finish and now the administration \nwants U.S. pilots serve as its Air Force the American people know what \nwe are spending in Bosnia--$4 billion a year and growing, now adding to \nthat in Kosovo, and at the same time not yet deploying a missile \ndefense system for this country which is imperative for the security of \nour own people and our troops wherever they may be in the world.\n  I applaud the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire. I certainly \nhope that we will get a chance to talk about this. I look forward to \nhaving the leaders in Congress stand up and say, What is the policy; \nhow many more times are we going to put troops in harm's way, paid for \nby the taxpayers of America, when there is no exit strategy, there is \nno plan, there is no rotation out, there is no temporariness about \nthis. It is open-ended.\n  I applaud my colleague from New Hampshire, and I hope that the Senate \nwill address this before we have a fait accompli, troops on the ground, \nas we have had in Bosnia in an unending mission, with no strategy, no \nplan and no exit.\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                  s. 4\n\n  At the request of Mr. Warner, the name of

Res. 48\n\n       Whereas March 12, 1999, is the 87th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Girl Scouts of the United States of America;\n       Whereas on March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts became the first \n     national organization for girls to be granted a Federal \n     charter by Congress;\n       Whereas through annual reports required to be submitted to \n     Congress by its charter, the Girl Scouts regularly informs \n     Congress of its progress and program initiatives;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts is dedicated to inspiring girls and \n     young women with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \n     and service to others so that they may become model citizens \n     in their communities;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts offers girls aged 5 through 17 a \n     variety of opportunities to develop strong values and life \n     skills and provides a wide range of activities to meet girls' \n     interests and needs;\n       Whereas the Girl Scouts has a membership of nearly \n     3,000,000 girls and over 850,000 adult volunteers, and is one \n     of the preeminent organizations in the United States \n     committed to girls growing strong in mind, body, and spirit; \n     and\n       Whereas by fostering in girls and young women the qualities \n     on which the strength of the United States depends, the Girl \n     Scouts, for 87 years, has significantly contributed to the \n     advancement of the United States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning March 7, 1999, as \n     ``National Girl Scout Week''; and\n       (2) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     designating the week beginning March 7, 1999, as ``National \n     Girl Scout Week'' and calling on the people of the United \n     States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important \nresolution recognizing the Girl Scouts of America.\n  This year commemorates the 87th anniversary of the founding of this \noutstanding organization. On March 16, 1950, the Girl Scouts of the \nUnited States of America became the first national organization for \ngirls to be granted a Federal charter by Congress.\n  The Girl Scout Organization has long been dedicated to inspiring \ngirls and young women with the highest ideals of character, conduct, \nand service to others to that they may become model citizens in their \ncommunities.\n  For 86 years, the Girl Scout movement has provided valuable \nleadership skills for countless girls and young women across the \nnation. Today, overall membership in the Girl Scouts is the highest it \nhas been in 26 years, with 2.7 million girls and over 850,000 adult \nvolunteers. I am proud to say that I, too, was a Girl Scout.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senator Mikulski in introducing this \nlegislation, which would designate the week beginning March 7, 1999, as \n``National Girl Scout Week.'' I ask our colleagues to join us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1825-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1825-S1830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSOLDIERS', SAILORS', AIRMEN'S, AND MARINES' BILLS OF RIGHTS ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   ROBB (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 8\n\n  Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bingaman, and \nMr. Kerrey) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 4) to improve pay and \nretirement equity for members of the Armed Forces; and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 28, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following new \n     sections:\n\n     SEC. 104.

Mr. President. February 23rd is an important day \nnot just in Black History Month, but in the history of Massachusetts. \nToday is the birthday of one of the most significant leaders ever to \ncall Massachusetts home, one of the brave leaders of the early civil \nrights movement whose words still stir us today.\n  131 years ago, W.E.B. DuBois was born in Great Barrington, \nMassachusetts. He studied at Harvard University in Cambridge, where he \nearned his doctorate and published his landmark book ``Souls of Black \nFolk,'' through the Harvard University press.\n  On college campuses around the country, in our high schools, in our \ncities, and on our village greens, we are still reading that pioneering \ntext--and we remember the way it touched off a movement and challenged \na nation to consider the issue of race in a more honest and personal \nlight.\n  DuBois's prophetic words about the age in which he was living still \nring true. ``The problem of the twentieth century,'' he wrote, ``is the \nproblem of the color line.''\n  DuBois was right. We look back this month and honor the struggles and \nthe perseverance of so many courageous trailblazers in the civil rights \nmovement, so many leaders whose sacrifices paved the way for a society \nmore attune to the guarantees of equal opportunity under God and under \nthe law--ideas as fundamental to the promise of America as the \nDeclaration of Independence itself.\n  This month we remember Dr. King, Medgar Evers, James Meredith, Julian \nBond, the late Rep. Barbara Jordan, and my distinguished colleague from \nGeorgia, Rep. John Lewis. We honor their efforts to remove the barriers \nof race that kept America from knowing the full measure of its own \ngreatness--and we look towards their legacy as a polestar to guide us \ntowards the future.\n  There could be no more appropriate time to reflect on the future of \nthe Civil Rights Movement and the future of our nation itself than \ntoday--in this historic month, in this, the last year of the twentieth \ncentury.\n  No one can deny that ``the problem of the color line'' was indeed the \ngreat problem of the twentieth century. But no one can deny that \nAmerica made strides in putting that problem to rest, in healing our \nwounds--and in moving forward towards a brighter day in American \nhistory. African American family income, college admissions, and home \nownership have hit an all-time high. African American poverty is down \nto near-record levels. African Americans have written some of the \npivotal decisions of our Supreme Court, written the laws of our land in \nthe Congress, and written their own inspiring stories into the fabric \nof our history.\n  But still more must be done before we can say the problem of the \ncolor line has been eradicated.\n  The question before us today is simple--to paraphrase the words of \nthe late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his last book, ``where do \nwe go from here?''\n  The violence in Jasper, Texas; the conditions of too many of our \nnation's inner city schools; the subtler forms of discrimination still \nprevalent in so many of our top corporations; all these problems \nrequire our attention if we are to make good on the promise that \nnever--never again--will an American century be defined by our \nstruggles over race and our encounters with an intransigent crisis.\n  With open hearts and open minds--and with the commitment and \ndetermination of W.E.B. DuBois or Rosa Parks, who forty years ago sat \ndown on a bus and said she `would not be moved'--we too can tell those \nwho stand against equality that America will not be moved from an \nunshakable belief in the fundamental rights of every American--no \nmatter their race, creed, or color--to life, liberty, and the pursuit \nof happiness.\n  The challenge before us today is to summon the leadership in the \ntwenty-first century--at the highest levels of government, and in our \ndaily lives--to wipe away hatred, bigotry, and intolerance--and to make \nAmerica in the image of the African Americans we honor this month: the \nland of the free, the proud, and the brave. I urge the United States \nSenate to contemplate that challenge on this special day, in this \nimportant month for the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1832-2", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1832-S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RULES OF PROCEDURE OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ETHICS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

The \n     court in which such action is brought may assess a penalty \n     against such employee in any amount not to exceed the retail \n     value of the gift improperly solicited or received plus \n     $5,000.\n       (i) The President shall direct all Chiefs of a United \n     States Diplomatic Mission to inform their host governments \n     that it is a general policy of the United States Government \n     to prohibit United States Government employees from receiving \n     gifts or decorations of more than minimal value.\n       (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed to derogate \n     any regulation prescribed by any employing agency which \n     provides for more stringent limitations on the receipt of \n     gifts and decorations by its employees.\n       (k) The provisions of this section do not apply to grants \n     and other forms of assistance to which section 108A of the \n     Mutual Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 applies.\n\n                Part II: Supplementary Procedural Rules\n\n\n                       Rule 1.

If either the Chairman or the Vice \n     Chairman concludes from the report that it appears that the \n     member may be ineligible, the member shall be notified in \n     writing of the nature of the particular proceeding and the \n     reason that it appears that the member may be ineligible to \n     participate in it. If the member agrees that he or she is \n     ineligible, the member shall so notify the Chairman or Vice \n     Chairman.

In any such case an absent member's \n     vote may be announced solely for the purpose of recording the \n     member's position and such announced votes shall not be \n     counted for or against the motion.\n       (2) On matters other than matters listed in paragraph \n     (m)(1) above, the Committee may order that the record be held \n     open for the vote of absentees or recorded proxy votes if the \n     absent Committee member has been informed of the matter on \n     which the vote occurs and has affirmatively requested the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman in writing that he be so recorded.\n       (3) All proxies shall be in writing, and shall be delivered \n     to the Chairman or Vice Chairman to be recorded.\n       (4) Proxies shall not be considered for the purpose of \n     establishing a quorum.\n       (n) Approval of Blind Trusts and Foreign Travel Requests \n     Between Sessions and During Extended Recesses: During any \n     period in which the Senate stands in adjournment between \n     sessions of the Congress or stands in a recess scheduled \n     to extend beyond fourteen days, the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, or their designees, acting jointly, are \n     authorized to approve or disapprove blind trusts under the \n     provision of Rule XXXIV, and to approve or disapprove \n     foreign travel requests which require immediate \n     resolution.\n       (o) Committee Use of Services or Employees of Other \n     Agencies and Departments: With the prior consent of the \n     department or agency involved, the Committee may (1) utilize \n     the services, information, or facilities of any such \n     department or agency of the Government, and (2) employ on a \n     reimbursable basis or otherwise the services of such \n     personnel of any such department or agency as it deems \n     advisable. With the consent of any other committee of the \n     Senate, or any subcommittee, the Committee may utilize the \n     facilities and the services of the staff of such other \n     committee or subcommittee whenever the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman of the Committee, acting jointly, determine that \n     such action is necessary and appropriate.\n\n\n                Rule 2: Procedures for Sworn Complaints\n\n       (a) Sworn Complaints: Any person may file a sworn complaint \n     with the Committee, alleging that any Senator, or officer, or \n     employee of the Senate has violated a law, the Senate Code of \n     Official Conduct, or any rule or regulation of the Senate \n     relating to the conduct of any individual in the performance \n     of his or her duty as a Member, officer, or employee of the \n     Senate, or has engaged in improper conduct which may reflect \n     upon the Senate.\n       (b) Form and Content of Complaints: A complaint filed under \n     paragraph (a) shall be in writing and under oath, and shall \n     set forth in simple, concise and direct statements:\n       (1) The name and legal address of the party filing the \n     complaint (hereinafter, the complainant);\n       (2) The name and position or title of each Member, officer, \n     or employee of the Senate who is specifically alleged to have \n     engaged in the improper conduct or committed the violation \n     (hereinafter, the respondent);\n       (3) The nature of the alleged improper conduct or \n     violation, including if possible, the specific provision of \n     the Senate Code of Official Conduct or other law, rule, or \n     regulation alleged to have been violated.\n       (4)(A) A Statement of the facts within the personal \n     knowledge of the complainant that are alleged to constitute \n     the improper conduct or violation.\n       (B) The term ``personal knowledge'' is not intended to and \n     does not limit the complainant's statement to situations that \n     he or she personally witnessed or to activities in which the \n     complainant was a participant.\n       (C) Where allegations in the sworn complaint are made upon \n     the information and belief of the complainant, the complaint \n     shall so state, and shall set forth the basis for such \n     information and belief.\n       (5) The complainant must swear that all of the information \n     contained in the complaint either (a) is true, or (b) was \n     obtained under circumstances such that the complainant has \n     sufficient personal knowledge of the source of the \n     information reasonably to believe that it is true. The \n     complainant may so swear either by oath or by solemn \n     affirmation before a notary public or other authorized \n     official.\n        (6) All documents in the possession of the complainant \n     relevant to or in support of his or her allegations may be \n     appended to the complaint.\n       (c) Processing of Sworn Complaints:\n       (1) When the Committee receives a sworn complaint against a \n     Member, officer or employee of the Senate, it shall determine \n     by majority vote whether the complaint is in substantial \n     compliance with paragraph (b) of this rule.\n       (2) If it is determined by the Committee that a sworn \n     complaint does not substantially comply with the requirements \n     of paragraph (b), the complaint shall be returned promptly to \n     the complainant, with a statement explaining how the \n     complaint fails to comply and a copy of the rules for filing \n     sworn complaints.

(See paragraph (d).)\n       (5) A preliminary inquiry shall be completed within sixty \n     days after the unsworn allegations or information were \n     received by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. The sixty day \n     period may be extended for a specified period by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly. A preliminary inquiry is \n     completed when the Chairman and the Vice Chairman have made \n     the determination required by subparagraphs (3) and (4) of \n     this paragraph.\n       (d) Determination Whether To Conduct an Initial Review: \n     When information or allegations are presented to the \n     Committee by the Chairman and the Vice Chairman, the \n     Committee shall determine whether an initial review should be \n     undertaken.\n       (1) An initial review shall be undertaken when--\n       (A) there is reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the possible improper \n     conduct or violation may be within the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee; and\n       (B) there is a reason to believe on the basis of the \n     information before the Committee that the improper conduct or \n     violation may have occurred.\n       (2) The determination whether to undertake an initial \n     review shall be made by recorded vote within thirty days \n     following the Committee's receipt of the unsworn allegations \n     or information from the Chairman or Vice Chairman, or at the \n     first meeting of the Committee thereafter if none occurs \n     within thirty days, unless this time is extended for a \n     specified period by the Committee.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that an initial review is \n     not warranted because (a) there is no reason to believe on \n     the basis of the information before the Committee that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred, or (b) the \n     improper conduct or violation, even if proven, is not within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee.\n       (A) If the Committee determines that an initial review is \n     not warranted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if \n     any, and any known respondent.\n       (B) If there is a complainant, he or she may also be \n     invited to submit additional information, and notified of the \n     procedures for filing a sworn complaint. If the complainant \n     later provides additional information, not in the form of a \n     sworn complaint, it shall be handled as a new allegation in \n     accordance with the procedures of Rule 3. If he or she \n     submits a sworn complaint, it shall be handled in accordance \n     with Rule 2.\n       (4)(A) The Committee may determine that there is reason to \n     believe on the basis of the information before it that the \n     improper conduct or violation may have occurred and may be \n     within the jurisdiction of the Committee, and that an initial \n     review must therefore be conducted.\n       (B) If the Committee determines that an initial review will \n     be conducted, it shall promptly notify the complainant, if \n     any, and the respondent, if any.\n       (C) The notice required under subparagraph (B) shall \n     include a general statement of the information or allegations \n     before the Committee, and a statement that the Committee will \n     immediately begin an initial review of the complaint. A copy \n     of the Rules of the Committee shall be supplied with the \n     notice.\n       (5) If a member of the Committee believes that the \n     preliminary inquiry has provided sufficient information for \n     the Committee to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred, the member may \n     move that the Committee dispense with the initial review and \n     move directly to the determinations described in Rule 4(f). \n     The Committee may adopt such a motion by majority vote of the \n     full Committee.\n\n\n          Rule 4: Procedures for Conducting an Initial Review\n\n       (a) Basis for Initial Review: The Committee shall promptly \n     commence an initial review whenever it has received either \n     (1) a sworn complaint that the Committee has determined is in \n     substantial compliance with the requirements of Rule 2, or \n     (2) unsworn allegations or information that have caused the \n     Committee to determine in accordance with Rule 3 that an \n     initial review must be conducted.\n       (b) Scope of Initial Review:\n       (1) The initial review shall be of such duration and scope \n     as may be necessary to determine whether there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred.\n       (2) An initial review may include any inquiries, \n     interviews, sworn statements, depositions, and subpoenas that \n     the Committee deems appropriate to obtain information upon \n     which to make any determination provided for by this Rule.\n       (c) Opportunity for Response: An initial review may include \n     an opportunity for any known respondent or his designated \n     representative to present either a written or oral statement, \n     or to respond orally to questions from the Committee. Such an \n     oral statement or answers shall be transcribed and signed by \n     the person providing the statement or answers.\n       (d) Status Reports: The Committee staff or outside counsel \n     shall periodically report to the Committee in the form and \n     according to the schedule prescribed by the Committee. The \n     reports shall be confidential.\n       (e) Final Report: When the initial review is completed, the \n     staff or outside counsel shall make a confidential report to \n     the Committee on findings and recommendations.\n       (f) Committee Action: As soon as practicable following \n     submission of the report on the initial review, the Committee \n     shall determine by a recorded vote whether there is \n     substantial credible evidence which provides substantial \n     cause for the Committee to conclude that a violation within \n     the jurisdiction of the Committee has occurred. The Committee \n     may make any of the following determinations:\n       (1) The Committee may determine that there is not such \n     substantial credible evidence. In this case, the Committee \n     shall report its determination to the complainant, if any, \n     and to the respondent, together with an explanation of the \n     basis for the determination. The explanation may be as \n     detailed as the Committee desires, but it is not required to \n     include a complete discussion of the evidence collected in \n     the initial review.\n       (2) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged violation \n     is inadvertent, technical, or otherwise of a de minimis \n     nature. In this case, the Committee may attempt to correct or \n     to prevent such violation by informal methods. The \n     Committee's final determination in this matter shall be \n     reported to the complainant, if any, and to the respondent, \n     if any.\n       (3) The Committee may determine that there is such \n     substantial credible evidence, but that the alleged \n     violation, if proven, although not of a de minimis nature, \n     would not be sufficiently serious to justify the severe \n     disciplinary actions specified in Senate Resolution 338, 88th \n     Congress, as amended (i.e., for a Member, censure, expulsion, \n     or recommendation to the appropriate party conference \n     regarding the Member's seniority or positions of \n     responsibility; or for an officer or employee, suspension or \n     dismissal). In this case, the Committee, by the recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four members, may propose a \n     remedy that it deems appropriate. If the respondent agrees to \n     the proposed remedy, a summary of the Committee's conclusions \n     and the remedy proposed and agreed to shall be filed as a \n     public record with the Secretary of the Senate and a notice \n     of the filing shall be printed in the Congressional Record.\n       (4) The Committee may determine, by recorded affirmative \n     vote of at least four members, that there is such substantial \n     credible evidence, and also either:\n       (A) that the violation, if proved, would be sufficiently \n     serious to warrant imposition of one of the severe \n     disciplinary actions listed in paragraph (3); or\n       (B) that the violation, if proven, is less serious, but was \n     not resolved pursuant to the procedure in paragraph (3). In \n     either case, the Committee shall order that an investigation \n     promptly be conducted in accordance with Rule 5.\n\n\n           Rule 5: Procedures for Conducting an Investigation\n\n       (a) Definition of Investigation: An ``investigation'' is a \n     proceeding undertaken by the Committee, by recorded \n     affirmative vote of at least four members, after a finding on \n     the basis of an initial review that there is substantial \n     credible evidence which provides substantial cause for the \n     Committee to conclude that a violation within its \n     jurisdiction has occurred.\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\n       (b) Scope of Investigation: When the Committee decides to \n     conduct an investigation, it shall be of such duration and \n     scope as is necessary for the Committee to determine whether \n     a violation within its jurisdiction has occurred. In the \n     course of the investigation, designated outside counsel, or \n     if the Committee determines not to use outside counsel, the \n     Committee or its staff, may conduct inquiries or interviews, \n     take sworn statements, use compulsory process as described in \n     Rule 7, or take any other actions that the Committee deems \n     appropriate to secure the evidence necessary to make this \n     determination.\n       (c) Notice to Respondent: The Committee shall give written \n     notice to any known respondent who is the subject of an \n     investigation. The notice shall be sent to the respondent no \n     later than five working days after the Committee has voted to \n     conduct an investigation. The notice shall include a \n     statement of the nature of the possible violation, and \n     description of the evidence indicating that a possible \n     violation occurred. The Committee shall offer the respondent \n     an opportunity to present a statement or to respond to \n     questions from members of the Committee, the Committee staff, \n     or outside counsel.\n       (d) Right to a Hearing: The Committee shall accord a \n     respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it recommends \n     disciplinary action against that respondent to the Senate.\n       (e) Progress Reports to Committee: The Committee staff or \n     outside counsel shall periodically report to the Committee \n     concerning the progress of the investigation. Such reports \n     shall be delivered to the Committee in the form and according \n     to the schedule prescribed by the Committee, and shall be \n     confidential.\n       (f) Report of Investigation:\n       (1) Upon completion of an investigation, including any \n     hearings held pursuant to Rule 6, the outside counsel or the \n     staff shall submit a confidential written report to the \n     Committee, which shall detail the factual findings of the \n     investigation and which may recommend disciplinary action, if \n     appropriate. Findings of fact of the investigation shall be \n     detailed in this report whether or not disciplinary action is \n     recommended.\n       (2) The Committee shall consider the report of the staff or \n     outside counsel promptly following its submission. The \n     Committee shall prepare and submit a report to the Senate, \n     including a recommendation to the Senate concerning \n     disciplinary action, if appropriate. A report shall be \n     issued, stating in detail the Committee's findings of fact, \n     whether or not disciplinary action is recommended. The report \n     shall also explain fully the reasons underlying the \n     Committee's recommendation concerning disciplinary action, if \n     any. No recommendation or resolution of the Committee \n     concerning the investigation of a Member, officer or employee \n     of the Senate may be approved except by the affirmative \n     recorded vote of not less than four members of the Committee.\n       (3) Promptly, after the conclusion of the investigation, \n     the Committee's report and recommendation shall be forwarded \n     to the Secretary of the Senate, and a copy shall be provided \n     to the complainant and the respondent. The full report and \n     recommendation shall be printed and made public, unless the \n     Committee determines by majority vote that it should remain \n     confidential.\n\n\n                    Rule 6: Procedures for Hearings\n\n       (a) Right to Hearing: The Committee may hold a public or \n     executive hearing in any inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding. The Committee shall \n     accord a respondent an opportunity for a hearing before it \n     recommends disciplinary action against that respondent to the \n     Senate. (See Rule 5(e).)\n       (b) Non-Public Hearings: The Committee may at any time \n     during a hearing determine in accordance with paragraph 5(b) \n     of Rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate whether to \n     receive the testimony of specific witnesses in executive \n     session. If a witness desires to express a preference for \n     testifying in public or in executive session, he or she shall \n     so notify the Committee at least five days before he or she \n     is scheduled to testify.\n       (c) Adjudicatory Hearings: The Committee may, by majority \n     vote, designate any public or executive hearing as an \n     adjudicatory hearing; and, any hearing which is concerned \n     with possible disciplinary action against a respondent or \n     respondents designated by the Committee shall be an \n     adjudicatory hearing. In any adjudicatory hearing, the \n     procedures described in paragraph (i) shall apply.\n       (d) Subpoena Power: The Committee may require, by subpoena \n     or otherwise, the attendance and testimony of such witnesses \n     and the production of such correspondence, books, papers, \n     documents or other articles as it deems advisable. (See Rule \n     7.)\n       (e) Notice of Hearings: The Committee shall make public an \n     announcement of the date, place, and subject matter of any \n     hearing to be conducted by it, in accordance with Rule 1(f).\n       (f) Presiding Officer: The Chairman shall preside over the \n     hearings, or in his absence the Vice Chairman. If the Vice \n     Chairman is also absent, a Committee member designated by the \n     Chairman shall preside. If an oath or affirmation is \n     required, it shall be administered to a witness by the \n     Presiding Officer, or in his absence, by any Committee \n     member.\n       (g) Witnesses:\n       (1) A subpoena or other request to testify shall be served \n     on a witness sufficiently in advance of his or her scheduled \n     appearance to allow the witness a reasonable period of time, \n     as determined by the Committee, to prepare for the hearing \n     and to employ counsel if desired.\n       (2) The Committee may, by majority vote, rule that no \n     member of the Committee or staff or outside counsel shall \n     make public the name of any witness subpoenaed by the \n     Committee before the date of that witness' scheduled \n     appearance, except as specifically authorized by the Chairman \n     and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Committee at least two working \n     days in advance of the hearing at which the statement is to \n     be presented. The Chairman and Vice Chairman shall determine \n     whether such statements may be read or placed in the record \n     of the hearing.\n       (4) Insofar as practicable, each witness shall be permitted \n     to present a brief oral opening statement, if he or she \n     desires to do so.\n       (h) Right To Testify: Any person whose name is mentioned or \n     who is specifically identified or otherwise referred to in \n     testimony or in statements made by a Committee member, staff \n     member or outside counsel, or any witness, and who reasonably \n     believes that the statement tends to adversely affect his or \n     her reputation may--\n       (1) Request to appear personally before the Committee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf; or\n       (2) File a sworn statement of facts relevant to the \n     testimony or other evidence or statement of which he or she \n     complained. Such request and such statement shall be \n     submitted to the Committee for its consideration and action.\n       (i) Conduct of Witnesses and Other Attendees: The Presiding \n     Officer may punish any breaches of order and decorum by \n     censure and exclusion from the hearings. The Committee, by \n     majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that the offender \n     be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (j) Adjudicatory Hearing Procedures:\n       (1) Notice of hearings: A copy of the public announcement \n     of an adjudicatory hearing, required by paragraph (e), shall \n     be furnished together with a copy of these Rules to all \n     witnesses at the time that they are subpoenaed or otherwise \n     summoned to testify.\n       (2) Preparation for adjudicatory hearings:\n       (A) At least five working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the Committee shall provide the \n     following information and documents to the respondent, if \n     any:\n       (i) a list of proposed witnesses to be called at the \n     hearing;\n       (ii) copies of all documents expected to be introduced as \n     exhibits at the hearing; and\n       (iii) a brief statement as to the nature of the testimony \n     expected to be given by each witness to be called at the \n     hearing.\n       (B) At least two working days prior to the commencement of \n     an adjudicatory hearing, the respondent, if any, shall \n     provide the information and documents described in divisions, \n     (i), (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (A) to the Committee.\n       (C) At the discretion of the Committee, the information and \n     documents to be exchanged under this paragraph shall be \n     subject to an appropriate agreement limiting access and \n     disclosure.\n       (D) If a respondent refuses to provide the information and \n     documents to the Committee (see (A) and (B) of this \n     subparagraph), or if a respondent or other individual \n     violates an agreement limiting access and disclosure, the \n     Committee, by majority vote, may recommend to the Senate that \n     the offender be cited for contempt of Congress.\n       (3) Swearing of witnesses: All witnesses who testify at \n     adjudicatory hearings shall be sworn unless the Presiding \n     Officer, for good cause, decides that a witness does not have \n     to be sworn.\n       (4) Right to counsel: Any witness at an adjudicatory \n     hearing may be accompanied by counsel of his or her own \n     choosing, who shall be permitted to advise the witness of his \n     or her legal rights during the testimony.\n       (5) Right to cross-examine and call witnesses:\n       (A) In adjudicatory hearings, any respondent who is the \n     subject of an investigation, and any other person who obtains \n     the permission of the Committee, may personally or through \n     counsel cross-examine witnesses called by the Committee and \n     may call witnesses in his or her own behalf.\n       (B) A respondent may apply to the Committee for the \n     issuance of subpoenas for the appearance of witnesses or the \n     production of documents on his or her behalf. An application \n     shall be approved upon a concise showing by the respondent \n     that the proposed testimony or evidence is relevant and \n     appropriate, as determined by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman.\n       (C) With respect to witnesses called by a respondent, or \n     other individual given permission by the Committee, each such \n     witness shall first be examined by the party who called the \n     witness or by that party's counsel.\n       (D) At least one working day before a witness' scheduled \n     appearance, a witness or a witness' counsel may submit to the \n     Committee written questions proposed to be asked of that \n     witness. If the Committee determines that it is necessary, \n     such questions may be asked by any member of the Committee, \n     or by any Committee staff member if directed by a Committee \n     member. The witness or witness' counsel may also submit \n     additional sworn testimony for the record\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\n     within twenty-four hours after the last day that the witness \n     has testified. The insertion of such testimony in that day's \n     record is subject to the approval of the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman acting jointly within five days after the testimony \n     is received.\n       (6) Admissibility of evidence:\n       (A) The object of the hearing shall be to ascertain the \n     truth. Any evidence that may be relevant and probative shall \n     be admissible, unless privileged under the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence. Rules of evidence shall not be applied strictly but \n     the Presiding Officer shall exclude irrelevant or unduly \n     repetitious testimony. Objections going only to the weight \n     that should be given evidence will not justify its exclusion.\n       (B) The Presiding Officer shall rule upon any question of \n     the admissibility of testimony or other evidence presented to \n     the Committee. Such rulings shall be final unless reversed or \n     modified by a majority vote of the Committee before the \n     recess of that day's hearings.\n       (C) Notwithstanding paragraphs (A) and (B), in any matter \n     before the Committee involving allegations of sexual \n     discrimination, including sexual harassment, or sexual \n     misconduct, by a Member, officer, or employee, within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee, the Committee shall be guided \n     by the standards and procedures of Rule 412 of the Federal \n     Rules of Evidence, except that the Committee may admit \n     evidence subject to the provisions of this paragraph only \n     upon a determination of a majority of the members of the full \n     Committee that the interests of justice require that such \n     evidence be admitted.\n       (7) Supplementary hearing procedures: The Committee may \n     adopt any additional special hearing procedures that it deems \n     necessary or appropriate to a particular adjudicatory \n     hearing. Copies of such supplementary procedures shall be \n     furnished to witnesses and respondents, and shall be made \n     available upon request to any member of the public.\n       (k) Transcripts:\n       (1) An accurate stenographic or recorded transcript shall \n     be made of all public and executive hearings. Any member of \n     the Committee, Committee staff member, outside counsel \n     retained by the Committee, or witness may examine a copy of \n     the transcript retained by the Committee of his or her own \n     remarks and may suggest to the official reporter any \n     typographical or transcription errors. If the reporter \n     declines to make the requested corrections, the member, staff \n     member, outside counsel or witness may request a ruling by \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman acting jointly. Any member or \n     witness shall return the transcript with suggested \n     corrections to the Committee offices within five working days \n     after receipt of the transcript, or as soon thereafter as \n     is practicable. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, the member or witness may only inspect the \n     transcript at a location determined by the Chairman and \n     Vice Chairman, acting jointly. Any questions arising with \n     respect to the processing and correction of transcripts \n     shall be decided by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly.\n       (2) Except for the record of a hearing which is closed to \n     the public, each transcript shall be printed as soon as is \n     practicable after receipt of the corrected version. The \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, may order the \n     transcript of a hearing to be printed without the corrections \n     of a member or witness if they determine that such member or \n     witness has been afforded a reasonable time to correct such \n     transcript and such transcript has not been returned within \n     such time.\n       (3) The Committee shall furnish each witness, at no cost, \n     one transcript copy of that witness' testimony given at a \n     public hearing. If the testimony was given in executive \n     session, then a transcript copy shall be provided upon \n     request, subject to appropriate conditions and restrictions \n     prescribed by the Chairman and Vice Chairman. If any \n     individual violates such conditions and restrictions, the \n     Committee may recommend by majority vote that he or she be \n     cited for contempt of Congress.\n\n\n                   Rule 7: Subpoenas and Depositions\n\n       (a) Subpoenas:\n       (1) Authorization for issuance: Subpoenas for the \n     attendance and testimony of witnesses at depositions or \n     hearings, and subpoenas for the production of documents and \n     tangible things at depositions, hearings, or other times and \n     places designated therein, may be authorized for issuance by \n     either (A) a majority vote of the Committee, or (B) the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, at any time \n     before a preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of obtaining \n     information to evaluate unsworn allegations or information, \n     or at any time during a preliminary inquiry, initial review, \n     investigation, or other proceeding.\n       (2) Signature and service: All subpoenas shall be signed by \n     the Chairman or the Vice Chairman and may be served by any \n     person eighteen years of age or older, who is designated by \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman. Each subpoena shall be served \n     with a copy of the Rules of the Committee and a brief \n     statement of the purpose of the Committee's proceeding.\n       (3) Withdrawal of subpoena: The Committee, by majority \n     vote, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by it \n     or authorized for issuance by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, \n     acting jointly. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, may withdraw any subpoena authorized for issuance by \n     them.\n       (b) Depositions:\n       (1) Persons authorized to take depositions: Depositions may \n     be taken by any Member of the Committee designated by the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, or by any other \n     person designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, including outside counsel, Committee staff, other \n     employees of the Senate, or government employees detailed to \n     the Committee.\n       (2) Deposition notices: Notices for the taking of \n     depositions shall be authorized by the Committee, or the \n     Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, and issued by \n     the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or a Committee staff member \n     or outside counsel designated by the Chairman and Vice \n     Chairman, acting jointly. Depositions may be taken at any \n     time before a preliminary inquiry, for the purpose of \n     obtaining information to evaluate unsworn allegations or \n     information, or at any time during a preliminary inquiry, \n     initial review, investigation, or other proceeding. \n     Deposition notices shall specify a time and place for \n     examination. Unless otherwise specified, the deposition \n     shall be in private, and the testimony taken and documents \n     produced shall be deemed for the purpose of these rules to \n     have been received in a closed or executive session of the \n     Committee. The Committee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness' failure to appear, or to testify, or to produce \n     documents, unless the deposition notice was accompanied by \n     a subpoena authorized for issuance by the Committee, or \n     the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly.\n       (3) Counsel at depositions: Witnesses may be accompanied at \n     a deposition by counsel to advise them of their rights.\n       (4) Deposition procedure: Witnesses at depositions shall be \n     examined upon oath administered by an individual authorized \n     by law to administer oaths, or administered by any Member of \n     the Committee if one is present. Questions may be propounded \n     by any person or persons who are authorized to take \n     depositions for the Committee. If a witness objects to a \n     question and refuses to testify, or refuses to produce a \n     document, any Member of the Committee who is present may rule \n     on the objection and, if the objection is overruled, direct \n     the witness to answer the question or produce the document. \n     If no Member of the Committee is present, the individual who \n     has been designated by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting \n     jointly, to take the deposition may proceed with the \n     deposition, or may, at that time or at a subsequent time, \n     seek a ruling by telephone or otherwise on the objection from \n     the Chairman or Vice Chairman of the Committee, who may refer \n     the matter to the Committee or rule on the objection. If the \n     Chairman or Vice Chairman, or the Committee upon referral, \n     overrules the objection, the Chairman, Vice Chairman, or the \n     Committee as the case may be, may direct the witness to \n     answer the question or produce the document. The Committee \n     shall not initiate procedures leading to civil or criminal \n     enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify or produce \n     documents after having been directed to do so.\n       (5) Filing of depositions: Deposition testimony shall be \n     transcribed or electronically recorded. If the deposition is \n     transcribed, the individual administering the oath shall \n     certify on the transcript that the witness was duly sworn in \n     his or her presence and the transcriber shall certify that \n     the transcript is a true record of the testimony. The \n     transcript with these certifications shall be filed with the \n     chief clerk of the Committee, and the witness shall be \n     furnished with access to a copy at the Committee's offices \n     for review. Upon inspecting the transcript, within a time \n     limit set by the Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     a witness may request in writing changes in the transcript to \n     correct errors in transcription. The witness may also bring \n     to the attention of the Committee errors of fact in the \n     witness' testimony by submitting a sworn statement about \n     those facts with a request that it be attached to the \n     transcript. The Chairman and Vice Chairman, acting jointly, \n     may rule on the witness' request, and the changes or \n     attachments allowed shall be certified by the Committee's \n     chief clerk. If the witness fails to make any request under \n     this paragraph within the time limit set, this fact shall be \n     noted by the Committee's chief clerk. Any person authorized \n     by the Committee may stipulate with the witness to changes in \n     this procedure.\n\n\n Rule 8: Violations of Law; Perjury; Legislative Recommendations; and \n               Applicable Rules and Standards of Conduct\n\n       (a) Violations of Law: Whenever the Committee determines by \n     majority vote that there is reason to believe that a \n     violation of law may have occurred, it shall report such \n     possible violation to the proper state and federal \n     authorities.\n       (b) Perjury: Any person who knowingly and willfully swears \n     falsely to a sworn complaint or any other sworn statement to \n     the Committee does so under penalty of perjury. The Committee \n     may refer any such case to the Attorney General for \n     prosecution.\n       (c) Legislative Recommendations: The Committee shall \n     recommend to the Senate by report or resolution such \n     additional rules, regulations, or other legislative measures \n     as it determines to be necessary or desirable to ensure \n     proper standards of conduct by Members, officers, or \n     employees of the Senate. The Committee may conduct such \n     inquiries as it deems necessary to prepare such a report or \n     resolution, including the holding of\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\n     hearings in public or executive session and the use of \n     subpoenas to compel the attendance of witnesses or the \n     production of materials.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable accomplishments of Charles Mandel as he prepares to receive \nthe Chaver Award from the Highland Park Conservative Temple and Center. \nCharlie was born in Jersey City, where he graduated from William L. \nDickson High School in 1935. He then went on to graduate from Rutgers \nUniversity with a degree in ceramic engineering in 1939. For the next \n42 years, Charlie worked as a plant manager and ceramic engineer with \nthe Willett Company. Following his retirement, Charlie has continued to \nserve as a consulting engineer for New Jersey Porcelain Company and \nLenape Products Company in Trenton, New Jersey.\n  Charlie has been affiliated with the temple since 1953. After \nofficially joining the temple in January 1955, he was appointed Gabbai \nand continues as Senior Gabbai to this day. Charlie has also served on \nthe Bimah with every temple President from Harry Kroll to the current \nPresident, Ed Guttenplan. In addition to these duties, Charlie has \nplayed an integral role in the temple's daily management. He was \nelected to the Temple Board of Trustees in 1955 and has remained there \ncontinuously, as a Trustee, Recording Secretary and Financial \nSecretary. In recognition of his loyalty and commitment, he was granted \nHonorary Life Membership to the Board of Trustees, a position held by \nonly four other people.\n  Charlie has been active on the Religious Committee, House Committee, \nBazaar Committee, and has had the unique experiences of serving on the \nRabbinical Search Committees for both Rabbi Yakov Hilsenrath and Rabbi \nEliot Malomet. In addition, he was chairman of the Special Fund Raising \nCommittee for forty years. The Special Fund Raising Committee has long \nbeen a euphemism for Bingo, which balanced the budget for forty years. \nCharlie's dedication to managing Bingo resulted in his giving up a \nmyriad of social and family functions on Tuesday evenings.\n  There probably is not an inch of the temple building that has not \nbenefitted from Charlie's commitment and dedication. He has always been \nwilling to give himself to the temple in any capacity whenever and \nwherever called upon. The entire temple community has been enriched by \nCharlie's presence, and they are grateful for his support through the \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/02/23/senate-section/article/S1844-1", "month": "02", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "23", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENT BY THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
