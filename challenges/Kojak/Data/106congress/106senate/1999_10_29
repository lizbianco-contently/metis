There will now be 30 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I might ask my colleague to yield 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague from South \nCarolina. I thank him for all his fine work in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I want to divide my remarks in 5 minutes and deliver \nthem in two parts. In the first part, I will talk about the African-\nCaribbean trade bill. I want to repeat two points I made\n\n[[Page S13492]]\n\nduring the course of this debate. There are some very good Senators who \nin very good conscience can have different viewpoints on this \nlegislation.\n  For my own part, the first point I will make is that I actually do \nnot believe this is about whether or not we as a nation are in an \ninternational economy; we are. And I don't think it is about whether or \nnot we are actively involved in trade; we are. It is more about the \nterms of the trade. I do believe it is a flaw, a fundamental flaw, of \nthis legislation that, again, we have trade legislation that does not \nhave any enforceable labor protections or enforceable environmental \nprotections. At the very minimum, it would seem to me we have to get \nserious about having clear language in these agreements which gives \npeople the right in countries with which we are trading to be able to \norganize and bargain collectively for themselves and their families. \nThe same thing can be said for the environment, the same thing can be \nsaid for child labor, and the same thing can be said for human rights \nas a part of these labor agreements.\n  I think basically what this African and Caribbean trade agreement \nsays is two things. It says to workers, to wage earners in our country: \nIf you should decide you want to organize to be able to bargain \ncollectively and get a better wage and better working conditions for \nyourself so you can do better for your family, then just understand \nthat these companies, these businesses, will just go to other parts of \nthe world where they don't have to deal with you at all. They don't \nhave to deal with the right of the workers to be able to organize. What \nit says to poor people and what it says to working people in African \ncountries and Caribbean countries is, the way you get the investment is \nto be willing to work for jobs that pay less than 30 cents an hour, or \nwhatever the case might be, because that is the only way it is going to \nhappen because there are in these agreements no protections, no \nenforceable labor code--child labor, right to organize, right to \nbargain collectively--no enforceable environmental code. That is the \nfirst point.\n  The second point I will make about this legislation is that I think \nit is a terrible message to send as we move to the WTO gathering in \nSeattle. I am in profound disagreement with the administration on this. \nThey think we should pass this and that would be important. To me, I \nhear the administration, Democrats--I am a Democrat--saying to labor, \nand saying to environmentalists, and saying to nongovernmental \norganizations, and saying to a whole lot of other people: Listen, we \nhave a real chance at this WTO gathering of moving toward \nenforceable labor codes, enforceable environmental protection. Well, if \nyou can't do it in a bilateral agreement, how in the world are you \ngoing to do it in a multilateral agreement, multinational agreement? It \nis not going to happen. So I oppose this legislation on substantive \ngrounds.\n\n  I hope my colleagues, especially Democrats, will vote against cloture \nbecause we have again been shut out of the opportunity to introduce \namendments that really go to the heart of whether we can represent \npeople in our States.\n  I have talked about the right to fight for family farmers for 8 \nweeks. The majority leader said the other day he filled up the tree one \ntime. I said I thought the record would show more than that. I think in \nthe last year it has been 9 or 10 times we have been shut out of the \nopportunity to even have an up-or-down vote. What is relevant to me is \nthe pain and agony of the family farmers and all the producers who are \nbeing driven off the land, and to not have the opportunity to consider \namendments, to have a debate and up-or-down votes, and to fight for \npeople back in my state to try to make a difference for family farmers. \nAnd other Senators feel the same way.\n  I also said I do not think the debate about campaign finance reform \nis over. To me, the energy is at the State level. To me, the energy is \ntoward clean money and clean elections, and I want an opportunity to \noffer an amendment that would give States the authority to have a \nclean-money, clean-election initiative that would apply not only to \nState races but to House and Senate races as well.\n  This debate is not over. Just because there are Senators here who \nblock reform, we will not go away. I want to offer an amendment which \ngives States the ability to pass sweeping campaign finance reform and \nthat would apply to our elections as well. I think that is where the \nenergy is going to be.\n\n  If we are not going to do it here, if the powerful financial \ninterests are going to block reform, let the States do it. I have an \namendment on that. I want to be able to bring up the amendment for \ndebate. That is what the Senate is all about. We are not the House of \nRepresentatives. Therefore, I hope Senators will vote against cloture \naround this fundamental principle that the Senate should be the Senate \nand we debate and fight for the people in our States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 434, \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act and Caribbean Basin Trade \nEnhancement Act and urge my colleagues to reject the cloture motion to \nend debate on this ill-advised legislation.\n  Today's proposal offers a unilateral opening of the U.S. market in \nexchange for no market access commitments from the countries affected. \nUnlike NAFTA, no negotiations are required for these benefits contained \nwithin the legislation to take effect. It is no wonder that the \ngovernments of the impacted countries argue in favor of this \nlegislation.\n  This legislation contains limited protections for Caribbean and \nAfrican workers and offer no protections for the environments in either \nregion. It is essentially an invitation for companies to leave the \nUnited States and exploit African and Caribbean workers and the \nenvironment.\n  Moreover, today's proposal disrupts a carefully balanced transition \nin textile and apparel manufacturing industries from a quota system to \na less regulated market.\n  Five years ago, in adopting NAFTA and the WTO we established a \ntextile and apparel policy that was designed to be implemented over a \n10-year period. We are now halfway through that implementation.\n  Manufacturers, workers, and families made investments and planned \ntheir future based on that scheme. It is grossly unfair to all involved \nto alter that plan in the middle of its implementation.\n  Specifically, the Africa portion of the legislation alters the \ngeneralized system of preferences program by permitting increased \naccess to imports from Africa into areas that have traditionally been \nlimited because they are import sensitive.\n  Let me restate that.\n  This package essentially lifts the protections for the most import \nsensitive products. In short, that means that U.S. workers will lose \njobs as a result of this legislation.\n  The protections that this legislation will erase have long been \nrecognized in U.S. trade policy. Proponents of this bill will argue \nthat the ITC has conducted a study that suggests that U.S. job loss \nwill be less than 1,000 jobs. I do not believe the study and will offer \nan amendment to this legislation that would suspend benefits when \ntextile and apparel job loss exceed 1,000 workers.\n  Moreover, this legislation contains few assurances that the products \ncoming from Africa be made in Africa. In fact, for most products, a \nminimum of 20 percent of the work can be done in Africa and the \nbenefits of the legislation will still apply to the product.\n  Traditionally, I have expressed concern on a variety of trade \ninitiatives and most particularly with regard to those impacting the \ntextile and apparel complex.\n  South Carolina has 93,000 workers in our textile and apparel \nindustries including 73,000 in the textile industries and 20,500 in the \napparel industries.\n  The proposal before the Senate today would essentially condemn the \n20,500 employees in the apparel industry (and the 666,000 apparel \nworkers nationally) to unemployment by permitting the duty-free entry, \nquota free entry of apparel products from Africa and the Caribbean that \nare made from American fabric--the so-called 807-a, 809 exception.\n  Many will claim that such a provision aids the U.S. textile industry \nand for a brief time it may. Unfortunately, it decimates the U.S. \napparel sector. If the apparel sector is undermined, eventually the \ntextile industry will erode as\n\n[[Page S13493]]\n\nwell, because manufacturers will always move to be near their \ncustomers.\n  Moreover, it is unlikely that the strict provisions that exist in the \nlegislation will remain, once the conference committee completes a \nreconciliation of this bill with the much more expansive proposal from \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In addition, the principles underlying this legislation assumes that \nthe current tariff situation remains unchanged as result of the new WTO \nSeattle Round negotiations. Such an outcome is unlikely.\n  This legislation merely continues the ongoing assault by the current \nadministration on America's strong manufacturing base. It will further \nweaken an already besieged U.S. textile and apparel industry and cost \nthe jobs of countless American workers.\n  This administration has become enchanted by the false promise of \n``free trade,'' to the detriment of numerous U.S. industries. While \nexpanding global commerce and benefiting less developed nations are \nadmirable goals, we cannot afford to pursue them if it means \ndangerously weakening our industrial complex and putting American \nlaborers out of work.\n  I have often spoken on behalf of the beleaguered textile and apparel \nindustry, one that is critical to maintaining a strong U.S. \nmanufacturing base. Currently the United States imports $21 million \nworth of apparel and fabric for every $6 million that it exports. This \nmargin will likely increase substantially with the implementation of S. \n1387.\n  American textile companies cannot compete with the increasing amount \nof cheap imports that are flooding our markets. Just in the past 17 \nmonths, 50 plants have been forced to close their doors, displacing \n30,000 workers. And as disturbing as they are, these are just the most \nrecent figures. I use them to underscore the seriousness of a much \nlarger, longer-term problem.\n  In large part it is our previous free trade agreements that are to \nblame for the losses in textile jobs. During the 36 months prior to \nimplementation of the NAFTA agreement, just 2,000 jobs were lost in the \nAmerican textile sector. The ensuing 56 months saw job losses rise to \n305,000. To put these numbers in perspective, that is over 300,000 \nfamilies who have lost their major source of income in just the past \nyear and a half.\n  The deterioration of the textile and apparel job market is not only \nharmful to South Carolina, but is devastating for many parts of the \nUnited States. In my State, the past 10 years has seen the number of \njobs in the apparel sectors drop from 45,000 to 20,500, a decrease of \nmore than 50 percent. Similarly, Pennsylvania's textile and apparel \njobs have dipped from 80,000 jobs to 34,800 since 1989.\n\n  Some might argue that in place of these jobs, many comparable new \njobs have been created through the growth of the retail industry. This \nfact appears to be true on the surface, but closer examination shows it \nto be deceiving. Textile jobs pay 63 percent more than retail jobs. \nWhile the average mill worker receives wages of $440.59 a week, retail \npositions pay only $270.90.\n  Furthermore, as an indication of the value of textile sector jobs, \none can look at the increase in wages earned by mill workers over the \npast ten years. The $440.59 figure is up from $308.15 in 1989.\n  In effect, well-paying jobs are being replaced with significantly \nlower paying jobs. This is a serious problem, particularly when many of \nthese workers provide the only source of income for their families.\n  Considering the difficulties of the domestic textile market, the last \nthing America needs is to increase the amount of cheap imports coming \ninto our country. Yet this is exactly what S. 1387 does. It provides \nthe perfect loophole for Asian countries to circumvent U.S. import \nrestrictions.\n  With the implementation of the Africa trade bill and the Caribbean \nBasin initiative, Asian companies will be able to easily conduct \nillegal textile transshipments from both African and Caribbean nations. \nOnce they build manufacturing plants on the Caribbean islands, their \nproducts will be automatically accepted into the U.S. with low duties \nand no quotas. The restrictions contained in the Africa trade \nlegislation will be subverted in a similar manner. Illegal \ntransshipments already hurt American textile companies, and making them \neasier will just exacerbate the problem.\n  This decimation of one of America's most important manufacturing \nsectors is unacceptable. I agree, as most of us do, that increased \neconomic development in Africa and the Caribbean Basin is an important \ninternational objective, and is ultimately in America's best interest. \nFurther, it is important that we assist these regions in implementing \neffective policies for this development. However, to do so at the \nexpense of the textile and apparel industries and the American workers \nin those industries is irresponsible and foolhardy.\n  The opportunity we are offering to the countries covered by this \nlegislation is enormous. We are allowing them open access to our \nmarkets, giving them the opportunity to export their products to the \nUnited States at will. Meanwhile, more American workers will lose their \njobs because foreign laborers are willing to work for much lower wages. \nEffectively, we are opening our doors to cheap imports and \nunemployment, all in the name of helping these poor nations to \nestablish a firmer economic footing.\n  In return for this favor we ask for nothing. We are agreeing to give \naway our employment and our money, and yet we want nothing in exchange. \nThis is bad economics and poor policy-making.\n  It seems clear to me that we should ask for something in return. We \nshould ask that, at the very least, these nations treat their citizens \ndecently and with respect. The human rights records of the countries \nincluded in this trade bill range from marginal to abominable. It \nshould not be too much to expect for their governments to take steps to \nimprove the living conditions of their people.\n\n  Women suffer unequal and often violent treatment in many of the \nAfrican countries and Caribbean nations. It is common in these \nsocieties to accept physical violence as a means of resolving domestic \ndisputes. The result of this toleration is that women are routinely \nbattered, raped, and assaulted. For example, human rights workers \nestimate that 20 percent of the female population in Nigeria has been \nsubjected to physical abuse in the home. Furthermore, many African \ntribes force their female members to undergo rituals of severe \nviolence, which are often life-threatening. In some countries, such as \nSierra Leone, such brutal acts have been practiced on almost 100 \npercent of females.\n  Obviously, these women are considered inferior citizens. That \ninequality is clear in the labor laws of many of these countries. If \nthey are allowed to work at all, women make far lower wages than their \nmale counterparts. In Kenya, women's average monthly wages were a \nstriking 37 percent below those of men in 1998.\n  Many of the children of these nations suffer similarly dismal fates. \nStreet children, often orphaned by the loss of their parents to the \nAIDS virus, are sold into prostitution or, in some cases, into slavery. \nIn El Salvador, as many as 270,000 children fit into this category. \nMore ``fortunate'' minors are put to work as street vendors or domestic \nservants to help support their families financially. Most of these \ncountries maintain the pretense of compulsory education and child labor \nlaws, but few conscientiously enforce them.\n  The plight of unskilled laborers in Africa and the Caribbean is also \nproblematic. Only a handful of the countries covered by S. 1387 have \nestablished minimum wages that are sufficient to allow workers to \nsupport their families. To state one example, unskilled and \nagricultural laborers in Burundi are forced to survive on an \nastonishingly low 35 cents per day! Not surprisingly, this amount has \nbeen deemed inadequate for a worker and his family to maintain a decent \nstandard of living.\n  Clearly, the citizens of African and Caribbean countries are being \nsubjected to numerous and often brutal human rights abuses. It is \nabsurd that we are proposing to help these nations economically while \nturning a blind eye to the violence and inequality that goes on within \ntheir borders. If Congress and the administration insist on expanding \n``free trade'' and granting open access to our markets to developing \nstates, let us at least make such\n\n[[Page S13494]]\n\naction contingent upon the equitable and decent treatment of their \npeople. We have a powerful tool at our disposal, and we would be \nfoolish not to use it.\n  This legislation defies common sense. By passing it, we would further \nerode our manufacturing base and sacrifice important jobs, while \nreceiving nothing in return. To you who represent farmers, I ask that \nyou join me today in opposing this legislation, just as I and the \ntextile workers have stood with you during the current crisis. To those \nwho represent steel, I remind you that we supported you during your \ncrisis as well. Please stand with me in voting against this proposal.\n  Mr. President, to sum up:\n  The bill decimates the apparel sector. It permits duty-free, quota-\nfree imports from the CBI/Africa when made from United States fabric.\n  It targets import-sensitive sectors by altering the rules for the \nimports of products from Africa.\n  It provides limited protections for African workers and limited \nprotections for Caribbean workers.\n  Unilateral action requiring that countries benefiting take no real \naction to obtain the benefits.\n  It provides no protection for the environment. Unlike the NAFTA side \nagreement, there are no side agreements to protect labor.\n  It undermines the textile and apparel policy adopted as part of GATT.\n  This Congress has no continuity of mind and attention. We passed a \n10-year phaseout in the GATT agreement on textile quotas. Now, 5 years \ninto the agreement, we want to cut it out. Investments made on the \nnational policy of a 10-year phaseout are cut short. How do we pay for \nthe machinery?\n  Since we have a limited time, I will bring the issue into focus. This \ncould be called the Fruit of the Loom job flight bill or the campaign \nfinance bill because this proves the efficacy of soft money.\n  I have an article from today, Friday, October 29, from the Washington \nPost, entitled ``Will Capitol Crusade Bear Fruit? Ailing Underwear \nMaker Gives Freely as Senate Mulls Tariff Cut.''\n\n       Fruit of the Loom Inc. is feeling deep pain these days. The \n     company whose name has long been synonymous with underwear \n     has lost money in the last three quarters. Its stock has \n     dropped from $40 in 1997 to below $3 yesterday.\n       So a bill that would eliminate tariffs that it and other \n     companies pay to bring in certain garments from their \n     factories in the Caribbean looks awfully attractive.\n\n  That is what we will be voting on.\n\n       On Capitol Hill, the company that industry people simply \n     call Fruit has emerged as a prime promoter of the Senate \n     bill, which is part of the United States' Caribbean Basin \n     Initiative. The company also has become a big contributor to \n     Republican causes.\n       Contribution records show that Fruit gave $350,000 in \n     ``soft money'' to GOP groups, $265,000 of it to the National \n     Republican Senatorial Committee, in the 1997-98 election \n     cycle. That placed the company in the same league as the \n     National Rifle Association and much bigger companies, such as \n     drugmaker Novartis Corp. and Atlantic Richfield Co.\n       Fruit also gave almost $90,000 in ``soft money to the \n     Democratic cause, all of it to the Democratic Senate Campaign \n     Committee.\n       Contributions have continued in 1999. Records show an \n     additional $73,000, all of it to Republicans.\n       At the same time, Fruit's chairman, William Farley, has \n     been an active donor to key Republicans, giving $2,000 in May \n     to the group Trent Lott for Mississippi, which supports the \n     Senate majority leader, and $2,000 to the Keep Our Majority \n     Political Action Committee, which supports GOP candidates.\n\n  Mr. President, we are not dealing with jobs and dealing with trade. \nWe are dealing with campaign finance.\n  I continue:\n\n       ``It's a company in bad shape giving money fairly lavishly \n     to the [political] process, with incredible things to gain,'' \n     said Charles Lewis, executive director of the Center for \n     Public Integrity.\n       Fruit doesn't deny the bill would help it--a spokesman said \n     it expects to gain $25 million to $50 million a year if the \n     Senate bill is enacted--but argues it will also help American \n     industry and jobs.\n       ``We don't look on this bill as corporate welfare,'' said \n     Ronald J. Sorini, Fruit senior vice president for government \n     affairs.\n       Sorini said that his company and the industry are ``getting \n     hammered'' by imports from Asia and that the Senate version \n     of the bill, which limits import benefits to clothes made \n     abroad from U.S.-produced textiles, would help the company \n     compete by helping team its U.S. textile workers with its \n     low-cost garment stitchers overseas. The House bill does not \n     require use of American cloth.\n\n  Mr. President, as an aside, the ATMI disapproves this particular bill \nbecause it marries the House bill with the Senate bill and does not \nrequire the Senate language.\n  Reading on:\n\n       He denied the contributions are targeted at the Caribbean \n     bill, saying Fruit has more issues than that to worry about \n     in Congress. ``We support those who generally support our \n     industry,'' he said.\n       The Clinton administration also backs the Senate bill, as \n     does the American Textile Manufacturers Institute, which \n     represents companies that make cloth.\n       The Senate bill, along with one to offer similar tariff \n     benefits to Africa, was caught up in maneuvering last night, \n     with a vote to limit debate set for today. The measure is \n     opposed by a coalition of labor groups and companies that \n     still make garments in the United States. They contend it \n     will further erode U.S. garment jobs and unfairly reward \n     companies like Fruit that have sent garment jobs overseas.\n       Fruit's U.S. employment has fallen from 33,000 to 17,000 \n     people, the company says. About 3,500 Fruit employees are \n     based in Kentucky, and the bill has caused a split between \n     the state's two senators, Mitch McConnell and Jim Bunning, \n     both Republicans.\n       McConnell favors it. ``It's not unusual for a senator to \n     support the interests of a major employer in his or her \n     state,'' said Kyle Simmons, his chief of staff.\n       McConnell heads the Republican committee that has been the \n     beneficiary of Fruit's soft-money contributions. Simmons said \n     the money has no connection to McConnell's position, adding \n     that he has always been a ``free-trader.''\n       Bunning has spoken out against the bill, on the grounds \n     that too many jobs are going abroad.\n       All in all, the bill would cost the Treasury about $1 \n     billion in lost tariff revenue over five years.\n\n  Mr. President, if there is any pride in being a Senator, they would \nwithdraw this bill.\n  I yield the floor and I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I rise one last time to implore my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support the motion to invoke cloture. Frankly, it \nwould be unconscionable to block progress on a bill that enjoys the \nsupport of at least 80 Senators from both sides of the aisle. It would \nbe unconscionable to block progress on what the President has described \nas one of the most significant initiatives of his presidency. It would \nbe unconscionable to block progress on a bill that enjoys the support \nof the vast majority of political, civic and religious leaders in this \ncountry and the support of each of the nations that would benefit from \nits passage.\n  But, most importantly, it would be unconscionable to block progress \non a bill that would create 121,000 jobs in the American textile \nindustry over the next 5 years. I have emphasized again and again in \nthis debate that this is not a bill that is good just for our neighbors \nin the Caribbean and Central America or our partners in Africa. This is \na bill that is good for our workers here at home!\n  Let me remind my colleagues that it is no benefit to workers in the \ntextile industry if you raise the minimum wage when they don't have a \njob. It is of no use to American textile workers if you debate mergers \nand acquisitions in the agribusiness sector if we do not open markets \nfor their products. It is of no use to the American textile workers if \nwe debate, yet again, reform of campaign finance laws when they headed \nfor the unemployment line.\n  I was not elected by my constituents in Delaware to look out for the \nshort-term political advantage. I was not elected by my constituents in \nDelaware to win debating points and I have never sought the floor for \nthat purpose.\n  I have drafted a bill here that is a benefit to workers and industry \nhere in the United States, as well as neighbors in the Caribbean, \nCentral America, and Africa. It is a ``win-win'' situation economically \nfor American workers and our friends abroad.\n  The bill is also a victory for an outward looking foreign policy. It \nis a statement about American leadership in an age that cries out for \nus to lead in positive ways that ensure peace and stability around the \nworld.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that no state in Africa or the Caribbean \nor Central America is politically stable if people cannot feed \nthemselves!\n  In recent weeks, I have heard an unending cavalcade of criticism \nabout the Senate's vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nIsolationists!\n\n[[Page S13495]]\n\nThat's what the opponents of this bill called those of us who thought \nmore about our national security than we thought of our political \nexpediency.\n  Where are those voices now? Where is the one or two voices that would \nargue now for an outward looking foreign policy agenda? Where are those \none or two votes in favor of engagement with the world, rather than a \nsterile debate about senatorial privileges?\n  This is not a debate about the minority party's rights. This is a \ntyranny of the small minority on each side of the aisle that wants to \nkill this bill. We must see our way clear to a vote against \npartisanship. We must rise above the parochial and focus on our \nnational interest and the world around us.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that this bill enjoys the support of one \nof the strongest bipartisan majorities I have seen in the Senate. The \ncloture vote on the motion to proceed was 90-8.\n  This is a measure that the distinguished minority leader himself \ninitiated in 1994. This is a measure that the distinguished majority \nleader has fought for and made room for at a time on the legislative \ncalendar when the hours are precious. This is a measure that the \nPresident has indicated in his State of the Union Address is at the top \nof his agenda.\n  This bill has the support of the strongest coalition of political, \ncivic, and religious leaders of any measure I have seen in years.\n  That said, I want to give credit where credit is due. Those who want \nto kill this bill--those who have appeared so frequently on the floor \nof the Senate this week to talk about anything but this bill--have done \na masterful job.\n  Does it strike anyone as an odd coincidence that Time magazine runs \nan article during the week of this debate that suggests that this bill, \nwhich would do so much for both Africa and the Caribbean and for \nworkers in the United States, is the work of a single company? Does it \nstrike anyone as an odd coincidence that someone named John Burgess in \nthe Washington Post, who erroneously reported last week that Nelson \nMandela opposed this legislation, regurgitates that Time magazine \narticle in this morning's edition of the Post?\n  Those articles ignore the bipartisan push that has brought this bill \nto the floor of the Senate. A bipartisan push in the House of \nRepresentatives led by the chairman and ranking member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee. And, the strong bipartisan push in the Senate as well.\n  My friends, each day this week, the Ambassadors of the 47 African \ncountries that would benefit from this bill have watched this debate \nfrom the Senate gallery. Each day this week, members of the American \npublic have looked on as we discussed our privileges, rather than their \nbusiness. They have read the misreporting of the bill in the popular \npress. They have seen the pleas of the President to vindicate his \nforeign policy initiatives in Africa and the Caribbean go unheeded as \nthe discussion of process, rather than substance, has dragged on.\n  The real question before us is whether we can look up into the Senate \ngallery and look those people in the eye if we fail to move this bill. \nThere will be a time to debate an increase in the minimum wage. There \nwill be a time to debate consolidation in the food processing industry.\n  There will be--and there has been--ample time devoted to the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. A vote for cloture does not preclude that \ndebate.\n  What would it do? It would leave us with a solid bill that is good \nfor Africa and the Caribbean and good for the United States. It would \nalso leave us with another two days to debate the merits of this bill \nand offer any germane amendments that would improve the legislation \nbefore us.\n  What is wrong with that? What is wrong with sticking to the subject \nat hand and getting our job done?\n  I implore my colleagues to vote for cloture on this bill. I implore \nmy colleagues to vote in favor of an open engagement with the world \naround us, rather than a fearful isolationism that hides behind \nprotective walls. I implore my colleagues to support this initiative \nwith a vote in favor of the motion before us.\n  Make your stand here. Vote for the motion.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Who yields time? The Senator \nfrom West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, much of the controversy surrounding U.S. \ntrade policy arises from differences in opinion about the economic \nbenefits achieved from trade agreements. Trade agreements, in \nprinciple, have winners and losers. In recent years, regrettably, U.S. \ntrade agreements seem to be pitting U.S. conglomerates and foreign \npolicy interests against the traditional American workers. By \ntraditional worker, I mean craftsmen, artisans, and laborers who, in \nthis information age, still actually make things. Man cannot live on \ninformation alone--we still need clothes, shoes, dishes to eat from, \nwatches, and tangible items. I believe the underlying issue for the \ntraditional American worker is the question of who benefits from our \ntrade negotiations. I believe that the traditional American worker \nperceives that a selected few U.S. industries keep winning, while other \ndomestic industries keep losing, and that the promised trickle down of \nbenefits from the winners to the losers never happens.\n  Certainly, this is the case with the trade legislation now before the \nSenate. The same industries keep losing. Under the African and \nCaribbean provisions in the bill, the losers will likely be textile and \napparel, footware, glass, electronics, handbags, along with canned tuna \nand petroleum. In this decade alone, the Senate approved two major \ntrade bills, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), and in each of these \nbills the losers were many of the same players. The deemed ``losers'' \nwere workers in traditional industries such as textile and apparel \nproduction, footware, glass, electronics, watches, and handbags.\n  I believe that many in the textile and apparel industry understand \nonly too well about the stigma of losing so often in trade agreements. \nI am bothered by the ``loser'' sign that has been placed on the \ntraditional U.S. workers, and the lack of concern about workers who \nlose their jobs as a result of a trade agreement. I believe that the \nso-called ``losers'' in U.S. trade policy ought not to be thoughtlessly \ndiscarded.\n  In the U.S. trade policy process, we have become heartless, \ninsensitive, merciless, and numb to the potential pain that these trade \nagreements can inflict on Americans--on mothers, fathers, brothers, \nsisters, and children. The so-called Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprogram falls woefully short in providing meaningful benefits to the \nworkers who lose their jobs as a result of trade agreements, and I hope \nthat members are not fooling themselves about the true hardships that \nare ahead for many workers as a result of the trade legislation that we \nare considering today. Yes, today the economy is booming, in most parts \nof the United States. I hope this state of well-being lasts forever. \nHowever, we know it will not.\n  Many of my colleagues eagerly point toward the benefits in the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance (TAA) program. TAA is touted as the sure thing to \nmake a winner out of the loser from a trade agreement. Under TAA, in \nreturn for their years of contributions to the local and national tax \nbases, workers who can prove that their company went under as a result \nof foreign trade might get a federal extension of unemployment checks, \nwhich is approximately $250 a week in West Virginia, and two years of \n``approved'' retraining. Possibly, if no ``approved'' jobs are \navailable in the area, these workers might also be eligible for a one-\nway ticket to another region or state, with a whopping $800 from the \nfederal government to start them off in their new lives. With good \nreason, most workers do not want TAA. They want to earn full wages, \nwith benefits, and two years of unemployment does not cut it.\n  Advocates of the trade bill proclaim that we have to think about the \nfuture U.S. relations with Africa and the Caribbean basin, and that we \nhave to accept the fact that many traditional industries are a thing of \nthe past in the United States. There are numbers of members who dismiss \nthe textile and apparel industries, as sure to go the way of covered \nwagons or the steam locomotive. Advocates want to make the\n\n[[Page S13496]]\n\ncase that you are either for the trade bill before us, or against U.S. \nrelations with Africa and the Caribbean. I support meaningful economic \ndevelopment in Africa and the Caribbean, but I also care about what \nhappens to the traditional worker here in the United States that might \nlose his or her job as a result of this bill, and I simply have not \nreceived any reasonable assurance that these workers will receive the \nsupport they deserve.\n  From my years in the Senate, I have a very strong viewpoint on \naccepting winners and losers as deemed by the Administration--any \nadministration--or by the committee of jurisdiction. I can tell you \nthat there are many, many industries that would be at risk, if certain \nspecial tax or procurement provisions failed to exist. In my view, the \nmain reason that textile and apparel workers are so-called ``losers'' \nis because decade after decade we have chipped the tariffs away, \nallowing our trading partners to enter the U.S. market under very \nadvantageous conditions. This strategy was called free trade, but, in \nreality, I believe that it was mostly a heyday for our trading partners \nwho had no labor or environmental standards. Regardless, decade after \ndecade, this country has relentlessly chipped away at the textile and \napparel manufacturing base, mostly on the grounds that this is a \nnatural procession of development, like the demise of the covered wagon \nand steam locomotive. My staff informs me that advocates of the African \nand Caribbean trade provisions actually use the metaphor of the covered \nwagon and steam locomotive as evidence that this is just the way the \nworld works. I guess someone forgot to educate this group that, unlike \ncovered wagons and steam locomotives, Americans will likely continue to \nwear and use textile and apparel products!\n\n  I wonder if members supporting this legislation recall that during \ndebate on GATT only five years ago, we implemented drastic cuts in the \ntextile and apparel tariff rates. We told the textile and apparel \nindustry that they would have to swallow the cuts, but that we would \nphase the tariff reductions in over ten years to help them make \nbusiness decisions and adjust to the new rules. Let me repeat that: \nfive years ago this body implemented deep tariff cuts on textile and \napparel with the understanding that the cuts would be phased in over \nten years. Well, it is 1999, and here we are again, chipping \nrelentlessly away at the nominal base that the textile and apparel \nindustry has left. Does the word of this body have no meaning?\n  Under the African and Caribbean trade provisions, there are U.S. \nindustry ``winners,'' mostly retailers, most notably apparel retail \ncompanies, and the bill would help U.S. fabric manufacturers and \ngrowers. To those winners, I say ``good for you.'' I know the value of \na dollar. I spend my money carefully. I like the benefit of consumer \nsavings from our free-market economy. I have never been against trade \nagreements on fair trade.\n  I am here to tell you, however, that the consideration of trade \nagreements should be completed in a serious, deliberative, and \nscrutinizing manner, as trade agreements have broad impacts, and \nnegative consequences. There has been only one relevant hearing held on \nthis legislation, and that hearing pertained solely to the Africa \nGrowth and Opportunity Act. There were no hearings on the Carribean \nBasin Initiative, the Generalized System of Preferences, or on Trade \nAdjustment Assistance during this Congress.\n  While the proponents argue in behalf of the potential long-term \nbenefits that the bill might provide to the United States, the fact \nremains that this bill lacks real reciprocal benefits for the United \nStates. This bill is generally a foreign aid package financed on the \nbacks of a few industries, such as the textile and apparel industry. Is \nthat fair?\n  It is time for the Senate to be sensitive to the costs of trade \nagreements. We are preparing to approve a bill that imposes enormous \ncosts on direct segments of our economy. TAA is a start, but it is not \nthe whole answer. I urge my colleagues to put a human face on workers \nin industries such as textile and apparel, footware, glass, \nelectronics, watches, and handbags. I can put a human face on these \nworkers, and I put a value on their hopes and dreams, and on their \nfuture prosperity.\n  I am a product of the coal fields of West Virginia. I have seen what \nit is to work hard, physically hard, to sweat, and to toil. American \nworkers, traditional workers, are the soul of America. They are the \nessence of our values. They bleed and hurt as U.S. trade policy \ntightens around their necks. With proper review, hearings, and \nconsideration, I am convinced that we could find a better way to \nachieve U.S. foreign policy goals for the fine people of Africa and the \nCaribbean nations. I support a long and prosperous relationship with \nour friends in the sub-Saharan African and the Caribbean Basin nations.\n  We need to restore the average American worker's faith in our trade \npolicy. We need to move forward on a trade process that provides fair \nand equitable treatment to all Americans. We need to recognize that all \nAmerican workers should be able to depend upon our understanding and \nregard for their position upon enactment of trade law. This bill is not \nwhat we are looking for. It does not do these things. For these \nreasons, I cannot support this bill. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman talked of a \nshort-term political advantage. I have debated this issue for 33 years \nin the Senate. When I started, I was not successful. We had 90 percent \nof the production of textiles. We are down to one-third or less of the \ncritical mass. If we preempt the 10-year phaseout of the Multifiber \nArrangement, I can tell you right now, the industry is gone. The jobs \nare gone.\n  He talks about the tyranny of the minority. He has not seen me. If I \ncould be a tyrant, I would be. The White House and an overwhelming \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats are all in favor of soft money.\n  The morning headline: ``Will Capitol Crusade Bear Fruit?'' ``Ailing \nUnderwear Maker Gives Freely as Senate Mulls Tariff Cut.''\n  It is not the jobs. The jobs have left Kentucky. Senator Bunning has \nto protect the jobs so that no more of them leave. 7,000 have already \nleft Louisiana. The gentleman, Mr. William Farley, has moved his \nheadquarters to the Cayman Islands; so we can call this the Fruit of \nthe Loom job flight bill.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to explain my opposition to \nthe African Growth and Opportunity Act. My decision was difficult \nbecause I wholeheartedly support provisions of the bill that would \nreauthorize of two important trade-related programs--the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance (TAA) and the Generalized System of Preferences \n(GSP). These programs provide vital benefits to the state of Maine and \nthe nation. Although on balance, I believe that H.R. 434 unfairly \ndamages Maine's economy, I take solace in the fact that the TAA and GSP \nprograms are one step closer to being reauthorized. I would like to \nfocus for a moment on these two programs.\n  The TAA aids workers and firms in global economic readjustments. By \nproviding funds to retrain workers, TAA's program offers both \nopportunity and a lifeline to workers displaced by market changes \ncaused by imports. It helps firms threatened by increased imports \nthrough grants to explore new technology, manufacturing methods, and \nmarketing techniques. I have seen the effectiveness and efficiency of \nthe TAA program firsthand in my state of Maine and strongly support \nboth its goal and methods.\n   Mr. President, I would like to recount just one TAA success story of \nthe many in Maine and the nation. Four years ago, when a shoe factory \nin Old Town, Maine closed, one of the employees laid off was a woman in \nher fifties. She had worked in shoe factories all of her working life. \nWith no high school degree, unemployed, and no skills other than making \nshoes in an economy with few shoe-making jobs, this woman was in dire \nstraits until she qualified for TAA assistance. Fortunately, she seized \nthe retraining opportunity to earn her GED and then trained as a \nnursing assistant. She recently proudly stopped by the local retraining \noffice to let them know of her new job as a nursing assistant. She now \nworks in home health care, making more money and enjoying greater \nflexibility than when she worked in a shoe\n\n[[Page S13497]]\n\nfactory. In a true tribute to the effectiveness of the TAA program, she \ntold the retraining officials, ``I wish I had been laid off sooner.'' \nThis story exemplified why the TAA program must be expeditiously \nreauthorized.\n  Similarly, the GSP program deserves swift reauthorization. It \nestablishes a mechanism for extending duty-free treatment of certain \nproducts imported from designated developing countries. The GSP program \nallows for participation by only those countries that adequately \nprotect intellectual and property rights, observe international \nstandards of labor rights, employ certain economic policies, and \nsatisfy other important criteria. Moreover, the GSP program is limited \nto products that are non-import sensitive, meaning American jobs are \nnot threatened.\n  In fact, the GSP program helps create jobs in America. The Foreside \nCompany based on Gorham, Maine, depends on the GSP program to be able \nto import product necessary to create jobs in Maine. The Foreside \nCompany, with over 150 employees, is one of the fastest growing \ncompanies in Maine. The energetic entrepreneur who runs this company \ntells me that if GSP is not renewed, it would harm this Maine business \nto the point that it would jeopardize dozens of jobs.\n  I am disappointed that legislation reauthorizing the TAA and GSP \nprograms were incorporated in H.R. 434, and not passed as independent \nbills. Unfortunately, H.R. 434 includes measures that I cannot support. \nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Carribean Basin \nInitiative are both deeply flawed proposals that would hurt Maine \nworkers and companies.\n  I want the record to clearly show, however, that in spite of my votes \nagainst H.R. 434, I remain strongly supportive of both the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences Extension Act and the Trade Adjustment Assistance \nReauthorization Act and strongly advocate for reauthorization of both \nprograms.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on few occasions is this body faced with a \nbill that is supported by such a vast, diverse, and a broad based list \nof industries and organizations, such as the NAACP, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the Corporate Council on Africa, and the National Retail \nFederation. The African Growth and Opportunity Act provides a real \nchance for the U.S. to engage in new trading partnerships with the sub-\nSahara Africa, but also provides a mechanism to assist those countries \nto bolster their own economies.\n  This bill is important not only because of the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, but for the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the \nGeneralized System of Preferences Program (GSP), and the Trade \nAdjustment Assistance (TAA) programs contained therein. It is essential \nthat the Senate reauthorize the GSP and TAA and discontinue the \npractice of simply extending these programs year by year. This all \nencompassing trade package, the result of three years of negotiation, \ndeserves passage.\n  What is also essential about this trade bill, is the manner in which \nthe United States can give a hand-up to the Caribbean Basin and sub-\nSahara Africa. After the death and destruction caused by Hurricane \nMitch, the Caribbean nations have been struggling to regain the \neconomic hold necessary not only to sustain their inhabitants, but to \ncontinue to prosper in the world economy. Instead of providing blanket \nfinancial assistance, the Caribbean Basin Initiative provides a \nmechanism and an avenue for these nations to begin rebuilding their \neconomies. The tariff preferences provided in this bill, on products \nnot previously covered by the 1990 CBI, will allow this region to \nexpand economically, and integrate them into the international trading \nsystem.\n  In addition, these Caribbean nations have asked and desire similar \ntreatment to those afforded Mexico in the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. These nations aspire to have the ability to broker trade \ndeals with the United States in order to ensure their economic \nlongevity in the region.\n  Trade with Africa is just as significant. According to the Department \nof Commerce, U.S. exports to sub-Saharan Africa in 1998 was \napproximately $6.7 billion, or 1% of total U.S. exports. Conversely, \nthe U.S. imported approximately $13.1 billion from sub-Saharan Africa. \nThe African Growth and Opportunity Act establishes the protocol and \ntrade mechanisms necessary to engage in future endeavors with these \ncountries. The bill provides for benefits under the GSP for sub-Sahara \nAfrica as well as benefits for the textile and apparel industries. As \nmy colleagues know, these benefits were constructed not to inhibit, but \nto enhance these industries in the United States. All garments and \napparel manufactured in Sub-Sahara Africa must consist of U.S. thread, \nyarn, and other components.\n  For my own State of Washington, passage of this bill means additional \nexport markets for our highly sought after wheat, world-renowned \naircraft, and the various other commodities and goods and services that \nhas made Washington the most highly trade dependent state in the \nnation. For example, the leading exports to sub-Saharan Africa include \naircraft, wheat, and aircraft parts. Incidentally, 68% of the aircraft \nutilized in sub-Saharan Africa is produced by the Boeing Company. \nBoeing estimates that these nations will eventually require at least \n270 new aircraft valued at approximately $20 billion. Naturally, the \n330 in the current fleet will require new parts and services. I cannot \nover emphasize the importance of these numbers alone, not only to \nWashington state, but to all the Boeing employees nationwide.\n  But free trade does not exist for the soul purpose of exports. \nThrough the mechanisms and tariff reductions provided in the CBI, \nNorthwest companies such as Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer have an \nopportunity to expand and import new materials and apparel.\n  Mr. President, again I reiterate the importance not only of the \ncontent of this trade bill, but of the far-reaching support for its \npassage. Senators Roth and Moynihan have repeatedly reminded our \ncolleagues of the many, many organizations and entities that support \nthis bill. Religious leaders coupled with business, and agriculture \nworking with the apparel industry--these partnerships emphasize the \nimportance of expanding and enhancing free trade to sub-Saharan Africa \nand the Caribbean. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this \nomnibus trade bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as we consider the African Growth and \nOpportunity Act, I rise to speak about the status of the United States \ntextile and apparel industry. During my time in the Senate, there has \nbeen an ever increasing effort to give away our textile and apparel \nindustry. This is done in the name of free trade, under the guise of \npromoting market-based economies and democratic governments in \ndeveloping countries. In spite of all this, the textile and apparel \nindustry still ranks second among United States manufacturing \nindustries. Notwithstanding downsizing, automation, and unfair import \ncompetition, this industry provides jobs for over one million two \nhundred thousand American workers, and contributes nearly sixty billion \ndollars per year to the Nation's Gross Domestic product.\n  Back in 1983 we passed the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act. \nThis was an attempt to provide free market economic and democratic \npolitical incentives to twenty-four Caribbean Basin countries. In 1994, \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect, \nlowering our quotas and tariffs for imports of textiles and apparel \nfrom Canada and Mexico. The following year, the United States made \nfurther concessions upon joining the World Trade Organization. Now the \nSenate is considering legislation, which, in my view, will further \nimpair the textile and apparel industry.\n  What has been the result of these trade agreements on the textile and \napparel industry in the United States? During the five-year period from \n1994 to 1998, the trade imbalance (imports over exports) for textiles \nincreased an annual average rate of 17.5 percent. For apparel, the \ntrade deficit increased at an annual average rate of 9.8 percent. \nDuring this time period, textile and apparel imports from Mexico rose \nby 288 percent. Apparel imports from the Northern Marianas jumped by \n300 percent. Additionally, the United States has endured a flood of \ntextile and apparel imports from Asia.\n  This flood of imports has had a significant impact on employment. \nSince 1981, just prior to the initial Caribbean\n\n[[Page S13498]]\n\nBasin trade legislation, 874,400 American textile and apparel jobs have \nbeen lost. In the five years since NAFTA, which supporters argued would \ncreate more jobs in the United States, the domestic textile and apparel \nindustry has lost 437,000 jobs. While some of these jobs have been lost \nas a result of restructuring and automation, major reductions in \nemployment levels are due to the elimination of our quotas and tariffs.\n  The textile and apparel industry is very important to my State of \nSouth Carolina. Unfortunately, the loss of textile and apparel jobs in \nSouth Carolina has been particularly devastating. Since 1987, textile \nemployment has decreased from a high of 108,000 to 73,000 this year. \nThis is a loss of almost 35,000 jobs, a reduction of nearly one-third \nof all textile jobs in South Carolina.\n  During this same period, my State has also endured the elimination of \nover 50 percent of all its apparel jobs. Apparel employment is down \nfrom a high of 46,000 jobs in 1987 to 20,000 jobs today. This means \nalmost 26,000 apparel jobs have disappeared in South Carolina.\n  The employment impact has been felt in other States as well. More \nrecently, from 1993 to 1998, North Carolina lost over 70,000 textile \nand apparel jobs; Tennessee nearly 35,000; Georgia almost 29,000; \nVirginia and Alabama 18,000 each; Mississippi over 17,000; and in Texas \nabout 15,000 jobs have been lost. In Oklahoma, the entire textile and \napparel industry has been lost--8,300 jobs no longer exist.\n  What is the outlook for future employment in the textile and apparel \nsector? There is great uncertainty, and a wide range of estimates. What \nis known, Mr. President, is that by the year 2005, the Agreement on \nTextiles and Clothing will expire, and all quota restrictions will \nlapse. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the impact of this \ndevelopment to be at least 200,000 jobs. The American Textiles \nManufacturers Institute predicts employment losses as high as 650,000. \nMr. President, it does not make sense to give away American jobs. The \npolicy of the Federal Government should be to preserve and promote job \ngrowth for Americans, not make them unemployed. I do not think that we \nwent through the process of reforming welfare just to add to the ranks \nof the unemployed.\n\n  The loss of textile and apparel jobs is more than just numbers, Mr. \nPresident. It affects the living conditions, health, and welfare of \nindividuals, families and the communities in which they live. In many \nrural counties in South Carolina, where the textile plant or sewing \nfactory is (or was) the only source of employment, unemployment rates \nrange from 8 to 16 percent. Textile and apparel industries have been \nthe economic backbone of many of these rural Southern counties. These \ncommunities have limited job opportunities. Furthermore, for a variety \nof reasons, the residents of these communities cannot just pick up and \nleave, nor is retraining a viable option in many cases.\n  Earlier during the floor debate on this bill, a report by the \nCongressional Research Service (CRS) was referenced during a discussion \nof labor productivity in the textile industry. The CRS Report notes \nthat there has been productivity in the industry because of capital \ninvestment in labor-saving machinery. The report states, ``Rapid \nemployment losses combined with stable output necessarily implies gains \nin labor productivity.'' Furthermore, it concludes that ``Many textiles \nfactories have become almost completely machine-driven, leaving little \nroom for further labor-savings, and the apparel industry seems ill-\nsuited to such mechanization.'' So I wanted to clarify the record on \nproductivity in the industry. It has come at the expense of employment.\n  Let me now turn to a more general issue. We must consider trade \nlegislation in the context of our broader foreign policy objectives. To \na great degree, this is made more difficult given this Administration's \nlack of clear foreign policy objectives. Nevertheless, let me discuss a \nfew items which I believe deserve closer review before final action on \nthis legislation is taken.\n  First, our foreign policy regarding Latin America and the Caribbean \nis basically running on empty. The United States is suffering in its \nown hemisphere strategically, politically, and economically. A good \nexample is our relationship with Haiti. Despite our intervention, Haiti \nhas advanced little toward establishing a minimally effective \ngovernment. After spending tens of millions of taxpayer dollars, United \nStates and Canadian troops are being pulled out.\n  Second, this Administration apparently cannot frame a coherent drug \npolicy. Currently, the United States spends $289 million on security \nassistance to Colombia, the third-largest recipient of such aid. Aid \nfor Colombia and its Andean neighbors, Bolivia and Peru, was meant to \nbegin eliminating the sources which fuel the Caribbean drug trade. Yet, \naccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Colombian traffickers \nhave taken over a major chunk of the United States heroin market from \nSoutheast Asian dealers. This is in addition to their dominance in the \ncocaine market. It is no secret the drug criminal organizations look \nfor the easiest route of movement--which is through the Caribbean.\n  The closing of United States military bases in Panama this year has \nseverely reduced America's ability to monitor the byways traffickers \nuse to ferry drugs into the country. The biggest blow came with the \nclosing of Howard Air Force Base, the U.S. center for anti-drug \noperations. Retired General George Joulwan, former commander of U.S. \nmilitary forces in Latin America, testified that Howard was the ``crown \njewel'' in our counter-drug operations because of its strategic \nlocation and infrastructure. Since being booted out of Panama, \nAdministration officials have been scrambling for alternative sites to \nuse to monitor and intercept drug traffic through the Caribbean.\n  I am concerned that as we propose to drastically increase container \nshipping through the Caribbean, we will be exposing our Nation to the \npotential for a tremendous increase in illicit drug imports. Other \nSenators have addressed the issue of how Custom Agents are presently \nunable to adequately monitor imports.  This situation is aggravated by \nthe movement toward paperless entry, where Customs forms are \nelectronically cleared after the foreign goods move through our ports.\n\n  Mr. President, the key to resolving many of our hemispheric problems \nis coordinating our criminal justice efforts, defense requirements, \nforeign policy, and economic and trade strategy toward Latin American \ncountries. We cannot afford to look at these in isolation of one \nanother.\n  Finally, let me highlight some of the more dangerous elements of \nlegislation which some in Congress are proposing. While the Senate bill \nalleviates some of the worst of these issues, I want the record to be \nclear on why these provisions must never become law. If, by some \nchance, this bill moves to a conference with the House, there may be an \neffort to incorporate some of these proposals. This would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  There are some in Congress who would favor the quota-free entry into \nthe United States for apparel made in the Caribbean Basin countries \nfrom fabric produced anywhere in the world. Such a provision would void \nthe Uruguay Round Agreement on Textiles and Clothing.\n  Another flawed proposal is the scheme to use Tariff Preference \nLevels, whereby fabric produced anywhere in the world may be used in \napparel sewn in the Caribbean Basin countries and imported duty-free \nand quota-free into the United States. Such preferences are permitted \nunder NAFTA. Canada has used its preferences to export into the United \nStates textile and apparel products made of non-North American yarns \nand fabrics. This violation of NAFTA has permitted $300 million from \ntextile mills in Europe and Asia to severely damage U.S. manufacturers \nof wool suits and wool fabrics as well as other U.S. producers. \nLikewise, Mexico is now sending textiles and apparel made from cheap \nAsian yarns and fabrics into the United States. Tariff Preference \nLevels are bad for the American textile and apparel industry and for \nits workers. They must not be permitted to be extended further.\n  Perhaps the worst provisions proposed in the House bill are those \nrelated to transshipment. Transshipment is the practice of producing \ntextile and apparel goods in one country, and shipping it to the United \nStates using the\n\n[[Page S13499]]\n\nquota and tariff preferences reserved for a third country. The most \negregious part of the House bill is that it fails to include provisions \nfor origin verification identical to those in Article 506 of the North \nAmerican Free Trade Act. This could lead to Africa and the Caribbean \nBasin being used as an illegal transshipment point by Asian \nmanufacturers. It would encourage the use of non-U.S. produced fiber \nand fabric in apparel goods entering the United States duty-free.\n  Finally, the House bill grants overly generous privileges and \npreferences to African and the Caribbean Basin countries in a \nunilateral fashion. There is little incentive for these countries to \ngrant reciprocal access for products made in the United States.\n  I have outlined the current economic standing of the United States \ntextile and apparel industry. There is no question that unfair trade \npolicies have negatively impacted employment levels in this important \nsector of our economy. There is no reason to believe the trade bills we \nare debating will lead to a different result. Furthermore, these bills \nraise serious national defense and foreign policy questions. Finally, \nmany provisions, which unfortunately might be included in the final \nlegislative product, would cause unnecessary harm to the textile and \napparel industry in the United States. The textile and apparel firms \nmay survive as they adapt to our legislative actions and changing \neconomic conditions. American textile workers may not be so fortunate. \nThis is my main concern--for those textile and apparel workers who work \nhard, pay their taxes and raise their families. This is why I have \nreservations about this bill.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the question before the Senate now--the \nAfrica trade package and enhancement of the (Caribbean Basin \nInitiative) (CBI)--is a simple question of recognizing and seizing \nopportunities for America.\n  As the world continues to open trade and reduce barriers with GATT \nand various regional groupings and agreements the opportunity to gain \ncompetitive advantage over Europe and the industrialized countries of \nAsia could not be more starkly presented than with this package.\n  In terms of the Caribbean and Central America that opportunity begins \nalmost right off our Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. The mutual benefit of \nthose relationships is recognized across the board in both the United \nStates and in the region.\n  The American textiles industry, which has taken such a hit in the \npast two decades, recognize the potential that CBI has with respect to \ncompeting with Europe and Asia in the next 10 years. Many of the \ncompanies see the future of the industry in America dependent on \ngaining that advantage through CBI and other trade agreements. We \nshould recognize and seize that opportunity.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa presents an entirely different set of \nopportunities and considerations.\n  We have also heard a great deal of concern about what this bill will \nor will not do for Africa.\n  Much of that concern is because Africa truly sits on the margins of \nour external trade relationships. It also sits on the margins of our \nnational interests. But it's not just us. Africa sits on the margins of \nthe global economy, where the gap between it and the developed world \ncontinues to grow wider at a disturbing rate.\n  In the minds of many people it is a lost continent, typified by \nextreme poverty and horrific brutality. The number of countries is \nconfusing, as are the fluid alliances and corrupt bases of power which \ndictate the continent's life.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I must admit that \nit is very difficult to associate the names of Somalia, Rwanda, Congo, \nAngola, Burundi, Sierra Leone, and even Sudan with opportunity and \npotential benefits to the United States. But the continent cannot be \nviewed as a single entity, and, even in the midst of tragedy and \nsuffering, they still have such great untapped potential.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa has--depending on whom you ask--a collective \npopulation approaching 700 million people. They are overwhelmingly poor \nand quite often isolated. But take even half that number and view them \nas potential consumers of American goods, and the opportunities for \nbeneficial trade look better.\n  In July I held roundtable discussion in the Africa Subcommittee with \nsome of the top fund managers, past and current Administration \nofficials, and economists, regarding the barriers to investment in \nAfrica. This group brought together very disparate interests and \nsomewhat differing views of how to address those barriers, but a \nsingle, profound view was shared by all: Africa is truly the final \nfrontier for American investment and trade, and that the potential is \ngreat enough that it must be given immediate and higher priority by \npolicy makers.\n\n  Although the continent is troubled and presents less immediate \nreturns than our expanded trade relationships with Latin America, Asia, \nand Europe, the potential benefits to the United States 10 to 20 years \nfrom now are so great that we would be remiss if we did not act now. We \nhave before us an opportunity to start diversifying and nurturing that \ngrowth outside of the extractive industries, and to profoundly \ninfluence the future of Africa.\n  The Africa trade legislation is not a comprehensive set of tools to \naddress those barriers and gain advantage in that last frontier--it has \nnever been billed as such and Senators should not consider it such when \nthey vote. But it is a good start. And, remarkably, it is a beginning \npoint upon which both Americans and Africans have agreed.\n  That is a remarkable opportunity in what has otherwise been a \ntroubled and neglected relationship.\n  But I differ with the ranking member of the Africa Subcommittee and \nthe other well-meaning opponents that this effort is fatally flawed. I \ndiffer as well on the idea that we must do all or nothing with respect \nto our potential trade relationships and policies toward Africa on this \npiece of legislation. That will be a long and difficult process and one \nwhich will require much more than legislation.\n  The Africa trade bill also has virtues beyond the expansion of trade.\n  The United States' national interests in Africa are not clearly \nunderstood, and, as a consequence, our policy goals are often ill-\ndefined. Even as the Secretary of State completed her trip to the \ncontinent last week, we find a lack of a consensus on the security, \neconomic and humanitarian interests we have there.\n  One point that is clearly understood and agreed upon on both sides of \nthe aisle and throughout policy circles in the United States and the \nentire developed world, is that our actions must promote greater \nfreedom and opportunity for Africans who suffer under some of the most \nincompetent, corrupt and sadistic regimes on the face of the earth.\n  These regimes also affect our lives when organized crime, terrorists, \ndrug traffickers and disease have found fertile ground and purchase on \na continent that has been so ravaged.\n  In the post-cold-war era, the United States; approach to Africa has \nbeen driven almost exclusively by foreign assistance packages. During \nthe cold war, the same was true, but we added the dimension of proxy \nwars against Soviet and Cuban aggression. That approach was reasonable \nat the time, considering what was at stake for us, but it did not leave \na good legacy on the continent.\n  We now have what is a tremendous opportunity to begin fundamentally \nchanging that legacy and, as I noted in the opening sentences of my \nremarks, to seize opportunities.\n  If you consider the effectiveness of aid to Africa in achieving those \ngoals a continent-wide scale, the record is not good. Almost all of \nAfrica has seen a reduction in income and, now, life expectancy, since \nwe began direct assistance programs in the late 1950s to mid 1960s. \nRegardless of that record, it is clear that monetary assistance alone \nis not an acceptable foundation for our relations with an entire \ncontinent.\n  This initiative, though, is quite different and it represents much \nmore than simply a ``trade not aid'' approach. Not only does it \npotentially benefit us as well, it contains incentives for simple yet \ncritical changes in governance in Africa.\n  Those incentives and mutual benefits have the added and rather \ndramatic quality of being backed by (literally) every single potential \nparticipant on the continent. Every single one.\n\n[[Page S13500]]\n\n  That includes former South African President Nelson Mandela, who has \nbeen erroneously portrayed as opposing this bill.\n  I think it is paternalistic to assert that African nations do not \nunderstand the effects this bill would have on them. And I do not \nbelieve that these nations have unrealistic expectations of its \npotential benefits.\n  Africans widely view their interaction with the outside world as one \nthat has been anything from exploitative at worst to unequal at best. \nFrom the time of the first penetration of the African interior by \nslavers and ivory hunters until today, that has been the case--\nregardless of intent. Even benevolent missions were viewed as \nunintentional but nonetheless effective entrees for colonial powers' \nexploitation of the continent.\n  Interestingly, our own foreign assistance to the continent--which is \nviewed as a product of goodwill and of shared goals with reformers--\ndoes not escape that stigma.\n  As with any donor/recipient relationship, the recipient will always \nbe viewed as ``less equal'' than the donor. That fact is unavoidable \nand, indeed, universal.\n  Although cash-strapped and desperately needy, Africans rightfully \nview a purely donor/recipient relationship between us and them as \nanother manifestation of the treatment of Africans as less than equal--\nagain, that is regardless of intent.\n  This legislation is clearly viewed differently by Africans, and \nthat's why I am puzzled and unimpressed with the accusations by \nopponents of this effort that it is ``exploitative.'' That somehow \nAmerican corporations are simply going to reinvent that age-old \nrelationship of Africa to the world and this will be their vehicle to \ndo so. This effort is about realizing opportunities to build new \nmutually beneficial ties between the United States and Africa.\n  That is the Africans' view, at least. And that is why they bristle at \nthe idea that this effort is not in their best interest, that they must \nbe protected from something which they see as beneficial and positive.\n  In effect, it says to them that they must be protected from beginning \nto build relationships with America where they can be equals, where \nthey are not simply something to pity and to patronize.\n  This bill will not change that attitude nor the continent overnight. \nAs I said earlier, it is neither comprehensive trade legislation for \nAfrica, nor is it a comprehensive policy toward Africa. It is a \nbeginning, though. An important beginning. And, despite its potential \nflaws, it is critically important to pass this bill if we ever want to \nhelp bring Africa away from the margins, away from the suffering and \nhuman and environmental disasters and into the fold of developed and \nfree nations.\n  That effort will require American leadership, and that leadership \nrequires a first step. This effort is just such a first step, and I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support it and to defend it from those \nwho would kill it, obstruct it or otherwise defeat it, either out of \nprotectionist or other outmoded sentiments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will make a few comments because I have\n\n[[Page S13501]]\n\nto say the vote just taken represents a sad day for America because it \ngives the wrong signal both to our people here at home and to those who \nwere looking forward to this legislation as a means of beginning their \ncountry on a road of success and development.\n  I have to say there is something wrong with the way this Senate \noperates when a majority on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and \nDemocrats, are in support of these significant treaties.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the revered chairman yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would he not estimate there are 75 votes for this \nmeasure in the Senate?\n  Mr. ROTH. Absolutely, I say to my distinguished friend, at least 75.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. At least 75.\n  Mr. ROTH. At least 75.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And here we are.\n  Mr. ROTH. What kind of signal are we giving to the rest of the world? \nPeople are talking about isolationism. What does this vote represent? \nDoes it mean we can't act effectively when the welfare of thousands of \npeople both here and abroad is at stake? I say to my distinguished \ncolleague and ranking member of the Finance Committee, for whom I have \nthe greatest respect, that we will not consider this to be a dead \nissue.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. No.\n  Mr. ROTH. We shall continue to fight and assure that the opportunity \narises for this Senate to take appropriate action, to have the \nopportunity to vote on this important matter. I lament we have spent \nmore than a week of debate on this bill. We are ready to deal with the \nsubject matter of this bill and relevant amendments. The vote, to be \ncandid, is a victory for the few who oppose the bill and a vote against \nthe interests of American workers who would benefit from this bill.\n  I regret it, as I said before, because this vote blocks progress--\nprogress by the House, which passed this bill with a strong bipartisan \nmajority. This vote blocks progress by the President, and this was one \nof his most important initiatives. This vote blocks progress by the \nSenate, which I know enjoys the support of strong majorities, as I have \nalready said, on both sides of the aisle. Most importantly, this vote \nblocks progress that would mean new markets. I can't emphasize that too \nmuch. It would mean new markets for the American textile industry. It \ncreates approximately 121,000 new jobs. It would have meant roughly \n$8.8 billion in enhanced business for the industry.\n  I deeply regret the effort to say this is just the result of campaign \ncontributions, or whatever. Nothing could be further from the truth. I \ndon't know whether or not we have upstairs now the Ambassadors of the \n47 countries in Africa who would have benefited. They have been here \nday in and day out watching the developments; they are concerned about \nthis legislation, which held out promise and hopes for them. As I said, \nthis legislation is critically important because it promised jobs here \nat home. It promised the opportunity for the textile industry to better \nkeep competitive in the local market. But not only here, I say to my \ndistinguished friend from New York, isn't it true it would also help \ndevelop markets abroad?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. That do not now exist.\n  Mr. ROTH. That do not now exist. Exactly.\n  So that, as I say, this is a sad day for the country, and it is a sad \nfor Delaware as well.\n  Let me say to the American workers, to our friends abroad, and our \nmany supporters in the Senate gallery--I think I can include Senator \nMoynihan--that I will continue to fight for this bill.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. ROTH. Senator Moynihan and I will continue to fight for the \nbenefits of this bill that extends to American workers and American \nindustry. We will continue to resist the instincts of some who have \nfought to maintain protective walls and isolate America from the \noutside world.\n  The thing that bothers me so much is that in addition to the negative \nimpact it has on this industry and on American workers, it sends the \nwrong signal just as we are on the verge of a multilateral meeting in \nSeattle--a historic occasion that would enable us to provide the kind \nof leadership that is needed if we are to continue the direction of \nliberal trade policy.\n  Yesterday, Senator Moynihan pointed out so eloquently how liberal \ntrade policies from way back in the 1930s have benefited this country, \nhave benefited American workers, and, indeed, have benefited the entire \nworld. We cannot turn our backs on this record.\n  We shall continue to fight and seek the opportunity to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, there are more than just prospective \nbenefits for American workers in this legislation, on this Trade and \nDevelopment Act of 1999. We now have 7 days before the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance program is ended, a program that goes back 37 years to the \nTrade Expansion Act that President Kennedy obtained in his first term--\nthe only real measure he did in his first term--37 years and as many \nPresidents as you can count, with 200,000 persons and their families \neligible for benefits. The funding ends on Friday.\n  More than that, we have put in jeopardy this morning--and it remains \nin jeopardy--trade policies of the last two-thirds of a century. In \nthat two-thirds of a century, we have seen America rise to unknown and \npreviously inconceivable levels of economic growth and stability.\n  This very morning the press reports, I will read from the New York \nTimes:\n\n       Headline: ``Strong summer is likely to propel the economic \n     boom to a record.'' The story: ``The American economy turned \n     in its best quarterly performance of the year this summer, \n     virtually guaranteeing enough momentum to carry the nation to \n     its longest economic expansion in history early next year.''\n\n  By February--that is not very long--we shall have had the longest \nexpansion in the history of the Nation.\n  Sir, I want to stand alongside my chairman and say this is not over. \nIt cannot be over.\n  Do we have any idea what is at stake? Can you imagine going to \nSeattle having denied the President--not this President, whoever, the \nnext President--having denied the Executive the power to negotiate \ntrade agreements at the Seattle Round--as it could be commonly called--\nand the fast track is not in the President's court?\n  And then the matter that we took up today. It is a great effort on \nsub-Saharan Africa. We had the President of Nigeria here yesterday. We \nhave had ambassadors from all over sub-Saharan Africa. The Caribbean \nBasin Initiative, President Reagan's initiative, sir--the new benefits \nthat we ought to put in place--are gone. The representatives of at last \ndemocratic regimes in Central America came up, sir, at your \ninvitation--gone. Trade Adjustment Assistance is gone. The Generalized \nSystem of Preferences--how old is that? A quarter of a century of the \nGeneralized System of Preferences is gone, emptyhanded.\n\n  The chairman and I were planning to spend a few days in Seattle just \nmeeting with people. We were not going to speak. Dare we go? I suppose \nAmbassador Barshefsky is required to go. I don't want to show my face. \nBut that need not be. We are still in session. The bill is still on the \ncalendar.\n  Let us hope what we have done this weekend we can move to change it, \nand move on as we were moving.\n  I thank you, sir. No one could lead it better than the chairman did--\nevents over which he has no control. The tangle we can get into with \npeople who sometimes think one issue is more important than others.\n  We have to rise to this, sir. I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank the Senator for the gracious remarks. I assure him \nI will work closely with him to make certain this matter is acted upon \nby this Senate.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I hope--from the exchange we have just \nwitnessed--that the two wise men will take their trip to Seattle \nwithout government gifts. But as they say, the fight will continue.\n  I am not at all sanguine about the recent vote. Be that as it may, it \nwas a majority vote.\n\n[[Page S13502]]\n\n  The Senator from Delaware says he knows--rather he estimated, \nestimated. The bipartisan majority has just stated what they would like \nto do, and that is to discuss this further because we are reading in \nthe morning paper exactly what is going on. You know and I know what is \ngoing on in this country. The money boys have taken over.\n  For the distinguished Presiding Officer, mark it down. The money boys \nsaid this Christian right fundamentalist crowd, Gary Bauer, be gone. \nMr. Buchanan, with your abortion, be gone. The rest of you with your \nfundamentalist stuff, be gone. We have taken over the party, and we are \nputting $60 million in with George Bush, and the selection process is \nover. They don't even have to attend the debates. That is what is \nexpected in politics. Otherwise, they have a good friend in the White \nHouse--the soft money President, and he is on the money side. I had to \nfight him with NAFTA. And I am fighting him now, and I will continue to \nfight and to speak for jobs.\n  Don't give me anything about jobs. How can they talk? It ought to be \nashes in their mouths.\n  Since they passed NAFTA promising 200,000 jobs, the textile industry \nalone has lost 420,000. We know about their promises. We put it in the \nRecord. ATMI, and everybody else who said they wouldn't move, they all \nmoved. They have to move. We are the ones who have caused the problem. \nWe put in clean air, clean water, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nplant closing notices, parental leave, and safe machinery. Before you \nopen up your manufacturing you have to comply with the high standard of \nAmerican living, bipartisan agreement on both sides. Instead, now you \ncan go down to Mexico for 58 cents. Maybe it is up to one dollar in \nsome places. And you don't have to have any of those requirements. If \nthe competition leaves, other companies have to leave to stay in \nbusiness.\n\n  They say: Let's spread it to the African nations; we have the \nambassadors in town. I have been in Africa. Don't tell me about \nsympathy for Africa. I lost friends in North Africa during the War who \nwere helping to bring freedom there. We finally helped Mandela get out \nof prison. We have been the friends of Africa. We traveled there and we \nhelped.\n  If we have so much to give, why don't the other industries give to \nAfrica? The textile industry has given at the store, so to speak. Now \nwe have lost two-thirds of our industry. We have a competitive one-\nthird left, but it is going away. That is why I stand here.\n  It is a dark day. I am reminded of Jesse Jackson, who said keep hope \nalive. We still have hope as long as we can get the attention of a \nmajority of Republicans and Democrats. Several Republican friends came \nover and said: I agree with you; I'm going to vote with you. Look at \nthe record. I don't know how many Republicans, but it was a bipartisan \nvote. They are embarrassed with the Farley escapade. It is a one-way \nstreet.\n  Come on, trade is trade. Don't give me this whine and fail stuff.\n  We need not just a new agricultural assistance over there with the \nspecial Trade Representative. We need Nancy Reagan to replace \nBarshefsky--``Just say no.'' That is what we need. We know how to \nbargain. This is not foreign trade; this is foreign aid. It was good \nfor 50 years to revive the different economies of the world, but it \nisn't any longer. We are in trouble. This boom they are talking about \nin the stock market is the information society; it doesn't create the \njobs. Farley has already transferred nearly as many jobs offshore as \nBill Gates has created with Microsoft. The Time magazine article says \nMicrosoft has created 22,000 jobs. We already shipped off, job-wise, \nMicrosoft. We have gotten rid of it, and we want to give them a $50 \nmillion prize for doing it, according to the Washington Post this \nmorning.\n  Talk about a dark day. Maybe someday we will simmer down in this body \nand forget about the Presidential election and act like Senators--work \non the minimum wage, health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nbankruptcy bill, and other bills we have been trying to bring up.\n  My caucus is meeting now. I know I belong in there to try to protect \nmy rights, but I will object to anything other than the regular order \nof business. Regular order is my vote. We can keep on moving. Let them \nvote against the minimum wage. They couldn't care less about the \nworkers; they just want the vote. It is all politics. It is all \napplesauce, as Will Rogers said.\n  We cannot break the syndrome around here. The media is just pell-mell \nand fancy-free with the politicians. We got a break this morning. I \nbless whoever wrote that story and the one in Time magazine because I \nhave been alone in this situation.\n  I am tired of this berating, when we are trying to do the work of the \nvoters and the middle class people of America--the economic strength of \nthis democracy--and the money guys are trying get rid of the middle \nclass. Money is taking over the Republican Party, and now money is \ntaking over the Democratic Party. That is what it is. It is just money. \nThat is all.\n  When we started the leadership council--that crowd, our own friends--\nI remember it well, it was after the 1984 race. We got together all of \nthe southern Senators, save one. We found out that the trouble was we \nhad too many caucuses. We had the NAACP, the AFL-CIO, the women's \ncaucus, this rights caucus and that rights caucus. So their solution \nwas to form a caucus. They had the arrogance to call them the \nleadership council. They talked at the caucus yesterday, everybody \nbowing and scraping. They said: Hollings, you got out of the \nPresidential race, but you head it up. I said I can't in good faith ask \nthe Democratic Party to be there for me and then, when I get beat, say \nthe trouble is with the party, not me. I supported Paul Kirk, and we \nworked and stayed in the party.\n\n  I have never been to a meeting in the leadership thing. I watched the \nmoney take over. A lot of what Buchanan said about the parties is \nright, there is not a dime's worth of difference. You can't get \nanything here for working America. It is money, money, money. They \nought to be ashamed to say I am continuing to fight for this. It would \nshame me with those contributions.\n  I was looking for the distinguished leader, and I was going to tell \nhim confidentially as a friend: Let the bill die; you don't want to \nbring it up. I have done you a favor.\n  We were headed with a symbol to the world. I am worried about the \ncountry. Don't give me symbols about Seattle and ambassadors in the \ngallery. We should stay here to do our work. They can make any \nagreement, but it had better not be unanimous because I object. I \nexpect the regular order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I don't intend to get involved in the debate involving the \nmerits of this bill, but the problem with this legislation is not the \nlegislation itself; the problem is the majority has not allowed the \nminority, the Republicans have not allowed the Democrats, to treat this \nbill as the Senate should treat any bill.\n  We started this bill last Thursday. It is now Friday. Eight days we \nhave spent on this legislation. We have spent no time on a single \namendment on this legislation.\n  The proper way to handle this is to allow the Senator from South \nCarolina, the Senator from Minnesota, and others to bring their \namendments forward and have a debate. The Senators who want to offer \namendments have all agreed to time agreements. The Senator from South \nCarolina desired 10 minutes on an amendment, 5 minutes per side.\n  Our leader, the minority leader, has also agreed, even though it is \nprobably not in his best interest, but he believes in this legislation. \nHe knows how important it is to the President. He has said he will \noffer to go along with the majority leader and table amendments not \ngermane.\n  We should treat this body as it has been treated for over two hundred \nyears: Bring a measure before the floor and let the debate proceed. We \nwould have completed this legislation some time ago. There is no \nquestion this legislation now before this body has at least 75 \nsupporters, maybe 80. I think this should give the majority all the \nbacking they need for this legislation. I think it is a shame we are to \nthe point we have not had a good debate on this legislation; in fact, \nprobably the legislation will be pulled down. That is too bad.\n\n[[Page S13503]]\n\n  We as the minority will have to continue protecting our \nrights, whether it is the CBI, this bill now before us, whether it is \nbankruptcy. Whatever the legislation that is going to be brought \nforward, we must have our input. That is all we are asking. We are not \nasking we win every amendment. Some amendments we recognize the \nmajority does not want to vote upon. But that is not the way you \nconduct a legislative body, just avoid all issues that are tough votes.\n\n  We need more tough votes. We would all be better off, individually, \nin our respective States and the country, if we had more tough votes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13503-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                ARMENIA\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my regret over the tragic \nsituation in Armenia. As we all know, a few days ago gunmen broke into \ntheir Parliament and killed the Prime Minister and several other \nofficials of the Armenian Government. Later today Senator Abraham will \nintroduce a resolution which will express our condolences to the people \nof Armenia and our expression of support for their continued struggle \nto create a viable and strong democratic tradition in their country.\n  As I said, late yesterday afternoon in Yerevan, the capital of \nArmenia, several gunmen broke into their Parliament and killed eight \nGovernment officials and wounded seven others. They then held hostages \nfor 24 hours, and only after the intercession of the President of \nArmenia in negotiations did they relent, release the hostages, and then \nsurrender to the authorities.\n  Among those killed were Prime Minister Vazgen Sarkisian, Parliament \nspeaker Karen Demirchian, deputy speakers Yuri Bakhshian and Ruben \nMiroian, Energy Minister Leonard Petrosian, senior economic official \nMikhail Kotanian and lawmakers Genrikh Abramian and Armenak Armenakian. \nThese gentlemen gave their lives as they were pursuing a democratic \nfuture for the people of Armenia.\n  It appears the gunmen were not part of any larger conspiracy. They \nwere family members who were bent on a path of individual retribution \nand revenge. But the tragic incident reminds us of the fragility of \nconstitutional government and democracy around the world, particularly \nin Armenia.\n  Armenia declared its independence in September of 1991. It has been \nstruggling to ensure a free and fair electoral process. Today, \nArmenians continue to be determined to ensure democracy will be the \nrule in their country. I had the occasion to travel there two years \nago.\n  We all know one of the great points of friction in the area is the \narea of Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnically Armenian territory which was \ncontrolled for years by Azerbaijan. Recently, we have seen progress. \nIndeed, the Prime Minister was one of the key figures in forging a \ndialogue between the Government of Azerbaijan and the Government of \nArmenia. His tragic loss, I hope, is not a setback for that process.\n  Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott had just left Armenia in his \nefforts to try to prompt further discussions between Azerbaijan and \nArmenia. He has now returned there to ensure it is clear to the \nGovernment and people of Armenia that America will stand with them.\n  Today is an opportunity to send our message of support, our message \nof condolence; also, our message of further support for the people of \nArmenia as they confront the challenges of democracy.\n  I join my colleague, Senator Abraham, and others supporting this \nlegislation to, once again, signal to the world and the people of \nArmenia that we stand with them in this time of tragedy, and will in \nthe future on more hopeful days.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate the conference report to accompany the D.C. Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill, H.R. \n     3064, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 27, 1999.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nbill as a whole. There is going to be a joint effort between two \nsubcommittees on the Appropriations Committee--my subcommittee, the \nD.C. appropriations subcommittee, on which Senator Durbin is the \nranking member, and then the Labor-HHS spending bill, which has Senator \nSpecter as the chairman and Senator Harkin as the ranking member. In \naddition, this bill contains the 1-percent across-the-board spending \ncut that is necessary for us to come into our budget caps and save the \nSocial Security surplus intact.\n  First, I want to talk about the bigger bill because I think we should \nunderstand this is a very important achievement that we will make if \nCongress passes this bill and sends it to the President.\n  This bill marks, for the first time in 30 years, that we will pass \nall of our spending bills, and there will be no raid on the Social \nSecurity trust funds. The Social Security trust funds will be left \nintact so that people who have paid in will get back not only what they \nhave paid in, but they will be given Social Security benefits after \nthey are eligible. No longer will we dip into the Nation's retirement \nfund to pay for today's spending needs. This is a significant \nachievement.\n  For the record, this bill will be voted on on Tuesday. We will debate \ntoday and Monday. On Tuesday, I hope we will send this bill to the \nPresident, and I hope the President will sign it.\n  Some have complained about the across-the-board spending cuts. I \nthink we can afford one penny of savings on every dollar to preserve \nthe retirement needs of America. I do not think that is too much to ask \nof this Congress. After all, there is a little waste in Federal \nGovernment.\n  The inspectors general within the Departments across Government have \nalready identified $16 billion in funds that have been misspent. The \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, working with the General Accounting \nOffice, has identified nearly $200 billion in savings in Federal \noverpayments, erroneous payments, and wasteful practices.\n  With this waste, I believe we can take a 1-percent cut to preserve \nthe integrity of Social Security to cover the programs that are worthy \nand use our taxpayer dollars more efficiently. With $216 billion in \nwaste, we can cover the programs that need to be covered if our \nadministrators have any integrity and if they are, in fact, competent. \nI hope they are. I do not think it is too much to ask. After all, when \nany family sees it is not going to meet its income and its spending \nneeds, what does it do? It does not just spend anyway. Hopefully, it \ndoes not borrow. It sits down and determines where it can cut. I wager \nmost families in America have had to make more than a 1-percent cut in \ntheir budgets when they have run into an emergency and do not have the \nfunds to spend.\n  I now turn to the provisions in the District of Columbia portion of \nthis bill. This is our second attempt to get a District of Columbia \nfunding bill the President will sign. I believe we have reached a \nsolution that is acceptable to all the relevant parties.\n  Senator Durbin has been very productive; he has been responsible; he \nhas been a real player in this process. In\n\n[[Page S13504]]\n\nour negotiation, we came to terms that allowed both of us to be \ncomfortable that we are doing the right thing for the District and that \neveryone has given a little bit without sacrificing principle.\n  No bill is perfect. I am the first to say that. We all have had to \nsacrifice a little, but this is a bill the President will sign and it \nis important we have a bill the President will sign because every day \nthis bill is not signed is a day our Nation's Capital is without \nimportant new initiatives that will make this a better city for our \ncitizens and visitors. Despite our differences on other issues, let's \nlook at what is good in this bill.\n  We have provided $17 million for college scholarships for D.C. \nstudents. We have provided funds to fight the war on drugs in the \nDistrict of Columbia, including money to combat open-air drug markets. \nWe have $5 million for commercial revitalization. We have funds to \nclean up the Anacostia River, to promote adoptions, and to help the \nChildren's Hospital.\n\n  On marijuana legalization, the ban is retained. Medical marijuana use \nwill not become law in the Nation's Capital.\n  On needle exchanges, there has been a great deal of misinformation. \nIn this bill, we continue the ban on Federal and local funding for \nneedle exchanges. I believe needle exchanges do not work. The drug czar \nof the United States, who represents the President of the United \nStates, believes needle exchanges do not work, and not one penny of tax \ndollars will be used to support needle exchanges in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Any suggestion that tax dollars from the Federal Government or D.C. \nGovernment are being used is simply wrong. What the bill does allow is \nfor clinics that have privately funded needle exchanges and do other \nworthy projects will not be prohibited from Federal funding for other \nworthy projects. But it is very clear there will be no Federal and no \nlocal money spent on needle exchanges in the District of Columbia.\n  On the voting rights lawsuit, I believe strongly this is a \nconstitutional issue. It is a legislative prerogative to deal with it. \nThis lawsuit has named officers of the Senate, the House, and even the \nPresident as defendants. The taxpayers of our country are spending \nmoney to defend against the lawsuit. We provide the District with 2 \nbillion Federal dollars. Those funds should not be used to sue the \nFederal Government on an issue that is squarely a legislative \nprerogative.\n  In my view, no public money should be used for this suit--not local \nmoney, not Federal money. Our bill permits the D.C. Corporation City \nCounsel to review and comment on legal briefs in private lawsuits. This \nis a limited role for their attorneys, but that is as far as this bill \ngoes. There will be no public money spent on the D.C. voting rights \nlawsuit or to provide statehood for the District of Columbia.\n  Finally, on legal fees in school disability cases, we retain the $60 \ncap, up $10 from a $50 cap, but the cap will be removed if local \nofficials develop a joint agreement--the school superintendent, the \nMayor, and the control board--on a new cap.\n  These are the changes we have made to our bill since it went through \nthe Senate. We have White House support for these changes, and we have \nthe support of the Democratic side for these changes.\n  I want to mention one other very important part of the bill that has \nremained intact, and that is the Mayor asked for the ability to spend \nmore of the D.C. funds. The District does have quite stringent \nrequirements for a surplus as well as a rainy day fund. That is sound \nbecause we are just beginning to get investment grade bonds for the \ncity which lowers the interest rate they will have to pay, and that, of \ncourse, means it lowers the cost of borrowing for the city.\n  I thought it important to keep the reserve requirements intact. That \nwill keep the city on a secure basis. I believed if they were going to \nspend money out of the surplus, that half of the surplus above the \nbasic reserve requirement should be spent only for paying down debt, \nwhile the other half could go to new programs. That was a compromise \nthe Mayor welcomed. He believes they will be able to address some of \nthe infrastructure issues that they have not been able to address in \ntheir budget, while at the same time I will be satisfied that they will \nbegin to pay down their long-term debt so they will have a more correct \ndebt-income ratio. That will give them a higher bond rating. It will \nlower the amount of debt they are carrying and I think will put the \ncity on a very firm financial footing in the very near future, which, \nof course, would then allow the city to go forward with a lower \ninterest rate, a higher bond rating; and our capital city, I hope, will \nbe able to flourish.\n\n  So this is an excellent bill. I hope the President will sign it.\n  With respect to the Labor-HHS part of the bill, I think this also \ncontains a number of positive provisions and should not be vetoed. \nSenator Specter and Senator Harkin have worked very hard on this bill. \nNo one should be led to believe this bill is underfunded. It is $6 \nbillion higher than last year's bill. In fact, it is $600 million above \nthe President's request. This bill contains $2 billion more for \neducation than last year; $300 million more in funding for the \nDepartment of Education than the President even requested. So if anyone \ntries to say we have underfunded education, the facts do not bear that \nargument out.\n  The National Institutes of Health will receive nearly $18 billion. \nThis is the funding for research, for medical research, for quality-of-\nlife improvements in our country. It is a $2 billion increase over last \nyear's bill and $2 billion above the President's request.\n  The Head Start program is increased by $600 million.\n  So despite our goal of keeping funds intact for Social Security, we \nhave still funded important priorities. If the bill is vetoed, it will \nnot be vetoed because we have not addressed the correct priorities.\n  With that, Mr. President, I conclude and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we come today to begin the debate on the \nappropriations bill for the District of Columbia. I am not certain, but \nI believe, of the 13 appropriations bills considered by the House and \nSenate, this is probably the smallest bill. Yet if you looked at the \ncontroversy that has preceded this debate, it would be a surprise to \nrealize it is a small bill in comparison to other spending bills.\n  I say at the outset, my colleague and my friend, the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison, has been a pleasure to work with. Oh, we \ndisagree on some things, and we have had some pretty hot debates, but I \nhave the highest respect for her ability and her hard work and her \nwillingness to sit down to try to work out our differences. I think it \nis because of that that we come today with the underlying D.C. \nappropriations bill--once vetoed by President Clinton--considerably \nimproved over the original version.\n  The Senator from Texas has outlined several elements that we have \nchanged or improved, and I would like to note them as well for the \nrecord.\n  I think it is important we follow the lead of the public health \nexperts, who tell us the incidence of HIV and AIDS in the District of \nColumbia is a national disaster. It is seven times the rate of the rest \nof the United States. If we do not acknowledge this health care crisis, \nand respond to it with aggressive and creative programs, we are going \nto doom generations of D.C. residents and others who come into contact \nwith them. It is that serious. That is why I applaud the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The needle exchange program no longer receives any Federal funds or \nany local funds, but if the program is offered by a clinic, in the \nDistrict of Columbia, they will not be disqualified from other public \nhealth programs. That, then, leaves it to the individual clinics to \nmake the decision. It does not ban the program, it merely says there \nwill not be governmental funds used for these purposes. That is not the \ncompromise I was looking for, but I think it is a reasonable one. I \nsupport it.\n  On the question of voting rights, it retains the ban on local and \nFederal funds on the voting rights case. But the D.C. corporation \ncounsel, the city's attorney, is permitted to review and comment on \nlegal briefs and private lawsuits.\n  This is what it is all about. There is a fear on the Republican side \nof the\n\n[[Page S13505]]\n\naisle that if the District of Columbia ever achieves statehood, it will \nelect Democrats. So they have historically opposed any efforts toward \nstatehood; and they have tried to stop or slow it down in a variety of \nways throughout history. It is a very clear political decision. But I \nthink we have done the best we can and said that the D.C. corporation \ncounsel can at least review and comment on the status of lawsuits \nmoving in that direction with the city council.\n  The cap on city council salaries of 5 percent is not something I \nwould vote for were it not part of a package that I think is important \nto pass. I do not believe we should try to inject ourselves in the \ndecisions of the D.C. City Council--even bad decisions. This is a \nquestionable decision. The pay raise they are envisioning, I believe, \nis in the neighborhood of 15 percent, if I am not mistaken--a pretty \nsubstantial increase. And the Senator from Texas believes it should be \nno more than 5 percent.\n  I am not certain I would even weigh in on that debate since it is a \nlocal decision. If we are going to weigh in on local decisions, I \ncertainly would like to weigh in on what I consider the absolute \nfoolishness of the D.C. City Council in announcing a tax cut of $57 \nmillion at a time when the District of Columbia still lacks the most \nbasic in public services.\n  You can leave this Capitol Building right here, that is well known \naround the world, and go four or five blocks away, at night, and run \nthe risk of being shot and killed. Of course, that happens in some \nother cities, including in my State of Illinois. But the fact is, the \nDistrict of Columbia is not safe for visitors or residents. And to \ndeclare a tax cut under these circumstances is absolutely foolish. To \nignore the public health needs of the District of Columbia and to say \nwe have so much money in our till that we can give away $57 million in \ntax cuts is ridiculous.\n\n  The HIV/AIDS crisis alone would argue that the District should take \nthis public health issue more seriously. There was a program on \ntelevision the other day, on CNN, which reported the ratio of students \nto computers in the United States of America: Dead last--and no \nsurprise--the District of Columbia, 1 computer for every 31 kids. That \nis as good as it gets if you happen to be a child in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Did the D.C. City Council decide to buy more computers so the kids \ncould learn and become proficient in the use of computers to be able to \ncompete and get good jobs? No; no way. They want to give a tax cut of \n$100 or $200 a year.\n  Oh, there is applause among some quarters. You can say: I'm a \npolitician. I'm giving away a tax cut. Then you look around and say: \nWait a minute. It's not safe to live in my neighborhood. There's an HIV \nepidemic going on. And the schools are the most disgraceful in the \nNation. That is what it comes down to. I think it is a bad decision, \nbut it is a decision they have made.\n  When you come down to other questions, such as attorneys fees and \nspecial education, we have made a concession in terms of the amount of \nmoney that will be allowed to attorneys representing families of \nspecial ed kids.\n  I would like to finish my comments on this bill related to the D.C. \nAppropriations bill and the Labor-HHS Appropriations bill which is \nbefore us, but I see our minority leader has come to the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield to the minority \nleader for such time as he may consume, and then resume my comments on \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the courtesy of the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois. I came to the floor to have a personal \nconversation with him on another matter. So I will yield the floor at \nthis time to allow that opportunity, and appreciate, again, his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I was trying to do my \nduty as a member of Senator Daschle's team.\n  Let me say that having said earlier that Senator Hutchison has done \nsuch an extraordinary job in trying to find a compromise, I would have \nto tell you that the District of Columbia deserves better. They deserve \nbetter than a process where every Member of the House or the Senate \nwould decide that they might add a rider to a bill to override local \ndecisions by the D.C. City Council.\n  The District of Columbia certainly deserves better than to be in the \npredicament they are in today, where they have been appended as an \nafterthought to a huge spending bill, the Labor-HHS and Education bill, \nand, frankly, have bought a ticket on the Titanic. This bill is going \nto be vetoed, just as sure as I am standing here. So D.C. is about to \nsee its third incarnation as an appropriations bill even later in the \nsession.\n  I would like to yield, if I might, to the Senator from----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I think \nSenator Specter, the chairman of the Labor-HHS committee, was going to \nmake the next presentation. That was the order. Is that acceptable?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I find no problem with that. I would be glad to yield to \nSenator Specter in one moment.\n  Let me just finish on the D.C. bill, if I might, very quickly, and \nthen yield to Senator Specter. Then we can come back to our side of the \naisle for further comment. Let me tell Senators, for perspective, we \nare talking about a $429 million Federal appropriations bill for the \nDistrict. The District of Columbia has its own budget of $6.8 billion. \nThat budget is twisted in knots by Members of the House and Senate who \nhave their own political agenda they want to inject into the \nappropriation for the District of Columbia. They impose standards and \nrestrictions on the District of Columbia they would never consider even \nsuggesting in their home States. The evidence is obvious. Some of the \nmore controversial issues in which we get involved in the D.C. \nappropriations bill turn out to be programs these Congressmen and \nSenators don't even talk about in their home States. I think that \nreally tells the whole story about what has happened with the District \nof Columbia in its spending bill.\n\n  I have a number of comments I would like to make about the underlying \nbill, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. But in the interest of \ncontinuing this debate and acknowledging the presence of the chairman \nof that Appropriations subcommittee, I yield the floor to Senator \nHutchison, if she would like to yield to Senator Specter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is now my intention to allow \nSenator Specter to take the floor. As I said, we have two bills \ntogether--the D.C. bill, which I chair, and the Labor-HHS bill, which \nSenator Specter chairs. Senator Specter has been very helpful, very \ncooperative to allow his very major bill to be put together with mine. \nHe is very much a greater than equal partner in this bill. I have to \nadmit, his bill is much bigger and much more important from a national \nstandpoint, although the District of Columbia is very important. \nNevertheless, Senator Specter's bill affects the lives of people all \nover our country.\n  It is my pleasure to yield the floor to Senator Specter for such time \nas he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nTexas for yielding. I know there are other Senators on the floor \nwaiting to speak, so I shall be relatively brief.\n  I do chair the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation. We thank the managers of the District of Columbia bill for \nallowing us to participate in their conference and for bringing our \nbill along.\n  The distinguished Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, and I had worked \nthrough, in our subcommittee, a bill to finance the Department of \nEducation, the Department of Labor, and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services which received a vote of 73 to 25. It is a very solid \nbill.\n  We then proceeded in a rather unusual way, because the House of \nRepresentatives had not passed a bill, to have an informal conference \nwhere Senator Harkin and I represented the Senate and Congressman \nPorter, chairman of the subcommittee on the House side, represented the \nHouse. Congressman Obey, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee, \ndeclined to participate because there had not been a House bill.\n\n[[Page S13506]]\n\n  We are trying to make the best of a very difficult situation. As I \nnoted, I will speak relatively briefly because I came to the floor on \nWednesday, October 27, and spoke at some length when we had just \nfinished the conference. Those remarks appear in the Congressional \nRecord for October 27.\n  In substance, the portion of this bill on Labor, Health and Human \nServices is a $93.7 billion bill. It is an increase of $6 billion over \nfiscal year 1999, an increase of some $600 million over the President's \nfigure. On education, which is a very high priority in America, \npriority second to none, this bill has appropriations totaling some $35 \nbillion, and it is a $300 million increase over what the President had \nrecommended.\n  We have sought to accommodate the President's interests and recognize \nhis priorities. On Head Start, we had an increase of some $608.5 \nmillion, bringing the total funding for Head Start in excess of $5 \nbillion. On GEAR UP, we had a 50-percent increase, from $120 million to \n$180 million. The President wanted a doubling. We could not find that \nmuch money. It is a good program, but we think a 50-percent increase \nwas very substantial.\n  There is a point of controversy on the question of teacher classroom \nsize. We have funded that at $1.2 billion. The President wanted $200 \nmillion extra. We anticipate that in negotiations that figure could be \nraised. Mr. Jack Lew, head of the Office of Management and Budget, has \nsome add-ons he wants to make when the negotiations finally do occur, \nand they have some additional offsets to talk about at that time.\n  There has been a disagreement over whether there ought to be a \nmandate for those funds to be used for classroom size reduction or \nwhether there ought to be some flexibility on the school districts. On \nthis matter, we have specified that classroom size is the first item on \nthe agenda, but we have given the local districts the option of using \nthem for teacher training or some other local purpose.\n  We do not believe there ought to be a straitjacket coming out of \nWashington, if the local districts have some other need and can \ndemonstrate that. I know this causes some heartburn to the \nadministration. I talked to the President about it personally and \ntalked to Jack Lew about it. It seems to us this is a matter where \nthere ought to be some significant congressional input. The primary \nresponsibility on appropriations comes to the Congress. That is what \nthe Constitution says. Of course, the President has to sign the bill, \nand we are always concerned and take into consideration the President's \npriorities. But as a matter of public policy, it makes a lot of sense \nto allow local school districts to make a different allocation from \nclassroom size reduction if they don't have a problem on classroom \nsize. So that is one issue where there is disagreement.\n  One aspect of the final bill, which came out of the conference, \nprovides for a 1-percent across-the-board cut, with which, as I noted 2 \ndays ago, I am personally not in agreement. My preference would have \nbeen to go through the bill and itemize various programs to make those \nreductions without a 1-percent across-the-board cut. There was a very \nstrenuous effort made by the leadership of the House and Senate and the \nrepresentatives of the subcommittee and the full committee to find \nanother way out, to have this bill come in without touching Social \nSecurity. Simply stated, this was the least of all the undesirable \nalternatives.\n  It is my hope the President will sign this bill. He has already \nstated he will veto it. This is another step in the process of the \nappropriations procedures to come back to negotiations and to try to \nfind a bill which will be acceptable to the President and to the \nCongress.\n  I note that when we talk about a 1-percent across-the-board cut on a \nprogram such as Head Start, there will still be an increase of some \n$569 million, not as much as the $608 million we had hoped for but \nstill a very substantial increase. When it comes to a variety of other \nprograms, we have added very substantial increases, so even when there \nis a 1-percent across-the-board cut, there is still a net advance.\n  Two more items are worthy of brief mention. We have added very \nsubstantially to the National Institutes of Health, some $2.3 billion. \nThat is the crown jewel of the Federal Government. They are making \nenormous strides. The expert testimony specifies that the cure for \nParkinson's may be only 5 years away; great advances on Alzheimer's, \ngreat advances on cancer--cervical cancer, breast cancer, prostate \ncancer--heart disease, the entire range of problems.\n  We have in this bill an allocation of some $800 million for a program \ndirected at youth violence. The actual figure is $733.8 million, where \nno additional funds were added, but there is a redirection to try to \ndeal with that major problem in America.\n  In essence, I think the bill that passed the Senate was a really good \nbill which would have clearly merited the President's signature, even \nthough some differences have existed with the 1 percent across-the-\nboard cut. I understand the problems there. But if somebody has a \nsuggestion on how to have offsets or cuts to protect Social Security, \nwe are prepared to sit down and meet with the officers of the executive \nbranch and the President to try to work out a bill that is acceptable \nto both the administration and the Congress, to be sure there is \nadequate funding for these three very important Departments.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently the Senate passed the last of \nthe Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills, the Labor, Health & Human \nServices, Education appropriations bill. Despite tight budgetary \nconstraints, the Senate has passed a bill which embodies the basic \nprinciples of our democratic society--all of our citizens deserve an \nequal opportunity to reach one's highest potential--by providing access \nto a good education, jobs skills training and protection from illness.\n  While I believe that this is a well balanced bill which appropriately \nreflects the priorities of the Senate, many of the votes that we cast \nin relation to the this bill challenged these priorities as well as our \ncommitment to protecting the Social Security surplus from careless \ngovernment over-spending. Therefore, please allow me to address some of \nthe specifics of individual amendments which touch upon these issues.\n  As I stated before, this legislation rightly embodies the ideals of \nresponsibility, accountability and flexibility. No greater are these \nideals highlighted than in the areas of education. This legislation \nprovides for $37.6 billion for the Department of Education; $6 billion \nfor special education; and $892 million in education impact aid. In \nfact, the Committee exceeded the President's funding level requests by \n$537 million, $586 million and $156 million respectively. This support \nwill provide the foundation by which we can continue to strengthen and \nimprove the education system for all of our children.\n  In addition, this legislation respects the right of the states and \nlocal districts to make appropriate decisions regarding education.\n  However, some of my colleagues would jeopardize the jurisdiction of \nstates, schools and parents to decide the most appropriate means by \nwhich to address the specific concerns of their children.\n  Senator Murray offered an amendment (No. 1804) which would have \nincreased the levels for the class-size reduction program from $1.2 \nbillion to $1.4 billion. This increase would be coupled to a mandate \nwhich requires that the funding must be used to reduce class size. Now, \nI agree that smaller class size is preferable to a larger class-size, \njust about anyone would; children receive more individual attention \nfrom the teacher when there are fewer children in the classroom. \nHowever, not all schools have the need for smaller class-sizes--42 \nstates have already met the goal of 18 students per teacher. Thus, not \nall districts place priority on smaller class-sizes. Why would the \nfederal government force districts and states to spend limited \nresources on a program which is unnecessary? What right does the \nfederal government have to decide for the schools and the parents what \ntheir priorities should be? Forcing schools to spend funding on one \nparticular program, simply takes valuable resources from other programs \nwhich might better address the needs of their students. Although this \namendment failed, the funding itself is still available to schools; to \nreduce the number of children in each classroom if they so choose or, \nif further class-size\n\n[[Page S13507]]\n\nreduction is unnecessary, to fund a more appropriate program such as \ntechnology-related training for teachers, dropout or drug abuse \nprevention programs and building new school facilities.\n  It is for similar reasons that I could not support an amendment (No. \n1809) to increase funding for 21st Century Community Learning Centers. \nAgain, I do not doubt that after-school programs offer structural, \neducational, and health services to children and the families of \ncommunities. However, the funding for this program had already been \nincreased $200 million over FY99 funding levels by the Committee. I \ncannot justify forcing states and localities to spend additional \nfunding on specific programs which might not be appropriate for their \ncommunities.\n  As we continue to raise the bar on the quality of education provided \nto our children, we have also increased state and local accountability \nfor reaching these high standards. Accountability is a key component of \na successful education policy, without it there is less incentive to \nsucceed or exceed goals. Earlier this session, we passed the Education \nFlexibility Partnership Act (Public Law 106-25), which in exchange for \ngreater accountability, provides states with expanded flexibility to \nchoose which education initiatives best fit the needs of their \nchildren. In the five years the Ed-Flex program was in effect, prior to \nits expansion to all states with the passage of this bill, it has \nrealized modest to spectacular results, and in no case has performance \ndeclined or has a state abused its increased flexibility by diverting \nor misrepresenting funds. I am proud to have voted for Ed-Flex and the \nprinciples it upholds.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues, while espousing the virtues of \naccountability, would at the same time take away the flexibility states \nneed to respond quickly and effectively to the needs of their students \nand schools. This is why I opposed an amendment (No. 1861) offered by \nSenator Bingaman, which purported to increase accountability for \nstates. This amendment undermined the principles of responsibility, \naccountability and flexibility. While the amendment would increase \nfunding for disadvantaged students by $49 million, it specifically \nmandated that $70 million in funding must be used for state \naccountability programs. This represents a net loss of $21 million in \nfunding which could have gone directly to the classrooms--funding which \ncould have directly and positively impacted the quality of education \nprovided for economically disadvantaged students. This amendment \nrepresents accountability, or at least requires the implementation of \nan accountability program, without the accompanying flexibility states \nneed to effectively address education issues.\n\n  Mr. President, there is another side to responsibility as well. \nEarlier this year, we made a promise to the American people that we \nwould not raid the Social Security surplus. Even as the President's \nbudget proposal threatened drain the Social Security surplus by $158 \nbillion over five years and the Democrats continued to filibuster my \nSocial Security Lockbox legislation, we still held true to our \ncommitment not to spend a single penny of the Social Security trust \nfund. Now, as we are nearing the end of the appropriations process, it \nis vital that we uphold our responsibility to the American people and \nkeep this promise.\n  Senator Nickles offered an amendment (No. 1889) which rightly \nexpressed the sense of the Senate regarding the importance of \nprotecting the Social Security surplus. Recognizing the possibility \nthat the amount of funding appropriated through the 13 appropriations \nbills could exceed budgetary restraints, the Senate agreed that a \nsolution could be an across-the-board reduction in discretionary \nfunding in an amount equal to that needed to stay within budget \nconstraints, thereby protecting Social Security. My vote reflects my \nunwavering belief that the social security surplus must be protected \nfrom wanton government spending. It also highlights my continuing \nopposition to rasing taxes on America's working families, especially \nwhen cutting wasteful Washington spending is certainly a viable \nalternative.\n  Some of my colleagues, many of whom are the same individuals who have \ncontinued to vote against a Social Security Lockbox, denounced the \nacross-the-board proposal. Although they could have offered a \nsubstantial and realistic alternative to across-the-board reductions in \nreductions, instead they choose to introduce an amendment (No. 2267) \nwhich merely denounces the proposal for a reduction in discretionary \nfunding and offers vague support for paying for the budget shortfall by \nraising taxes and using other offsets.\n  When my colleagues were pressed about details, they stated that there \nis currently $4 trillion in tax expenditures which could be examined \nand possibly eliminated to raise revenue for excess spending: that \n``there may very well be an opportunity to squeeze some resources out \nof tax expenditures * * *''. Another term for tax expenditure is tax \nrelief. And when my colleagues talk about squeezing out resources, this \nincludes ``squeezing'' relief measures such as the tax credit for post-\nsecondary education, the $500 per child tax credit, estate tax relief \nand the home interest deduction, among many other provisions which \nallow families to save and invest in their own and their children's \nfutures. Without a clear explanation of exactly how enough revenue \nwould be raised to fill the budget shortfall, thereby avoiding spending \nthe Social Security surplus, I could not support the alternative \namendment to the across-the-board reduction in discretionary spending \nlevels and I will not support any proposal which would increase the \nalready excessive tax burden on American families.\n  In addition, some of my colleagues offered an amendment (No. 2268) \nwhich would reduce the level of fairness inherent in an across-the-\nboard reduction by insisting on an exemption for specific programs from \nthe resulting decreases in discretionary funding, specifically \neducation funding. While I believe that education is a top national \npriority, this amendment primarily highlights a general lack of \nunderstanding about the actual education funding levels in this \nappropriations bill.\n  My votes on these Sense of the Senate amendments simply express my \npreference for spending reductions versus raising taxes or spending the \nSocial Security surplus. In that there are many specific areas of \nfederal spending that in my view can and should be cut back, I would \nprefer to see us balance the budget with reductions of that type. \nUnfortunately, gaining consensus on such reductions will be difficult, \nalthough I will continue to press for this type of approach. Failing \nthat, some type of across-the-board reductions may be the last resort.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the education funding in this bill exceeds \nthe levels requested by the Administration on many fronts. While it is \nimpossible at this point to know exactly what the final spending level \nwill be at the end of the day, even after including all of the \nPresident's emergency spending and a possible Balanced Budget Act of \n1997 (BBA) pay-back bill, an across-the-board reduction, designed to \nprotect Social Security, would result in approximately a 1.4 percent \ndecrease.\n  Mr. President, even with a 1.4 percent reduction in discretionary \nfunding, I would further note that special education and education \nimpact aid would have funding levels $521 million and $143 million \nabove the President's request levels, respectively. In addition, the \nDepartment of Education would be funded $10.6 million over that which \nthe President requested. Far from under-funding education, this bill \ncontinues to provide strong support for our schools and our students.\n  We have almost completed our appropriations work this year, and I \napplaud the effort and dedication demonstrated by my colleagues on the \nSenate Appropriations Committee and in the Senate as whole. I hope, as \nwe go into the final stages of this process, we will continue to abide \nby the ideals of responsibility, accountability and flexibility by \nupholding our promise to protect Social Security and by producing a \nfinal package which will serve Americans well.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13507-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13507-S13520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TAX RELIEF EXTENSION ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have some very important extenders in the \nTax Code that need to be acted on before the end of this year or they \nwill\n\n[[Page S13508]]\n\nexpire. The Finance Committee, in a broad bipartisan way, reported out \nthe bill. We have now cleared it on both sides. So this is very \nimportant to get it into conference with the House quickly so we can \nget this legislation completed before the year's legislative end.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now turn to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 346, S. 1792, the so-called Finance \nCommittee extenders bill, and there be 10 minutes for debate, with no \namendments or motions in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1792) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     to extend expiring provisions, to fully allow the \n     nonrefundable personal credits against regular tax liability, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I express my support for this bill.\n  This bill is not perfect. There are many of us in the Senate who have \nhoped we could have done more. I have argued that the Research and \nDevelopment tax credit should be made permanent for many years. \nCompanies plan their research many years in advance, and we don't get \nthe full benefit of the R credit by allowing it to expire so \nfrequently.\n  I also support making the AMT exclusion in the bill permanent. \nTaxpayers should be assured they will receive the full benefits of the \npersonal credits that we enacted with such fanfare just last session.\n  There are other credits in this bill that should be made permanent, \nsuch as the Work Opportunities and Welfare to Work tax credits. These \ncredits help compensate companies for hiring those employees that are \nthe hardest to employ and train--those coming off the welfare rolls.\n  But we cannot allow the perfect to be the enemy of the good. We stand \nhere in the waning days of this session, and it appears as though \nenacting legislation that would make these credits permanent is simply \nnot in the cards. They are expensive, and it is not possible to enact \nmajor tax legislation that uses a substantial portion of the surplus \nunless it is in the context of a comprehensive bill.\n  Above all, we must be fiscally responsible, and protect the surplus \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  This bill has been reviewed by all Senators and has received \nunanimous consent to proceed. I hope the Conferees on the bill will \nwork out the differences between the House and Senate quickly, and send \nus back a bill the President can sign into law. Doing otherwise risks \ngetting nothing at all, and allowing the gap since these important \ncredits lapsed to grow. This would further undermine their \neffectiveness, and leave thousands of businesses and individuals with \ntremendous uncertainty about their tax liabilities for this year.\n  We cannot and should not leave this important work undone. We should \nrestore these credits as soon as possible, even if that means leaving \nthe debate about permanence for these credits for another day.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask consent that following the conclusion \nor yielding back of time, the bill be advanced to third reading and \npassed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table. I further \nask consent that the bill remain at the desk, and once the Senate \nreceives the House companion bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration and all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text \nof the Senate bill be inserted, the bill be advanced to third reading \nand passed. I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House, and the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and passage \nof the Senate bill be vitiated and it be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1792) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1792\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join the distinguished \nranking member of the Finance Committee, Senator Moynihan, in \ndiscussing Senate passage of the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999.\n  The bill the Senate passed today is a consensus package of extensions \nof expiring tax provisions, known as ``extenders.'' Working together, \nSenator Moynihan and I produced a package that was reported out of the \nFinance Committee unanimously.\n  In order to get a package that could be approved by unanimous \nconsent, we had to achieve a fair compromise. Every Member would \nprobably differ in the way he or she would write an extenders bill.\n  Fortunately, Members of the Senate realize the importance of \naddressing these expiring provisions. The evidence of that importance \nis demonstrated by the unanimous consent agreement for passage that we \nentered into today.\n  The most important of the expiring provisions, as Senator Moynihan \nnoted, is the exclusion of nonrefundable tax credits from the \nalternative minimum taxes (``AMT''). The Finance Committee bill insures \nthat middle income families will receive the benefits of the $500 per \nchild tax credit, HOPE Scholarship credit, Lifetime Learning credit, \nadoption credit, and dependent care tax credit. This relief is extended \nthrough December 31, 2000.\n  There are other important expiring tax provisions the Finance \nCommittee bill addresses. Included is the research and development \n(``R'') tax credit, the tax-free treatment of employer-provided \neducational assistance, the work opportunity tax credit, the welfare-\nto-work tax credit, the active finance exception to Subpart F, and the \nextension and modification of the tax credit for production of \nelectricity from wind and biomass, including poultry waste. There are \nseveral other important extenders in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I urge the House to pass its extenders bill. We will \nthen proceed to a conference and work out the differences between the \ntwo bills. It is important that we work quickly and produce a \nconference agreement that addresses these important matters.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I have just a couple of points to make \nabout this extender bill. First, my congratulations to our revered \nchairman\n\n[[Page S13520]]\n\nof the Finance Committee, who brought all sides together in a consensus \nbill that accomplishes our objective--extend expiring provisions that \ncommand support from all Senators. This was not a simple task.\n  Tax extenders were part of the large tax bill that began working its \nway through the Congress in July--a bill that in my view needed to be \nand was vetoed. This fall, Senator Roth returned to the task and \npresented a chairman's mark focused on extenders. He built bipartisan \nsupport for the bill, and that is why we are here on the Senate floor \nso soon, ready to pass the legislation by unanimous consent.\n  This bill is a paid-for extenders package. As such, it meets the \nstandards of Members on both sides of the aisle. It is a bill that can \npass this Congress and can be signed by the President.\n  And it is important that we pass legislation that can be signed. If \nwe do not, approximately 1.1 million Americans will find out that they \nwill lose part or all of the $500 child credit or the HOPE scholarship \ncredit when they sit down to complete their 1999 tax return. That is \nbecause these credits have not yet been permanently exempted from what \nwe call the alternative minimum tax. This legislation will exempt these \ncredits from the alternative minimum tax for 1999 and 2000.\n  The American people ask us to be responsible in managing our tax \nlaws. To not pass this bill would be irresponsible and contribute to a \nperception that Members of Congress who agree on what should be done \ncannot sit down and figure out a way to do them.\n  Again, my congratulations to the chairman, and let's move \nexpeditiously to a conference with the House of Representatives as soon \nas they pass similar legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the cooperation we have had \non both sides of the aisle to get to this point. A number of Senators \nhave expressed a desire to offer amendments and to change, in some way, \nthe package as it has been presented and passed this morning. We will \nwork with our colleagues to find ways in which to address many of these \nissues, whether it is in conference or on other vehicles.\n  There are a number of issues I care about as well, and I share the \nconcerns expressed to me by some of our colleagues. It is very \nimportant that before the end of the session we pass this legislation \nout and get to conference within a time where we might be able to move \nit further along.\n  I strongly support the action the Senate has just taken. My only \nregret is that these matters aren't permanent law and that they require \nextension at all. There should come a time when we pass them \npermanently so we aren't required to come back year after year. Having \nsaid that, again, I appreciate the work of the majority leader.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I agree with that. I might say that there \nare some permanent provisions in the House Ways and Means version of \nthis bill. They would make permanent the extender with regard to the \nalternative minimum tax and how it affects the low- and middle-income \npeople and others. Also, I have a bill at the desk to express my strong \nfeeling on this subject that would make the R tax credit permanent. I \nthink to come back every year, 2 years, or even every 5 years, causes \nconcern and insecurity with regard to those tax credits. I hope we will \nmake it either permanent, or as long as possible, in the conference.\n  I know there is at least one Senator who has provisions he hopes will \nbe considered in the conference, and I think they should be. On our \nside, I have one Senator who feels very strongly that there are three \nparts of this bill that affect permanent law, which is not extenders. I \nagree. I think those permanent law issues should be dealt with by the \nregular committees. One has to do with brownfields, one with a rum \nprovision, maybe in the Virgin Islands--not that you might want to be \nfor them; I am just questioning whether or not they should be in a bill \nthat is supposed to be tax credit extenders. We have other good \nprovisions in here, a welfare-to-work tax credit, and others. So I am \nglad we are going to get this done before we leave. I thank Senators \nfor the cooperation on both sides.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13520-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13520-S13524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield some time at this moment to the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Labor-HHS \nSubcommittee for his commitment to children and health. He stood with \nmany of us many times. Unfortunately, the Labor bill that is now before \nus simply doesn't make the grade. I believe a number of our colleagues \non this side of the aisle will be speaking against this and voting \nagainst this in the hopes that when the President vetoes it, the \nSenator from Pennsylvania, chairman of the committee, will work out \nsome of the things about which we care deeply.\n  When you leave something for the last minute, you can't do it \njustice. This Congress has left our investment in educating our \nchildren, in protecting our American workforce, and in ensuring the \nhealth of the people of this country for the last minute, and the \nfailures are pretty obvious. The Labor-HHS appropriations bill should \nhave been the first bill we brought to the floor--not the last.\n  This Congress has tried every trick and every gimmick to play games \nwith the budget. I am here to say we are nearing the end of this game; \nand for the American people who are watching this Congress, they must \nwonder how serious we are about addressing their concerns. If this \nflawed proposal passes, the American people will be the ones who lose \nout.\n  I am on the floor to say this combination D.C./Labor-HHS conference \nreport--with its irresponsible across-the-board cuts--fails to make the \nvital investments we need, the investments our constituents are asking \nfor.\n\n  Mr. President, I will vote against this conference report, and I will \ntell you why. First, and most important, this bill will not guarantee \nthat we reduce class size.\n  Now, last year, this Congress, the House and Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, made a bipartisan commitment to help our districts hire \nand train new teachers. We did that because research shows students who \nlearn in classes where there are fewer students in the early grades do \nbetter throughout their educational careers. They learn the basics--\nmath, science, and English--and they have fewer discipline problems. We \ndid that because it was a goal of all of us to make a concerted \nnational effort to make sure that young children learned the basics, \nreduced the discipline problems, went on to college, and would be \nviable contributors to our economy when they graduated.\n  Last year, we made that bipartisan commitment and promised the \nparents of this country we would give their schools targeted money for \nsmaller class sizes for the next 7 years. This bill walks away from \nthat commitment. That is not acceptable. Not only does it walk away, \nbut it broadens the use of the money so much that it could open the \ndoor to using vital, public education, class size dollars for private \nschool vouchers.\n  Now, the President has said he will veto this bill if it does not \nkeep our commitment to hire more teachers to reduce class size. I am \nproud that 37 Senators have joined with me to sign a letter saying they \nwill back up that veto because we know that guaranteeing smaller \nclasses for our children is worth fighting for.\n  The Labor-HHS bill's failure on class size is glaring. But to me it \nis just a start of many things that need to be fixed once this is \nvetoed and sent back to us in order for Democrats to be supportive.\n  It also fails to help families gain the literacy skills they need. \nWhen the Senate passed its version, we were able to provide an increase \nof $103 million, which would have taken thousands of people off of \nwaiting lists for literacy services. But in this conference agreement, \nthey cut the Senate number by $43 million. Those families were just \nabout to get the skills they needed to rejoin our economy, and this \nagreement pushes them to back of the line.\n  This bill fails to make kids safer in our schools. In a year when the \ntragedy\n\n[[Page S13521]]\n\nat Columbine High School is still fresh in our minds, this bill cuts--\ncuts--$31 million from the Senate bill for the Safe and Drug-Free \nSchools Program. Local educators tell me we should double our funding \nin this area which is vital. Cutting it is just not acceptable.\n  This bill also fails the children who depend on the Head Start \nprogram. Head Start often makes the difference between success and \nfailure in school for so many disadvantaged children. This bill does \nnot do right by them.\n  This bill also cuts basic skills education for disadvantaged \nstudents. And it underfunds education technology programs at a time \nwhen we know all of our students need to get the skills in technology \nso that they can get the jobs that are open and waiting for them in so \nmany communities across our country. It also cuts the vocational \neducation program at a time when we know we need to make sure our kids \ngraduate with skills to help them get jobs.\n  This bill does not do enough to support the Reading Excellence Act \nand bilingual education. This bill underfunds several important \nprograms that build access and success for higher education students by \nnot adequately funding Pell grants and vital programs like GEAR UP, \nLEAP, and TRIO.\n  I could go on. But it is clear that on education this bill is a \nmissed opportunity. I am sure many people will try to claim that this \nagreement is ``a victory for education.'' But I can tell you as a \nformer teacher and a former school board member that it is a hollow \nvictory.\n  Mr. President, on labor issues, the Labor, HHS bill fails to \nadequately protect American workers and to promote universal \nemployment.\n  This bill cuts funds for vital organizations, like the National Labor \nRelations Board--by 5 percent--and the Occupational Safety and Health \nAdministration--by 6 percent--below the administration's request. I \ndon't want to be any part of a bill that could harm our ability to \nenforce the labor and workplace laws that protect the health and safety \nof our country's workers.\n  This bill's irresponsible across-the-board spending cut would also \nhurt many vital job programs. For example, it would cut the Department \nof Labor's Youth Activities formula grants by $9.7 million, closing the \ndoor to almost 5,700 disadvantaged young people as they seek job \ntraining, summer employment, and educational opportunities. That is not \nacceptable to this Senator.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to protecting the health of our \ncitizens, this bill is a mixed bag. While it does offer important \nsupport for the National Institutes of Health, for telemedicine for \nChildren's Hospital in Seattle, poison control, and community and \nmigrant health centers, the areas where it fails are so significant and \nso glaring that I cannot support the underlying bill.\n  This bill fails to address the human and social costs of AIDS and \nHIV. This bill's arbitrary and irresponsible across-the-board cut means \nthat AIDS patients and their communities will suffer because it doesn't \nmeet the growing need for services--services like drug assistance and \npediatric AIDS care.\n  Similarly, the D.C. appropriations bill will hurt our ability to halt \nthe spread of the disease because the bill continues to prohibit public \nfunds from being used for clean needle exchange.\n  This bill also reduces our commitment to reproductive health care and \nfamily planning. I find it painfully ironic that last week, 48 Senators \nwent on record against the principles of Roe v. Wade, claiming that \nabortion should not be a choice for women. Yet when it comes to \nreducing unintentional pregnancies or providing health care services \nfor pregnant women, those same Senators are simply not there. This bill \nmeans that 40,000 women will be denied access to basic reproductive \nhealth care. It will reduce women's access to critical pre-natal care.\n  This bill's irresponsible across-the-board cut will also weaken our \nability to respond to domestic violence. This bill would spend less \nmoney than we are spending this year on programs under the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. That means less money for rape prevention and for \nbattered women's shelters.\n  Many communities in my State are struggling--struggling--to help \nwomen and children affected by rape and abuse. Reducing the Federal \ncommitment in this area is simply unacceptable.\n  Some people will say this bill's across-the-board cut won't hurt \nanyone. They are wrong because denying emergency shelter to a battered \nwoman and her children is painful. Denying access to reproductive \nhealth care services to 40,000 women is painful, and denying access to \nlife-saving drug therapies for AIDS patients is worse than painful, it \nis deadly.\n  Mr. President, we still have an opportunity to do the right thing for \nour children, our families and our communities. I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' on this bill so the President can veto it and we can fix \nit--by undoing its damaging across-the-board cut and keeping our \ncommitment to reduce class size. Let's show the American people that \neven though this Congress has failed--throughout the session--to do its \nwork in a timely, responsible way, we still have the wisdom to get \nthings right at the end.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Labor-HHS bill \nwhich has been attached to the D.C. appropriations bill. I will not \nhave any comments on the D.C. appropriations bill; I leave that to my \nfriend and colleague, my leader, Senator Durbin from Illinois.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent Jane Daye, Mark Laisch, and Dr. Jack Chow, \ndetailees to the Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee, be permitted on the \nfloor during consideration of the D.C. and Labor-HHS-Education \nconference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Today we are bringing up--and I guess the vote will be \nheld on Tuesday--the conference report that accompanies the D.C. \nappropriations bill. This report, as we now know, also includes the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill \nnegotiated by the House and Senate appropriators.\n  I regret very much that the conference agreement includes a poison \npill inserted by the House Republican leadership, an irresponsible and \nindiscriminate across-the-board cut against all discretionary programs, \nprojects, and activities. Later I will discuss that at length.\n  First, I commend the work of my colleague and chairman on the \nappropriations bill, Senator Specter. He and I have had a great working \nrelationship through the years, a true partnership every year on this \nbill, first when I was Chair and he was ranking member and now he is \nChair and I am ranking.\n  Senator Specter has a deep commitment to the vitally important \nhealth, education, labor, research, and other initiatives in this bill. \nSenator Specter and his staff have always treated our side fairly. I \nwant him and them to know how much I appreciate that. I not only \nappreciate it; I understand how important it is in terms of completing \nour Nation's business.\n  A few weeks ago, the Senate passed the Labor-HHS-Education \nappropriations bill by an overwhelming vote of 73-25; 41 Democrats and \n32 Republicans voted for it. This is an exceedingly strong vote. It got \nthis strong vote because Senator Specter and I worked together and we \nworked with Senators from both sides of the aisle to craft a bill that \ntruly reflected our Senate priorities. It was a good bill. It provides \na major increase for medical research. It provides $500 million more \nthan the President requested for education. It maintained our \ncommitment to worker safety provisions.\n  It did have one major flaw. It did not fund the President's class \nsize initiative in an acceptable manner. Nonetheless, I argued strongly \nfor its passage. At the time, I told Members on my side of the aisle I \nwould work to resolve the class size issue in conference. We had a good \nSenate bill. We had a strong Senate vote, with 73 votes on the Senate \nside.\n  The House of Representatives, on the other hand, was not able even to \nproduce a bill. The Appropriations Committee on the House side reported \nout a bill. It cut education, cut job training, had a whole lot of bad \nlabor riders dealing with workers' safety protection. But the full \nHouse never even took it up.\n  Several weeks ago, we began something I had never ever engaged in\n\n[[Page S13522]]\n\naround here; we began a nonconference conference. We could not have had \na conference because the House never passed a bill, but we met with the \nHouse appropriators. Congressman John Porter, the chairman of the \nLabor-HHS subcommittee on the House side--Senator Specter and I, and \nour staffs, met with him in an effort to move the process forward. When \nour committee was working on it, we made good progress. We worked \ntogether to produce an agreement that was very close to the Senate \nbill.\n  Again, I compliment and commend my colleague on the other side of the \naisle in the House, Congressman Porter, for working together in an open \nand constructive manner to produce a bill I believe could have garnered \nvotes and could have passed. If we could have ended the conference at \nthat point, I would be here today speaking in favor of the Labor-HHS \nand Education bill. However that is not the case.\n  With regard to the class size reduction issue, I raised the point in \nour negotiations with the House that 38 Senators encouraged the \nPresident to veto the conference report if it did not include this \ninitiative. However, I was not able to convince the negotiators on this \npoint. I am, however, convinced this issue will be addressed in any \nfinal bill. But putting this class size initiative aside, we had put \ntogether, I thought, really a pretty good agreement. We included a \nlarge increase for biomedical research, $100 million for community \nhealth centers, and a big increase for Head Start. None of what I term \n``the offensive House riders'' the House had put on for labor, health, \nand safety--none of those were included. Largely, it reflected most of \nthe priorities of the Senate on both sides of the aisle, both \nRepublican and Democratic.\n  As I said, if we could have ended it there, we probably would have \nhad a pretty good bill. But then Republican House leadership got \ninvolved. First, they insisted key programs be cut. They insisted \nafterschool programs be reduced by $100 million. They insisted the \nsmall increase we had for critical family planning services be \neliminated. They insisted on cutting Goals 2000. Why? I don't know, \nunless it was because it was a Presidential priority.\n  Next, they insisted on further delayed obligations. We had some \ndelayed obligations, but I think they were delayed obligations with \nwhich we could have lived, with which the Departments and Agencies \ncould have lived. But the delayed obligations the House leadership put \nin, I think, will cause some real problems at the National Institutes \nof Health.\n  I have long said not only do we have to increase the money going to \nthe NIH, that we had to double their budget over 5 years--of which I \nhave been very supportive--but that we need continuity, so grants could \ngo out to researchers that are not interrupted, so when researchers \nstart on a program and a research project they can continue.\n  With the delayed obligations and the extent to which we have them in \nthis bill, it appears that NIH will not be able to fund these research \nprograms on a longer term basis. It is just going to be from 1 year to \nthe next. As any person familiar with research can tell you, that is \nnot the best way to conduct research. I think the delayed obligations \nare going to cut back on the good that we did in terms of increasing \nthe funding for NIH.\n\n  Next, the House leaders also put in a $121 million reduction in \nsalaries and expenses. That was over and above the reductions we had \nalready made on the Senate side. We cut pretty deeply in the salaries \nand expenses and administrative costs of the Departments under our \njurisdiction, but the House leadership cut another $121 million. I \nbelieve that is unacceptable.\n  After that, the House leadership added--over, I might say, the \nopposition of most of the appropriators--the poison pill across-the-\nboard cut. The House Republican leaders repeatedly said this cut will \ngive each Department the ability to cut fraud, waste, and abuse. I take \na back seat to no one in this body or the other body or on either side \nof the aisle when it comes to fighting fraud, waste, and abuse in \ngovernment programs, but that is not what this provision says, nor \nwould it accomplish that. This is not a 1-percent cut that can be taken \nfrom any broad array of programs. Every program, project, and activity \nin this bill has to be cut by 1 percent.\n  So when you see the House Republican leaders on television saying: 1 \npercent, that's nothing, we can take that out of fraud, waste, and \nabuse--sorry. That is not the way the provision is written. The \nprovision is written it is 1 percent. It is not 1 percent of the \nincrease; it is 1 percent of the total that goes to each line item in \nthis bill, every single line item has to be cut.\n  You might say that is not, that 1 percent--that doesn't sound like a \nlot. When you put it in the Social Security system and the offices that \nadminister Social Security, it cuts it big time. It cuts millions of \ndollars out of veterans' health care. It cuts Meals on Wheels, \ncommunity health centers, afterschool programs; it cuts education. \nAgain, I point out it does not just cut the increases; it cuts many \nimportant programs actually below last year's level.\n  I will read from a list here of some programs that actually will have \nless than last year because of this across-the-board cut. Adult job \ntraining--we saw the other day our economy is booming at unprecedented \nrates. But the economy is changing. For example, we had an announcement \nthe other day in Iowa a major packing plant was closing its doors 5 \ndays before Christmas. I will not go into that right now, but talk \nabout heartless; 5 days before Christmas, Iowa Beef Processors is \nclosing its doors, and over 400 people are being thrown out of work. We \nneed to retrain those people. We need to retrain them for the new kind \nof economy we have. The bill before us cuts adult job training to less \nthan what we had last year. It is the wrong way to go.\n  Youth opportunity grants, community service jobs for senior citizens \nare cut below last year's level. Family planning, AIDS prevention, \nsubstance abuse block grants, child welfare and child abuse programs \nare all cut to less than what we had last year. This is not a cut in \nthe increase, this is a cut below what we had last year.\n  Teacher training: I met with some educators in my office yesterday \nwho were here from Irving School in Dubuque. They were getting an award \nas one of the blue-ribbon schools of America, a great award. I \nmentioned the teacher training program was being cut to less than last \nyear. They said: How could this possibly be? This is the program, the \nEisenhower math and science program, that keeps our teachers up to par \nwith what is happening so they can better teach their students. You can \nvote for this bill if you want, Mr. President, but if you do, you are \nvoting to cut teacher training programs for Goals 2000, the literacy \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this list of cuts that I have \njust enunciated be printed in the Record in tabular form.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n Sample of Programs Cut Below a Hard Freeze Under Conference Agreement \n  \\1\\--Compares Labor-HHS Items From Fiscal Year 1999 Level to Fiscal \n                            Year 2000 Level\n\n\n        Program                                   Total cut in millions\nDepartment of Labor:\n  Adult Job Training..............................................$7.38\n  Youth Job Training..............................................10.01\n  Youth Opportunity Grants.........................................2.50\n  Comm.

Mr. President, the House Republican leadership and others \nhave argued this across-the-board cut was needed to protect Social \nSecurity. We all agree we want to protect the Social Security surplus. \nBut the Congressional Budget Office says even with the across-the-board \ncut, they are going to have to tap Social Security by $17 billion. So \nleaving that aside, an across-the-board cut is not the answer. Let's \nprotect Social Security. Let's do it in the right way. Let's make the \ntough decisions, not hide behind an across-the-board cut.\n  Frankly, there are other offsets we could use. I say we should impose \na penalty on tobacco companies that fail\n\n[[Page S13523]]\n\nto meet targets for reducing youth smoking. In fact, I have in my hand \na specific proposal to do just that, to set a goal of reducing teen \nsmoking by 15 percent. That is a modest goal. If they fail to meet that \nmodest goal, they would have to pay a penalty. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that this proposal would raise almost $6 billion in \nfiscal year 2000.\n  That is $2.8 billion more than is saved by this across-the-board cut. \nIt would have the added benefit of protecting our kids from the deadly \naddiction of tobacco.\n  I want to be very clear--my esteemed friend from Illinois is sitting \nhere--this is not a new idea. We have voted on this before. In fact, \nthis was part of a proposal the Senator from Illinois and the Senator \nfrom Ohio proposed and which actually passed this body. So why don't we \ndo this rather than having an across-the-board cut in teacher training, \nthe substance abuse block grant, health programs, AIDS prevention \nprograms. Let's do something we already said we ought to do--cut teen \nsmoking. And if the tobacco companies cannot meet it, they pay a \npenalty. Unfortunately, the conference report we have before us does \nnot take this path.\n  With all the respect, admiration, and friendship I have for Senator \nSpecter--and he has worked doggedly on this bill; he has worked hard to \nprotect education and health and research programs; he and his staff \nhave worked openly with me and my staff--reluctantly I will have to \nvote against this conference agreement.\n  The poison pill across-the-board cut did it. I do so with reluctance \nbecause I believe we crafted a good bill in the Senate, and it would \nhave avoided all kinds of political maneuvering if we had the bill we \npassed in the Senate. If we followed that bipartisan path Senator \nSpecter and I worked on and set up in the Senate that was reflected in \na strong bipartisan vote in the Senate, we would have had a much \ndifferent result.\n  It is very clear to everyone, if this conference agreement is passed \nby the Senate, it will be vetoed by the President, and that veto will \nnot be overridden. When that happens, I plan to work very hard with my \nchairman, Senator Specter, and will be sitting at that table to help \ncraft a bill with our House colleagues and, of course, with the White \nHouse, that reflects congressional priorities but does not make these \ninordinate, mindless across-the-board cuts and that has offsets that \ntruly do reduce teen smoking and help us meet our goals of not invading \nthe Social Security trust funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to make a unanimous consent request because \nI have been waiting to make a statement on the floor. Several of my \ncolleagues have come to the floor with requests for short periods of \ntime. If there is no objection, I ask that the Senator from Washington \nbe allowed to speak for 10 minutes, as in morning business, followed by \nthe Senator from West Virginia for 10 minutes, and then that I be given \nthe floor at that moment in time for 15 minutes to address the bill \nthat is pending before us.\n  Mr. GORTON. Reserving the right to object, I am not speaking in \nmorning business; I am speaking on the bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sorry.\n  Mr. GORTON. While I think it would be about 10 minutes, I do not want \nto be called down if I go over 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to amend the unanimous consent request \nto accommodate whatever time the Senator would like, if he would \nspecify a time.\n  Is there a time the Senator would like to set?\n  Mr. GORTON. It will be approximately 10 minutes. It will be on the \nbill. If the unanimous consent request is amended in that form, I am \nperfectly happy with that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I want to give the Senator from Washington every \nopportunity to speak on this bill. I misunderstood when I spoke with \nhim. But I would be happy to yield to him. As part of the unanimous \nconsent request, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nWashington be recognized on the bill for up to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Then the Senator from West Virginia be recognized for up \nto 10 minutes in morning business, and then I be recognized for 15 \nminutes on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is a landmark Labor, Education, and \nHealth appropriations bill. It is a landmark in more than one respect. \nFrom my perspective, however, it is especially notable for two features \nrelating to our assistance to the education that is being provided to \nchildren all across the United States of America.\n  The first is this bill, in reaction to the President's budget message \nof much earlier this year, ends any dispute about the generosity of \nsupport for education on the part of either the President or the \ncongressional majority. In fact, this bill includes some $300 million \nmore for education purposes than did the President's budget message \nearlier this year; $2 billion more than last year--$35 billion in \ntotal.\n  Mr. President, $35 billion is not an inconsiderable sum. But of that \nportion that goes to our common schools from kindergarten through 12th \ngrade, it still will represent only about 7 percent of the number of \ndollars that go into providing an education for future generations of \nAmericans. But there is not a dispute in this bill over whether or not \nwe should fund education with this relative degree of generosity. In \nthat respect, this is a landmark bill.\n  But as we deal with the question of education, I believe it to be a \nlandmark in more than just that respect. This bill, in its present \nform, represents the first modest turn from a direction that we have \ntaken for three decades or more. During the last 30 or 35 years, the \nCongress and Presidents of both parties have piled one categorical aid \nprogram for education on top of another. Each of those programs has its \nown rules for eligibility. Each has its own rules as to how money \nshould be spent. Each carries with it its forms to be filled out and \nits audits to be performed and to be examined after the fact.\n  The President's proposed budget added a number of new categorical aid \nprograms to those already in existence and, I believe, shortchanged a \nnumber of the most vital educational programs that have been a part of \nour system literally for decades. As a consequence, this bill provides \nconsiderably more money for impact schools than the President's budget \ncalled for. Impact schools, of course, are those schools on or near \nmilitary reservations, Indian reservations, or other Federal property \nin which a peculiar and unique burden is placed by the fact that the \nFederal Government has employees or beneficiaries in the immediate \nvicinity while at the same time owning tax-exempt property that does \nnot, as property, pay its fair share or any share of the cost of \noperating those schools.\n  Most national administrations, most Presidents of the United States, \nhave not much liked impact aid. It took me some time to determine in my \nown mind why that was. I think it is because once the formula \ndistributes so many dollars to a school district in impact aid, the \nschool district decides how the money is going to be spent to advance \nthe education of its students. There aren't any rules and regulations \nfrom the U.S. Department of Education telling school districts how they \nmust use that impact aid. As a consequence, it has never had much of a \nlobby in the Department of Education or in administrations either \nRepublican or Democratic.\n  A second area in which this bill includes more money for education \nthan did the President's original request is for IDEA, the education \nfor the disabled. This body proudly reauthorized IDEA just 2 years ago, \nincluding in it a provision that we would come up with 40 percent of \nthe costs that that bill, for the education of the disabled, imposed on \nschool districts all across the country--40 percent of those costs. \nThis bill, more generous than the President's budget, actually funds \nabout 9 percent of those costs. Members of the Congress and the \nPresident got to congratulate themselves on passing a bill mandating \neducation for the disabled. They got to congratulate themselves on a \npromise that, very bluntly, I think, neither side had any intention of \nkeeping. We do not, in this bill, come close to that 40-percent \nrequirement, but we do better than the President of the United States \ndid in his budget submission.\n\n[[Page S13524]]\n\n  From my perspective, however, the most important change takes place \nin connection with a program that began last year designed to put more \nteachers in the classroom, especially more teachers in the classroom up \nthrough the third grade, a proposal that, for all practical purposes, \ncould be used only for that purpose, whether more teachers in those \nprimary grades was the primary need for each and every one of the \n17,000 school districts in the United States or not.\n  I don't believe my State is different from many others. My great \nfriend and frequent ally, the Senator from West Virginia, is on the \nfloor. I suspect he has a greater percentage of school districts in his \nState than does Washington State that don't receive enough money under \nthis program to hire one teacher because they are simply too small. So \nthis bill, after an extended debate between the two sides in which one \nside said we have to continue the program entirely unchanged, whatever \nthose school districts' priorities are, and our side that says we have \nto trust the school districts to spend that money for any educational \npurpose they desire--two rather dramatically opposed points of view--\ntakes a halfway position between the two.\n  It states that the primary goal of this $1.2 billion is to put more \nteachers in the classroom but that if school districts have other \npriorities or if they don't get enough money to do that for even one \nteacher, they can, in fact, use it for improving the quality of \nteachers they already have through more training or for some other \neducational purpose they believe is more significant than the top-down \nmandate in this bill.\n  I hope that will be appealing to the President of the United States. \nIt does express at least a qualified degree of trust on the part of the \nCongress in the dedication and intelligence and knowledge of the men \nand women who run our schools, either as elected members of school \nboards or as full-time superintendents, principals, and teachers, to \nmake decisions that will improve the quality of education of their \nchildren.\n  I have never been quite certain why it is that Members of the Senate \nthink they know more about the needs of schools all across the country \nthan do the people who make their entire careers out of providing that \neducation, but that has been the net result of what we have done. This \nis a modest move in the other direction, a reflection of the fact that \nearly next year, when we debate the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, we will debate exactly that kind of issue: Who knows best what our \nyoung people need, we in Washington, DC, or those who run the hundreds \nof thousands of schools in the United States of America.\n  This bill also begins to keep a promise we made a relatively short \ntime ago significantly to increase funding for health research through \nthe National Institutes of Health.\n  This bill is a landmark in one other vitally important respect. As \ngenerous as this bill is to education, as generous as it is to health \nprograms and to other programs included within it, it is a part of a \npattern of 13 appropriations bills that spend almost $600 billion in \ndiscretionary money in the course of the next year but do not touch the \nSocial Security trust fund. Last year, for the first time in decades, \nwe ended up with a budget that was not only balanced but in surplus to \nthe tune of $1 billion without touching a dime in the Social Security \ntrust fund. We are absolutely convinced, I think most of us, that we \nshould make the year 2000 the second consecutive year in which that \ntakes place and keep on following exactly those same policies.\n  We can pass this bill and the other appropriations bills still \nunresolved without dipping into the Social Security surplus and without \nincreasing taxes on the American people. That truly is a landmark. We \nthought when we passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, we might get to \nthis point in 2002 or 2003. We got to it in fiscal year 1999.\n  This morning's newspapers printed excerpts of a speech by Alan \nGreenspan on the nature of our economy and on the fact that it has \nactually been growing more rapidly and is more robust than most of our \nstatistics had indicated. Chairman Greenspan has made it very clear \nthat actually balancing the budget and paying down the debt is a key \nfactor in keeping the economy of this Nation moving forward.\n  We have a bill that I commend enthusiastically to all of the Members \nof this body. It is generous with education dollars, as it ought to be \nfor one of the highest of all priorities in any society, the education \nof its future generation; it provides at least a modestly greater \ndegree of trust in our professional educators and in our elected school \nboard members with respect to how to spend that education money; it \ndeals generously with our need for health research; and it is a part of \na pattern that will continue the 1-year precedent of balancing the \nbudget without invading the Social Security trust fund, without \nbreaking the promises we have made not only to those who are retired \ntoday but those who are working today but will depend on Social \nSecurity in the future, that the money they pay into Social Security is \nfor that purpose and that purpose only. For that reason, I highly \ncommend this bill to the Senate of the United States and hope it is \npassed and approved by the President of the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13524-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13524-S13525]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PHONE BILL FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, yesterday, I introduced the Phone \nBill Fairness Act. Consumers across this country have to deal on a \nregular basis with telephone bills, and one thing they do understand is \nthat telephone bills are very complicated and frustrating. But what \nthey may not know is that telephone bills are, to them, more than just \nan annoyance--they may be costing them quite a lot of money. I want to \naddress that issue very briefly.\n  When the average consumer receives their phone bill, they don't get a \nsheet of paper; they get dozens of pages, with very small type, filled \nwith confusing acronyms, complicated payment schemes, and sometimes \neven services they have not signed up for at all but for which they are \nbeing asked to pay. I imagine most consumers not only don't understand \neverything they have received, but after reading a few pages into their \nbill--if they do that--they give up and just hope, so-to-speak, they \nare getting what they want.\n  Now, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was based on the idea \ncompetition and market forces would lead to lower prices and better \nservice. We have begun to see the benefits of that act in certain \nrespects. New companies and newly competitive incumbents have begun to \nreduce rates and offer innovative new services. That is to the good. \nThe main beneficiaries of these improvements, however, have been \nbusiness consumers. They have the expertise to analyze the \nbewilderingly complicated telecommunications market and to find out \nwhat are the best deals for them. That is exactly what they wanted \nbecause they have the size and scope to figure out what is going on and \nproceed to do what is in their best interest.\n  But your average phone user does not have a team of lawyers or \naccountants who can pour over his or her phone bill to determine the \nplan or the company that will save them the most money, which is what \ncompetition is about; thus, they cannot use the market system to their \nfinancial advantage. Unfortunately, phone bills become so complicated, \nand the array of services and phone plans so bewildering, that it \nreally does take lawyers and accountants to understand and maximize the \nbenefits that are intended.\n  So, on the one hand, the Telecommunications Act is working because it \nhas created the opportunity for consumers to get lower rates and better \nservice, but it is not working because it requires consumers to walk \nthrough a complicated and highly uncertain maze to finally get to that \nopportunity.\n  Once simple choices about telephone service have become so \ncomplicated that even the Chairman of the FCC, Bill Kennard, who was \nour foremost expert on telecommunications matters, himself has \nexpressed frustration over reading his own phone bill, I think we have \nsomething we need to consider.\n  We may not be able to reduce the complicated nature of \ntelecommunications competition, but at the very least we can provide \nresidential consumers with a roadmap that leads\n\n[[Page S13525]]\n\nthem through the maze of telecommunications. We must give consumers \nhelp, guidance, and be helpful to them in making sure they can \nunderstand their telephone bills and the options they have in telephone \nservice so they can take advantage of the benefits of competition in \nthe telecommunications world, just as businesses can do on a very \nregular basis.\n  Therefore, the Phone Bill Fairness Act tries to do this by the \nfollowing:\n  First, we require all telephone companies to accurately describe \ncharges that appear on bills. No one should be able to misidentify so-\ncalled line items, especially by claiming they are ``federally \nmandated'' when they are not federally mandated.\n  Secondly, our bill would require all telephone companies to tell \ntheir customers exactly what their average per-minute rate is for a \nmonth, so they can compare it to the rates of other companies. Is that \nso strange? Not at all. When a customer goes to a supermarket, they can \nlook at unit prices for groceries and, thus, they can shop and compare. \nThat allows them to buy what is best for them in terms of what they \nwant, in terms of price and quality, and that is competition. Why can't \nwe do this for telephone customers? The answer is, of course, we can.\n  Thirdly, we would require that all telephone companies inform \ncustomers of their calling patterns in an understandable way. If \ncustomers know what they are paying and know what types of calls are \nmost frequent, they will then be able to compare all of the different \ncompany plans and find the one that is right for them. Again, the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 was about competition. This bill is \nabout competition.\n  Finally, the bill gives the Federal Communications Commission and the \nFederal Trade Commission the power to explore how to make phone bills \neasier to read so that we don't do it here in Congress, and to \ndetermine whether any telephone companies are committing fraud in their \nbilling practices. I don't mean to suggest this is the common practice, \nbut there are some small phone companies that do something called \n``slamming,'' and that is fraud. They charge people for things they \nhave not, in fact, signed up for. That is fraud. The best defense \nagainst fraud is an informed consumer. Consumers cannot be well-\ninformed if they do not understand their phone bills. So this is all \nfairly logical and straightforward and, I think, in the interest of the \nTelecommunications Act and, more important, of the American people.\n  Consumers are terribly frustrated with how confusing phone bills are \ntoday. When consumers get frustrated, they assume the worst. I believe \nwe have an obligation to try to do something about all of this, and I \nbelieve we can. I still very much believe in the Telecommunications \nAct. I voted for it and participated in shaping it. I believe in the \nbenefits of competition, but we need to make sure the benefits of \ncompetition reach everybody in the country--business consumers, \nresidential consumers, and everybody. The first step to achieving this \ngoal is making sure every consumer not only has the opportunity to get \nbetter rates and services but that they also have the knowledge and the \npower to actually get what they want at the lowest price.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the President's \nnew proposal entitled the Strengthen Social Security and Medicare Act \nof 1999.\n  I send it to the desk.\n  It lays out steps we need to take to protect Social Security and \nMedicare for future generations. It has a number of key provisions that \nI will enumerate.\n  I look forward to the time in the not too distant future when I will \ncome back with a number of our colleagues to talk at greater length \nabout the importance of this bill and what it includes. It devotes the \nentire Social Security surplus to debt reduction. That is one of the \nmost important features of the bill.\n  We recognize how critical it is that we ensure the viability of the \ntrust fund for as long as we can. We also recognize it isn't mutually \nexclusive to want to extend the viability of the trust fund and pay off \nthe public debt at the same time.\n  Therefore, what this legislation will do is first pay off all of the \npublic debt. It will eliminate the publicly held debt by the year 2015, \nreducing the debt by $3.1 trillion over the next 15 years.\n  It then devotes the entire savings, which otherwise would have been \nspent on the interest on that debt, to the Social Security trust funds. \nThe real savings generated in the year 2011 alone, according to the \nOffice of Management and Budget, will be $107 billion.\n  This is a remarkable bill and one of which I am very excited to \nintroduce. First, we pay off the debt; second, we dedicate to Social \nSecurity the interest that would otherwise have been going to pay \ninterest on the debt. We not only have eliminated the public debt, we \nhave lengthened the viability of the trust fund.\n  The President's plan extends the life of the trust fund in this \nmanner by almost 20 additional years, to the year 2050. This extension \nof solvency is not conjecture. It is not something we wish will happen \nunder this plan. Independent Social Security actuaries have confirmed \nthis plan extends the solvency of the Social Security trust fund until \nthe year 2050.\n  What a remarkable accomplishment. First, we will have paid off the \npublicly held debt; second, we will have extended solvency by 16 years.\n  We also do something else with this legislation. Obviously, it is \nimportant to extend solvency. But if the program is not reformed, we \nhave not done enough. There are things we can do to strengthen and \nmodernize another aspect of the entire retirement infrastructure we \nhave in place today. That infrastructure has three legs: Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and private insurance, or retirement plans.\n  We will address private retirement issues in other legislation.\n  This bill addresses the two main governmental pillars of Social \nSecurity retirement: Social Security and Medicare.\n  It creates a real lockbox to further protect the trust funds both for \nSocial Security and Medicare by extending the budget enforcement rules, \nincluding pay-as-you-go budget requirements from here on out.\n  There have been a number of debates on the Senate floor, and we \ntalked in recent weeks about whether or not we are ever going to enact \na lockbox. Unfortunately, the majority leader has chosen to fill the \namendment tree--that is to preclude Democratic amendments in the debate \non the lockbox; that has precluded our ability entirely to offer an \namendment which says we ought not only lock up the Social Security \ntrust fund, we ought to lock up the Medicare trust fund, too, because \nit, too, is a trust fund upon which our seniors depend.\n  This legislation includes a long-supported lockbox, but it also \ncontains no trap door. The Republican version contained a trap door \nthat allowed Social Security surpluses to be used for any purpose, \nincluding tax cuts, that could be labeled as Social Security reform.\n  There it is. In addition to ensuring we pay down the debt, in \naddition to ensuring we provide for 16 additional years of solvency, \nthis bill provides a real lockbox without a trap door for Social \nSecurity and for Medicare.\n  I think it is important we set the record straight when it comes to \nthis proposal. This has been the product of an extraordinary amount of \nwork within the White House, within the administration, working with \nDemocrats in Congress.\n  Republicans claim they have found religion when it comes to Social \nSecurity. The CBO clarified what is happening right now on Social \nSecurity with the letter provided yesterday. They said if the budget \nand the appropriations bills pass as are now contemplated and as are \nnow drafted, we\n\n[[Page S13526]]\n\nwill be using $17.1 billion of Social Security trust funds. Those \naren't our words; those are the words of the Congressional Budget \nOffice. They said if we were going to offset the need to use Social \nSecurity trust funds, we would have to cut across the board 4.8 percent \nto accommodate the increases in investments and spending across the \nboard in the 13 appropriations bills.\n  There shouldn't be any doubt about who it is that is drawing down the \nSocial Security trust fund this year before we even have a lockbox, \nbefore we even have real Social Security and Medicare reform. That is \nwhy this legislation is necessary. We have a rare opportunity to extend \nthe life and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, to pay off \nthe publicly held debt in 15 years, and to provide meaningful reform to \nboth Social Security and Medicare in a way that will absolutely \nguarantee that baby boomers, when they retire, will be able to count on \nSocial Security and on Medicare in a debt-free country.\n  It doesn't get much better than that as a goal, as a set of \nproposals. I am hopeful in this Congress before the adjournment date \nnext session this legislation will become the focus of a good debate. \nThis legislation will be not only considered but given an opportunity \nfor a good vote, an opportunity for careful consideration. Let it be \namended if it be the will of the Senate, but let's debate it. Let's get \non with it. Let's commit it to law. Let's send a clear message to the \nAmerican people, we as Republicans and Democrats, and support \neliminating the public debt. We support extending the solvency and the \nviability of both the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. We can \ndo that with the bill we are introducing today, and I hope it is done.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the assistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. I listened intently to the leader's statement. I ask the \nleader if it is somewhat startling, amusing--whatever word we want to \nuse--that the majority, the Republicans, did not support Social \nSecurity when it was adopted in the 1930s; the Senator is aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is correct. To my knowledge, it \nwas not supported by Republicans--I don't know if I am in a position to \nsay unanimously, but overwhelmingly.\n  Mr. REID. We do know they filed in this body the motion to recommit, \nsaying they wanted to get rid of it once and for all.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. It is also true when Medicare was adopted, that was a \nDemocratic program. There was some support from the Republicans, but \nnot very much?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is also aware in recent years, under the \nleadership of Newt Gingrich, the House Republican leadership spoke out \nin opposition to Medicare and Social Security? Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator from Nevada is correct. I think the words \nwere, ``We want to see it wither on the vine.''\n  Mr. REID. And the present majority leader of the House said he \nthought Social Security was a ``rotten idea.'' Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is how he has been quoted. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I further say it was just a few years ago when the Senator \nfrom South Dakota joined a number of us on the floor in opposing a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget which used Social \nSecurity surpluses to balance that budget. Is the Senator aware of \nthat?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is right. In fact, he was a very important \npart of that whole effort.\n  Mr. REID. In short, I say to the Senator, and I think the Senator \nwould agree, it is great, now that the Republicans, the majority, who \nhave been opposed to Social Security, opposed to Medicare in years gone \nby, suddenly, in effect, have found religion and now they want to do \nsomething to support Medicare and to extend the solvency of Social \nSecurity; isn't it good?\n  I know you would agree with that. But I say to the Senator from South \nDakota, I think it is important that you, in effect, have challenged \nthem to come forward in a bipartisan fashion to debate these proposals \nthe Senator has outlined for the good of the country, to extend Social \nSecurity and preserve Medicare. Is that, in effect, what the Senator is \nsaying?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is exactly what I am saying. I think it is \nimportant for us to depoliticize the issue to ensure we find ways to \naddress meaningful reform that will pass and will be signed into law.\n  I am concerned. The Senator from Nevada mentioned ``getting \nreligion.'' I am concerned that, while it is important to have \nreligion, it is important to follow the practices of religion--if this \nis how we are going to characterize this new-found sensitivity to \nSocial Security and Medicare--the facts do not comport with the current \nexpressions of devotion to Social Security. The facts are, the \nRepublican budget raids the Social Security trust fund by $17 billion, \nas was indicated, again, yesterday in the letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  The facts indicate that there is a trap door in the lockbox proposed \nby Republicans that would actually allow any proposal to draw on the \nSocial Security surplus, so long as you call it Social Security reform. \nYou could call a tax cut Social Security reform, and it would qualify \nunder the lockbox proposal made by our Republican colleagues. Call it \nreform and it opens the lockbox. That is the key.\n\n  We used to have skeleton keys when I was young. The Republican \nlockbox has a skeleton key that would fit in any door. We need to get \nrid of these skeleton keys. We need to get on with real lockbox reform. \nWe need to lock up Medicare as well; we need to make sure we are not \ngoing to use the $17 billion of trust fund money currently included in \nthis budget. We need to do that and that is what this proposal will do \ntoday.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for one brief question, based on the \nstatement the Senator just made?\n  We had, yesterday, a number of Senators from the minority making the \ncase we were unable to bring matters to the floor--Patients' Bill of \nRights, minimum wage--all the things we have talked about in the last \nseveral months and have not had the opportunity to, in effect, debate. \nThe junior Senator from Illinois came forward and said he thought it \nwas too bad the minority would not allow a vote on the lockbox.\n  I say to the Democratic leader, isn't it true that we were happy to \nhave a vote on the lockbox; all we wanted was to have our lockbox and \ntheir lockbox and vote on both of them? Isn't that what it was all \nabout?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator makes a very important point for the record, \nand we ought to make it daily. They are turning facts on their head. \nThe accusation is the Democrats won't allow a vote on the lockbox. What \nis really true is we are not allowed a vote on our own amendment when \nit comes to the lockbox. Our view is, it is important if we are going \nto have a debate on the lockbox that we all have the opportunity to \noffer amendments. You cannot have a meaningful debate without a \nmeaningful opportunity to offer amendments. That is all we are \nprotesting. Certainly, the Republican majority can understand that.\n  Mr. REID. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13526-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13526-S13529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY SECURITY TAX ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, for the last 2 years I have been working \nclosely with a number of my colleagues to develop a package of tax \nincentives to foster domestic energy alternatives and thus help reduce \nour growing dependence on imported oil. Along with those colleagues, I \nam pleased today to introduce the Energy Security Tax Act of 1999, and \nI am hopeful that Congress will enact this legislation in the near \nfuture.\n  Despite periodic efforts by Congress to address this problem, since \nthe oil price shocks of the 1970s, we have seen our dependence on \nforeign oil continue to grow. Today, our Nation's energy supply is more \nvulnerable than ever to events taking place in countries far from our \nshores. Solving this problem will require the collective efforts of all \nour Nation's energy producers.\n  The legislation we have developed is correspondingly ambitious in its \nscope.\n\n[[Page S13527]]\n\nIt encompasses a broad range of technologies, representing the diverse \nregions and resources of the country. Farmers will benefit from the \nprovisions modifying the existing tax incentive for small ethanol \nproducers, so that farmer-owned cooperatives can utilize it, and by the \nestablishment of tax credits for efficient irrigation equipment, \nconservation tillage expenses, and anaerobic digesters that convert \nmanure and crop waste into useful gas. The legislation will encourage \nthe development of biomass-based electric power industries, which will \nprovide a market for wide range of biomass, including switchgrass, \ncrops and crop residues, and wood waste.\n  We are proposing to extend the wind energy tax credit, so that we can \nmore fully develop the wind power potential of States from California \nto the Dakotas to New England. Coal miners from West Virginia to \nMontana will benefit as a result of the tax incentives for repowering \nor replacing older coal-fired power plants with more efficient \ntechnology. Steelmakers will become more competitive through the use of \ntax incentives for more energy-efficient processes and for the \nproduction of energy from cogeneration. Hawaiian ethanol producers will \nbe encouraged to utilize bagasse--a sugar cane residue--thereby \nconverting a potential waste into a useful fuel.\n  Oil and gas producers in States like New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma \nwill benefit from incentives for greater domestic production. Business \nowners will be able to use the new incentives to make investments in \nenergy-efficient property, thereby reducing energy costs and improving \ncompetitiveness. Homeowners throughout the country will benefit from \nnew incentives designed to encourage the installation of renewable and \nmore efficient energy technologies, and by the construction of energy-\nefficient homes. Americans from all parts of the nation will be \nencouraged to use environmentally friendly electric and hybrid \nvehicles.\n  There is an old saying: The time to fix the roof is when the sun is \nshining. While we are fortunate now to have adequate supplies of oil, \nour dependence on foreign nations continues to grow. It is incumbent on \nU.S. policymakers today to recognize the risks associated with this \ntrend and to prepare the nation for a more secure future. As part of \nthat effort, we should take the first opportunity that presents itself \nto enact the tax policies necessary to encourage the development of a \nmore diverse and robust domestic energy portfolio, one that will reduce \nour vulnerability to future oil price shocks and supply shortages. This \neffort not only will result in greater energy security, it will reduce \nour balance-of-trade deficit, create domestic jobs, improve air \nquality, and help limit the emission of greenhouse gases.\n  I hope that all of my colleagues will consider cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation and will support its timely enactment.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I join with the distinguished Democratic \nleader and other colleagues in cosponsoring the Energy Security Tax Act \nof 1999.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for his leadership in crafting this targeted \ntax proposal that offers incentives for the more efficient use of a \nbroad range of energy sources vital to the American economy. This \ntargeted proposal has a multiplicity of economic and environmental \nbenefits.\n  I have long been an advocate of programs that encourage the more \nefficient use of energy. This proposal does exactly that. The United \nStates is a highly energy-intensive nation, and it depends heavily on \nenergy for manufacturing, communications, transportation, and many \nother purposes. While the United States is currently enjoying the \nbenefits of an expanding economy, that economy demands even more \nenergy. The United States has already invested heavily in the research \nand development of many innovative clean and efficient technologies \nthat will allow our Nation to help meet these demands, and we must \ncontinue exploring these opportunities.\n  This bill provides key incentives to demonstrate and to deploy these \ntechnologies, including clean coal technologies, a program that I have \nlong supported. Now that we are at the threshold of a new millennium \nthat begins the year after next--not next year; next year completes the \ncurrent second millennium. Next year completes the 20th century. It is \nnot the beginning of the 21st. So much for that.\n  Now that we are at the threshold, just a little over a year away, of \na new millennium, Congress can and Congress should help to prepare a \npathway for the new era of energy and resource use. New technologies \nshould be part of that path. For example, with the use of clean coal \ntechnologies, it remains economically feasible to produce electricity \nin coal-fired powerplants while also improving environmental quality.\n  By demonstrating and deploying these technologies, coal continues to \nbe a viable ``cleaner and greener'' fuel for power generation. Clean \ncoal technologies are American-made technologies that provide a variety \nof positive benefits for the U.S. as well as other developing nations \nwith large coal reserves.\n  Coal currently provides the energy to generate more than fifty \npercent of the electricity consumed in the U.S. The Energy Information \nAdministration, an arm of the Department of Energy (DOE), projects that \ncoal will continue to provide our nation with the energy needed to \ngenerate more than one-half of its electricity needs in 2020. Equally \nas important, the International Energy Agency has projected that coal \nwill provide forty-six percent of the world's electricity in 2020. \nSignificant growth in coal use to generate electricity is expected to \ntake place in developing countries like China and India. The challenge \nassociated with the continued use of coal, the nation's most cost \ncompetitive and abundant energy resource, is to preserve our nation's \nenergy security while also meeting important environmental goals. There \nhas to be a balance. Also, the opportunity exists to use better, more \nadvanced technologies in those developing countries that will \nexperience increases in the use of coal.\n  The current Clean Coal Technology Program has demonstrated a number \nof first-of-a-kind technologies that increase efficiency and reduce \ngreenhouse gases and other emissions from coal combustion. As a result, \na number of emerging clean coal technologies are ready to be deployed \ncommercially. However, full commercial penetration first requires \nconstructing and operating several early commercial-scale applications. \nIn order to install these early commercial applications, all \nstakeholders including the designer, manufacturer, financier, and owner \nwill have to face both the technological and economic risk associated \nwith the ``not yet fully commercial'' technology.\n  Development of these early commercial clean coal technology \napplications will require a new program of limited tax and financial \nincentives to overcome the associated technological and economic risks \nthat will complement continued research and development (R) funding. \nThe required R funding has come under the DOE's Fossil Energy \nProgram. The associated tax and financial incentives program proposed \nhere would be limited in scope and timing and the proposed technologies \nwould be required to meet ever-increasing performance levels to qualify \nfor the tax incentives. The U.S. tax code would be amended to provide \nfor: (1) a ten percent investment tax credit; and (2) a production tax \ncredit. In addition, annual appropriations would be provided for a risk \npool to offset costs, if any, for modifications resulting from the \ntechnology's need to reassess its design performance during start-up \nand initial operation.\n  Mr. President, another section of this bill provides tax incentives \nto encourage newer, more innovative steelmaking technologies. Although \nthreatened by a flood of cheap, even illegal, foreign steel imports, \nthe U.S. steel industry still employs some 160,000 workers and forms an \nimportant element in overall U.S. industrial strength. It is in the \nU.S. national and security interests, I believe, to ensure that U.S. \nsteelmakers have the ability and encouragement to remain energy \nefficient, environmentally sound, and economically healthy.\n  By continuing to make investments in the steel industry through tax \nincentives, we will be helping to preserve high-paying manufacturing \njobs in the United States. Of course the obvious other benefit is its \neffect on our environment and the preservation of our\n\n[[Page S13528]]\n\nnatural resources. The steelmaking provisions would provide incentives \nfor investment in cutting-edge steelmaking technologies and allow the \nsteel industry to work with other sectors in the production of more \nefficient energy through co-generation.\n  In conclusion, I strongly support this targeted tax incentive \npackage. This legislation embraces the belief that the U.S. is a leader \nin developing energy efficient technologies as well as stressing the \nimportance of fuel diversity. I support the adoption of these tax \nincentives, which demonstrate that economic growth and environmental \nprotection can go hand-in-hand.\n  Again, I thank the distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. REID. May I ask the Senator a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that about 12 or 15 miles outside \nReno, NV, the newest generation facility in Nevada is clean coal \ntechnology?\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I am certainly aware of it now. I am heartened by \nthis information.\n  Mr. REID. The only reason I mention that to the Senator from West \nVirginia is that these things actually happen. Clean coal technology \nactually exists, and it exists in a place such as Nevada.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. I thank the distinguished Senator. I am proud to say I \nhave been fighting this fight for clean coal technology now for years. \nI was in the position to do it during the time I was the Senate \nDemocratic leader. It may have been back when I was the whip. I was \nable to put money in appropriations bills for clean coal technology. I \nalso thank the distinguished Democratic leader for his kindness and \ncourtesy in allowing me to introduce this bill. I thank him for his \ndrafting of the legislation, and I thank him for his leadership. I \nthank him for allowing me to be a cosponsor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me begin by complimenting the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia for his eloquence and his \nstatement and for his willingness to take the leadership and to provide \nhis name on this legislation. I can think of no one I would rather have \nin support of legislation of this kind than the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  As has been noted, he is ``the'' leader, not just ``a'' leader, on \ncoal and on clean coal technology. No one has committed more time, \neffort, and leadership to the issue than he has. So it was with that \nappreciation that I asked the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nabout his willingness to honor me as he did this afternoon.\n  It troubles me, as I know it does him, that this country continues to \ndepend on foreign sources for energy to a far greater degree than it is \nin our Nation's best interest. If we are ever going to deal with that \nreal dilemma, it seems to me we have to continue to find ways in which \nto utilize more effectively our own resources. That has been the \nargument made so passionately and so ably by the Senator from West \nVirginia now for so long.\n  This legislation would allow us to move closer to the goal that one \nday we can be more energy self-sufficient, and that we can do so with \nthe recognition of the importance of the environment. It combines two \nnational goals: a clean environment and energy independent. I am \nhopeful we can see careful consideration of this legislation, and other \nideas that we offer in good faith with the expectation that the Senate \nrecognize the importance of these goals and this contribution to those \ngoals.\n  Again, let me thank the distinguished Senator for his kindness, for \nhis leadership, and for the commitment he has made with this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished minority leader \nyield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator.\n  Clean coal technology also provides a very important key to the \nproblem of global warming. I hope that we can interest other countries, \nsuch as China. China is in the process of constructing many new \npowerplants. They are new in the sense that they are newly constructed. \nBut they are old in the sense that they use the old technology, if I \nmay use that word. They depend on the burning of coal in ways that \ncontribute to the deterioration of the environment.\n  I hope these countries such as China and Brazil and India will join \nwith the developed countries of the world in the attempt to do \nsomething about global warming.\n  I have lived a long time--82 years, Saturday 3 weeks from tomorrow. \nAnd I have seen changes in climate. I don't know much about the science \nand global warming, but I know that I have seen changes in the climate. \nWhen I was a young man, when I was a man in my middle ages, I never saw \nstorms of the frequency and the intensity, floods and droughts that we \nare seeing today, and seemingly increasingly. There is something going \non out there.\n  As I say, I am not a scientist. But there is something going on, and \nI am concerned about it. But whatever it is, whatever the part may be \nthat it is manmade, can be limited considerably if the developing \ncountries would utilize the technologies that our country through its \nresearch and demonstration projects, through the millions--yea, \nbillions--of dollars that this country has spent on research, if those \ncountries would utilize these technologies in the building of their \npowerplants, they would diminish the emissions of carbon dioxide and \nthe other gases that I think are having some considerable impact upon \nclimate worldwide.\n  I congratulate the leader for this legislation. I hope that we can \ncontinue to do research on clean coal technology. I hope, as I say, \nwhen countries meet in various places, such as Bonn and Buenos Aires, \nto discuss global warming, that they will somehow be able to persuade \nthe developing countries in the world to use our technology, because \nwhile we are plugging the holes in the front of the boat that we have \nhelped to create through two world wars--by defeating Hitler, and the \nGerman Kaiser, and others in the interest of the freedoms that these \ndeveloping countries enjoy to some extent--I hope that the developing \ncountries would not be in the back of the boat drilling more holes, and \nthus increasing emissions which affect all of us. It is not a boat only \npart of which will sink. The entire boat will sink.\n\n  We need the cooperation of the developing countries. We can help them \nthrough clean coal technology and other technologies.\n  I thank the distinguished leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia \nfor his very important additional comments.\n  We talk a lot about globalization, a globalized economy. We have a \nglobalized diplomatic infrastructure today due to the fact the cold war \nended. We have had a globalized environment from the very first day of \ncreation. A globalized environment means that what happens in China, \nwhat happens in Asia, what happens in Europe, or Africa, or Latin \nAmerica, has an effect on what happens here, and vice versa.\n  The Senator from West Virginia makes a very important point. If we \nare, indeed, globalized, then it seems to me that we ought to share our \ntechnology with those countries that may be contributing both favorably \nand unfavorably to that globalized environment. We ought to provide \nleadership. They ought to recognize the importance of involvement. He \nhas made that point for some time. I have heard some of his excellent \nspeeches to that effect on the Senate floor.\n  Let us hope we can continue to make progress, and let us hope that \nmaybe this legislation will help us do so even more successfully.\n  Again, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me join a chorus thanking Senator Byrd and Senator Daschle for \ntheir leadership. Illinois has a history of being a great coal-\nproducing State. Environmental standards have changed, and I hope we \ncan find ways to develop technology so that this almost infinite energy \nresource can be tapped that now sits in the ground. Many unemployed \ncoal miners drive over it every day asking policy leaders in Washington \nwhat they are doing. The legislation Senator Byrd is proposing is a \nstep in the direction of finding new technology to use this domestic \nenergy resource to create jobs in\n\n[[Page S13529]]\n\nAmerica, to be responsible to the environment, and to lessen our \ndependence on foreign fuel.\n  As always, I salute Senator Byrd for his leadership on this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator from Arkansas allow me to proceed briefly \nwith a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Certainly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13529-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13529-S13530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I call for regular order with regard to the trade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the pending business.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 434) to authorize a new trade and investment \n     policy for sub-Sahara Africa.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, having witnessed the vote earlier today, I \nam very concerned about our ability to complete action on the African \nand Caribbean Basin Initiative free trade legislation. This is \nimportant legislation. I believe it is good for the United States. It \nwill be good for Central America, the Caribbean, and Africa. This bill \nis supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle and by the \nPresident.\n  I understand that maybe some Senator or Senators have gotten the \nidea, since we did not get cloture today, that was the end of it and \nthis bill would just be set aside permanently. We are still very \nhopeful we can find a way to get this job done. We have a problem in \nthat it takes a lot of time to get through the cloture motions and \ncomplete it, but I have not given up yet.\n  I am going to file cloture on the pending substitute, and if cloture \nis not invoked on Tuesday, we will have to move on to other issues. I \nemphasize I am filing two cloture motions, so we can hopefully get \ncloture on the substitute and on the bill itself and allow us to get to \nthe substance, have amendments that are important, and bring it to a \nconclusion.\n  As a part of all this, I emphasize that Senator Daschle and I are \nworking on an apparently unrelated issue but one that is related in \nfact, and that is an agreement as to how we can handle the bankruptcy \nbill and allow amendments, amendments that relate to bankruptcy, the \ncredit cards issue, but also would have a number of agreed-to, \nnonrelevant amendments that would be in order.\n  I hope we can get that worked out. We are getting very close. That \nwould relieve some of the pressure in opposition, and if we can get \nboth bills done, it will be a monumental achievement, if we can go out \nthis session having done the free trade bill for the Caribbean Basin \nInitiative and Africa and a bankruptcy bill that allows votes on which \nthe Senate has indicated it wants to vote.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the pending \nsubstitute to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 215, H.R. 434, an act to authorize \n     a new trade and investment policy for sub-Sahara Africa:\n         Trent Lott, Bill Roth, Mike DeWine, Rod Grams, Mitch \n           McConnell, Judd Gregg, Larry E.

The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. \n     215, H.R. 434, an act to authorize a new trade and investment \n     policy for sub-Sahara Africa:\n         Trent Lott, Bill Roth, Mike DeWine, Rod Grams, Mitch \n           McConnell, Judd Gregg, Larry E.

Mr. President, these cloture votes will occur on Tuesday, \nNovember 2. I will notify Members of the exact time after I have had an \nopportunity to consult with the Democratic leader about the appropriate \ntime for that.\n  In the meantime, I ask unanimous consent that both quorums which are \nmandatory under rule XXII be waived and the previously scheduled vote \nregarding the D.C./Labor-HHS legislation occur notwithstanding rule \nXXII.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I may \nask the majority leader, he is announcing there will not be any votes \non Monday; is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. If we get these agreements worked out and in order to \naccommodate the time that has been requested for the D.C./Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill, then there will not be any recorded votes on \nMonday. The next recorded vote will be, I presume, at 10 o'clock on \nTuesday, which is the D.C./Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill, and \nthen hopefully sometime in short order after that, we go to votes on \nthe two cloture motions.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I may further reserve the right to \nobject--and I will not object, obviously--I wonder if the majority \nleader is able to tell me something at this time? I have given him a \nproposal on bankruptcy--we have cleared it on our side--having to do \nwith the nonrelevant amendments and then the clarification of relevant \namendments to the bankruptcy bill. Has the majority leader been able to \ndetermine whether that is acceptable and whether he has been able to \nclear it on his side?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe it is going to be acceptable. I have not cleared \nit completely on our side. I just had an opportunity to read over it in \nthe form on which our staffs worked. I see a couple of little problems \nthat are really clerical in terms of how the three amendments would be \nhandled. The way I read it, it looks as if there could be as many as 12 \namendments, but really what we are talking about is 3 and 3, side by \nside. Once that is clarified, unless there is something else I see that \nis a problem, I think we can get this done.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. So the majority leader is saying there would be three \nRepublican nonrelevant amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Has the Republican caucus made that decision as to what \nare the relevant amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. Obviously, I have to know what the three are on the other \nside. I know one would have to do with education, one of them would be \nthe counterpart to minimum wage, and I am not now sure of the third \none. Obviously, before we do get a final agreement on this, we will get \nthat information to you. If there is a problem, obviously, we will have \nto work through that. I do not think it will be a problem. We will \ndefinitely get that to you; hopefully this afternoon, if the Senator is \ngoing to be around a little while. We are working on it, and I think we \nare very close.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, assuming we then would be in a position \nto get agreement on moving to bankruptcy, would it be the intention of \nthe majority leader to move to bankruptcy on Tuesday?\n  Mr. LOTT. It was my thinking that--I believe the way this is set up--\nwe would complete trade and then we would go to bankruptcy when we \ncomplete the trade bill.\n  We are also hoping we can get some way to consider the nuclear waste \nbill, but it is my plan and my hope--we will have to get agreement, \nobviously, to do all these--to complete the trade bill and do \nbankruptcy and try to do the nuclear waste bill before we go out. \nObviously, we have some hoops through which we have to jump in order to \nachieve that.\n  It is my thinking at this time we will complete the trade bill if we \nget the cloture. We can enter into a UC on bankruptcy before we do \nthat. We will talk to you about that, exactly when\n\n[[Page S13530]]\n\nwe need to do it, and we can go to bankruptcy before we go out. My \nintent would be to go to it next, after consultation with both sides.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the indulgence of the majority leader and \nhis answers to my questions. I have one other question relating to the \ntrade bills.\n  Obviously, we have attempted to discuss how to proceed for some time. \nI have made an offer to the majority leader that he has been kind \nenough to consider; that is, he and I would table amendments that were \nnot relevant to trade but certainly allow for at least a period of time \nso Senators can offer these amendments, with the idea that they will be \ndebated and tabled shortly after the time they are offered, I am \ncertainly prepared to renew that offer to the majority leader. As he \nknows, he has made the situation, again, one which would require a \nprocedural vote on cloture rather than a substantive vote on cloture, \nthereby, again, undermining our ability to finish the bill.\n\n  I wonder if the majority leader has given any more thought to this \nsuggestion that he and I table these amendments and then move to final \npassage on trade, as I think we could have done even this week.\n  Mr. LOTT. In response to his question, I was in the hopes that if we \ncould get agreement on the bankruptcy bill and the unrelated amendments \nthat would be made in order under the agreement, that would help \nresolve the problem.\n  The difficulty is, in going through this process where we would in \nfact both vote to table, first of all, there is a lot of opportunity \nfor mischief in terms of what amendments are offered, objections to \ntime agreements, and how long would it take. That is one thing that \nworries me. If we do not get cloture and we go through a series of \namendments where we have to vote to table them, I worry about the image \nof us voting to table, even if we could explain it procedurally. But if \nyou vote to table fast track or vote to table agricultural sanctions or \nyou vote to table some of these other things, I would prefer that the \nSenate not be recorded as having defeated or tabling some of these \nissues.\n  But the further problem is, if we go through and hold a number of \nthese on this bill, how do we get it done in somewhat of a foreseeable \nperiod of time and then be able to get to bankruptcy? I am also worried \nabout what in fact happens if we move to table or try to table or not \ntable. I think the Senator has been right in saying that is where \nleadership has to weigh in and we have to make sure we get it done.\n  I think one of the issues that would have been the greatest problem \nwould have been minimum wage, but I believe we are going to address the \nminimum wage on bankruptcy, therefore relieving the pressure, the need \nto put it on this particular bill.\n  So that is what we are up against. I have learned around here you \nnever say never. I am just worried about being able to get this job \ndone. Also, I have not been able to clear on our side an arrangement \nthat would go through a repeated number of votes on trade. We have had \nthis discussion privately. I think it is appropriate that we have it \npublicly, too.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, just in further clarification, I am \nwondering--there are really two issues. The majority leader has \nappropriately articulated one of the concerns he has with regard to \nfinishing the bill. Cloture will do that, if cloture is invoked.\n  I am wondering if the majority leader would entertain tearing the \ntree down to allow Senators to offer amendments during the time the \nlegislation is pending, thereby at least giving Senators the right to \noffer amendments, because he would still have the assurance, of course, \nthat the bill--if cloture is invoked--would ripen and would ultimately \nterminate debate, but he then would cease to make the issue a \nprocedural one. Then it would be one upon substance, which I think \nwould be advantageous for both the majority leader and many of us who \nwork with the administration to see this legislation pass.\n  Mr. LOTT. Are you talking about doing it during the period of time \nwhen we may be discussing, as on Monday, the Labor-HHS bill? Are you \ntalking about postcloture? Also, what do we do in terms of getting time \nagreements if the Senator from South Carolina objects to that? Maybe we \nwill just have to--that is a lot of ifs--what if, what if. We will have \nto work through that. It would take a lot of delicacy in trying to get \nit to a conclusion. But that is my concern.\n  Are you talking about trying to do it Monday, or are you talking \nabout trying to do it during the day Tuesday or Wednesday? And how do \nwe, in terms of time--even postcloture, a lot of amendments are in \norder.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The majority leader points out a very important problem. \nIf we invoke cloture, there are many important relevant amendments, \nthat I think he and I would probably both support, that are not going \nto be in order on this legislation. I do not know how we are going to \ndeal with that. I doubt he would be able to get unanimous consent to be \nable to offer it. I know amendments having to do with Africa, in \nparticular, are in peril if cloture is invoked. So we have compounded \nthe problem both from a relevancy point of view as well as from this \nprocedural problem that we are attempting to work through.\n  You asked the question, When would this occur? I guess I am thinking, \nunder the current circumstances, there would not be any time for it to \noccur because the vote on cloture would occur as early as Tuesday \nbecause that is when the cloture motion ripens. I would be willing to \nwork with the majority leader on an acceptable schedule for such \namendments and the filing of cloture were he willing to work to \naccommodate at least some amendments and the opportunity to deal with \nthis relevancy question that I think, regardless of the circumstances, \nhe would deal with.\n  Mr. LOTT. An interesting sidelight, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Postcloture, for instance, there might be some amendments \nwith regard to African trade. I wonder if there might be some way we \ncould get an agreement. I worry about it getting agreed to, because I \nam not sure the Senator from South Carolina would agree to it, where \nsome of those amendments, while they are not germane, would not be in \norder postcloture, they certainly relate to what we are trying to do. I \nwould certainly like to have some way found for amendments such as \nthat, if they exist. I could think of a couple I have heard of that \nought to be offered.\n  I will be glad to work with the Senator to try to find a way to see \nif we can at least do that and get it cleared. But we do have a problem \nwith objections. We can see if we can get it agreed to, and we can try \nto get it agreed to, if we can get something worked out that we can \noffer. Then if it is objected to, we just have to deal with that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I know there are other colleagues who are waiting to do \nother business. I think we might talk more privately about this and \nproceed. But I look forward to working with the majority leader to see \nif we can find a way to deal with it.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If the leader would yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. There was no objection to that last request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was no objection to the last request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do have one more request I know the Senator from Alaska \nis interested in. If the Senator would like to make that request----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

I obviously would like to accommodate \nthem. But I wonder if we could get some idea of who and how many, \nbecause obviously I am prepared to start the debate on the nuclear \nwaste bill and want to accommodate Members.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Reid, if he would like to \ncomment.\n  Mr. REID. I say, through the majority leader, to the Senator from \nAlaska, Senator Durbin wishes to speak for 15 minutes and the Senator \nfrom Arkansas for 5 minutes. That is all we have until we turn to the \nmatter of the Senator from Alaska.\n  I ask the Senator from Alaska, in relation to his opening statement, \ndoes he have any idea how long he is going to take?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no idea, Mr. President, how long the leadership \nwants to go today. But I am prepared to accommodate the interests of \nthe Senate and am also prepared to go at great length. So it might be \nappropriate if we had some indication of how long the leadership wants \nthis matter debated today because I understand we are going to be going \noff of it and then back on it.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond, Mr. President, we do not have a certain \ntime set. I would not want in any way to preclude the Senator from \nusing as much time as he needs.\n  It sounded to me as if you have about 15 minutes on the other side. \nYou could take the time you need, and when that is completed--I see \nSenator Byrd may be here and want to speak, too. So as long as Senators \nare here and wanting to speak, we will continue this afternoon. But if \nI could----\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield to Senator Reid.\n  Mr. REID. I say, through the leader, Senator Byrd is on the floor and \nhe needs 20 minutes, just so the Senator from Alaska would have some \nidea. And I would think Senator Byrd would speak before Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is a good idea.\n  Mr. REID. Although the Senator from Arkansas has agreed to how much \ntime?

Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the people of \nArkansas to express my extreme disappointment, frustration, and \nbewilderment with our ineffectiveness in the manipulation of the \nSenate. Today, I was supposed to be touring the former Eaker Air Force \nBase site in Blytheville, AR, with numerous officials from the National \nPark Service as well as other State and local leaders. This is a \nmeeting we have worked on for months to arrange, understanding there \nmight be legislative business today.\n  The community is united in its effort to have this former military \nbase converted into a Mississippi Valley archeological facility and \nresearch center. The benefits this project will bring to northeastern \nArkansas are enormous, and I had hoped to be there today to again \ndemonstrate my support to the entire community and the Park Service and \nto urge a favorable decision by the Park Service.\n  I also had several other appointments scheduled with various \nconstituents in the State, but I had to cancel all these meetings to be \nhere for scheduled votes. I thought we might vote on key trade \ninitiatives and might even get to an appropriations bill. But these \nvotes are, once again, delayed and may never occur. This is not the \nfirst time I have had to cancel meetings or events on critical issues \nwith large groups of constituents in Arkansas to stay in Washington for \nvotes, votes and work that never happened or were simply procedural or \npartisan. My constituents understand when I have to be in Washington to \nvote, but what they do not understand and what frustrates me is when I \nstay in Washington for votes and work that never occur.\n  I would understand, and would encourage a great deal, if we were \ndelaying debate so Members could travel to Rhode Island to pay tribute \nto our distinguished former colleague, John Chafee, a man whose \npresence in the Senate made this entire body a more respectful and \nenjoyable place, a truly bipartisan, wonderful colleague I enjoyed \nworking with so very much and a great leader, one who I think would be \nproud to see us working to come to conclusion and bring about results \non behalf of the American people. But this is not the case. There is no \nreason we should not be working and voting today.\n  October 29, today, was our target adjournment day. We could be and \nshould be done. We have just voted our third continuing resolution. We \ncould have been working in the Senate to come to conclusion. Five \nspending bills still remain, including funding for education and health \ncare, which I think should have been our very first priority in the \nSenate. It is clear to everyone involved why this mess keeps happening, \nwhy we are not getting anywhere. The majority is trying to override the \ntrue design of the Senate. They are limiting debate. They are refusing \namendments and pulling legislation off the floor to mute the voices of \nthe minority. I have great concern with that.\n  I was elected to this body in November of 1998. I came to serve in \n1999, during a historical situation that caused each of us to research \nand understand what the constitutional responsibilities of this body \nare about, to understand the design of this body. I was a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives. The Senate is called the upper Chamber, the \ndeliberative body, for a very good reason. We are supposed to be above \nall of this. We are not the House.

Mr. President, earlier we were discussing the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. It is a bill that I have taken an \ninterest in as the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee. One of the \nsmaller spending bills, it has now become one of the largest. You might \nwonder what has happened.\n  It turns out that the District of Columbia appropriations bill has \nbecome a vehicle in the closing hours of this session for a lot of \nlegislative attempts at spending. In fact, the largest nondefense \nbudget to be considered by the Congress each year is for the \nDepartments of Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and related \nagencies. It is the largest bill. It passed the Senate in one form a \nfew weeks ago. But the bill in its original form never has passed the \nHouse of Representatives. In fact, they went the entire session \ndebating about whether or not there would be enough money to fund \ncritical programs for education and health. The House could not muster \na majority to pass that bill during its regular session. It had to wait \nfor a conference committee which involved the District of Columbia to \nfinally bring it to the floor just a few hours ago where it passed with \na very close vote. It now is headed to the President's desk for his \nconsideration after we vote on Tuesday. It is my guess that the \nrollcall will be by and large a partisan rollcall, but that the bill \nwill pass the Senate and head down to the White House.\n  It is also fairly certain that bill will be vetoed by the President. \nIn fact, the D.C. appropriations bill, as I mentioned earlier, has \nbought a ticket on the Titanic. This bill is going to sink, as it \nshould, and let me tell you why it should.\n  I can't understand why we wait until the closing days of the session \nto address the issue of education. It is the last priority in Federal \nspending from the congressional perspective. It is the first priority \nof every American family. We just don't get it. We don't connect with \npeople who time and time again, when asked in opinion polls for the \nmajor concern we face as a nation, identify education.\n\n  Yet in this congressional session it is an afterthought. We have done \neverything else; now let's look at education. I don't think the \nAmerican people expect that kind of conduct from Congress. They don't \nexpect Members in the closing hours of any session to finally get \naround to talking about schools, kids, and education. That is exactly \nwhat we have done.\n  This bill, which the President should veto and send back to Congress \nto work on more, guts the class size reduction initiative, an \ninitiative which allows hiring more than 100,000 teachers nationwide so \nthat first and second grade classrooms have fewer kids. Every teacher \nand parent knows the wisdom of that decision. Yet the Republican \nmajority resists. They voted for it last year; now they don't want it.\n  They ought to come to Wheaton, IL, and the schools I visited there. \nThis is considered to be a fairly conservative area politically. They \nare for the President's initiative. They have seen it work. Why this \nbill wants to kill that initiative, I don't know. They are not \nlistening to teachers or parents when the Republican majority insists \non that. The Republican bill funds 3,400 fewer afterschool centers. \nAlmost a million kids in America are denied afterschool programs, a \nmillion who would have received it if the President's request had gone \nthrough. The kids will be out of school at 3 in the afternoon with \nlittle or no adult supervision and nothing constructive to do. The \nRepublican majority says that's fine; that is the way it has to be. I \ndon't think so. I think our vision of America should be broader. We \nknow kids going home to an empty house or hanging around a mall or \nstreet corner are not engaging themselves in learning. I think the \nPresident's proposal was far better.\n  There are many other areas of concern, including denying title I \nreading and math teachers. Think about that. At a time when we need \nmore scientists and computer engineers, we are going to eliminate 5,400 \ntitle I teachers who would have been included in the President's budget \nto teach reading and mathematics. Cut reading instruction for 100,000 \nkids, and they fall behind in their classes.\n  Is this the kind of bill we want to kick off the new century? Does \nthis define our priority in education? I think not. I think it is a bad \npolitical decision. I hope the President wastes no time in vetoing it \nand sending it back to the Republican majority to address.\n  The worst part of the bill, if that isn't bad enough, has to do with \nmedical research. Every administration tries in some way, shape, or \nform to find something to do legally with the budget which will allow \nthem to get away from some tough decisions. Democrats have done it; the \nRepublicans have done it. What we have done with the National \nInstitutes of Health is tragic. The National Institutes of Health--and \nI am sure most Americans are familiar with that name--is the agency we \nassign the responsibility of finding cures for the diseases that plague \nAmericans and people across the world.\n  When one of my former colleagues in the House of Representatives, \nBill Natcher of Kentucky, who passed away several years ago, used to \nbring this bill to the floor, he would say: This is the people's bill, \nthe one that everyone can identify with because we are all interested \nin schools, education, and safety in the workplace.\n  The people's bill isn't being treated very well when it comes to \nmedical research. I had a chance to look at comments made in the House \nof Representatives during this debate by my friend and former \ncolleague, Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco, CA. I think she \nhit the nail on the head when she said our former Speaker, Tip O'Neill, \nsaid all politics is local. But in this bill all politics is personal. \nIt is as personal as the woman with breast cancer, the man with \nprostate cancer, or people with AIDS who look to us for hope.\n\n  As a Senator, one of the more emotional things I have to go through \neach year is a visit from different groups interested in the National \nInstitutes of Health funding. They come to me in desperation. They are \nthe mothers and fathers of children with juvenile diabetes; they are \nthe mothers and fathers of autistic children; they are people who are \nsuffering from cancer and heart disease and rare diseases with names \nthat one might never have heard. They say: Senator, do something; make \nsure the National Institutes of Health have the money they need to look \ninto medical research to save our children's lives and to give them \nsome hope.\n  That is a tough responsibility for anyone to face. Doctors face it \nevery day, but politicians and Senators face it rarely. When we do, it \nis not a comfortable situation. I always assure them I will do \neverything I can, I will pass every bill I can to put money in medical \nresearch.\n  For the last several years, we have increased the amount of medical \nresearch. That is good. My colleague in the House, John Porter, a \nRepublican from Illinois, has been a leader in that. I salute him for \nthat. I think we should continue on that track. This bill, \nunfortunately, takes a giant step backwards because this bill, as it is \ndrafted and being sent to the President, says the National Institutes \nof Health must postpone the awarding of medical research grants until \nthe closing weeks of next year. It means that universities and medical \nresearchers all across America are put on hold. They won't be given the \nmoney to research diabetes, cancer, heart disease, AIDS and all the \nother things we are concerned about. They have to wait.\n  What do their official organizations say about that? The American \nCouncil on Education says of this approach in the Republican bill to \ndelay medical research in America:\n\n       . . . research programs cannot be stopped and started up \n     again without considerable, often irretrievable loss to \n     research progress.\n\n  The Association of American Medical Colleges says of this Republican \nidea:\n\n       The cumulative impact of these effects will slow the \n     overall pace of research.\n\n  The Coalition for Health Funding says:\n\n\n[[Page S13533]]\n\n\n       The net effect would be a significant slowing of biomedical \n     research endeavors.\n\n  This isn't just a budget gimmick. This isn't a way to save face. This \nis, frankly, something that should alarm every American family. If \nthere is not someone in your household who is ill, you are blessed, but \ntomorrow that can change.\n  For those who sit patiently in doctors' waiting rooms, in hospitals, \npraying for a miracle for help from Washington when it comes to medical \nresearch, this bill is no hope at all. This bill takes a step \nbackwards. The President should veto this bill. Basically, it says to \nthe National Institutes of Health, we will give you more money but wait \n8 months. Let's let medical research stand on hold for 8 months. Mr. \nPresident, 40 percent of their spending, 60 percent of their grants \nwill be delayed until the closing days of the next fiscal year. This is \nbeyond budget gimmickry. This is unfair. It is inhumane. If for no \nother reason, President Clinton should veto this bill.\n  What it does to the Centers for Disease Control is also awful.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true that in addition to the so-called forward-\nfunding, they are also talking about an across-the-board cut that would \nalso affect the programs at the National Institutes of Health in \naddition to what the Senator has spoken about?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is true. I concede the overall spending is moving \nup, but they are slicing it back as part of the 1-percent, across-the-\nboard cut.\n\n  As we learned from the Congressional Budget Office yesterday, if the \nRepublican leadership is to keep their hands out of the Social Security \ntrust fund to accomplish this, 1 percent won't be enough. They will \nneed to cut back 5.8 percent, which means less money for medical \nresearch than otherwise would have been there.\n  By failing to make the necessary, tough, hard choices about where to \nspend money and where not to respond, they have tried to spread this. \nAnd by doing so, they have hit areas such as medical research.\n  Mr. REID. Isn't it true, also, when they talk about 1 percent--which \nwe know has to be 6 percent--isn't there that much waste in government? \nThe Senator knows they are talking not about looking at pockets of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. But these are indiscriminate, across-the-board \ncuts; is that not true?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator is correct. As a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee, he has had the responsibility of putting together a budget. \nWe are supposed to make choices. Some programs are worth investing in \nand some are not. Instead of making the choice, the Republican \nleadership says let's take a cut across-the-board on all of these \nprojects and programs.\n  I am not going to stand here and say there is waste, fraud, and abuse \nwhen it comes to medical research. We fund at the current time fewer \nthan half of the requests. People come to NIH and say: We have an idea \nfor a cure for diabetes, or something to do with asthma, arthritis. \nThese people are vetted, the professionals look at them, the money is \ngiven.\n  This approach is not only going to cut a percentage off the money for \nmedical research, it is going to delay 40 percent of the funds until \nthe closing days of the year. So all the researchers are put on hold, \nand all the people out in America, worried about these medical \nconditions for themselves and their families, frankly, are going to be \nfaced with that same delay.\n  Mr. REID. I ask one last question to the Senator from Illinois. I \nthink the Senator has done a good job of indicating these cuts are \nrelated to real people, people who get sick. They are not numbers. They \nare not statistics.\n  It was a few months ago at the West Front of the Capitol that I was \nhere with Miss America. There has been a new Miss America in the last \nfew weeks. The 1998 Miss America is a diabetic. She was out there \nbecause she has hope that what we are doing at the National Institutes \nof Health will allow her and the millions of other people who are \ndiabetic to be cured.\n  This will slow up the grants to these people who, we are told, are on \nthe verge of a breakthrough so children and others with diabetes can \nlook forward to the date when they will no longer have to take the \ninsulin shots, sometimes three times a day. Isn't that right?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Nevada is right. Again, let me remind \nyou, this is a budget gimmick. If you delay the spending in an agency \nuntil the closing weeks of the year and then when you calculate how \nmuch it is going to cost, it won't come out to the same dollar amount. \nIn order to meet some budget guidelines and conform with some \nregulations and rules, they make this decision to make an across-the-\nboard cut and delay the spending.\n  If somebody came to the floor and said, I have a great idea, let's \ndelay paying Members of Congress until the last few weeks of the year, \nI think we might have some resistance here. I think some of my \ncolleagues and my wife and I might see that a little differently. When \nit comes to medical research, we are prepared to do that. How can you \nsay that to the families you have met and I have met who come and \nexpect us to do our very best to encourage medical research?\n  Let me tell you another area. The Centers for Disease Control gets \n$2.8 billion. What do they do? They try, across the United States, to \ndo things such as reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS, try to reduce \ntuberculosis, immunization programs for kids, things that make America \nhealthier. This appropriation the Republicans have brought to us delays \nuntil the very end of the fiscal year a third of that money. Slow down \nyour effort to try to stop the spread of AIDS, this appropriation bill \nsays. I think that is irresponsible.\n  If there is any reason for the President to veto this bill, it is in \nthe area of health research and disease prevention. I hope the \nPresident vetoes it, sends it back up in a hurry, and says to the \nRepublican leadership: Roll up your sleeves and get serious. If you are \ngoing to make cuts in order to achieve some budget goals, don't start \nwith medical research, don't start with children who are suffering from \ndiseases where we might find a cure, don't go to the Centers for \nDisease Control which has an important mission for all Americans to \nmake this a healthier nation. No, go somewhere else.\n  I have been elected to the Congress, the Senate, now, for 17 years. \nThere are some areas that are really worth a fight. We can talk about \nroads and bridges. They mean a lot to a lot of people. But when it \ncomes to education and health, I think that is worth a fight. I invite \nthe President's veto as quickly as possible. Send this bill back up \nhere and say to the leadership, on both sides of the Rotunda, that they \nhave a lot more to do. Balancing this budget on the backs of kids who \nneed special tutorial help to learn to deal with reading and math is \nunconscionable. Balancing this budget on the backs of thousands who \nreceive assistance from the Women, Infants, and Children Program for \nnutritional assistance, so babies are born healthy, that is \nunconscionable.\n\n  For those of us who next year again will face a steady stream of \npeople--from Illinois, in my case, Nevada in the case of Senator Reid--\nwho come to our office and beg us, please do something about medical \nresearch so my child might live, I want to be able to look them in the \neye and say: We did the right thing. We encouraged the President to \nveto an irresponsible bill, a bill which would have delayed medical \nresearch for a lot of people across America who are depending on it for \ntheir survival.\n  When it comes down to the closing hours of the session, sometimes \nthings move through quickly and people are anxious to get home. I know \nI speak for myself and I probably do for many others when I say I am \nprepared to stay as long as it takes to see that the National \nInstitutes of Health and all their medical research responsibilities do \nnot become part of the political gamesmanship of the end of this \nsession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13534]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13532-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13532-S13534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2000--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

If you delay the spending in an agency \nuntil the closing weeks of the year and then when you calculate how \nmuch it is going to cost, it won't come out to the same dollar amount. \nIn order to meet some budget guidelines and conform with some \nregulations and rules, they make this decision to make an across-the-\nboard cut and delay the spending.\n  If somebody came to the floor and said, I have a great idea, let's \ndelay paying Members of Congress until the last few weeks of the year, \nI think we might have some resistance here. I think some of my \ncolleagues and my wife and I might see that a little differently. When \nit comes to medical research, we are prepared to do that. How can you \nsay that to the families you have met and I have met who come and \nexpect us to do our very best to encourage medical research?\n  Let me tell you another area. The Centers for Disease Control gets \n$2.8 billion. What do they do? They try, across the United States, to \ndo things such as reduce the incidence of HIV and AIDS, try to reduce \ntuberculosis, immunization programs for kids, things that make America \nhealthier. This appropriation the Republicans have brought to us delays \nuntil the very end of the fiscal year a third of that money. Slow down \nyour effort to try to stop the spread of AIDS, this appropriation bill \nsays. I think that is irresponsible.\n  If there is any reason for the President to veto this bill, it is in \nthe area of health research and disease prevention. I hope the \nPresident vetoes it, sends it back up in a hurry, and says to the \nRepublican leadership: Roll up your sleeves and get serious. If you are \ngoing to make cuts in order to achieve some budget goals, don't start \nwith medical research, don't start with children who are suffering from \ndiseases where we might find a cure, don't go to the Centers for \nDisease Control which has an important mission for all Americans to \nmake this a healthier nation. No, go somewhere else.\n  I have been elected to the Congress, the Senate, now, for 17 years. \nThere are some areas that are really worth a fight. We can talk about \nroads and bridges. They mean a lot to a lot of people. But when it \ncomes to education and health, I think that is worth a fight. I invite \nthe President's veto as quickly as possible. Send this bill back up \nhere and say to the leadership, on both sides of the Rotunda, that they \nhave a lot more to do. Balancing this budget on the backs of kids who \nneed special tutorial help to learn to deal with reading and math is \nunconscionable. Balancing this budget on the backs of thousands who \nreceive assistance from the Women, Infants, and Children Program for \nnutritional assistance, so babies are born healthy, that is \nunconscionable.\n\n  For those of us who next year again will face a steady stream of \npeople--from Illinois, in my case, Nevada in the case of Senator Reid--\nwho come to our office and beg us, please do something about medical \nresearch so my child might live, I want to be able to look them in the \neye and say: We did the right thing. We encouraged the President to \nveto an irresponsible bill, a bill which would have delayed medical \nresearch for a lot of people across America who are depending on it for \ntheir survival.\n  When it comes down to the closing hours of the session, sometimes \nthings move through quickly and people are anxious to get home. I know \nI speak for myself and I probably do for many others when I say I am \nprepared to stay as long as it takes to see that the National \nInstitutes of Health and all their medical research responsibilities do \nnot become part of the political gamesmanship of the end of this \nsession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13534]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13534-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 1832\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, it is my understanding that it was \nthe leader's intention to lay down the nuclear waste bill, but there \nhas been an objection raised. As a consequence, it is my understanding \nthat we will be discussing the bill, recognizing that there may be \nprocedural action by the leadership at a later date regarding the \ndisposition of this legislation.\n  It is my intention to simply discuss the merits of the bill for a \nperiod that would accommodate the President, as well as my colleagues, \nrecognizing it is Friday afternoon and there are Members who perhaps \nhave other plans.\n  While it is not my intention to communicate to this body every \nthought concerning this matter that I have. I do have, through the \ncooperation of my staff, probably enough material to take 6 or 7 days. \nHopefully, it will not take that long to convince my colleagues that we \nhave a problem in this country with our high-level nuclear waste \nprogram.\n  It is no secret there are not a number of States that are standing in \nline to take this waste. The fact is, most Members would wish for some \ntype of a magic trick that would make this waste disappear. But the \nfacts are, this waste is with us. It was created by an industry which \ncontributes some 20 to 22 percent of the total electric energy produced \nin the United States. So it is our obligation to address how we are \ngoing to handle that waste.\n  We have, I think, like the ostrich, put our head in the sand \nregarding advanced technology addressing high-level nuclear waste that \nhas advanced in other countries, particularly in France, and to a \ndegree Great Britain and Asia.\n  The technology varies, but the basic premise is that spent fuel \ncoming from our depleted cores within the reactors are taken, and \nthrough a chemical process, the plutonium is recovered and returned to \nthe reactors as fuel. This is an oversimplification of the process, \nbut, as a consequence, the proliferation threat of the plutonium is \nreduced dramatically because it is burned in the reactors. Not every \nexisting reactor can utilize this technology, but technology is clearly \navailable.\n  What is done with the rest of the waste? It is vitrified. That means \nthe remaining waste is turned into a glass. The lifetime of that \nmaterial has been reduced dramatically. It still must be stored, but it \nhas a lesser radioactive life.\n  What we have here is a situation where my good friends on the other \nside have objected to consideration of this bill.\n  That objection suggests that they might have some other alternative \nother than simply delaying a resolution of this problem. If there is \nanother alternative other than delay, I would hope my friends on the \nother side would bring that to my attention.\n  For the sake of full disclosure, as the junior Senator from Alaska, I \ndo not have a constituency in my State on this issue. My hands, so to \nspeak, from a self-interest point of view, are pretty clean. Oftentimes \nwe have Members who are trying to foster a particular policy based on \nan interest in their State. We don't have high-level nuclear waste in \nAlaska. We have never had a nuclear power reactor, with the exception \nof a small program back in the early 1960s on one of our military \nbases. That facility has since been removed. The point is, the \nobligation I have is one as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee to try to get my colleagues to recognize that we \ncollectively have a responsibility as to what we are going to do with \nthis waste.\n\n  The industry is strangling on its waste. If we don't address it in a \nresponsible way, the industry will decline. It will decline for a \ncouple of reasons. The storage at many reactors is at, or almost at, \nthe maximum limit allowed by their licenses. That means that each \nreactor is licensed for the amount of waste that can be stored on the \nsite of the reactor. Many of you have been to nuclear reactors. You \nhave seen the blue pools where the spent rods are stored. There is a \nlimit to how much storage is available. As a consequence, we run into a \nsituation where some reactors have reached their maximum limit under \nthe authorization and cannot continue to operate without some relief.\n  That relief, as I will indicate to my colleagues, was to have been \nprovided by the Federal Government. The Federal Government contracted \nwith the nuclear power industry in the United States to take this waste \nbeginning in 1998. As often is the case, the Government doesn't seem to \nhonor the sanctity of contractual commitments to the level the private \nsector does. The Government was unprepared to take this waste in 1998, \neven though there had been a continuing effort to meet the Government's \nobligation by opening a facility at Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, for the \npermanent placement of high-level nuclear waste. To date there has been \nalmost $7 billion expended in that process. That facility is not ready.\n  So what we have before us is a situation where the Government has \nviolated its contractual commitments. The damages associated with that \ncurrently are estimated to be $40 to $80 billion. The U.S. taxpayer is \ngoing to have to accept the responsibility for these damages as a \nconsequence of the Government's failure to initiate taking of the waste \nin 1998.\n  When you look at $40 to $80 billion, you must recognize that this \nobligation arises as a consequence of DOE's failure to perform the \ncontract. This is basically damages. So we have a situation where \nnobody wants the waste, including the Federal Government that is \ncontracted to take the waste as of 1998. We have a stalemate. We have \nan effort to ignore this waste as though it didn't exist, that it will \ngo away. Some would even make the generalization that the Clinton \nadministration simply does not want to address this issue on their \nwatch.\n  There are all kinds of interests here. There are some of the \nenvironmental groups that don't want to see this issue resolved. They \nwant to kill the nuclear power industry in this country. They certainly \ndon't want to see it grow. There has not been a new reactor ordered in \nthe United States since 1979. So we are not advancing, and we are not \nstanding still; we are stepping back.\n  The consequences of this are: What are we going to do? How do we meet \nour obligation to provide power if, indeed, we lose a portion of our \nnuclear industry? Some suggest we will just reach out and find more \nnatural gas.\n\n[[Page S13535]]\n\nWe have had hearings in our committee that indicate you just don't plug \nin if you need more natural gas; you are going to have to depend on an \nexpanded distribution system. That expanded distribution system isn't \ngoing to be built unless there is an increase in the price of gas. And \nto suggest you are going to have cheap gas available is strictly \nspeculation. You will have to go after deeper gas. To give someone the \nincentive to drill in these more difficult areas, you are going to have \nto increase the price.\n  As a consequence, the critics of this legislation fail, I think, to \nmeet their obligation to come up with an alternative as to where this \nenergy is going to come from if we don't address this high-level \nnuclear waste issue. Leave it where it is?\n  Where is nuclear waste? Behind me we have a map that shows every \nMember of this body where it is today. It is stored in about 80 sites \nin 40 States. If you don't want to do anything about this, you are \ndeciding to leave it where it is. Some of the Governors have indicated \nthey are reluctant to support this legislation because it has been \namended to accommodate the administration's proposal that it be \nauthorized to take title to the waste at the site. The governors are \nfearful the waste will stay there. For the life of me, I can't \nunderstand that logic. If we don't do anything, it is going to stay \nthere anyway. So we have to address the problem. Leave it where it is? \nNow you know where it is.\n  I am going to go through several States individually this afternoon \nbecause I think it is important that the States that depend on nuclear \npower have a general understanding of how much they have paid into the \nwaste fund, how much they are dependent on nuclear power, and what is \ngoing to happen if we don't address this problem.\n  First is the State of Illinois. As you can see on the chart, the \nconsumers in the State of Illinois have paid $2 billion into the \nNuclear Waste Fund. What is the Waste Fund? It is the Government. They \npaid the Government to take this waste. This started in 1982.\n  How many units do we have in Illinois? We have the Braidwood 1 and 2, \nByron 1 and 2, Clinton, Dresden 2 and 3, LaSalle 1 and 2, Quad Cities 1 \nand 2. How much waste is stored? We have 5,215 metric tons of waste in \nthe State of Illinois. In addition, the Department of Energy research \nreactor fuel is stored there, 40 metric tons. If you don't find a place \nfor this, what is going to happen? It is going to stay. Here, where it \nsays ``no vacancies,'' are the reactors by name and when they run out \nof storage space: Dresden 3, the year 2000; Dresden 2 in the year 2003; \nClinton, 2003; 2006; 2006; 2013; 2015; and 2019.\n  We have a crisis coming up because the earliest, from all estimates, \nthat we can have a facility ready to receive waste is in the year 2007. \nThat is the expedited schedule under S. 1287. We have done extensive \nwork at Yucca Mountain. The tunneling is done. You can wander around in \nthere. It looks very impressive. Why Yucca Mountain? Well, some of the \npeople who make decisions decided that was the best place to put this \nwaste because of the unique geography of the site. Nobody wants this \nmaterial. Vermont has a lot of granite. It would probably make a good \nrepository, but I am sure if the delegation from Vermont were here \ntoday, they would have something to say about it.\n  But the point is, it has to go somewhere. So they chose a site out in \nNevada, a site where we have had nuclear testing for some 50 years. You \nmight say it is polluted. It has been used over a period of time for \nhundreds of above-ground and underground nuclear explosions. So they \ndecided to put it out there, and they spent almost $7 billion of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  Back in Illinois, how significant is nuclear power in the mix? It is \n39 percent of Illinois' power. I hope every person in Illinois \nunderstands this because it is their lights and pocketbook. You want to \nget nuclear waste out of here? You want your reactors to continue to be \nable to produce power? Or do you want your electric rates to go up when \nthese plants close? Are you going to hold the Government responsible \nfor the payment you made in your electric bill to take that waste when \nyou paid them $2 billion? They are in violation of the sanctity of that \ncontractual commitment. So that is the story in one State, the State of \nIllinois.\n  But I am not through. We have a lot of charts, and we are going to go \nthrough a few.\n  The State of Michigan. They make a few automobiles out there, as I \nrecall. We don't make automobiles in Alaska. We grow fish and trees in \nAlaska. The ratepayers paid $696 million into the waste fund so the \nFederal Government would take their waste in 1998. They have four \nunits: Cook 1 and 2, Fermi 2, and Palisades. The waste stored is 1,493 \nmetric tons. The DOE has research reactor waste there as well. What \nhappens? Palisades says 1992. So they are out of luck. Fermi 2 is down \nin 2001, and Cook and 2 are down in 2014. Michigan is 24-percent \ndependent on nuclear power.\n  The next chart: Arkansas. The ratepayers in Arkansas paid $365 \nmillion to the Federal Government for the waste fund. You would think \nPresident Clinton, being from Arkansas, would have some interest in \nsolving this problem. No way. They have two units, Arkansas 1 and 2. \nWaste storage is 690 metric tons. Unit 1, down in 1996; unit 2, down in \n1997. What they have done is they took their waste out of the spent \nfuel pool, and put it on site in casks temporarily. That is where it \nis. The State allowed them to do that. We don't know if all the States \nare going to allow that. Now, mind you, that is temporary. \n``Temporary'' implies you are going to do something for a permanent \nsolution. Arkansas is 33-percent dependent on nuclear power.\n  The next chart: The State of Oregon. They paid $108 million into the \nwaste fund. One unit, Trojan. Waste stored, 424 metric tons. It is the \nlocation of the Hanford site. Waste stored, 2,133 metric tons. Trojan \nclosed for decommissioning. The waste stays in Oregon. If the Governor \ndoesn't want relief, it is going to stay in Oregon.\n  Next is Louisiana. Waste fund, $239 million. That is what the \nratepayers paid in Louisiana. Two units, River Bend 1 and Waterford 3. \nWaste stored, 567 metric tons. What is happening? In the year 2002, \ndown goes Waterford 3, and in 2007, down goes River Bend 1. The State \nof Louisiana is dependent 22 percent.\n  Georgia. The waste fees that the people in Georgia paid on their rate \nbills total $529 million. Four units: Hatch 1 and 2 and Vogtle 1 and 2. \nWaste stored 1,182 metric tons. They have the Savannah River site. \nWaste stored, 206 metric tons. It is going to stay there. Hatch is out \nin 1999; Vogtle out in 2008. Georgia is 30-percent dependent on nuclear \nenergy.\n\n  The dairy State, Wisconsin. What bothers me here is the fact that \nMembers from these States should be concerned. You have been ripped off \nby the Federal Government. They are taking your consumers' money, and \nthey haven't taken your waste. Do you want it to stay there? If you do, \ndon't do anything. If you want to move it, you had better get behind \nsome legislation. Three units, Kewaunee and Point Beach 1 and 2. Waste \nstored, 967 metric tons. Point Beach: They are storing it in casks on \nthe surface at the nuclear reactor. Kewaunee goes down in 2001, and \nPoint Beach goes down in 1995. They are 8-percent dependent on nuclear \npower.\n  Connecticut. We haven't had much concern from Connecticut. I can't \nimagine why. Connecticut is 43-percent dependent on nuclear power. That \nis the first quarter figures for 1999. The residents, in their utility \nbills, have paid in $655 million for the Federal Government to take the \nwaste. Two units, Millstone 2 and 3. Waste stored, 1,445 metric tons; \nDOE defense waste. They build a few nuclear subs in Connecticut. They \nhave for a long time. Do you want us to be able to continue building \nthose submarines? Millstone 2 is up in 2002. Millstone 3 is up in 2003. \nThey are 43-percent nuclear dependent in Connecticut.\n  Next chart: The State of Washington, moving out near my part of the \nworld. The waste fund contribution is $344 million. Residents paid that \namount in Washington in their utility bills. The Government didn't take \nthe waste. One unit, WNP 2. Waste stored, 292 metric tons. No vacancy \nin 2000. Despite the fact that they have tremendous hydro in the State \nof Washington, they are 6-percent dependent on nuclear.\n\n[[Page S13536]]\n\n  Moving on to Massachusetts. The ratepayers there paid $156 million in \ntheir electric bills. One unit, Pilgrim 1. Waste stored, 495 metric \ntons. The State is 12-percent dependent.\n  That gives you some idea geographically of where this stuff is. It is \nall over the country.\n  We are trying to get consideration of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act \nAmendments of 1999.\n  This issue has been before this body before. We passed bills by broad \nbipartisan margins in previous Congresses but couldn't overcome a veto \nthreat by our President from Arkansas. On that last vote there were 65 \nvotes in support of the bill and 34 were opposed to it. Our President \nis from Arkansas. I guess he wants to leave the waste in Arkansas \nbecause he threatened to veto the bill. We didn't quite have a veto-\nproof vote. We only had 65 votes. That is pretty good around here.\n  Those bills were a complete substitute for the existing Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1982. That bill gave the authority to build an interim \nstorage facility for nuclear waste at a temporary above-ground storage \npad adjacent to Yucca Mountain. In other words, the relief proposed in \nthat bill was to move the waste into casks that were designed and \nengineered for transportation and move them out to Yucca Mountain where \nthey could be stored temporarily in above-ground storage until such \ntime as Yucca Mountain was ready to receive the waste.\n  I have another chart that shows how high-level waste moves around the \ncountry in the transportation network. It is important that you \nunderstand this high-level waste moves across the United States today. \nThere have been from time to time suggestions made that somehow this \ncan't be moved safely.\n  When we show you the chart, you will recognize that there is a risk \ninvolved in moving anything, including you and I. With proper \nprecautions and with proper engineering, the risks can be reduced \ndramatically.\n  That is what has been done. When one considers the risk inherent in \nleaving this waste where it is, scattered around the country in places \nwhere it wasn't designed to be stored, or storing it onsite in casks, \none has to question why there is such a concern over moving this waste \nto one concentrated site as was proposed initially in the previous \nlegislation to establish interim storage at a temporary above-ground \nstorage pad adjacent to the Yucca Mountain site.\n  Here are 30 years of safe transportation of used-fuel routes that \noccurred from 1964 to 1997. There were 2,913 shipments. There is the \nrouting. They go from Portland to San Francisco, Los Angeles, \nAlbuquerque, Phoenix, Denver, Cheyenne, Bismark, Minneapolis, Omaha, \nDes Moines, St. Louis, Oklahoma City, Nashville, Columbia, Raleigh, \nRichmond, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, New York, Syracuse, Boston, \nPittsburgh, Charleston, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, and St. Paul. \nThey have been moved, and they have been moved safely.\n  I think there was one accident where somebody ran off the road. No \ndamage was done to the spent fuel cask. The inherent safety of the \ntechnology within the casks resulted in no release of radiation. Sure, \nsomething could happen. Something could happen by leaving it where it \nis.\n  The fact is, with these numbers of shipments over that timeframe, \nthere has never been a fatality. There has never been an injury. There \nhas never been any environmental damage because of carriage of this \nradioactive cargo. To suggest we should suddenly become excited about \nthe prospects of moving it, fails to recognize that we have been moving \nit for 30 years.\n  The previous legislation contained extensive provisions on licensing \nfor Yucca and interim storage facilities, including NEPA radiation \nprotection standards and transportation requirements. History tells us \nthe administration, of course, threatened to veto this legislation \nbecause it opposed interim storage, and the justification for that was \nthat they wanted the viability assessment to have been completed \nregarding the permit repository at Yucca Mountain. The viability \nassessment has been completed. So that is behind us. That is one \nroadblock that has been thrown in our way.\n\n  We have had, of course, a great deal of objection from our friends \nfrom Nevada. I can understand their objection. They don't want it in \ntheir State. Where are we going to put it? Are we going to put it in \nthe District of Columbia, which belongs to everybody? We know the \npracticality of that is unrealistic. We know we have to store it \nsomewhere. If it weren't for my friend from Nevada objecting, it would \nbe my friend from someplace else objecting. But you can't continue to \nignore the problem.\n  There is an anti-nuke movement out there that doesn't want to see any \nadvancement of technology for anything that has anything to do with \nnuclear power generation. One thing they forget is what the nuclear \npower industry contributes to air quality. It makes the greatest \ncontribution of any source because there are no air emissions. If you \nwant to clean up the air, and we are concerned about global warming, \nnuclear is an answer. They won't have that. They want the status quo, \nwhich is doing nothing while the waste continues to pile up.\n  We are trying to accommodate the administration. We are trying to \nmake advances so we can make progress on how we are going to address \nthis problem.\n  In response to the administration's concern, the bill before us, \nSenate bill 1287, is a completely different approach. I hope my \ncolleagues and staff who are watching this debate understand what this \nbill does. It is not a complete substitute for the old act. It is a \nminimal approach. It does not contain interim storage provisions. We \nhave taken those out because there has been great objection to that. \nThe reason there is great objection is because the fear is that if you \nput spent fuel in Nevada in interim storage it will become permanent. I \ndo not agree with this position, but I am not going to argue the point. \nNevertheless, this legislation is different. It doesn't mandate an \ninterim storage provision. So let's get that out of the debate. It is \nno longer in the bill.\n\n  There are two major things this bill does. First, it gives the \nDepartment of Energy the tools it needs to meet its commitment to move \nspent fuel by opening a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. That is \nthe policy. That is the objective. Every responsible policy-maker has \nagreed. We have to have an answer to this. The answer, of course, is \nthe permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. One may not agree that is \nthe correct answer, but we have collected over $15 billion from the \nratepayers to put that waste in that hole we dug at a cost of over $7 \nbillion at Yucca Mountain. That is our policy. We have to have some \npolicy. Otherwise, we are going down a million rabbit trails at once.\n  The second major thing: It provides fair treatment for those who have \nfulfilled their end of the bargain by paying over $15 billion under the \ncontract, only to have DOE leave them literally holding the bag. This \nis pursuant to the contract to take the waste in 1998, which the \nFederal Government failed to do.\n  Specifically, this legislation, Senate bill 1287, clarifies the \nexisting unconstitutional one House veto for raising the nuclear waste \nfee. It states, I think, appropriately, that only the Congress can vote \nto raise the existing one mill per kilowatt fee if necessary to pay the \nadditional expenses anticipated in this program. We are saying only the \nCongress has that authority.\n  The bill allows plaintiffs in the lawsuit and the Department of \nEnergy to reach voluntary settlements of DOE's liability for failing to \ntake nuclear waste in 1998. To accommodate Secretary Richardson, with \nwhom I have been working at great length, we have included the \nadministration proposal to take title to the waste at reactor sites.\n  This offers the industry an alternative. They can do one of two \nthings: They can either let the Government take title to the waste at \nsite or they can choose to proceed to litigate their claim for the \nGovernment for failing to take the waste.\n  There is a radiation standard that has received a lot of \nconsideration. The question is, Who sets the standard? Should it be the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission that has the extended, in-depth expertise \nin nuclear matters and setting standards? Should that agency set the \nstandard that protects the people of Nevada and other States without\n\n[[Page S13537]]\n\nimposing unnecessary and counterproductive restrictions?\n  Some will argue that the regulator ought to be the Environmental \nProtection Agency. The EPA should regulate and set the standard. Let's \nbe sure we understand one another. That standard has to be reasonable. \nOtherwise, this whole thing is for naught.\n  The EPA has a rather curious record. Some suggest there are portions \nwithin the administration that don't want to have anything to do with \nnuclear energy; they are opposed philosophically to it. Are they going \nto be objective and set a standard that is unattainable on purpose? \nThat is the real risk. This whole thing can be killed on that one \nissue. That has been known to happen. If they set a standard for \ngroundwater comparable to the drinking water standard, this thing is \nthrough. The Government's money is wasted, and the $6 billion in Yucca \nMountain is wasted. I know some people would love to have it that way \nbecause we wouldn't be putting it in Yucca Mountain or Nevada and we \nwould still have the problem.\n  Be careful of this one, colleagues. The bill contains a radiation \nstandard set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. I am willing to take \na look at other proposals as long as it will result in a rational \nstandard.\n  The fourth issue in this new proposal is to allow the fuel to be \naccepted when the NRC authorizes construction of a permanent repository \nin the year 2007. Again, we assume that will be at Yucca Mountain. It \nallows the Department of Energy to begin moving fuel as soon as \npossible after Yucca Mountain is licensed in the year 2007.\n\n  I appeal to those States and those Governors who are following this \ndebate who say wait, if this proposal goes and the Government takes \ntitle, it is still stuck in my State. I remind the Governors, if this \nbill does not pass, it is still stuck in your State. We have to have a \nvehicle to move this process along. Everybody is free to come in if \nthey can build a better mousetrap.\n  Transportation provisions based on those used for the Waste Isolation \nPilot Plant, or WIPP, are another provision. Again, I refer to the \ntransportation chart. We move spent fuel all the time in the United \nStates and around the world and have no release of radiation.\n  This revised bill builds on the existing safety system by adding \nmoney for education, emergency responders, local communities, \ntransportation personnel, provisions for routing, allowing the State \ninput, special rules for populated areas, and advanced notification for \nlocal government. That is not what is done now by the Federal \nGovernment; they just go ahead and move it. This is civilian, \ngovernment-owned and military waste. The same stuff. It moves to Idaho, \nmoves all over the country; we just don't say anything about it. Now we \nare saying: OK, public, this is what we will do. Is it any less safe \nthan what we are doing now? It will be safer if we pass S. 1287.\n  We will have an opportunity for a demonstration. Some folks will come \nout and have a field day. But they have an obligation, too. What will \nthey do about this waste? Will they stand and block it so it can go \nback to where it came from? That is irresponsible.\n  Where is the administration? I am not sure. I talked to the \nSecretary. We have accommodated the Secretary. It was his proposal that \nsaid we would take the waste at site. I explained we are having \nproblems with some of the Governors, particularly in the northeast part \nof the United States. They want to get this waste out of their area. \nThey had better get behind something that will address a process so the \nwaste can be moved, because if they don't, it will sit there forever.\n  We have eliminated the source of the administration's opposition to \nour previous bill on the issue of no interim storage, and on their \nsuggestion relating to the Government taking title of the waste. I am \nnot sure I understand whether the administration still opposes the \nbill, but I am sure my friends on the other side will enlighten me. \nThey certainly have not come to the table to try to work constructively \nto resolve this problem which I believe we can no longer ignore.\n  I think it is the philosophy of the Clinton administration to simply \nignore this for the remainder of their watch. As a consequence, it is \ndelayed, delayed, delayed, delayed.\n  I have gone on for a reasonable period of time. I want to accommodate \nmy colleagues. I see the Senator from Nevada waiting to be recognized, \nas well as some of my other colleagues.\n  Madam President has been most accommodating in allowing me this time, \nbut I am inclined to yield the floor. This may be enough for me today, \nbut I have about 680 more pages of material that, hopefully, will \nconvince you, if I have not convinced you already.\n  With that, Madam President. I temporarily yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding the \nfloor. I wish we were in a position to be discussing how we can protect \nSocial Security, I think that is something the American people are very \nmuch concerned about; how we could extend the solvency of Medicare and \nprovide a prescription drug benefit; campaign finance reform; minimum \nwage. I think those are the things the American people would like to \nsee this Congress act upon. I regret to say this legislation is pure, \nnaked, special interest legislation, and I want to give some historical \nperspective, since my friend from Alaska recited some of the history \nitself.\n  In 1982, the Congress of the United States passed the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act. The original concept of that act was an attempt to deal \nwith a difficult issue but in a fair and balanced way. In essence, what \nthe act provided was that different geological formations in the \ncountry that might be suitable for waste--granite in the Northeast, \nsalt domes in the Southeast, welded tuff in parts of the West--would be \nconsidered and studied; three sites would be referred to the President \nof the United States after the study, or, as the technical term is \nused, ``characterization'' is completed, and the President of the \nUnited States would select one of those.\n  The concept was there would be some geographical balance as well. And \nthat is important, it strikes me, for us to understand. That carefully \ncrafted and I think somewhat thoughtful approach was corrupted almost \nimmediately by the political process. No sooner had the bill gone into \neffect than there was an effort, politically, to exclude certain \nregions of the country. The Northeast with the granite formations made \nit very clear, the Department of Energy records reflect, that because \nof the opposition from that part of the country, the Department of \nEnergy, in effect, withdrew or abandoned any serious efforts to look at \nthat. That had absolutely nothing to do with science or logic or \nbalance or fairness.\n  Then, shortly thereafter, some of our colleagues from the Southeast \nraised concerns during the 1984 Presidential campaign, and lo and \nbehold, assurances were given by the top levels of the then-\nadministration that, indeed, the Southeast would be taken off the list.\n  In the 1982 Act, the Environmental Protection Agency was charged with \nthe responsibility of a permanent repository health and safety standard \nthat would be promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, \nsomething that was of overarching importance because the high-level \nnuclear waste we are talking about is not just messy stuff, unpleasant \nstuff; it is deadly, lethal, for tens and tens of thousands of years. \nSo this is a major public health and safety concern, and the Congress \nchose the Environmental Protection Agency, created during the Nixon \nadministration, to be, in effect, the agency to set that standard.\n  My friend from Alaska posed the question, rhetorically: Why Yucca \nMountain? Let me respond to that, if I may. In 1987, an infamous piece \nof legislation known throughout my State as the ``Screw Nevada Bill'' \nwas passed in the Congress. Unlike the 1982 Act, which said we will \nlook across the country and develop three sites and have the President \njudge--in 1987 the ``Screw Nevada Act'' said we will look only at Yucca \nMountain, no other place. That was not science. That was not logic. \nThat was not fairness. That was not balance. That is the sheer force \nand impact of naked political power inflicted upon a State with a \nsparse population and a small congressional representation in the \nNation's Capitol.\n\n  But even in 1987, at the request of the nuclear utility industry, \nwhich drives\n\n[[Page S13538]]\n\nthis debate, there was no attempt to change the health and safety \nstandards. Then, 1992 comes along, the energy bill. There was nothing \ndebated in committee or in the floor amendments--but in conference. As \nmy colleagues fully understand, but our friends who are listening to \nthis at home may not, a conference report cannot be amended. In the \nconference report there was an attempt--it succeeded--to place a \nprovision that sought to somehow weaken those public health and safety \nstandards, and the National Academy of Sciences was introduced for the \nfirst time. They were to look at the public health and safety \nstandards, make some recommendations, and the Environmental Protection \nAgency would have to conform its decision within the range of standards \nproposed by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Make no mistake, the primary intent of doing that was to weaken \nhealth and safety standards. The proposal originated within the highest \ncorporate board rooms in the nuclear power industry in America. I \nobjected, as some of my colleagues did. Nevertheless, it became law.\n  That brings us to a somewhat contemporary point in time. I am not \ngoing to discuss the flaws of the interim storage proposal. When \nCongress passed this legislation back in 1982, they fully understood if \nan interim storage was located that would, in fact, become de facto the \npermanent nuclear waste dump. It makes no sense then. It made no sense \nwhen it was proposed in the last Congress. That is why the President of \nthe United States very appropriately and responsibly said: I will veto \nthat if it ever gets to my desk.\n  I have some sympathy for my friend from Alaska. He, as his \npredecessors, as chairman of the Energy Committee, has a responsibility \nto accommodate the requests of the nuclear power industry. My friend \nbegan the debate by saying, in effect: Look, we have a decision in \nwhich we have a decline in the industry. The industry is struggling. We \nare out of capacity. What are we going to do with all of this? Long \nbefore this Senator from Nevada arrived in the Chamber, those very \nwords were heard by the then-chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, \nin 1981, when there was a proposal to develop what was then known as an \naway-from-reactor proposal; that is, move the waste away from the \nreactor site.\n  Then, in 1981, it was stated that nuclear plants would have to close \ndown, there would be electrical brownouts in America. That was 18 years \nago. No nuclear utility in America has closed down. No brownout has \noccurred because of the absence of storage issue. There is an answer, \nand it is the same that those who were our adversaries proposed for us \nin Nevada; and that is dry cask storage onsite, and many utilities have \ndone that.\n  It is suggested in the course of this debate there is some need to \ntake urgent action. We have to do something. Let me say, I do not like \nthe idea that Nevada got the shaft in the 1987 legislation. But the \ncurrent law, if nothing occurs with respect to nuclear waste in this \nCongress, is that Yucca Mountain is going to be studied. And \nultimately, if a determination is made as to suitability--and that \ndetermination has not yet been made; let me emphasize, no determination \nhas been made that Yucca Mountain is suitable and there are a host of \nproblems with that site. I will not get into extended comment on that \ntoday to keep my remarks somewhat abbreviated--but that process goes \nforward.\n  So, what is the circumstance? The circumstance today is that nuclear \nenergy is an energy dinosaur.\n  There have been no new reactors ordered in America for more than two \ndecades, and I suspect that even the most persuasive and articulate \nMembers of this Chamber would have a very difficult time trying to \npersuade their community, look, what we need--I see the distinguished \noccupant of the Chair, perhaps a new city in her State--is a nuclear \nreactor right next door. It is not going to happen.\n  Why is it not going to happen? Because people, understandably, are \nvery apprehensive and scared because they have seen some circumstances \nthat have occurred around the world, and they are very much troubled by \nthis.\n  This is a move by the nuclear utility industry that, in effect, has \nseveral flawed provisions I want to discuss ever so briefly.\n  With respect to the concern raised by my friend from Alaska that the \ntax ratepayers paid into this nuclear waste trust fund and that, \nindeed, the 1998 deadlines have not been met, the Senator from Alaska \nmakes a fair point. They have not been met. There are many who say the \nnuclear utilities in 1982 forced upon the Department of Energy an \nunrealistic timeframe. Indeed, that has been the history of these \nvarious deadlines contained in some of the oversight by the Department \nof Energy over the intervening years.\n  I recognize the utilities have incurred additional expense because a \npermanent repository was not available in 1998 and will not be for some \nyears ahead, even assuming Yucca Mountain. That is a red herring. That \nis not the issue. This Senator from Nevada and my colleague offered \nlegislation as far back as 1990 saying: Yes, we have to compensate the \nutilities because there is no site available in that they are going to \nhave to construct, in some instances, onsite storage in dry cast. That \ncost the ratepayers. We recognize it is fair to reimburse the utility \nfor that expense.\n  The utilities would have no part of that because that is not their \nconcern, that is not the agenda. They have something much different in \nmind, and they would like to shift the entire responsibility of this \nprogram, in effect, to the American taxpayer and not to the ratepayer.\n  This legislation proposes to compensate the nuclear utilities. I do \nnot have a problem with that. It proposes the Federal Government take \nover the title. Whether that is good or bad is an issue on which I do \nnot care to comment.\n  What it does that violates every sense of public health and safety \nand fairness and public policy is it moves the public health and safety \ngoalposts in midcourse. Let me point this out.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency did, in fact, come with its \nrecommendations as to what is an appropriate public health and safety \nstandard. That is not just for Nevadans, but that is for Americans \nbecause although my friend from Alaska points out, yes, some nuclear \nwaste has been transported across the country and there have been no \nmajor catastrophes, let us go back more than 20 years ago. The nuclear \nindustry in America could say there has been no serious accident with \nrespect to nuclear reactors in this country. But guess what. Three Mile \nIsland occurred.\n  Nobody can make that contention today. I suppose the old politburo in \nthe Soviet Union could have said at one point a bit more than 10, 15 \nyears ago: Look, we have never had a serious nuclear reactor accident \nin the Soviet Union. But that was before Chernobyl, one of the biggest \nenvironmental disasters of our time. Radiation contaminated vast areas \naround the nuclear reactor site. Yes, my friend from Alaska suggests \nreprocessing and mixing this stuff is somehow a new elixir of life. I \nsuppose the Ministry of Energy in Japan might have said a few months \nago: We have never had a problem with that. They cannot say that \nanymore after the very serious accident which occurred in Tokyo and, \nindeed, tragically--I hope this is not the case--we are likely to see \nseveral fatalities as a result of that because of lethal doses.\n\n  ``It has never happened, it is plenty safe, and do not worry about \nall this.'' We are talking about tens of thousands of shipments, 77,000 \nmetric tons.\n  My friend from Nevada, my senior colleague, wants to speak in a \nmoment as well. Should the majority leader bring this up for debate, I \nassure my colleagues we will have extended debate for a week, if not \nlonger, in which we will explore each of these things in some detail. \nThat would be unfortunate because it would make it impossible for us to \nconsider a whole host of legislation that is pending that many people \nin the Chamber, myself included, believe has a far greater priority \nthan a special interest piece of legislation in which only the \nutilities are interested.\n  Public health and safety ought to be of concern whether you are for \nnuclear energy, against nuclear energy, or ambivalent. Here is what is \ninvolved: The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to establish a \n15-millirem-per-year standard. That is the State rate of exposure on an \nannual basis--15 millirems. That, we are told, is outrageous, as if \nsomehow the standard is\n\n[[Page S13539]]\n\nif we cannot build it, then let's reduce health and safety standards. \nThat is fairly outrageous. We are talking about something that kills \npeople. It is deadly, lethal. I would think everybody would say: Look, \nI have never agreed with you before on some of these things, but when \nthey are trying to screw around with health and safety standards, that \naffects every American. This is the EPA proposal.\n  You will recall I talked about how the nuclear utilities thought they \nwere going to game the system with the 1992 Energy bill. They got the \nNational Academy of Sciences involved. The National Academy of Sciences \nlooked at it and said: We recommend the millirem standard--that is the \nrate of exposure per year--be between 2 millirems and 20 millirems. The \nEPA standard is right in the middle. The NRC standard--and we know they \nare friendly with the industry--recommends 25 millirems. The \nlegislation that may be considered goes to 30. That would double it.\n  Why are they doing that? They are trying to game the system. \nRemember, if nothing passes, Yucca Mountain continues to be studied and \nmay, indeed, prove to be suitable. I hope not. I think not. But \nnevertheless, that process is in place.\n  Let me point out what we are dealing with with other EPA public \nhealth and safety standards. Some years ago, when I first came to the \nSenate, we were debating the WIPP facility, the waste isolation \nproject. We set standards for them that dealt with lifetime cancer risk \nper 10,000 individuals. That standard was set at 3. That is what the \nEPA essentially is proposing for us as well.\n  Look what S. 1287, the bill the Energy Committee has processed, would \ndo. It would be more than triple what we did for WIPP, taking it to 10 \nlifetime cancer risk per 10,000--a serious erosion of public health and \nsafety.\n  What possible reason or why would anyone want to suggest that the \ngood folks in Nevada, whether it is your favorite State or not, would \nnot be entitled to the same health and safety protections provided to \nthe good citizens of New Mexico? Why do we do that? It simply makes no \nsense at all.\n  One can look at Superfund standards, hazardous air pollutants--all of \nthose are within this range, which is within the National Academy of \nSciences' findings. Look how far S. 1287 is outside the envelope or \nprotection that the National Academy of Sciences recommended.\n  Remember, the nuclear industry fully expected the National Academy of \nSciences would have come up with a standard much more favorable to \ntheir point of view which, frankly, is minimal health and safety \nstandards. Whatever it takes to get that site built, they could care \nless, in effect, about the public health and safety of folks who could \nbe impacted by this. Pretty outrageous: 10 versus about 3--pretty \noutrageous.\n\n  So when we are talking about some of the fatal flaws in this \nlegislation, I simply take the time this afternoon in joining my friend \nfrom Alaska in debate to point out something about which every American \nought to be concerned. This is nuclear waste.\n  What industry comes to the Congress next year and says, we can't meet \nthe standard that is set for public health and safety? You all, last \nyear, did something for the nuclear power industry. Can you do \nsomething for us? In effect, what we would establish is a public policy \nprecedent that would unravel public health and safety standards if the \nindustries that are regulated do not like those standards. That is \nextraordinarily dangerous.\n  I say to my colleagues: Don't get stampeded on this piece of \nlegislation. If nothing occurs, the characterization of study of Yucca \nMountain--much to my dismay, but it is the law--will continue. This \nlegislation is dangerous. It is enormously bad public policy. It is an \nincredibly bad precedent. And it is unneeded. To bring it up at this \nlate hour in this session, when we are trying to wrap things up in the \nnext couple of weeks, it seems to me, says something about our \npriorities here in the Congress.\n  I hope the distinguished majority leader does not bring this up. But \nI can assure him--and I do so with great respect--that it will be the \nonly issue we will be discussing for some extended period of time \nbecause for Nevada this is a life or death proposition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, there is going to be ample time in the \nmonths to come to debate this issue. As the Record is clear, this \nmatter was brought up by the majority leader today, and there were a \nnumber of Senators on the floor, including the two Senators from Nevada \nand the Democratic leader, who all objected to the motion to proceed. \nThe leader did say that he was going to, at some subsequent time, bring \nthis matter forward.\n  My purpose today is simply to state that the Senator from Alaska, who \nis the chairman of the committee that is trying to move this piece of \nlegislation, indicated he could speak for 7 or 8 days on the issue. I \nthink the Senator from Alaska is going to have to speak for 7 or 8 days \non the issue in an effort to move this matter forward.\n  The Senators from Nevada, and others who oppose this environmental \ndisaster, would speak for eight times 8 days in an effort to stop this \nmatter from moving forward. This legislation is bad legislation.\n  The fact that the nuclear power industry gave up on interim storage, \nwhat does that mean? It means there was an attempt by the nuclear power \nindustry--this all-powerful entity that has been so powerful in the \nCongress--for 4 or 5 years to set all environmental laws aside, the \nlaws that are established to protect the public in the characterization \nat Yucca Mountain. They moved to set all these environmental laws \naside, go to the Nevada Test Site, pour a big cement pad on top of the \nground, and then haul across the highways and railways across this \ncountry nuclear waste, dump it on top of the cement pad, and in effect \njust leave it there.\n  Everyone recognized that if this storage took place, this so-called \ninterim storage--which in the minds of the nuclear industry meant \npermanent--it would be permanent, it would never leave the Nevada Test \nSite.\n  The President of the United States said: I think we have to do \nsomething to take care of nuclear waste, but I think what is being \nattempted in the interim storage is wrong. If the Congress sends that \nto me, I am going to veto it.\n  We had a couple of test votes here, and it showed that we clearly had \nenough votes to sustain a Presidential veto on nuclear storage in an \ninterim fashion.\n  The nuclear power industry has said: We weren't able to do that. And \nwe don't want Yucca Mountain to go forward, as the law now stands. We \nwant to change the law.\n  How do they want to change the law? They want to, again, set \nenvironmental standards on their head, avoid environmental standards. \nWhat they want to do is have the Environmental Protection Agency--\nremember that name, the Environmental Protection Agency--removed from \nthe picture. The most poisonous substance known to man, plutonium, \nnuclear waste, they want to haul someplace, and the nuclear power \nindustry does not want the Environmental Protection Agency to have \nanything to do with it.\n  How in the world could you support legislation such as that? Instead \nof the Environmental Protection Agency, they want to insert the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. They want to have the fox guarding the hen \nhouse, literally.\n  Again, the President of the United States has stepped forward and \npublicly said: I am not going to allow that to happen.\n  All environmental groups in America, and probably in the world--\ncertainly I can speak about America--think this is bad legislation, and \nthey have spoken out accordingly. The President has again said: Go \nahead and pass this legislation. But if you do, I am going to veto it.\n  I do not know why, other than to pacify and satisfy the nuclear power \nindustry, you would bring this legislation forward. This legislation is \ndead. It has no chance of passing.\n  If they think they can bring in a subsequent President--that would \nhave to be, I assume, President Bush, if in fact he were lucky enough \nto be President--that is the only way this will ever pass because \nPresident Gore would never support this legislation.\n\n[[Page S13540]]\n\n  But in fact what they should do, to avoid all this wasted time in the \nSenate this year and next year, is just wait until the next \nPresidential election takes place. I think they will find they are \nprobably going to be faced with President Gore. But regardless of that, \nthey should at least wait because in the meantime they are wasting the \ntime of the Congress by playing around with this legislation.\n  I repeat: To take from the law the protection of the Environmental \nProtection Agency, it is not only that they are going to remove the \nEnvironmental protection Agency from this legislation but at the same \ntime they are changing the standards; they are reducing the standards; \nthey are making it easier to place nuclear waste.\n  We have always talked around here about the risks, the millirems, the \nway you measure the poison that comes into your system. We have \nmeasured that with adults. What we are going to talk about, at the \nright time as this legislation proceeds, is what this radiation would \ndo to children.\n  Children cannot take the same radiation that adults can. We have had \nthis debate on other issues. Lead, lead-based paint, lead in the \nenvironment is very harmful to children, not very harmful to adults--\nharmful to adults, but not nearly as harmful to adults as it is to \nchildren.\n  If you look at the risk to children, you see that the risk to \nchildren is very substantial. In fact, the risk to children is six \ntimes the maximum risk permitted by the EPA standards. They want to \nlower that.\n  The children living in the areas of Yucca Mountain and the areas that \nare going to transport this stuff will suffer as much as three times \nwhat an adult would.\n  So we are going to have time to talk about this. As I have indicated, \nwe can talk eight times 8 hours on this issue, and we are going to \ndevote at least a couple of hours of that time to the risk to children.\n  Ground water protection. Things nuclear are very dangerous to water. \nWe have learned at the Nevada Test Site, where we have set off 1,000 \nnuclear devices either above ground or in the ground, that it is being \ntransported in the water a lot quicker than we ever thought. Scientific \nproof is now present which shows there is tremendous danger in things \nnuclear to ground water. What they are trying to do with Yucca Mountain \nwill be very dangerous to water. But what about the water along the \nhighways and railways where it is being transported? Of course, it is \ndangerous there also.\n\n  In addition, earthquakes in the Nevada area of Yucca Mountain are \nvery significant. Yucca Mountain is located in the region with the \nsecond highest frequency of earthquakes in the entire country. It is \nhard to believe, but the Department of Energy selected the second most \nearthquake-prone place in the United States to site this nuclear \nrepository. There has been a series of earthquakes in this area in the \nlast couple of years--not one, but a series of earthquakes. It is \ncalled a cluster area; a clustering of earthquakes occurs in Yucca \nMountain naturally. We will have an opportunity to talk about that.\n  The cost of the program is something the American public needs to \nhear more about. This program already has cost about $7 billion. We \nknow the public has lost confidence. This is not something we are \nmaking up. We can look at what has transpired in Europe where they have \ntried to move nuclear waste. Last year, they tried to move a few casks \nof nuclear waste in Europe. They had to call out 30,000 soldiers and \npolice to move it. I think it is clear there is a loss of confidence in \nbeing able to transport nuclear waste.\n  We have talked on the Senate floor--we will have a lot more time to \nspend on it--about the shipments and where this nuclear waste will \ntravel. We know that at least 50 million people are located in an area \nwithin a mile of the highways and railways where it will be \ntransported. We know that there are terrorist threats. It is very easy \nto develop nuclear weapons. You can go on the Internet. For example, \nthe blast that blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma, they learned \nto do that over the Internet, how to mix fertilizer and whatever else \nyou mix to make this huge explosion. It is just as easy, if you have \nthe material, to come up with a nuclear device. That is one thing the \ntransportation of nuclear waste presents to us; how are we going to \nstop it. How are we going to prevent terrorists from stealing it?\n  We have had organizations that have followed small shipments of \nnuclear waste. They said there is no one guarding it. It is easy to \nfollow it. It could be stolen, if someone wanted to.\n  We know the canisters that have been developed are not safe for \ntransporting. They are safe for storage but not transporting. A \ncollision or a fire breaches the casks. Physicians for Social \nResponsibility are very concerned about nuclear waste and the dangers \nof nuclear waste. They testified on October 26, regarding the draft \nenvironmental impact statement, that the dangers associated with \nstoring an unprecedented amount of highly radioactive waste is very \ndangerous, and it is difficult to comprehend how it could be done \nsafely.\n  Finally, recognizing the day is late and my friend from Alabama \nwishes to speak, the obvious question people ask, if you are opposed to \ninterim storage and you don't want these standards changed at Yucca \nMountain, what should be done with nuclear waste? Easy question to \nanswer. Scientists have determined the best thing to do with nuclear \nwaste is leave it where it is, leave it where it is in dry cask storage \ncontainment. It would be safe. To set up one of these sites only costs \n$5 million. Only? Remember, Yucca Mountain is already approaching $7 \nbillion. So the constant harangue here, ``OK, if you don't want to put \nit in Nevada, where are you going to put it,'' is easy to answer.\n\n  The question wasn't so easy to answer a few years ago, but the \nscientific community has stepped forward and now, as is done right out \nhere, not far from Washington, DC, at Calvert Cliffs, nuclear waste is \nstored in dry cask storage containers, and it is stored safely--safe \nagainst fire, safe against transportation. And it is easy to secure it \nbecause it is in one centralized location. Of course, there would be a \nnumber of these locations around the country, but think of how much \nmore safe it is to have these multiple sites than trying to transport \nthis 70,000 tons across the highways and railways of this country.\n  In closing, we have a lot to talk about on this issue. I express \nappreciation to the President of the United States who is willing to \njoin with the environmental community in saying: Don't do it because if \nyou do, I will veto it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. REID. Will the gentleman from Alabama yield for a brief question \nabout procedure on the floor?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes, please.\n  Mr. REID. I apologize for interrupting. The Senator from Nevada would \nlike to leave. It is my understanding all the Senator from Alabama \nwishes to do is make a statement on nuclear waste and Senator Chafee. \nThere will be no motions or anything?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct. I do have the closing script.\n  Mr. REID. Which we have reviewed.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do think Senator Hutchison wants to talk on another \nmatter.\n  Mr. REID. But again, I am going to go back to my office. If there is \nanything further, I would appreciate a call.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand and respect the Senator's position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13540-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13540-S13542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE NUCLEAR POWER INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, for a lot of reasons, I believe the \nnuclear power industry cannot be a dinosaur, as was suggested earlier.\n  The world today has 6 billion people on it; 2 billion of those people \nhave no electricity. They are without power. In the next 25 years, we \nexpect another 2 billion people to be added to the world population. \nMany of the people who do have power today, have it only in very \nlimited quantities.\n  We know there is an extraordinary expansion of life expectancy and \nimprovement in lifestyle where electricity is present. People can have \nwater pumps. They don't have to go to the well with a bucket or a jug \nto get water for their families. There is no doubt the quality of \npeople's lives, the length of their lives, some estimate it increases \nas much as 50 percent, is\n\n[[Page S13541]]\n\ngreatly improved if they have access to electricity. Think about it.\n  As a matter of humanity, a human imperative, nothing could be better \nthan expanding the availability of electricity throughout the world. We \nnow know that there will be at least a 50-percent increase in \nelectricity generation by the year 2020, doubling by the year 2050. \nThat is a big increase.\n  Now at the same time, a number of people--Vice President Gore being \none of them--have expressed great concern over global warming and the \nemission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. They tried to commit \nthis country to a massive reduction in the emission of greenhouse \ngases. In fact, the Kyoto treaty the President signed and supports \ncalls on this Nation, between the years 2008 to 2012, to actually \nreduce our emissions by 7 percent below 1990 levels. When you consider \nat the same time our economy, population and demand for energy has \ncontinued to increase since 1990, greenhouse gas cuts envisioned by the \nKyoto treaty would amount to a cut of nearly one-third of today's \nenergy use in America to achieve that goal, a one-third cut. That is a \nbig-time number. We are heading for a train wreck. We want to reduce \nemissions and increase power generation at the same time, yet we refuse \nto develop new nuclear power infrastructure. Some greenies think you \nshould live out in the woods and just let the rain and sunshine take \ncare of you and maybe have a windmill to generate power. But that is \nnot proven to be efficient or effective. There will be opportunities to \nexpand the use of renewable energy, but it does not have the potential, \nusing even the most generous forecasts, to reach a level that would \nsatisfy the demands of the Kyoto treaty.\n\n  So how are we going to do it? Twenty percent of the power generated \nin the United States is generated by nuclear power. France has 80 \npercent. They continue to build nuclear power plants on a regular \nbasis. Look at it this way. Ask yourself, how can we meet the demand of \nboth increased energy and reduced emissions? Nuclear power has no \ngreenhouse gases that are emitted from the production of electricity. \nIt emits no waste into the atmosphere. It is the only large-scale \nclean-burning electricity production method. Yet, the very same people \nwho fight for even more stringent clean air regulations are often also \nopposed to nuclear power.\n  Twenty percent of our power, at this very moment, comes from nuclear \npower. Utility companies have not ordered a new plant since the late \n1970s, so it has been over 20 years since we have built a new nuclear \nplant. Other industrial nations are continuing to build them, such as \nFrance, Germany, and Japan and China. Do we want China to build coal \nplants to meet its massive need for electricity? Is that what we are \nasking them to do? Are we saying China can have it, but not us?\n  Fundamentally, we need to confront this question for humanity's sake. \nShould we increase the production of nuclear power? Through over 50 \nyears of experience with nuclear energy, there has not been a single \nAmerican injured from a nuclear plant, not a single person in the world \ninjured by the production of American-generated equipment for nuclear \npower? Not one. None. How many have died in coal mines, or on oil rigs, \nor from truck wrecks in transporting oil and coal, and train wrecks? \nWhich is safer, I submit to you?\n  This is an irrational thing to me. I can't understand such objection \nfrom those who long for a cleaner environment. I believe, first of all, \nwe need to understand that America needs more power to support our \ngrowing economy and population. The world needs more power. It will be \na good thing for the world. To meet these demands, we are going to have \nto use nuclear power. I don't just say this as a Member of the Senate. \nI am not an expert. However, last year I happened to be in attendance \nat the North Atlantic Assembly, in Edinburgh, Scotland, with members of \nParliaments from all over the world gathered there. Ambassador John B. \nRitch, III, addressed us. He is President Clinton's appointed \nAmbassador to the International Atomic Energy Administration. He shared \nsome important thoughts with us about the future of nuclear power. He \nmentioned some of the things I have already shared with you. From his \nremarks, he said:\n\n       Nuclear energy, the one technology able to meet large base-\n     load energy needs with negligible greenhouse emissions, \n     remains subject to what amounts to an intense, widespread \n     political taboo.\n\n  Then he goes on to point out that we cannot possibly meet our world \nenergy demands without increasing nuclear power. How is it we are not \nable to do that? How is it we have not been able to build a single \nnuclear plant in the United States, even though we have not had a \nsingle person injured from the operation of one since the conception of \nthe program over 50 years ago? How is that true?\n\n  Well, one of the tactics that has been used is to spread this fear \nthat nuclear waste is going to pollute the environment forever, and \nthat it can't be stored anywhere. It is just going to destroy the whole \nEarth if we do that. Well, that notion is so far from reality. I \nunderstand the Senators' political commitment to their State and maybe \nthey believe it is going to be somehow negative to their State. They \ntalked about how much exposure to radiation you are going to have. This \nstuff is not going to be thrown all over the sides of the highways. The \nwaste will be stored in a solid rock tunnel in the ground, inside \nthick, technologically advanced, containers within the tunnel. It is \nnot a lot of product. It doesn't take up a lot of space. It can be \nsafely stored.\n  Who is going to be subjected to any radiation from it? Are they going \nto bring schoolchildren down there to look at it? It is going to be \nsealed off from the public. The Yucca mountain site is in the remote \ndesert, in area that was previously used to test over 1000 atomic \nbombs.\n  Somebody said the Lord created that desert so we could put that waste \nthere. I don't know, but I say this to you. I don't see how the storage \nof very well-contained nuclear waste, placed hundreds of feet \nunderground in the Yucca Mountain chamber--inside a mountain--is going \nto damage the life, health, and safety of anybody. It is beyond my \ncomprehension that we would argue that. I know that maybe people don't \nlike it to come through their States. People don't like interstate \nhighways coming through their farms, and they don't want to move their \nhomes, so they object. But if the Government decides that is where the \ninterstate highway has to go for the good of all the people, they build \na highway. I used to be a Federal attorney and we would condemn \npeople's property and take it for public use.\n  Our country has 20 percent of its power generated by nuclear power \nplants, and we are incapable of finding a place in this whole vast \ncountry to put it? That is beyond my comprehension. We have to act \nresponsibly and take decisive action. Nuclear energy simply must remain \na part of our mix in the future.\n  I thought it was interesting that the Senator from Nevada indicated \nthat Vice President Gore would not sign this bill. Well, maybe he would \nnot sign this bill. Vice President Gore has also indicated that he \nflatly opposes offshore drilling for natural gas. Natural gas is the \nonly non-nuclear fuel which has a chance of filling the demand for new \npower while reducing overall air emissions in the near future. Gas is \nproduced predominantly from offshore wells. We have a significant \ndeposit off the gulf coast of the United States. Yet the Vice President \nopposes the development of these significant deposits of clean burning \nfuel.\n  But the Vice President not only opposes nuclear power, he opposes the \nstoring of nuclear waste in a sane way, in a single, guarded location--\nand not scattered in all 50 States, in hundreds of different locations. \nHe also opposes, as he said recently, offshore gas production.\n  How are we going to meet our demands for the future, I ask? I think \nthe Vice President's position is a very unsustainable position. It will \nnot hold up to scrutiny and he will have to answer to that. If we are \nnot going to use nuclear power and we are not going to use gas, what \nare we going to use? How can we do it without a huge cost and increase \nin expense for energy in America. The world is heading into a new \ncentury. Nuclear power is going to play a key role, without any doubt \nin my mind, in making the lives and the health of people all over this \nworld better tomorrow than it is today. It is\n\n[[Page S13542]]\n\ngoing to make people healthier. Their lifestyles are going to be \nbetter. They are going to have pumps to bring water to their homes. \nThey are going to have electric heating units to cook their food so \nthey do not have to go out and gather wood or waste to burn. And it is \ngoing to clean up our global environment in ways we have never known \nbefore. We have prospects, if we don't run from science and if we don't \nretreat from the future. If we go forward and take advantage of the \nopportunities given to us, we can really have a terrific century. I \nthink it is going to be better and better.\n\n  But it does make you wonder sometimes how people who seem to be \ncaring deeply for the environment and our future could block the things \nthat would be most helpful to us. That is a concern I have.\n  I hope we can reach the extra two votes. We have 65 votes. We need 67 \nto override a Presidential veto. There is bipartisan support--\nRepublicans and Democrats--for this bill. It is the right thing to do.\n  I urge the President not to veto it. If he does, I urge the Members \nof this body in both political parties to vote for clean air, vote for \nthe future, vote for improving the quality of our lives, both in the \nUnited States and the world. For over 50 years the United States has \nbeen a leader in the peaceful use of nuclear power. The United States \nneeds to continue to be a leader in this industry. We don't need to be \nsitting on the sidelines while the rest of the world is developing the \ntechnology to produce even safer electric power through nuclear energy \nand even greater productivity through nuclear energy.\n  I have had the opportunity to talk to some of the country's finest \nscientists. They are absolutely convinced that if we improve \nregulations, have a little more research and a little more commitment, \nwe can create a nuclear power plant that may even eliminate nuclear \nwaste entirely. But that is a step for the future, but the not too \ndistant future. It is an exciting time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13542-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PRESIDENTIAL VETO\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about President \nClinton's veto of the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill for \nfiscal year 2000. I am very concerned about this veto. It was a very \ndifficult bill. There is no question about it, given the budget caps \nthat both Congress and this administration adopted and agreed they \nwould adhere to.\n  Still, the bill provides the resources needed to continue our strong \nefforts to fight crime, enhance drug and border enforcement, respond to \nthe threat of terrorism, and help women and children who are victims of \nfamily violence. A key component of our crime-fighting effort is \nstopping drugs at our borders. Thanks to Senator Judd Gregg and Senator \nFritz Hollings, this bill provides for 1,000 new Border Patrol agents \nto guard our borders.\n  The President's decision to veto the bill makes clear that funding \nfor these critical matters is not a priority to the President. Despite \nour budget constraints and our need to preserve Social Security, this \nbill provides nearly $3 billion more than last year's bill. This bill \nis not a cut; it is an increase.\n  The President said he vetoed the bill because it didn't fully fund \nhis COPS Program. The reality is that Congress provided funding for \n100,000 police for our cities all over America 2 years ago. In fact, we \nhave provided funding for 115,000 police. The President says he wants \n30,000 to 50,000 more, but the irony is he hasn't even met the first \ngoal. We still don't have more than 60,000 police on the streets. Yet \nhe is vetoing the bill when the funding is there. The full funding was \ngiven by Congress with the excuse that he wants 30,000 to 50,000 more \nwhen he has 40,000 that are fully funded that he has not been able to \nfill.\n  I am concerned because this is not the only law enforcement \ninitiative in which the President has failed. This administration was \nunder direction from Congress to hire 1,000 new border guards in 1999. \nIt failed when only 200 to 400 were actually hired. Yet every penny of \nthe money that went to the 1,000 has been spent. Yet this year in the \nbudget that the President has just vetoed, the President didn't ask for \none new Border Patrol agent.\n  I ask, what is the role of the Federal Government? Is it to put \npolice on the streets of our cities or is it to guard the sovereignty \nof our Nation, the borders of our Nation? I think the President of the \nUnited States is not fulfilling his responsibility when Congress comes \nforward and says we are going to guard the borders of our country; we \nare going to provide for police on streets as requested, and he vetoes \nthe bill and asks for no new Border Patrol agents.\n  Our border is a sieve. The distinguished chair and I both represent \nStates on the Southwest border. There is no other way to describe it \nwhen an estimated $10 billion in marijuana, heroin, cocaine, and other \ndrugs crossed our border last year, according to the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. These drugs find their way to cities and school \nyards all over America. This is not just the Southwest. It is not just \nTexas, Arizona, New Mexico, and California. These illegal drugs go all \nover the country. They end up in the school yards, preying on our \nchildren. We are a gateway, but we are not the stopping point. They are \ncoming in record numbers. In 1998, there were over 6,000 drug seizures \nalong the Southwest border. The total value was $1.28 billion. Our drug \nczar, General McCaffrey, has argued we should have 20,000 Border Patrol \nforces to stop the flow of drugs across our border.\n  A University of Texas study last year indicates 16,133 agents are \nneeded to do the job. We have about 8,000--less than half of that \nneeded to do the job, which is the responsibility of the Federal \nGovernment and which Congress is trying to provide, with no cooperation \nfrom this administration. Only 200 to 400 are likely to be hired this \nyear, according to the administration's own records.\n  I think the President of the United States needs to stop the \nrhetoric. He needs to stop playing games with important appropriations \nbills and do something that is going to stop illegal immigration and \nillegal drugs coming through our borders and spreading all over our \ncountry. The President needs to fulfill the commitments he has already \nmade and that we have funded to get 1,000 police officers on the \nstreets and 1,000 more Border Patrol agents each year, for 5 years, as \nCongress has directed the administration to do.\n  Vetoing this bill does not help crime-fighting efforts. Signing the \nbill, keeping his promises for police and Border Patrol does.\n  I am very concerned the President of the United States has not taken \nseriously enough the need to control our borders, from illegal \nimmigration to illegal drugs. Vetoing the Commerce-State-Justice bill \nshows that he is not taking this seriously, as Congress most certainly \nis. I urge the President to understand how important this issue is and \nto start doing what Congress has directed and what his own drug czar is \nrecommending; that is, start working toward 20,000 Border Patrol agents \nwho keep the sovereign borders of our country safe and secure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13542-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13542-S13543]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National \nWomen's Business Week, a series of national events held recently to \nrecognize and celebrate women entrepreneurship.\n  Women now own 38 percent of all businesses in this country, and it \nhas been reported that half of all new businesses started today are \nstarted by women. In my home state of Texas alone, there are now \n627,300 woman-owned businesses employing 1.8 million people and \ngenerating $222 billion in annual sales, a growth of 157 percent over \nthe last seven years.\n  As a former small business owner, I know it is no easy feat to \ndevelop a business plan, generate the necessary start-up and operating \ncapital, and make a payroll when you start a business. As if all those \neconomic hurdles were not enough, small business owners in this country \nmust comply with literally hundreds of local, state, and federal \nlicensure, regulatory, and tax laws and requirements.\n  That tens of thousands of small businesses do get started in this \ncountry every year is truly a testament to the vision and hard work of \nso many Americans, especially American women.\n\n[[Page S13543]]\n\n Women like Patricia Pliego Stout, owner of the Alamo Travel Group, \nheadquartered in San Antonio. Ms. Pliego Stout has grown a small travel \nbusiness into the fourth largest agency in San Antonio. In recognition \nof her achievements and, as importantly, her encouragement and support \nof other women entrepreneurs in Texas, Ms. Pliego Stout was recently \nappointed to the National Women's Business Council, which promotes the \ngoal of woman business ownership.\n  There are countless other success stories, as well. Unfortunately, \nthere are also far too many stories of lack of access to adequate \ncapital, of inability to break into established government and \ncontracting networks, and other problems that continue to hamper women \nas they seek to become financially independent and to contribute to \ntheir greater economy and community.\n  As a United States Senator, I have worked hard to break down some of \nthese barriers, and to open more opportunities to more people of all \nbackgrounds and talents. In particular, I was proud to have been able \nto lead the effort in Congress to establish a 5 percent federal \ngovernment-wide contracting goal for woman-owned small businesses. In \naddition, I have worked to expand such successful federal efforts as \nthe Women's Business Centers program, which helps women with those \ncritical first steps of starting a business. In addition, of assistance \nto all small businesses, including a disproportionate number of woman-\nowned businesses, I have worked to limit the federal government \nprocurement practice of ``bundling'' contracts, which can also leave \nnewly-formed firms out of the contracting game.\n  Mr. President, I again congratulate the women in Texas and across the \nnation who every day continue to overcome obstacles and who create \nsuccess, jobs, and wealth through their sheer determination and energy. \nThe events and activities of National Women's Business Week are \nevidence that women business ownership is alive and well, to the \nbetterment of us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13543-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13543-S13544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     AGRICULTURAL JOB OPPORTUNITY BENEFITS AND SECURITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise with Senators Graham, \nCraig, Cleland, McConnell, Coverdell, Mack, Cochran, Helms, Grams, \nCrapo, Bunning, and Voinovich to encourage support of S. 1814, the \nAgricultural Job Opportunity Benefits and Security Act of 1999.\n  Our bill will reform the agricultural labor market, establish and \nmaintain immigration control, provide a legal workforce for our \nfarmers, and restore the dignity to the lives of thousands of \nfarmworkers who have helped make the U.S. economy the powerhouse that \nit is today.\n  I am sure you are aware of the problems that have arisen within \nAmerican agriculture. For many years, employers in the agricultural \nindustry have struggled to hire enough legal workers to harvest their \nproduce and plants.\n  As one of the most rapidly growing industries in this country, we can \nonly expect the demand for agricultural labor jobs to continue to rise. \nWhen coupled with the lowest unemployment rates in decades, a crackdown \non illegal immigration, and increased Social Security audits, the \nagriculture industry--and ultimately its consumers--face a crisis of \ndevastating proportions.\n  Contrary to some media accounts, these labor shortages and the need \nfor a revised H-2A temporary foreign worker program exist around the \ncountry. Mr. President, my colleagues all agree with the General \nAccounting Office's (GAO) statement that while the labor shortage is \nnot caused by one single problem, regional shortages stemming from \nregion-specific problems do exist.\n  We have a shortage of legal workers in this country and the GAO \nestimates that there are in excess of 600,000 self-identified illegal \naliens currently employed in U.S. agriculture. Another survey done by \nthe Department of Labor also revealed that more than 70 percent, or \nabout 1 million, of those hired to work on U.S. farms are here \nillegally.\n  Due to the highly sophisticated fraudulent documents in circulation \nand strict U.S. laws prohibiting employers from scrutinizing these \ndocuments too carefully, thousands of illegal workers have been \nunknowingly hired as a result. This situation leaves many agricultural \nemployers vulnerable to potential labor shortfalls in the event of \nconcentrated or targeted Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) \nenforcement efforts or Social Security Administration audits.\n  Immigrants are also severely impacted when they must work as \nundocumented workers. These foreign workers risk their lives paying \nhuman ``coyotes'' $1,200 to be smuggled across the desert border in the \ntrunk of a car to work in this country. Because of the risks these \nforeign workers face in coming here and the difficulty of returning if \nthey leave for a visit home, many go for years without seeing their \nspouses and children, some never return home. These illegal workers are \nextremely vulnerable to these ``coyotes'' and other dark elements of \nsociety that prey upon them, prohibiting the basic human rights of \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n  A recent survey published by the William C. Velasquez Institute \ndemonstrated that a vast majority of registered Latino voters support a \nnew farmworker program. In addition to supporting higher wages and \nunionization for farmworkers, the overwhelming majority of registered \nLatino voters--76% in California and 67% in Texas--supported a program \nwhere ``illegal immigrant'' farmworkers were allowed to become \npermanent residents in exchange for several years of mandatory \nagricultural labor.\n  This poll clearly demonstrates that the current farm labor system \nserves no one well. Farmworkers support changing an illegal system that \nvictimizes them and their families.\n  This issue is not new to Congress. Our government's H-2A agricultural \nguest worker program was designed in part to help solve the labor \nproblems facing our farmers. Instead of helping, the H-2A program--the \nonly legal temporary agricultural worker program in the United States--\nit merely adds bureaucratic red tape and burdensome regulations to the \ngrowing crisis. And it is failing those who use it.\n  The H-2A program is not practicable for the agriculture and \nhorticulture industry because it is loaded with burdensome regulations, \nexcessive paperwork, a bureaucratic certification process and untimely, \ninconsistent, and hostile decision-making by the U.S. Department of \nLabor. This program is over 50 years old.\n  To illustrate, Mr. President, this is the application I filled out to \nrun for the United States Senate. It is one page, front and back.\n  This is the Department of Labor's 325-page handbook, from January \n1988, which attempts to guide employers through the H-2A program's \nconfusing application process. The GAO itself found that this handbook \nis outdated, incomplete, and very confusing to the user.\n  Even the December 1997 GAO report illustrated the burdensome H-2A \nprocess with which employers must comply in order to bring in legal, \nforeign workers. A grower must apply to multiple agencies to obtain \njust one H-2A worker. This process is further complicated by the \nmultiple levels of government, redundant levels of oversight and \nconflicting administrative procedures and regulations. Also, as \nreported by the recent Department of Labor Inspector General, the H-2A \nprogram does not meet the interests of domestic workers because it does \na poor job of placing domestic workers in agricultural jobs.\n  We are looking for solutions to not only make it easier for employers \nto hire legal workers to harvest their crops, but also to ensure that \nU.S. workers find jobs and are treated fairly in the process.\n\n  Our bill is a win-win-win for farmers, farmworkers, and immigration \ncontrol. It reforms the agricultural labor market and establishes and \nmaintains immigration control. It gives farmers the stability of a \nlegal workforce and the certainty that the crops will be harvested in a \ntimely manner. It gives farmworkers the ability to earn the right to \nlegal status, avoid the risks of undocumented status and receive U.S. \nlabor law protections. It addresses a status quo that persons on both \nsides of the issue agree is indefensible, but until now, has been too \neasy to ignore. It is a balanced bill that seeks both\n\n[[Page S13544]]\n\nshort and long-term solutions to the crisis in farm labor.\n  Our bill will allow farmworkers who have a proven history of \nagricultural employment to eventually adjust to legal status in this \ncountry. Serious agricultural workers who are willing to commit to work \nseveral years in agricultural employment will receive nonimmigrant \nstatus and the rights that go with it.\n  If employment requirements are met, workers can eventually adjust to \npermanent resident status, allowing them to remain in the U.S. year-\nround. Utilizing the skills of the existing farmworker workforce, a \nmajority of whom are undocumented status in the United States, would \nreduce the number of temporary H-2A workers needed. It allows \nhardworking farmworkers seeking to better themselves and their families \nthe opportunity to earn the right to legal status.\n  At the same time, the current temporary farmworker program--called H-\n2A--will be reformed to make it more responsive, affordable and usable \nby the average family farmer who needs temporary help to produce and \nharvest agricultural crops and commodities. The need and risks of \nillegal immigration are removed.\n  Our bill provides a system or registry where our unemployed U.S. \nworkers can go to find out about job openings on our U.S. farms. Any \nlegal U.S. resident who wants to work in agriculture will get the \nabsolute right of first refusal for any and all jobs that become \navailable. After the Department of Labor determines that a shortage of \ndomestic workers exists, farmers would be able to recruit adjusted \nworkers. If a shortage of adjusted workers is found, farmers could then \nutilize H-2A workers. This ensures that employers hire workers already \nin the U.S. before recruiting foreign guest workers.\n  Our bill also improves the conditions of the farm workers' lives and \nprovide them the dignity they deserve. These needed benefits include \nproviding a premium wage, providing housing and transportation \nbenefits, guaranteeing basic workplace protections, and extending the \nMigrant and Seasonal Workers Protection Act to all workers.\n  To add more protections for the health, safety, and security of \nfarmworkers, our bill establishes a commission that would study \nproblems with farmworker housing. Our bill also directs the Department \nof Labor and Department of Agriculture to study field sanitation, \nchildcare and child labor violations, labor standards enforcement and \nto ultimately make recommendations for long-term changes and \nimprovements.\n  I am very concerned that workers are protected, but let's not forget \nthat growers have been victimized by this process too. In order to feed \ntheir families--and yours--the growers need to harvest their crops on \ntime, meet their payroll, and ultimately maintain their bottom line. \nWithout achieving those things, farms go out of business and the jobs \nthey create are lost along with them. So it is in all of our best \ninterests--workers, growers, and consumers alike--that growers have the \nmeans by which to hire needed legal workers.\n  While I don't have a crystal ball to predict the future of the \nindefensible status quo, I can tell you that we will have a major \neconomic and social crisis on our U.S. farmlands if there is not an \nimprovement over the current process.\n  Let's not keep making fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of \nfarmers.\n  I urge my fellow colleagues to join Senators Graham, Craig, Cleland, \nMcConnell, Coverdell, Mack, Cochran, Helms, Grams, Crapo, Bunning, \nVoinovich, and me in support of this important bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13544-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13544]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CHILDREN'S MARCH FOR GUN CONTROL\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, yesterday, students from around the country \ncame to Washington to ask for help. Students participating in the \nChildren's March for Gun Control marched hand-in-hand to Capitol Hill \nwith a simple demand: to keep them safe from guns.\n  Members of Congress should tune out the NRA, and start listening to \nthese children--who have to face the fear of guns everyday. The \nchildren from across the country are pleading that Congress create an \nenvironment free from fear and violence. These children are armed, not \nwith firearms, but with letters, urging Congress to end the epidemic of \ngun violence that claims the lives of thousands of their peers each \nyear.\n  Yet, while Congress should be passing comprehensive legislation to \nprevent school shootings like those in Conyers, Littleton, Springfield, \nEdinboro, Jonesboro, West Paducah, Pearl and the many others, it cannot \neven muster enough votes to take UZIs and AK-47s out of the hands of 15 \nyear olds. After Columbine, the Senate took a few steps to protect \nchildren from gun violence. We passed legislation to prohibit juveniles \nfrom owning semiautomatic weapons and large capacity ammunition \ndevices. We passed an amendment to require that handguns be sold with \ntrigger locking devices to protect children. And we passed an amendment \nto close the gun show loophole, ensuring juveniles and others cannot \nuse these shows as a convenient way to circumvent the safeguards \napplied to normal sales through licensed gun dealers.\n  That legislation was a first step, but it still falls short of \nclosing loopholes which allow our youth easy access to deadly weapons. \nFor example, one of our most important tasks yet will be to ban \nhandguns and semiautomatic assault weapons for persons under 21 years \nof age. Yet, even the most minimal effort to end gun violence has been \nstymied in the House of Representatives, where they have passed no gun \nsafety legislation. And any effort to come to some agreement has been \nrepeatedly stalled by the Republican leadership.\n  It was great to welcome such a group of dedicated young people to the \nnation's Capitol. I encourage them to keep up their effort and to speak \nout for those children who have been silenced by guns. Over time, these \nchildren are sure to accomplish what other nations have done: end the \nplague of gun violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13544-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13544-S13547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          LONG-PENDING JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS BEFORE THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Majority Leader for the \nproposal he made to the Senate last night on moving a portion of the \nExecutive Calendar. I would like to see those nominees he mentioned \nconfirmed as well as the others on the calendar. I want to work with \nhim to have them all considered and confirmed. I want to be sure that \nthe Senate treats them all fairly and accords each of them an \nopportunity for an up or down vote. I want to share with you a few of \nthe cases that cry out for a Senate vote:\n  The first is Judge Richard Paez. He is a judicial nominee who has \nbeen awaiting consideration and confirmation by the Senate since \nJanuary 1996--for over 3\\1/2\\ years. The vacancy for which Judge Paez \nwas nominated became a judicial emergency during the time his \nnomination has been pending without action by the Senate. His \nnomination was first received by the Senate almost 45 months ago and is \nstill without a Senate vote. That is unconscionable.\n  Judge Paez has twice been reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee to the Senate for final action. He is again on the Senate \ncalendar. He was delayed 25 months before finally being accorded a \nconfirmation hearing in February 1998. After being reported by the \nJudiciary Committee initially in March 1998, his nomination was held on \nthe Senate Executive Calendar without action or explanation for over 7 \nmonths, for the remainder of the last Congress.\n  Judge Paez was renominated by the President again this year and his \nnomination was stalled without action before the Judiciary Committee \nuntil late July, when the Committee reported his nomination to the \nSenate for the second time. The Senate refused to consider the \nnomination before the August recess. I have repeatedly urged the \nRepublican leadership to call this nomination up for consideration and \na vote. The Republican leadership in the Senate has refused to schedule \nthis nomination for an up or down vote.\n  Judge Paez has the strong support of both California Senators and a \n`well-qualified' rating from the American Bar Association. He has \nserved as a municipal judge for 13 years and as a federal judge for \nfour years.\n  In my view Judge Paez should be commended for the years he worked to\n\n[[Page S13545]]\n\nprovide legal services and access to our justice system for those \nwithout the financial resources otherwise to retain counsel. His work \nwith the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the Western Center on Law \nand Poverty and California Rural Legal Assistance for 9 years should be \na source of praise and pride.\n  Judge Paez has had the strong support of California judges and law \nenforcement representatives familiar with his work, such as Justice H. \nWalter Crosky, and support from an impressive array of law enforcement \nofficials, including Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles District Attorney; \nthe late Sherman Block, then Los Angeles County Sheriff; the Los \nAngeles County Police Chiefs' Association; and the Association for Los \nAngeles Deputy Sheriffs.\n  I have previously commended the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nfor his support of this nominee and Senator Boxer and Senator Feinstein \nof California for their efforts on his behalf. In the Senate's vote \nearlier this month on the nomination of Justice Ronnie White, \nRepublican Senators justified their vote by deferring to home state \nSenators and local law enforcement. When it comes to Judge Paez, he has \nthe strong support of both home state Senators and local law \nenforcement. Accordingly, I would hope and expect that the Senate will \nsee a strong Republican vote for Judge Paez.\n  The Hispanic National Bar Association, the Mexican American Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, the League of United Latin American \nCitizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, and many, many others have been seeking a vote on this \nnomination for what now amounts to years.\n  Last year the words of the Chief Justice of the United States were \nringing in our ears with respect to the delays in Senate consideration \nof judicial nomination. He had written:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor \n     vote. . . . The Senate is surely under no obligation to \n     confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary \n     time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Richard Paez's nomination to the Ninth Circuit had already been \npending for 24 months when the Chief Justice issued that statement--and \nthat was almost 2 years ago. The Chief Justice's words resound in \nconnection with the nomination of Judge Paez. He has twice been \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee. It was been pending for \n45 months. The court to which he was nominated has multiple vacancies. \nIn fairness to Judge Paez and all the people served by the Ninth \nCircuit, the Senate should vote on this nomination.\n  I have been concerned for the last several years that it seems women \nand minority nominees are being delayed and not considered. I spoke to \nthe Senate about this situation on May 22, June 22 and, again, on \nOctober 8 last year, and a number of times this year, including on \nOctober 15 and October 21. Over the last couple of years the Senate has \nfailed to act on the nominations of Judge James A. Beaty, Jr. to be the \nfirst African-American judge on the Fourth Circuit; Jorge C. Rangel to \nthe Fifth Circuit; Clarence J. Sundram to the District Court for the \nNorthern District of New York; Anabelle Rodriguez to the District Court \nin Puerto Rico; and many others.\n  In explaining why he chose to withdraw from consideration for \nrenomination after waiting 15 months for Senate action, Jorge Rangel \nwrote to the President and explained:\n\n       Our judicial system depends on men and women of good will \n     who agree to serve when asked to do so. But public service \n     asks too much when those of us who answer the call to service \n     are subjected to a confirmation process dominated by \n     interminable delays and inaction. Patience has its virtues, \n     but it also has its limits.\n\n  Last year the average for all nominees confirmed was over 230 days \nand 11 nominees confirmed last year took longer than 9 months: Judge \nWilliam Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--it became the longest-\npending judicial nomination in the history of the United States, a \nrecord now held by Judge Paez; Judge Hilda Tagle's confirmation took 32 \nmonths, Judge Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 months, Judge \nAnn Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Judge Margaret McKeown's \nconfirmation took 24 months, Judge Margaret Morrow's confirmation took \n21 months, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Judge \nRebecca Pallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Judge Ivan Lemelle's \nconfirmation took 14 months, Judge Dan Polster's confirmation took 12 \nmonths, and Judge Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months. Of \nthese 11, 8 are women or minority nominees. Another was Professor \nFletcher who was held up, in large measure because of opposition to his \nmother, Judge Betty Fletcher.\n  In 1997, of the 36 nominations eventually confirmed, 9, fully one-\nquarter of all those confirmed, took more than 9 months before a final \nfavorable Senate vote.\n  In 1996, the Republican Senate shattered the previous record for the \naverage number of days from nomination to confirmation for judicial \nconfirmation. The average rose to a record 183 days. In 1997, the \naverage number of days from nomination to confirmation rose \ndramatically yet again, and that was during the first year of a \npresidential term. From initial nomination to confirmation, the average \ntime it took for Senate action on the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke \nthe 200-day barrier for the first time in our history. It was 212 days.\n  Unfortunately, that time grew again last year to the detriment of the \nadministration of justice. Last year the Senate broke its dismal \nrecord. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 \njudges confirmed in 1998 was over 230 days. The independent and \nbipartisan study of Task Force on Judicial Selection formed by Citizens \nfor Independent Courts recently confirmed what I have been observing \nfor the past few years--the time to consider judicial nominations has \nbeen increased significantly over the last few years and women and \nminority judicial nominees are more likely to take significantly longer \nto be considered, if they are considered at all.\n  We have had too many cases in which it has taken women nominees years \nbefore the Judiciary Committee would act and the Senate would vote. \nEventually, we have been able to confirm many of these outstanding \nnominees, people like Margaret Morrow, Sonia Sotomayor, Ann Aiken, \nMargaret McKeown and Susan Oki Mollway. The current victim of the \nextensive delays caused by unusually intensive scrutiny of many women \njudicial nominees is Marsha Berzon.\n  Marsha Berzon is one of the most qualified nominees I have seen in 25 \nyears, and Senator Hatch has agreed with that assessment publically. He \nvoted for her in the Judiciary Committee. Her legal skills are \noutstanding, her practice and productivity have been extraordinary. \nLawyers against whom she has litigated regard her as highly qualified \nfor the bench. She was first nominated in January 1998, some 20 months \nago. Her nomination remains the subject of ``secret holds'' from \nanonymous Senate Republicans.\n\n  Senator Feinstein has made the point that it may be subtle forms of \ndisparate treatment and double standards to which these nominations are \nsubjected. She has lectured the Committee and the Senate from time to \ntime on our insensitivity to the experiences of these nominees. Women \nstill do not have the good old boy network of some nominees and often \nshow leadership and get experience by being involved in community \nactivities and with charities and with organizations that some \nconservative Republicans apparently view negatively and with suspicion.\n  Marsha Berzon is an outstanding nominee. By all accounts, she is an \nexceptional lawyer with extensive appellate experience, including a \nnumber of cases heard by the Supreme Court. She has the strong support \nof both California Senators and a well-qualified rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  She was initially nominated in January 1998, 21 months ago. She \nparticipated in an extensive two-part confirmation hearing before the \nCommittee back on July 30, 1998. Thereafter she received a number of \nsets of written questions from a number of Senators and responded in \nAugust of last year. A second round of written\n\n[[Page S13546]]\n\nquestions was sent and she responded by the middle of September of last \nyear. Despite the efforts of Senator Feinstein, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Specter and myself to have her considered by the Committee, she \nwas not included on an agenda and not voted on during all of 1998. Her \nnomination was returned to the President without action by this \nCommittee or the Senate last October.\n  This year the President renominated Ms. Berzon in January. She \nparticipated in her second confirmation hearing in June, was sent \nadditional sets of written questions, responded and got and answered \nanother round. I do not know why those questions were not asked last \nyear.\n  Finally, on July 1 almost 4 months ago, the Committee considered the \nnomination and agreed to report it to the Senate favorably. After more \nthan a year and one-half the Senate should, at long last, vote on the \nnomination. Senators who find some reason to oppose this exceptionally \nqualified woman lawyer can vote against her if they choose, but she \nshould be accorded an up or down vote. That is what I have been asking \nfor and that is what fairness demands.\n  Senator Hatch was right 2 years ago when he called for an end to the \npolitical game that has infected the confirmation process. These are \nreal people whose lives are affected. Judge Richard Paez has been \nwaiting patiently for 45 months, almost 4 years, for the Republican \nSenate to vote on his nomination, a nomination that Senator Hatch voted \nfor twice. Marsha Berzon has been held hostage for 21 months not \nknowing what to make of her private practice or when the Senate will \ndeem it appropriate to finally vote on her nomination.\n  Last week I received a Resolution from the National Association of \nWomen Judges. I hope that the Senate will respond to Resolution, in \nwhich the NAWJ urges expeditious action on nominations to federal \njudicial vacancies. The President of the Women Judges, Judge Mary \nSchroeder, is right when she cautions that ``few first-rate potential \nnominees will be willing to endure such a tortured process'' and the \ncountry will pay a high price for driving away outstanding candidates \nto fill these important positions. The Resolution notes the scores of \ncontinuing vacancies with highly qualified women and men nominees and \nthe nonpartisan study of delays in the confirmation process, and even \nmore extensive delays for women nominees, found by the Task Force on \nJudicial Selection formed by Citizens for Independent Courts. The \nResolution notes that such delay ``is costly and unfair to litigants \nand the individual nominees and their families whose lives and career \nare on hold for the duration of the protracted process.'' In \nconclusion, the National Association of Women Judges ``urges the Senate \nof the United States to bring the pending nominations for the federal \njudiciary to an expeditious vote so that those who have been nominated \ncan get on with their lives and these vacancies can be filled.''\n  Although this is not just about numbers, the numbers are damning. So \nfar this year the Senate has received 70 judicial nominations and \nconfirmed only 25. By this time last year, the Senate had confirmed 66 \njudges--more than twice as many. By this time in 1992, the last year of \nPresident Bush's term, a Democratic Senate had confirmed 64 judges. By \nthis time in 1994, a Democratic Senate had confirmed over 100 judges.\n  There are judicial emergencies vacancies all over the country. The \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals has had to declare that entire Circuit \nin an emergency. Its workload has gone up 65 percent in the last 9 \nyears; but they are being forced to operate with almost one-quarter of \ntheir bench vacant. The Senate has not given any attention to the two \nnominees pending in Committee--either Enrique Moreno or Alston Johnson.\n  We had a similar emergency a year or so ago in the Second Circuit. We \nfinally ended that crisis when we fought through secret Republican \nholds and got the Senate after 15 months to vote on the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor. She was confirmed overwhelmingly.\n  At the time I was struck by an article by Paul Gigot in the Wall \nStreet Journal, which explained why Judge Sotomayor was being held up--\nit was not because she was not qualified to serve on the Second Circuit \nbut because some felt that she was so well qualified President Clinton \nmight nominate her to the United States Supreme Court if a vacancy were \nto arise. Imagine that, anonymous holds to ensure that a superbly \ntalented Hispanic woman judge not be seen as a good bet to nominate to \nthe Supreme Court. I fear that the opposition to Marsha Berzon may \npartake of some of this kind of thinking. She is so well qualified, so \nclearly likely to be an outstanding judge on the Ninth Circuit, that \nperhaps some anonymous Republican Senators are afraid that she will be \ntoo good, that her opinions will be too well reasoned that her \napplication of the law will be too sound.\n  Weeks ago the Majority Leader came to the floor and said that he \nwould try to find a way to have the Paez and Berzon nominations \nconsidered by the Senate. I have tried to work with Majority Leader on \nall of these nominations. I would like to work with those Senators whom \nthe Majority Leader is protecting from having to vote on the Paez and \nBerzon nominations, but I do not know who they are. Despite the policy \nannounced at the beginning of this year doing away with ``secret \nholds,'' that is what Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon still confront as \ntheir nominations continue to be obstructed under a cloak of anonymity \nafter 45 months and 21 months, respectively. That is wrong and unfair.\n  This continuing delay demeans the Senate, itself. I have great \nrespect for this institution and its traditions. Still, I must say that \nthis use of secret holds for extended periods that doom a nomination \nfrom ever being considered by the United States Senate is wrong and \nunfair and beneath us. Who is it that is afraid to vote on these \nnominations? Who is it that is hiding their opposition and obstruction \nof these nominees? After almost 4 years with respect to Judge Paez and \nalmost 2 years with respect to Marsha Berzon, it is time for the Senate \nto vote up-or-down on these nominations.\n  The Senate should be fair and vote on these nominations. Anonymous \nRepublican Senators are being unfair to the judicial nominees on the \ncalendar. These qualified nominees are entitled to an up or down vote, \ntoo.\n  The Atlanta Constitution noted recently:\n\n       Two U.S. appellate court nominees, Richard Paez and Marsha \n     Berzon, both of California, have been on hold for four years \n     and 20 months respectively. When Democrats tried . . . to get \n     their colleagues to vote on the pair at long last, the \n     Republicans scuttled the maneuver. . . . This partisan \n     stalling, this refusal to vote up or down on nominees, is \n     unconscionable. It is not fair. It is not right. It is no way \n     to run the federal judiciary. . . . This ideological \n     obstructionism is so fierce that it strains our justice \n     system and sets a terrible partisan example for years to \n     come.\n\n  It is against this backdrop that I, again, ask the Senate to be fair \nto these judicial nominees and all nominees. For the last few years the \nSenate has allowed one or two or three secret holds to stop judicial \nnominations from even getting a vote. That is wrong.\n  The Washington Post has noted:\n\n       [T]he Constitution does not make the Senate's role in the \n     confirmation process optional, and the Senate ends up \n     abdicating responsibility when the majority leader denies \n     nominees a timely vote. All the nominees awaiting floor votes \n     . . . should receive them immediately.\n\n  The Florida Sun-Sentinel has written:\n\n       The ``Big Stall'' in the U.S. Senate continues, as senators \n     work slower and slower each year in confirming badly needed \n     federal judges. . . . This worsening process is inexcusable, \n     bordering on malfeasance in office, especially given the \n     urgent need to fill vacancies on a badly undermanned federal \n     bench. . . . The stalling, in many cases, is nothing more \n     than a partisan political dirty trick.\n\n  Nominees deserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed \nfor 2 and 3 and 4 years. I continue to urge the Republican Senate \nleadership to proceed to vote on the nominations of Judge Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon. There was never a justification for the Republican \nmajority to deny these judicial nominees a fair up or down vote. There \nis no excuse for their continuing failure to do so.\n  Acting to fill judicial vacancies is a constitutional duty that the \nSenate--and all of its members--are obligated to fulfill. In its \nunprecedented slowdown in the handling of nominees since\n\n[[Page S13547]]\n\nthe 104th Congress, the Senate is shirking its duty. That is wrong and \nshould end. These are the nominations that the Senate on which the \nSenate should be working toward action.\n  I understand that nominations are not considered in lockstep order \nbased on the date of receipt. I understand and respect the prerogatives \nof the majority party and the Republican leader. I do not want to \noppose any nomination on the calendar and only ask that the Senate be \nfair to these other nominees, as well. Nominees like Judge Richard Paez \nand Marsha Berzon should be voted on up or down by the Senate. We are \nasking and have been asking the Republican leadership to schedule votes \non those nominations so that action on all the nominations can move \nforward.\n  I know that there were no objections on the Democratic side of the \naisle to the three judicial nominations that the Majority Leader \nincluded in his proposal last night. No Democrat has a hold on the \nnominations of Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, Barbara Lynn or Ronald \nGould. No Democrat has any objection to proceeding to confirm by voice \nvote or to proceed to roll call votes on these nominations. No \nDemocratic Senator has any objection to proceeding to confirm by voice \nvote or to proceed to rollcall votes on any of the 9 judicial \nnominations on the Senate's executive calendar. What we do ask is that \nJudge Paez and Marsha Berzon not be left on the calendar without a vote \nat the end of another session of Congress. We have been unable even to \nobtain a commitment from the Majority Leader to schedule a fair up or \ndown vote on these nominations at any time in the future. We \nrespectfully request his help in scheduling such action by the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13547-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF R.

Mr. President, this has not been a good week--losing a \nfriend and colleague; Payne Stewart, and, yes, another friend here in \nthis town who had a government relations job.\n  We often hear the word ``lobbyist'' put in a negative tone, but this \nwas a man who built a reputation of integrity and honesty in government \nrelations.\n  This week, cancer claimed R. Duffy Wall. He died at his home on the \nEastern Shore. He was friend and mentor.\n  You know what we would be without the folks who work in different \nareas of American life who represent that way of life to the Congress \nof the United States. We are not all wise. We do not know everything \nabout everything. We need help. Duffy Wall was such a person--honest, \nstraight shooter, a friend, dead at age 57, far too young. We will not \nget to use his services and wisdom anymore either.\n  I could talk longer about these friends. This has been a bad week, \nespecially losing our Senator and losing a person very close to us.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the notes on Mr. Wall and \nhis obituary be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 25, 1999.\n       Following a long battle against lung cancer, R. Duffy Wall, \n     57, died yesterday at his home on the Eastern Shore--his wife \n     Sharon was by his side. `Duffy' as he was known by his many \n     friends was a native of Louisiana who came to Washington in \n     the 1970's and spent his entire career in the public policy \n     arena. Known for his humor and ability to advise and \n     ``cajole'' Members of Congress and clients on the intricacies \n     of legislation, he was highly respected and admired by the \n     powerful and the not-so-powerful alike.\n       In 1982, Mr. Wall founded R. Duffy Wall & associates \n     providing lobbying and government relations services to a \n     broad range of corporate clients. Under Mr. Wall's \n     leadership, the firm grew into one of the Capital's most \n     admired and successful lobbying operations attracting some of \n     America's most prestigious companies and associations as \n     clients. In 1998, the company was acquired by Fleishman-\n     Hillard, an international communications company \n     headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri.\n       Bill Brewster, the former Congressman from Oklahoma, who \n     assumed the leadership of the company in 1998 and became CEO \n     in 1999, said of Mr. Wall, ``Duffy was a friend, advisor, and \n     mentor to all of us for many years. He will be missed very \n     much by everyone in the government relations and political \n     community, and he will always remain the faithful voice of \n     encouragement to hunters in the field.''\n       An avid sportsman, Mr. Wall was as comfortable staling \n     woodland paths and fencerows in pursuit of game and fowl as \n     he was walking the halls of Congress.\n       In accordance with Duffy's wishes, the funeral will be \n     limited to his family and there will be no memorial service. \n     Those who wish to remember him are encouraged to send \n     contributions in lieu of flowers to:\n       MD Anderson Cancer Center, Foundation of America, R.

In late September, we put the finishing \ntouches on a Leahy-Abraham substitute to S. 761.\n  On Tuesday night, after most members had left for the day, Senator \nAbraham went to the floor and propounded a unanimous consent on a very \ndifferent substitute to S. 761. Because I was not able to respond fully \nto his comments the other night, I would like to do so now.\n  At the outset, let me say that I support the passage of federal \nlegislation in this area. In particular, we need to ensure that \ncontracts are not denied validity that they otherwise have simply \nbecause they are in electronic form or signed electronically.\n  As I have said many times, however, we must tread cautiously when \nlegislating in cyberspace. Senator Abraham's bill, S. 761, takes a \nsweeping approach, preempting countless laws and regulations, federal \nand state, that require contracts, records and signatures to be in \ntraditional written form. My concern is that such a sweeping approach \nwould radically undermine laws that are currently in place to protect \nconsumers.\n  We are told that S. 761 will have tremendous benefits for ``the \npublic.'' Who exactly is ``the public'' that will benefit from this \nlegislation? Not consumers. The bill is strongly opposed by consumer \norganizations across the country.\n  Supporters of this bill say that consumers will benefit from S. 761 \nbecause it will permit them to contract electronically for goods and \nservices, and to obtain electronic records of their transactions. I \nagree that consumers should be able to contract online, but that is not \nthe issue. Consumers already can contract for most things online, as \nanyone who has heard of such businesses as ``amazon.com'' and \n``ebay.com'' knows. The issue here is whether we are going to allow \npublic interest protections now applicable to private paper \ntransactions to be circumvented simply by conducting the same \ntransaction electronically.\n  Let me tell you about an incident that occurred in my office just \nthis week. An industry lobbyist called to ask for a copy of my recent \nfloor statement regarding this legislation. We sent him a copy as an \nattachment to an e-mail. An hour later, the same lobbyist called back \nto say that he had received the e-mail, but could not read the \nattachment. So we e-mailed it to him again, this time using a different \nword processing format. The lobbyist called back a third time to say \nthat he still could not read the statement, and would we please fax a \ncopy to his office, which we did. This sort of thing happens every day \nin offices and homes across the country.\n  It was only after we sent the fax that it occurred to me that under \nthis bill, the unfortunate caller would have been deemed to have \nreceived written notice of my floor statement, in duplicate no less, \nbefore it ever reached him in a form he could read. No great loss in \nthe case of my floor statement, but swap a bank and a homeowner for the \nSenator and the lobbyist in this story, and a foreclosure notice for \nthe floor statement, and you can begin to see the harm this legislation \ncould cause to ordinary Americans on a regular basis.\n\n[[Page S13548]]\n\n  Many fine and responsible companies have called my office over the \nlast few months, to express support for one or another version of S. \n761. I have no doubt that they and a great many other American \nbusinesses that respect and value their customers would benefit from \nfederal e-commerce legislation and share the benefits with their \nconsumers.\n  We must not forget, however, that the purpose of consumer protection \nlegislation is not so much to reinforce the good business practices of \nthe best businesses in our society, but rather to protect consumers \nfrom the abusive and fraudulent minority of businesses that will take \nany opportunity to use new technologies to prey on consumers. That is \nwhy we must keep the interests of consumers in mind. While I do not \nquestion in any way the good intentions of the industry representatives \nwho support this bill, they do not have the duty that we in Congress do \nto represent the broader public interest.\n  In urging speedy passage of S. 761, Senator Abraham pointed to ``the \nfact'' that it passed the Commerce Committee unanimously, and ``the \nfact'' that the President endorsed it. The fact is, the bill that \nSenator Abraham asked us to pass earlier this week is not the same bill \nthat the Commerce Committee reported in June.\n  For one thing, it includes a new and complex provision regarding what \nit calls ``transferable records,'' that has never been considered by \nany Committee of the House or Senate. The bill also contains a host of \nother new provisions and amendments, including provisions and \namendments relating to agreements, admissibility of evidence, record \nretention, and checks.\n  Furthermore, this bill is far less respectful of the states than the \nCommerce-passed bill, which was itself unprecedentedly preemptive. This \nlegislation should be an interim measure to ensure the validity of \nelectronic agreements entered into before the states have a chance to \nenact the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act. Once the UETA is adopted \nby a state, the federal rule is unnecessary and should ``sunset.''\n  Unlike the Commerce-passed bill, the new S. 761 would maintain a \nstrong federal hand in the commercial law of electronic signatures and \nelectronic records within a state even after it adopts the UETA. This \nis true because the bill would lift its preemptive effect only to the \nextent that a state's UETA is consistent with the provisions of S. 761. \nThe reformulation can have only one possible objective, which is to \nprevent states like Vermont or California or even Michigan from passing \ne-commerce legislation that is more protective of consumers than \nfederal law.\n  That is why the bill is so strongly opposed by the States. The \nNational Conference of State Legislatures writes that the latest \nversion of S. 761 ``would eviscerate consumer protections which \nconsumers now enjoy off-line and mandate how states are to transact \nbusiness.'' The New Jersey Law Revision Commission, an agency of the \nNew Jersey Legislature, writes that it ``vigorously opposes'' S. 761, \ncalling it ``an unwarranted imposition on State law'' that ``would \ncreate more problems than it would solve.'' Other representatives of \nthe States have expressed similar concerns.\n  To summarize, the Commerce Committee did not unanimously report this \nbill, nor did the Administration endorse it. Indeed, I doubt that \nanyone in the Administration set eyes on this bill before Monday, when \nit was filed as a substitute to S. 761.\n  Moreover, the Administration does not currently endorse even the more \nmodest bill reported by the Commerce Committee. In a recent letter to \nthe House Judiciary Committee regarding title I of H.R. 1714, which \nsubstantially resembles S. 761, the General Counsel of the Commerce \nDepartment noted that, at the time S. 761 was reported, the spillover \neffect of its provisions on electronic contracts on existing consumer \nprotection and regulatory standards had not been identified. He \nconcluded:\n\n       Now that this effect has become clear, and it is equally \n     clear that enactment of this measure is desired by some \n     precisely because of this spillover effect, we [i.e., the \n     Administration] must oppose these provisions as currently \n     drafted.\n\n  The same letter states:\n\n       Consumer protection is [an] important area where the public \n     interest has been found to require government oversight. \n     States, as well as the Federal government, must not be \n     shackled in their ability to provide safeguards in this area. \n     Yet this is precisely what this legislation would do.\n\n  The recently-filed substitute version of S. 761 would do the same.\n  I was surprised to hear Senator Abraham say that his efforts to \nnegotiate with those of us who had concerns about the bill had been \n``unsuccessful.'' As I have already discussed, those negotiations were \nvery successful. They produced a truly bipartisan bill that promoted e-\ncommerce for the benefit of all Americans and not just special \ninterests. It took many weeks of hard work to achieve that result.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the substitute for S. 761.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom Federal Trade Commission to my office dated September 3, 1999, and \na letter from the Commerce Department to Representative Hyde dated \nOctober 12, 1999.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         United States of America,\n\n\n                                     Federal Trade Commission,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 3, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: In response to your request, I am \n     pleased to submit the views of the Federal Trade Commission \n     on S. 761, the ``Third Millennium Digital Commerce Act,'' \n     which was reported by the Commerce Committee on June 23, \n     1999. You have asked, in particular, whether the bill could \n     undermine consumer protections in state and federal law, and \n     how the bill might be improved.\n       We share the broad goals of S. 761, which are to promote \n     the development of electronic commerce through the expanded \n     use of electronic signatures and electronic agreements. As \n     with other aspects of electronic commerce, these technologies \n     hold possibility of reducing costs and expanding \n     opportunities for consumers. Although the bill appears \n     primarily focused on removing barriers to electronic commerce \n     in business-to-business transactions, we have begun analyzing \n     the possible impact of the bill on business-to-consumer \n     transactions.\n       The bill's potential application to consumer transactions \n     raises questions that should be addressed. For instance, \n     would the bill preempt numerous state consumer protection \n     laws? Would borrowers be bound by a contract requiring that \n     they receive delinquency or foreclosure notices by electronic \n     mail, even if they did not own a computer? Would consumers \n     who had agreed to receive electronic communications be \n     entitled to revert to paper communications if their computer \n     breaks or becomes obsolete? Would consumers disputing an \n     electronic signature have to hire an encryption expert to \n     rebut a claim that they had ``signed'' an agreement when, in \n     fact, they had not? What evidentiary value would an \n     electronic agreement have if it could be easily altered \n     electronically? It may be that with some clarification, these \n     questions can easily be addressed.\n       We would be pleased to work with the Congress, industry and \n     consumer representatives to craft provisions that would \n     provide protections for consumers while allowing business-to-\n     business commerce to proceed unimpeded.\n       By direction of the Commission.\n                                                C. Landis Plummer,\n     Acting Secretary.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            General Counsel of the\n\n\n                                  U.S. Department of Commerce,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 12, 1999.\n     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is to convey the views of the \n     Administration regarding Title I of H.R. 1714, the \n     ``Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce \n     Act,'' as reported by your Subcommittee on Courts and \n     Intellectual Property (``Subcommittee'').\n       We support the overall goal of H.R. 1714 of promoting a \n     predictable, minimalist legal environment for electronic \n     commerce, including the encouragement of prompt state \n     adoption of uniform legislation assuring the legal \n     effectiveness of electronic transactions and signatures. We \n     also appreciate the desire and the work of the Subcommittee \n     on Courts and Intellectual Property to put forward a bill \n     that addresses the concerns of the Administration as \n     explained in Commerce and Justice Department testimony before \n     that Subcommittee.\n       In particular, we note that section 103 of the reported \n     bill, titled ``Interstate Contract Certainty,'' is directed \n     to ``any commercial transaction affecting interstate \n     commerce'' and that ``transaction'' is defined to exclude \n     activity involving federal or State governments as parties. \n     We endorse these features of the bill, which make the scope \n     of the legislation broad enough to encompass most day-to-day \n     commercial electronic transactions without interfering with \n     the orderly adoption by governments of electronic means for \n     transacting their public business.\n\n[[Page S13549]]\n\n     We also are pleased that the reported bill omits any \n     provision for federal agency initiatives to enjoin state laws \n     not conforming to the requirements of this statute.\n       We continue to support strongly the principles for the use \n     of electronic signatures in international transactions set \n     out in section 102. These are fully consistent with the \n     principles we have been actively promoting internationally \n     since July, 1997, when President Clinton and Vice President \n     Gore issued the Framework for Global Electronic Commerce \n     charging our Department to ``work with the private sector, \n     state and local governments, and foreign governments to \n     support the development, both domestically and \n     internationally, of a uniform commercial legal framework that \n     recognizes, facilitates, and enforces electronic transactions \n     worldwide.''\n       We nevertheless believe that the bill, as reported, would \n     still preempt state law unnecessarily, both in degree and \n     duration; invalidate numerous state and federal laws and \n     regulations designed to protect consumers and the general \n     public; and otherwise create legal uncertainty where \n     predictability is the goal. We therefore must strongly oppose \n     the measure in its current form.\n       To begin with, we do not understand why it is necessary to \n     override existing federal laws governing commercial \n     transactions. The purpose of this legislation has always been \n     explained as the elimination of antiquated requirements for \n     physical contracts and pen-and-ink signatures. Because those \n     legal principles are embodied in state law, it is \n     understandable that some limited preemption of state law is \n     necessary to accomplish that goal pending the States' \n     adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (UETA). \n     The federal rules applicable to these transactions are \n     grounded in regulatory obligations, not basic contract law \n     principles. We do not believe it is appropriate to sweep away \n     these requirements on an across-the-board basis. to the \n     extent that federal regulatory rules need updating to address \n     the new reality of electronic transactions, this should be \n     done on a case-by-case basis, to ensure that the public \n     policy concerns that underlie the existing measures are fully \n     addressed in the electronic world. Accordingly, we believe \n     only state law standards should be affected by federal \n     legislation in this area.\n       Section 103 of H.R. 1714 as reported to your Committee \n     continues to place significant, and we believe inappropriate, \n     limits upon the States' ability to alter or supersede the \n     federal rule of law that the bill would impose. As I \n     indicated in my testimony before the Courts and Intellectual \n     Property Subcommittee, this legislation should be limited to \n     a temporary federal rule to ensure the validity of electronic \n     agreements entered into before the States have a chance to \n     enact the UETA. Once the UETA is adopted by a State, the \n     federal rule is unnecessary, and it should ``sunset.'' The \n     reported bill would maintain a strong federal hand in the \n     commercial law of electronic signatures and records within a \n     State even after it adopts the UETA. This is true because the \n     bill would lift its preemptive effect only to the extent that \n     the UETA ``as in effect in such State,'' or any other law of \n     the State, is ``not inconsistent, in any significant manner'' \n     with the provisions of this Act.\n       The pervasiveness and strength of this continuing federal \n     influence over States' laws is shown by the broad and \n     unqualified wording of some of the substantive provisions of \n     section 103. For example, subsection 103(a)(3) provides: ``If \n     a law requires a record to be in writing, or provides \n     consequences if it is not, an electronic record satisfies the \n     law.'' Similarly, subsection (a)(4) provides that wherever a \n     law ``requires a signature, or provides consequences in the \n     absence of a signature, the law is satisfied with respect to \n     an electronic record if the electronic record includes an \n     electronic signature,'' and subsection (a)(5) provides highly \n     specific requirements for ensuring that a legal record-\n     retention requirement will be satisfied by an electronic \n     record. With such provisions in section 103, the bill's \n     continuing preemption of all State laws which are ``not \n     inconsistent in any significant manner'' with the provisions \n     of this Act would perpetuate federal law as the core of the \n     commercial law of electronic signatures and records in every \n     state. As emphasized in our Department's testimony before the \n     Subcommittee, deference to state law in the area of \n     commercial transactions has been the hallmark of the legal \n     system in this country. The reported bill remains \n     inconsistent with this important tradition which has \n     produced a system of commercial law widely considered the \n     best in the world.\n       Subsections 103(a) (3), (4) and (5), which I have just \n     mentioned, coupled with the broad party autonomy language of \n     section 103(b), would also place excessive limits on \n     governmental authority. In particular, these provisions would \n     appear to preclude virtually any regulation of private \n     parties' authentication of recordkeeping practices in the \n     sphere of electronic commerce, as is common and recognized as \n     appropriate with respect to paper-based transactions.* But \n     these regulations, including consumer protection laws, laws \n     governing financial transactions, and others, are essential \n     to ensure that the public interest is protected.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     * These provisions are similar to some contained in S. 761, \n     as reported by the Senate Commerce Committee. I expressed \n     support for that measure because it ensured that contracts \n     could not be invalidated because they were in electronic form \n     or because they were signed electronically. At the time the \n     bill was reported, the spillover effect of these provisions \n     on existing consumer protection and regulatory standards had \n     not been identified. Now that this effect has become clear, \n     and it is equally clear that enactment of this measure is \n     desired by some precisely because of this spillover effect, \n     we must oppose these provisions as currently drafted.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       For example, raising concerns similar to those noted in \n     this Department's testimony on H.R. 1714, Banking Committee \n     Chairman Leach recently wrote to Commerce Committee Chairman \n     Bliley noting that the federal financial regulatory agencies \n     have raised a concern about the language of the section of \n     H.R. 1714 (section 103(b) of the version before your \n     Committee) relating to the autonomy of parties to a contract \n     to set their own requirements with respect to electronic \n     records and signatures. Specifically, he noted the need to \n     ensure that the bill's party autonomy provisions would not \n     limit government authority to engage in limited regulation of \n     authentication- or records-related matters in certain private \n     party transactions in the public interest. We agree; for \n     example, given the unqualified authorization provided by \n     subsection 103(b) to private parties to determine the \n     ``methods'' as well as the ``terms and conditions'' under \n     which they will use and accept electronic signatures and \n     records, banks would be free to adopt methods that could \n     result in the absence of adequate records or sound \n     authentications of transactions when the bank examiner \n     arrives.\n       Chairman Leach also noted that the Federal Reserve Board \n     has raised concerns regarding the application of H.R. 1714 to \n     negotiable instruments, such as checks and notes. He pointed \n     out that the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform \n     State Laws recognized some of these concerns and therefore \n     excluded transactions covered by the Uniform Commercial Code \n     from coverage under UETA. We agree with the concerns raised \n     by Chairman Leach and believe that amendments or \n     clarifications along the lines he has suggested continue to \n     be needed in the context of H.R. 1714 as reported to your \n     Committee.\n       Consumer protection is another important area where the \n     public interest has been found to require government \n     oversight. States, as well as the Federal government, must \n     not be shackled in their ability to provide safeguards in \n     this area. Yet this is precisely what this legislation would \n     do.\n       Section 104, ``Study of Legal and Regulatory Barriers to \n     Electronic Commerce,'' is consistent with the \n     Administration's commitment to ensure the careful review of \n     possible legal and regulatory barriers to electronic \n     commerce. Indeed, this provision in the bill as reported \n     focuses upon barriers to electronic commerce, as such, rather \n     than more narrowly upon commerce in electronic signature \n     products and services. We believe this focus is appropriate. \n     However, to avoid duplication of agency reporting, we would \n     recommend against inclusion of the Office of Management and \n     Budget as an agency to receive initial agency reports under \n     the provision.\n       In summary, we believe that the bill as reported by the \n     Subcommittee addresses some important concerns of the \n     Administration that were set out in our earlier testimony. \n     However, H.R. 1714 in the form reported to your Committee \n     retains significant flaws that would have to be addressed \n     before the Administration could support the bill. We would be \n     pleased to continue to work with your Committee on this \n     important legislation.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the submission of this report from the \n     standpoint of the Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n     Andrew J. Pincus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13549-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13549-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13549-S13550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n A REPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n          RESPECT TO SUDAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 69\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the\n\n[[Page S13550]]\n\nanniversary date of its declaration, the President publishes in the \nFederal Register and transmits to the Congress a notice stating that \nthe emergency is to continue in effect beyond the anniversary date.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would address the growing bankruptcy caseload in our federal \njudiciary. Increased bankruptcy filings are placing a severe strain on \nour federal courts and on the judges who preside over these cases. The \nHouse and Senate bankruptcy reform bills seek to address this issue by \nauthorizing eighteen new bankruptcy judges. While Congress recognizes \nthe need for these judges, it has not yet taken the step it deems \nnecessary to approve another needed group of bankruptcy judges \nidentified by the U.S. Judicial Conference in March of this year. This \nlegislation would authorize these six judgeships and help our federal \njudiciary address an overburdensome workload.\n  My home state of Georgia is one of the states that the Judicial \nConference has indicated needs another bankruptcy judge. The middle and \nsouthern districts in Georgia have, respectively, the eighth and ninth \nhighest weighted caseloads in the country. The most recent data from \nthe Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts indicates that the \nweighted bankruptcy filings per authorized judgeships is 1,907 for the \nmiddle district and 1,880 for the Southern district. Even with approval \nof a new judge for the southern district, the three full-time judges in \nthat district would still carry a caseload that exceeds the threshold \nof 1,500 weighted hours that justifies the creation of another \njudgeship.\n  The review undertaken by the Judicial Conference of the workload in \nthese Georgia districts also found that caseloads are being managed in \na highly efficient manner. The Judicial Conference had no suggestions \nto assist the court in expending its caseload. A new judgeship is the \nonly solution to this caseload problem.\n  I understand that the Judicial Conference used the same criteria to \njustify the 6 new judgeships in their March 1999 recommendation that \nthey used to justify the 18 judgeships in the bankruptcy reform bills. \nUnderstanding the need for a new bankruptcy judge in my state, I \nsupport the Judicial Conference's recommendation,\n\n[[Page S13553]]\n\nand other states' efforts to obtain an additional judge. I am pleased \nthat Senator Biden, Edwards, Graham, Cleland, Sarbanes, Mikulski, and \nMack, whose states were also included in the March 1999 Judicial \nConference recommendation, have joined me on this bill. I believe this \nlegislation will shed important light on caseloads and the need for new \njudges. The last time Congress approved new bankruptcy judgeships was \nseven years ago. These judges are needed now and I hope Congress will \nmove forward in approving them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1831. A bill to protect and provide resources for the Social \nSecurity System, to reserve surpluses to protect, strengthen and \nmodernize the Medicare Program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Budget and the Committee on Governmental Affairs, \njointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with instructions \nthat if one committee reports, the other committee have 30 days to \nreport or be discharged.\n\n\n              medicaid eligibility restoration act of 1999\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Medicaid \nEligibility Restoration Act of 1999, which fixes a major problem \nrecently created in the health care safety net.\n  My bill addresses a Medicaid eligibility problem--lack of access to \nhealth insurance during the first, and often costliest, month of \ndisability--that was inadvertently caused by a change to Supplemental \nSecurity Income (SSI) policy in the 1996 welfare reform law.\n  Let me explain how this Medicaid ``gap month'' problem was created.\n  In 1996, the effective date of application for Supplemental Security \nIncome (SSI) was changed to the month following the date when an \nindividual applies for SSI.\n  Before the 1996 change, pro-rated payments began immediately. Since \n1996, payments do not begin until the month following original \napplication.\n  This SSI payment change generated a small cost savings for the SSI \nprogram and ended the administrative burden of calculating partial \nmonth payments, but it also created a problem--a gap month--for \nMedicaid eligibility that is linked to SSI.\n  For most SSI and Medicaid recipients, this change has resulted in one \nlost month of Medicaid eligibility, which is a hardship in itself.\n  But those who suddenly become disabled or who are born with a \ndisability face more dire consequences.\n  Because of the 1996 change, they now lose health insurance coverage \nfor what is often their costliest month--their first month of \ndisability. This policy shift has left families with enormous medical \nbills and hospitals with uncompensated care.\n  The Medicaid Eligibility Restoration Act would end this gap month in \nMedicaid coverage and would restore the pre-1996 Medicaid eligibility \ncriteria.\n  This issue first came to my attention when I received a letter from \nRandall Connelly of Sioux Falls, South Dakota.\n  His wife, Susan, had recently given birth to premature twins. \nTragically, the twins died a few days later.\n  Despite the fact that Randy had a good job, with good health \ninsurance, he still faced unaffordable out-of-pocket medical expenses. \nBecause of the twins' low birth weight, both children were \nautomatically eligible for SSI and Medicaid--or they would have been, \nif the twins had been born before enactment of the welfare reform law \nof 1996.\n  In fact, the Connellys were ineligible for any help with their \nmedical bills because of the small 1996 technical change in SSI payment \npolicy.\n  The unfortunate result was that the Connellys were left to cope not \nonly with the loss of their newborn twins, but also with unaffordable \nhospital bills.\n  Since my communication with the Connellys, I have heard from hospital \nadministrators who have expressed concern on behalf of patients and \nfamilies who have suddenly found themselves with nowhere to turn during \ntheir first weeks of extreme financial hardship and emotional trauma \ndue to disability.\n  Sioux Valley Hospital in Sioux Falls, SD, has reported that 28 \nnewborns were affected during the past year in that one hospital alone. \nHospital administrators report that:\n\n       Delay in Medicaid coverage results in severe hardship for \n     many families. . . . The normal stresses of dealing with a \n     newborn with a serious disability are compounded by the \n     extensive financial demands attendant to medical services \n     provided for that child.\n\n  I ask that a copy of Sioux Valley's letter of support for the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      Sioux Valley\n\n\n                                    Hospitals & Health System,\n\n                                    Sioux Falls, October 27, 1999.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: I am writing to express the support \n     of the Sioux Valley Hospitals & Health System for legislation \n     we understand you are planning to introduce which would \n     address an issue involving SSI eligibility, and therefore, \n     Medicaid eligibility. The issue, as we have experienced it, \n     involves the date on which Medicaid coverage would commence \n     for SSI eligible newborns. We understand that current law \n     results in a start date for Medicaid payment coverage on the \n     first of the month following SSI eligibility which for \n     disabled newborns is their date of birth.\n       That delay in Medicaid coverage results in severe hardship \n     for many families who have had babies with medical conditions \n     requiring extremely expensive services in the Sioux Valley \n     Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Some 28 families have \n     been affected at Sioux Valley alone over the course of the \n     last year. The normal stresses of dealing with a newborn with \n     a serious disability are compounded by the extensive \n     financial demands attendant to medical services required for \n     the child.\n       While we understand that public programs cannot be expected \n     to address expenses associated with every catastrophic \n     medical situation, this delay in coverage for severely \n     disabled newborns seems particularly appropriate for a public \n     response. I wanted you to know, therefore, that we do support \n     your effects in this respect.\n       Please let me know if any of our staff could provide \n     further information with respect to the importance and impact \n     of the legislation which you propose.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank M. Drew,\n                           Senior Vice President of Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I have also heard from public health officials who are \nconcerned that public health funds may need to be diverted to address \nthe needs of those who should have been covered by Medicaid--as they \nwere in the past.\n  Some states are able to cover the gap month through other Medicaid \ncategories, such as the ``medically needy'' category and a category for \nthose who meet all the SSI criteria but are not receiving benefits.\n  There are several states, however, that still face the gap month \nproblem.\n  It is difficult for many of these states to address this problem, \nbecause, while covering only the gap month may be affordable, adding a \nwhole new Medicaid category is seen as too expensive.\n  There is a simpler, and less expensive way to address the problem: \nrestore the pre-1996 Medicaid eligibility.\n  We must restore health care benefits to those with disabilities who \nneed them and should be eligible for them.\n  The gap month is not a difficult problem to fix.\n  A solution only requires our attention and our commitment to \nprotecting the health care safety net. My bill does that by ensuring \nMedicaid helps cover those facing unexpected disability.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1831\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Strengthen Social Security \n     and Medicare Act of 1999.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The Social Security system is one of the cornerstones \n     of American national policy and has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. For 30 percent of all \n     senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide almost 90 \n     percent of their retirement income. For 66 percent of all \n     senior citizens, Social Security benefits provide over half \n     of their retirement income. Poverty rates among the elderly \n     are at the lowest level since the United States began to keep \n     poverty statistics, due in large part to the Special Security \n     system. The Social Security system, together with the \n     additional protections afforded by the Medicare system, have \n     been an outstanding success for past and current retirees and \n     must be preserved for future retirees.\n\n[[Page S13554]]\n\n       (2) The long-term solvency of the Social Security and \n     Medicare trust funds is not assured. There is an estimated \n     long-range actuarial deficit in the Social Security trust \n     funds. According to the 1999 report of the Board of Trustees \n     of the Social Security trust funds, the accumulated balances \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and \n     the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund are currently \n     projected to become unable to pay benefits in full on a \n     timely basis starting in 2034. The Medicare system faces more \n     immediate financial shortfalls, with the Hospital Insurance \n     Trust Fund projected to become exhausted in 2015.\n       (3) In addition to preserving Social Security and Medicare, \n     the Congress and the President have a responsibility to \n     future generations to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public. Significant debt reduction will contribute to the \n     economy and improve the Government's ability to fulfill its \n     responsibilities and to face future challenges, including \n     preserving and strengthening Social Security and Medicare.\n       (4) The Federal Government is now in sound financial \n     condition. The Federal budget is projected to generate \n     significant surpluses. In fiscal years 1998 and 1999, there \n     were unified budget surpluses--the first consecutive \n     surpluses in more than 40 years. Over the next 15 years, the \n     Government projects the on-budget surplus, which excludes \n     Social Security, to total $2.9 trillion.

A bill to restore Federal remedies for violations of \nintellectual property rights by States, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n        the intellectual property protection restoration of 1999\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intellectual \nProperty Protection Restoration Act of\n\n[[Page S13556]]\n\n1999, a bill to restore federal remedies for violations of intellectual \nproperty rights of States.\n  Innvoation and creativity have been the fuel of our national economic \nboom over the past decade. The United States now leads the world in \ncomputing, communications and biotechnologies, and American authors and \nbrand names are recognized across the globe.\n  Our national prosperity is, first and foremost, a tribute to American \ningenuity. But it is also a tribute to the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers, who made the promotion of what they called ``Science and the \nUseful Arts'' a national project, which they constitutionally assigned \nto Congress. And it is no less of a tribute to the successive \nCongresses and Administrations of both parties who have striven to \nprovide real incentives and rewards for innovation and creativity by \nproviding strong and even-handed protection to intellectual property \nrights. Congress passed the first federal patent law in 1790, and the \nU.S. Government issued its first patent the same year--to Samuel \nHopkins of my home State of Vermont. The first federal copyright law \nwas also enacted in 1790, and the first federal trademark laws date \nback to the 1870s.\n  The Supreme Court has long recognized that intellectual property \nrights bear the hallmark of true constitutional property rights--the \nright of exclusion against the world--and are therefore protection \nagainst appropriation both by individuals and by government. Consistent \nwith this understanding of intellectual property, Congress has long \nensured that the rights secured by the federal intellectual property \nlaws were enforceable against the federal governments by waiving the \ngovernment's immunity in suits alleging infringements of those rights.\n  No doubt Congress would have legislated similarly with respect to \ninfringements by State entities and bureaucrats had there been any \ndoubt that they were already fully subject to federal intellectual \nproperty laws. But there was no doubt. States had long enjoyed the \nbenefits of the intellectual property laws on an equal footing with \nprivate parties. By the same token, and in accordance with the \nfundamental principles of equity on which our intellectual property \nlaws are founded, the States bore the burdens of the intellectual \nproperty laws, being liable for infringements just like private \nparties. States were free to join intellectual property markets as \nparticipants, or to hold back from commerce and limit themselves to a \nnarrower governmental role. The intellectual property right of \nexclusion meant what it said and was enforced evenhandley for public \nand private entities alike.\n  This harmonious state of affairs ended in 1985, with the Supreme \nCourt's announced of the so-called ``clear statement'' rule in \nAtascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon. The Court in Atascadero held that \nCongress must express its intention to abrogate the States' Eleventh \nAmendment immunity ``in unmistakable language in the statute itself.'' \nA few years later, in Pennsylvania v. Union Gas Co., the Supreme Court \nassured us that if the intent to abrogate were expressed clearly \nenough, it would be honored.\n  Following Atascadero, some courts held that States and State entities \nand officials could escape liability for patent, copyright and \ntrademark infringement because the patent, copyright and trademark laws \nlacked the clear statement of congressional intent that was now \nnecessary to abrogate State sovereign immunity.\n  To close this new loophole in the law, Congress promptly did \nprecisely what the Supreme Court had told us was necessary. In 1990 and \n1992, Congress passed three laws--the Patent and Plant Variety \nProtection Remedy Clarification Act, the Copyright Remedy Clarification \nAct, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Acts. The sole purpose of \nthese Clarification Acts was to make it absolutely, unambiguously, 100 \npercent clear that Congress intended the patent, copyright and \ntrademark laws to apply to everyone, including the States, and that \nCongress did not intend the States to be immune from liability for \nmoney damages. Each of three Clarification Acts passed unanimously.\n  In 1996, however, by a five-to-four-vote, the Supreme Court in \nSeminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida reversed its earlier decision in \nUnion Gas and held that Congress lacked authority under article I of \nthe Constitution to abrogate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity \nfrom suit in federal court.\n  Then, on June 23, by the same bare majority, the Supreme Court in \nFlorida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College \nSavings Bank told us that it did not really mean what it said in \nAtascadero and invalidated the Patent and Plant Variety Protection \nRemedy Clarification Act. In a companion case decided on the same day, \nthe same five Justices held that the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act \nalso failed to abrogate State sovereign immunity.\n  The Court's latest decisions have been the subject of bipartism \ncriticism. In a floor statement on July 1, I highlighted the anti-\ndemocratic implications of the approach of the activist majority of the \nSupreme Court, who have left constitutional text behind, ripped up \nprecedent, and treated Congress with less respect than that due to an \nadministrative agency in their haste to impose their natural laws \nnotions of sovereignty as a barrier to democratic regulations. I also \nnoted that ``the Court's decisions will have far-reaching consequences \nabout how . . . intellectual property rights may be protected against \neven egregious infringements and violation by the State.''\n  One of my Republican colleagues on the Judicial Committee, Senator \nSpecter, expressed similar concerns in a floor statement on August 5. \nHe noted that the Court decisions ``leave us with an absurd and \nuntenable state of affairs,'' where ``States will enjoy an enormous \nadvantage over their private sector competitions.''\n  Not surprisingly, alarm has also been expressed in the business \ncommunity about the potential of the Court's recent decisions to harm \nintellectual property owners in a wide variety of ways. A commentary in \nBusiness Week on August 2, 1999, gave these examples:\n\n       Watch out if you publish software that someone at a State \n     university wants to copy for free . . . Watch out if you own \n     a patent on a medical procedure that some doctor in a State \n     medical school wants to use. Watch out if you've invested \n     heavily in a great trademark, like Nike's Swoosh, and a \n     bureaucrat decides his State program would be wildly promoted \n     if it used the same mark.\n\n  Charles Fried, a professor at Harvard Law School and former Solicitor \nGeneral during the Reagan Administration, has called the Court's \ndecisions in Florida Prepaid and College Savings Bank ``truly \nbizarre.'' He observed, in a July 6 opinion editorial in the New York \nTimes:\n\n       [The Court's decisions] did not question that States are \n     subject to the patent and trademark laws of the United \n     States. It's just that when a State violates those laws--as \n     when it uses a patented invention without permission and \n     without paying for it--the patent holder cannot sue the State \n     for infringement. So a State hospital can manufacture \n     medicines patented by others and sell or use them, and State \n     schools universities can pirate textbooks and software, and \n     the victims cannot sue for infringement.\n\n  I believe that these concerns are very real. As Congress realized \nwhen it waived federal sovereign immunity in the area, it would be \nnaive to imagine that reliance on the commercial decency of the \ngovernment and its myriad agencies and officials would provide the \nsecurity needed to promote investment in research and development and \nto facilitate negotiation in the exclusive licensing arrangements that \nare often necessary to bring valuable products and creations to market.\n  The issue is not whether State infringement has been frequent in the \npast, but rather whether we can assure American inventors and investors \nand our design trading partners that, as State involvement in \nintellectual property becomes ever greater in the new information \neconomy, U.S. intellectual property rights are backed by guaranteed \nlegal remedies. It is a question of economics: our national economy \ndepends on real and effective intellectual property rights. It is also \na question of justice: in conceding that the States are \nconstitutionally bound to respect federal intellectual property rights \nbut invalidating the remedies Congress has created to enforce those \nrights, the Court has jeopardized one of the key principles that \ndistinguishes our Constitution from the Constitution of the old Soviet \nUnion--the principle that where there is a right, there must also be a \nremedy.\n\n[[Page S13557]]\n\n  Some have suggested that a constitutional amendment may be the only \nway to restore protection to patent, copyright and trademark owners as \nagainst States. But even if Congress were to adopt such an amendment, I \ndo not expect that we will see a lot of States rushing to ratify an \namendment that forces them to pay for things that they can currently \nget for free.\n  Fortunately, however, while the implications of the Court's decisions \nfor our constitutional scheme are serious, we can restore the \nguarantees of our intellectual property laws without resorting to a \nconstitutional amendment. After close consideration of Florida Prepaid \nand the other recent Supreme Court precedents, I have no doubt that \nthey leave several constitutional mechanisms open to us to restore \nsubstantial protection for patents, copyrights and trademarks through \nordinary legislation. The Supreme Court's hyper-technical \nconstitutional interpretations require us to jump through some \ntechnical constitutional hoops of our own, but that the exercise is now \nnot merely worthwhile, but essential to safeguard both U.S. prosperity \nand the continued authority of Congress.\n  The Intellectual Property Protection Restoration Act is based on a \nsimple supposition--that there is no inherent entitlement to federal \nintellectual property rights. In discussing the policies underlying the \npatent laws, the Supreme Court has emphasized that ``[t]he grant of a \npatent is the grant of a special privilege `to promote the Progress of \nScience and useful Arts,' '' and that ``[i]t is the public interest \nwhich is dominant in the patent system.'' Similarly, in discussing the \ncopyright laws, the Court has underscored that ``the monopoly \nprivileges that Congress has authorized, while `intended to motivate \nthe creative activity of authors and inventors by the provision of a \nspecial reward,' are limited in nature and must ultimately serve the \npublic good.''\n  The Constitution empowers but does not require Congress to make \nintellectual property rights available, and Congress should do so on in \na manner that encourages and protects innovation in the public and \nprivate sector alike.\n  States and their institutions, especially State universities, benefit \nhugely from the federal intellectual property laws. All 50 States own \nor have obtained patents--some hold many hundreds of patents. States \nalso hold other intellectual property rights secured by federal law, \nand the trend is toward increased participation by the States in \ncommerce involving intellectual property rights.\n  Principles of State sovereignty tell us that States are entitled to a \nfree and informed choice of whether or not to participate in the \nfederal intellectual property schemes, subject only to their \nconstitutional obligations. Equity and common sense tell us that one \nwho chooses to enjoy the benefits of a law--whether it be a federal \ngrant or the multimillion-dollar benefits of intellectual property \nprotections--should also bear its burdens. Sound economics and \ntraditional notions of federalism tell us that it is appropriate for \nthe federal government to assist and encourage the sovereign States in \ntheir sponsorship of whatever innovation and creation they freely \nchoose to sponsor by giving them intellectual property protection and, \non occasion, funding, so long as the States reciprocate by assisting \nthe federal governments to keep its promise of guaranteed exclusive \nrights to intellectual property owners.\n  The IPPRA builds on these principles. In order to promote cooperative \nfederalism in the intellectual property arena, it provides a mechanism \nfor States to affirm their willingness to participate in our national \nintellectual property project and so ``opt in'' as full and \nequal participants. A State would opt in to the federal intellectual \nproperty system every time it applied for protection under a federal \nintellectual property law, by promising to waive its sovereign immunity \nfrom any subsequent suit against the State arising under such a law.\n\n  States take their commitments seriously. We can therefore expect that \na State, having promised to waive its immunity if called upon to do so, \nwould take whatever steps were necessary to fulfill that promise. At \nleast in theory, however, a State could assert its immunity regardless \nof any assurance to the contrary.\n  The IPPRA addresses this problem by conditioning a State's \nintellectual property rights on its adherence to its promise to waive \nimmunity. Thus, a State's refusal to waive immunity in an intellectual \nproperty suit after it has accepted benefits under an intellectual \nproperty law would have a number of consequences. Most significantly, \nit would give private parties the right to assert an immunity-like \ndefense to damages claims in any action to enforce an intellectual \nproperty right that is or has been owned by the State during the five \nyears preceding the State's assertion of immunity. This quid pro quo \nprovision restores the level playing field by putting States that \nassert immunity in essentially the same position as private parties who \nseek to endorse federal intellectual property rights against them.\n  The IPPRA does this without coercing the State to waive by \nthreatening pre-existing benefits. The quid pro quo provision only \naffects those intellectual property rights that the State acquired by \nvirtue of its promise to waive immunity. To ensure that State waivers \nare voluntary, State intellectual property rights that pre-date the \npassage of the IPPRA are preserved regardless of waiver.\n  This scheme is consistent with the spirit of federalism, as \ninterpreted by the Supreme Court, because it gives the States a free, \ninformed and meaningful choice to waive or not to waive immunity at any \ntime. It is also plainly authorized by the letter of the Constitution. \nArticle I empowers Congress to ``promote the Progress of Science and \nuseful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the \nexclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' \nIncident to this power, Congress may attach conditions on the receipt \nof exclusive intellectual property rights. Indeed, we have always \nattached certain conditions, such as the requirements of public \ndisclosure of an invention at the Patent and Trademark Office in order \nto obtain a patent.\n  Congress may attach conditions on States' receipt of federal \nintellectual property protection under its Article I intellectual \nproperty power just as Congress may attach conditions on States' \nreceipt of federal funds under its Article I spending power. Either \nway, the power to attach conditions to the federal benefit is an \nintegral part of the greater power to deny the benefit altogether. \nEither way, States have a choice--to forgo the federal benefit and \nexercise their sovereign power however they wish subject to the \nConstitution, or to take the benefit and exercise their sovereign power \nin the manner requested by Congress. In South Dakota v. Dole, for \nexample, the Supreme Court held that Congress may condition federal \nhighway funds on a State's agreement to raise its minimum drinking age \nto 21. The condition imposed on receipt of federal benefits by the \nIPPRA--submitting to suit under laws that are already binding on the \nStates--is not onerous, nor does it co-opt any State resources to the \nservice of federal policy.\n  Given the choice between opting in to the intellectual property laws \nand forgoing intellectual property protection under the federal laws, \nmost States are likely to choose to former. The benefits secured by \nthose laws far outweigh the burdens. Most States already respect \nintellectual property rights and will seldom find themselves in \ninfringement suits. To deny the States the choice that the IPPRA offers \nthem would amount to penalizing States that play by the federal \nintellectual property rules for the free-riding violations of the \nminority of States that refuse to commit to do so. As is normally the \ncase in a federal system, cooperation between the States and the \nfederal government is likely to be beneficial to all concerned.\n  However, some States and some State entities and officials have \ninfringed patents and violated other intellectual property rights in \nthe past, and the massive growth of both intellectual property and \nState participation in intellectual property that we are seeing as we \nmove into the next century give ample cause for concern that such \nviolations will continue. Now that the Supreme Court has seemingly \ngiven States and State entities carte\n\n[[Page S13558]]\n\nblanche to violate intellectual property rights free from any adverse \nfinancial consequences so long as they stand on their newly augmented \nsovereign immunity, the prospect of States violating federal law and \nthen asserting immunity is too serious to ignore.\n  The IPPRA therefore also provides for the limited set of remedies \nthat the Supreme Court's new jurisprudence leaves available to Congress \nto enforce a non-waiving State's obligations under federal law and the \nUnited States Constitution. The key point here is that, while the Court \nstruck down our prior effort to enforce the intellectual property laws \nthemselves by authorizing actions for damages against the States, it \nnonetheless acknowledged Congress' power to enforce constitutional \nrights related to intellectual property.\n  First, for the avoidance of doubt, the IPPRA ensures the full \navailability of prospective equitable relief to prevent States from \nviolating or exceeding their rights under federal intellectual property \nlaws. As the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in its Seminole Tribe \ndecision in 1996, such relief is available, notwithstanding any \nassertion of State sovereign immunity, under what is generally known as \nthe doctrine of Ex parte Young.\n  Second, to address the harm done to the rights of intellectual \nproperty owners before they can secure an injunction, the IPPA also \nprovides a damages remedy against non-consenting States, to the full \nextent of Congress' power to enforce the constitutional rights of \nintellectual property owners. Under the Supreme Court's recent \ndecisions, this remedy is necessarily limited to the redress of \nconstitutional violations, not violations of the federal intellectual \nproperty laws themselves. However, as I have already noted, the Supreme \nCourt has reaffirmed on many occasions that the intellectual property \nowner's right of exclusion is a property right fully protected from \ngovernmental violation under the Fifth Amendment's Takings Clause and \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n\n  Under the Fifth Amendment, a State can be sued for damages for taking \nan intellectual property right. Although States can normally take a \nproperty right constitutionally, so long as they do so for a ``public \npurpose'' and provide ``just compensation,'' the Supreme Court held in \n1984 that the ``public purpose'' requirement for a lawful taking means \nthat the taking must be a valid exercise of the State's eminent domain \npowers. Because of the uniquely federal nature of federal intellectual \nproperty rights of exclusion, States have no eminent domain or other \nsovereign power over them. ``When Congress grants an exclusive right or \nmonopoly, its effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its \nreach.'' Therefore, every State taking of an intellectual property \nright, with or without some promise of subsequent compensation, is a \nconstitutional violation ripe for congressional enforcement under \nsection five of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  Stangely, and I think improperly, the Supreme Court declined to \ndecide in Florida Prepaid whether our earlier Clarification Acts could \nbe sustained as an enforcement of the Takings Clause. The Court also \ndid not resolve when a violation of intellectual property rights \namounts to an unconstitutional taking. Because the Court emphasized \nthat the resolution of such constitutional questions is its job, and \nnot ours, the IPPRA simply provides a federal cause of action for an \nunconstitutional taking of intellectual property rights, leaving the \ncourts to make the final determination of what is a constitutional \nviolation and what remedy is constitutionally authorized. The IPPRA \ndoes, however, instruct the courts to interpret both the right and the \nremedy as broadly as constitutionally permissible. At the same time, by \nexcluding treble damages from the remedies provided and by adopting the \nsame standard of compensation--``reasonable and entire compensation''--\nthat is currently available against the federal government for patient \ninfringements, the bill respects the States' dignity and responds to \nthe Court's objection that the Clarification Acts provided identical \nremedies against States and private parties.\n  Finally, in order to ensure the full availability of constitutionally \npermissible remedies if the courts adopt a narrow view of the Takings \nClause in this context, the IPPRA adopts a similar approach in \nproviding the fullest remedies constitutionally available, up to and \nincluding ``reasonable and entire compensation'' but excluding treble \ndamages, for State violations of a federal intellectual property \nowner's Fourteenth Amendment right not to be deprived of her property \nwithout due process of law.\n  In sum, the constitutional remedy provided by the IPPRA closely \nresembles the remedy that Congress provided decades ago for \ndeprivations of federal rights by persons acting under color of State \nlaw. The bill does not expand the property rights secured by the \nfederal intellectual property laws--these laws are already binding on \nthe States--nor does the bill interfere with any governmental authority \nto regulate businesses that own such rights. It simply restores the \nability of private persons to sue in federal court to enforce such \nrights against the States.\n  I view this bill as an exercise in cooperative federalism. Clear, \ncertain and uniform national rules protecting federal intellectual \nproperty rights benefit everyone: consumers, businesses, the federal \ngovernment and the States. The IPPRA preserves States' rights, and \ngives the States a free choice. At the same time, it ensures effective \nprotection for individual constitutional rights, and fills the gap left \nby recent Supreme Court decisions in which there are federal rights \nunsupported by effective remedies.\n  There are, to be sure, other approaches that Congress could take to \naddress the problems created by the Court's decisions. For example, \nCongress could condition a State's receipt of federal funds--including \nfederal research funds used to generate intellectual property--on the \nState's wavier of immunity from any suit arising under the federal \nintellectual property laws. As I previously discussed, this approach is \nsquarely supported by the Court's decisions in the spending cases. In \nmy view, however, such an approach would be less respectful of State \nsovereignty than the opt-in-scheme proposed by the IPPRA. It would also \nimpede the States' ability to conduct research in a manner that the \nIPPRA would not.\n  There is another approach that remains open to Congress that would \nprovide a remedy for intellectual property owners against States, \nrespect State sovereignty, and restore some degree of uniformity and \nconsistency in the construction of the federal intellectual property \nlaws. That is, Congress could give State courts jurisdiction over \nintellectual property suits or just compensation claims against the \nStates, and then require the United States Supreme Court to exercise \nappellate review of the resulting State court judgment. There is no \npossible constitutional objection to this approach; the Eleventh \nAmendment does not defeat the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction \nover suits brought against the States. We should not, however, burden \nthe Supreme Court in this manner when, as the IPPRA demonstrates, there \nare efficient and proper ways to bring these claims into the lower \nfederal courts in which intellectual property expertise resides.\n  Intellectual property is the currency of the new global economy. As \nwe move into the 21st century, we should not allow that currency to be \ndevalued by abstruse 18th century legal formalities. For that reason, I \nbelieve that legislation is imperative to minimize the ill effects of \nthe Supreme Court's latest attack on our ability to protect our \nnational economic assets. The IPPRA restores protection for violations \nof intellectual property rights that may, under current law, go \nunremedied, and so provides the certainty and security necessary to \nfoster innovation and creativity. We unanimously passed more sweeping \nlegislation earlier this decade, but were thwarted by Supreme Court \ntechnicalities. The IPPRA is designed to restore the benefits we sought \nto provide intellectual property owners while meeting the Supreme \nCourt's technical requirements. We should move to consider this \nlegislation as soon as we return next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S13559]]\n\n                                S. 1835\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The protection of Federal intellectual property rights \n     is of critical importance to the Nation's ability to compete \n     in the global market.\n       (2) There is a strong Federal interest in the development \n     of uniform and consistent law regarding Federal intellectual \n     property rights, and in the fulfillment of international \n     treaty obligations that the Federal Government has \n     undertaken.\n       (3) Prior to 1985 and the Supreme Court ruling in \n     Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234 (1985) (in \n     this section referred to as ``Atascadero''), owners of \n     Federal intellectual property rights could fully protect \n     their rights against infringement by States.\n       (4) Following Atascadero, a number of courts held that \n     Federal patent, copyright and trademark laws failed to \n     contain the clear statement of intent to abrogate State \n     sovereign immunity necessary to permit owners of Federal \n     intellectual property rights to protect their rights against \n     infringement by States.\n       (5) In 1990, Congress passed the Copyright Remedy \n     Clarification Act (Public Law 101-553), to clarify its intent \n     to abrogate State sovereign immunity from suits for \n     infringement of copyrights and exclusive rights in mask \n     works.\n       (6) In 1992, Congress passed the Patent and Plant Variety \n     Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Public Law 102-206) and \n     the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (Public Law 102-542) \n     to clarify its intent to abrogate State sovereign immunity \n     from suits for infringement of patents, protected plant \n     varieties and trademarks.\n       (7) In 1996, the Supreme Court held in Seminole Tribe of \n     Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996) (in this section \n     referred to as ``Seminole Tribe'') that Congress may not \n     abrogate State sovereign immunity under article I of the \n     United States Constitution. Under the Supreme Court decision \n     in Seminole Tribe, the Copyright Remedy Clarification Act, \n     the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification \n     Act, and the Trademark Remedy Clarification Act could not be \n     sustained under clause 3 or 8 of section 8 of article I of \n     the United States Constitution.\n       (8) In 1999, the Supreme Court held in Florida Prepaid \n     Postsecondary Education Expense Board v. College Savings \n     Bank, 119 S. Ct. 2199 (1999) (in this section referred to as \n     ``Florida Prepaid'') that the Patent and Plant Variety \n     Protection Remedy Clarification Act could not be sustained as \n     legislation enacted to enforce the guarantees of the due \n     process clause of the fourteenth amendment of the United \n     States Constitution.\n       (9) As a result of the Supreme Court's decision in Florida \n     Prepaid, and absent remedial legislation, a patent owner's \n     only remedy under the Federal patent laws against a State \n     infringer of a patent is prospective relief under the \n     doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908).\n       (10) On the same day that it decided Florida Prepaid, the \n     Supreme Court in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid \n     Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 119 S. Ct. 2219 (1999) \n     (in this section referred to as ``College Savings Bank'') \n     extended State sovereign immunity to purely commercial \n     activities of certain State entities.\n       (11) The Seminole Tribe, Florida Prepaid and College \n     Savings Bank decisions have the potential to--\n       (A) deprive private intellectual property owners of \n     effective protection for both their Federal intellectual \n     property rights and their constitutional rights under the \n     fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United States \n     Constitution; and\n       (B) compromise the ability of the United States to fulfill \n     its obligations under a variety of international treaties.\n       (12) Article I of the United States Constitution empowers, \n     but does not require, Congress to offer Federal intellectual \n     property protection to any person on such terms as appear \n     reasonable and appropriate to serve the public interest by \n     encouraging scientific and artistic innovation and promoting \n     commerce and fair competition.\n       (13) Congress can best accomplish the public interests \n     described under paragraph (12) by providing clear and certain \n     national rules protecting Federal intellectual property \n     rights that establish a level playing field for everyone, \n     including States.\n       (14) In recent years, States have increasingly elected to \n     avail themselves of the benefits of the Federal intellectual \n     property system by obtaining and enforcing Federal \n     intellectual property rights.\n       (15) Any State should continue to enjoy the benefits of the \n     Federal intellectual property system, if that State accepts \n     the burdens with the benefits.\n       (16) A State should not enjoy the benefits of the Federal \n     intellectual property laws unless it is prepared to have \n     those same laws enforced against that State.\n       (17) Limiting the ability of a State to enjoy the benefits \n     of the Federal intellectual property system will neither \n     prevent the State from providing any services to citizens of \n     that State, nor stop the State from engaging in any \n     commercial activity.\n       (18) If a State waives its sovereign immunity from suit \n     under the Federal intellectual property laws, any \n     constitutional violation resulting from its infringement of a \n     Federal intellectual property right may be remedied in an \n     infringement suit in Federal court.\n       (19) If a State does not waive sovereign immunity with \n     respect to Federal intellectual property laws, it is \n     necessary and appropriate for Congress to exercise its power \n     under section 5 of the fourteenth amendment to the United \n     States Constitution to protect the constitutional rights of \n     owners of Federal intellectual property rights, which are \n     property interests protected by the fifth and fourteenth \n     amendments of the United States Constitution.\n       (20) According to the Supreme Court in College Savings \n     Bank, ``The hallmark of a protected property interest is the \n     right to exclude others.''. Patents, copyrights, and \n     trademarks are constitutionally cognizable species of \n     property because they secure for their owners rights of \n     exclusion against others.\n       (21) A State may not exercise any of the rights conferred \n     by a Federal intellectual property law without the \n     authorization of the right holder, except in the manner and \n     to the extent authorized by such law. In Goldstein v. \n     California, 412 U.S. 546 (1973), the Supreme Court stated \n     ``When Congress grants an exclusive right or monopoly, its \n     effects are pervasive; no citizen or State may escape its \n     reach.''.\n       (22) Because a State engaged in an infringing use of a \n     Federal intellectual property right is acting outside the \n     scope of its sovereign power, such State fails to meet the \n     public use requirement for a taking of property imposed by \n     the fifth amendment of the United States Constitution (made \n     applicable to the States through the fourteenth amendment).\n       (23) According to the Supreme Court in Hawaii Housing \n     Authority v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), a claim for the \n     taking of property\n\n[[Page S13560]]\n\n     in violation of the public use requirement is ripe at the \n     time of the taking.\n       (24) A violation of the Federal intellectual property laws \n     by a State may also constitute an unconstitutional \n     deprivation of property under the due process clause of the \n     fourteenth amendment of the United States Constitution.\n       (25) In order to enforce Federal intellectual property \n     rights against States under the fifth and fourteenth \n     amendments of the United States Constitution, it is \n     appropriate to provide a right to enjoin any continuing or \n     future constitutional violation and a right to recover \n     sufficient damages to make the injured party whole.\n       (26) Violations of the Federal intellectual property laws \n     by States not only impair the constitutional rights of the \n     individual intellectual property owner, but also discourage \n     technological innovation and artistic creation. Moreover, the \n     potential for future violations to go unremedied as a result \n     of State sovereign immunity prevents intellectual property \n     owners from securing fair and efficient fees in licensing \n     negotiations.\n       (27) States and instrumentalities of States have been \n     involved in many intellectual property cases. Some States \n     have violated Federal intellectual property rights and the \n     constitutional provisions which protect such rights and have \n     refused to waive their constitutional immunities, thereby \n     securing unfair economic advantages over other States and \n     private entities with whom such States may be in competition.\n       (28) States and instrumentalities of States have become \n     increasingly involved in commerce involving intellectual \n     property rights in recent years, and this trend is likely to \n     continue. As a result, violations of Federal intellectual \n     property rights by States have become increasingly more \n     widespread.\n       (29) It is not practical for Congress to engage in an \n     ongoing particularized inquiry as to which States are \n     violating the United States Constitution at any given time. \n     Accordingly, a national, uniform remedy for constitutional \n     violations is appropriate.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) provide States an opportunity to participate in the \n     Federal intellectual property system on equal terms with \n     private entities;\n       (2) reaffirm the availability of prospective relief to \n     prevent State officials from violating Federal intellectual \n     property laws, and to allow challenges to assertions by State \n     officials of rights secured under such laws, on the same \n     terms and in the same manner as if such State officials were \n     private parties;\n       (3) provide other Federal remedies to owners of Federal \n     intellectual property rights as against the States, State \n     instrumentalities and State officials, to the maximum extent \n     permitted by the United States Constitution; and\n       (4) abrogate State sovereign immunity in suits alleging \n     violations of Federal intellectual property laws or \n     challenging assertions of Federal intellectual property \n     rights by States to the maximum extent permitted by the \n     United States Constitution, pursuant to Congress's powers \n     under the fifth and fourteenth amendments of the United \n     States Constitution and any other applicable provisions.\n\n   TITLE I--STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n                                 SYSTEM\n\n                        Subtitle A--Definitions\n\n      SEC. 101.

Prospective relief may \n     include injunctive relief under section 34, costs and \n     attorney fees under section 35, destruction of infringing \n     articles under section 36, and declaratory relief under \n     section 2201 of title 28, United States Code.\n       ``(b) Remedy for Constitutional Violation.--\n       ``(1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `State' \n     includes a State, an instrumentality of a State, and an \n     officer or employee of a State acting in an official \n     capacity.\n       ``(2) In general.--\n       ``(A) Remedies.--Any State that takes any of the rights of \n     exclusion secured under this Act in violation of the fifth \n     amendment of the United States Constitution, or deprives any \n     person of any of the rights of exclusion secured under this \n     Act without due process of law in violation of the fourteenth \n     amendment--\n       ``(i) shall be liable to the party injured in a civil \n     action against the State for the recovery of that party's \n     reasonable and entire compensation; and\n       ``(ii) may be enjoined from continuing or future \n     constitutional violations, in accordance with the principles \n     of equity and upon such terms as the court may determine \n     reasonable.\n       ``(B) Compensation.--Reasonable and entire compensation may \n     include actual damages and profits or statutory damages, and \n     costs and attorney fees under section 35.\n       ``(3) Limitations.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The remedy provided under paragraph (2) \n     is not available in an action against--\n       ``(i) a State that has waived its sovereign immunity from \n     suit in Federal court for damages resulting from a violation \n     of this title; or\n       ``(ii) a State official in an individual capacity.\n       ``(B) Remedies.--Remedies (including remedies both at law \n     and in equity) are available against such State or State \n     official in the same manner and to the same extent as such \n     remedies are available in an action against a private entity \n     or individual under like circumstances.\n       ``(4) Burden of proof.--If a claimant produces prima facie \n     evidence to support a\n\n[[Page S13564]]\n\n     claim under paragraph (2), the burden of proof shall be on \n     the State, except as to any elements of the claim that would \n     have to be proved if the action were brought under another \n     provision of this Act.

Recent Supreme Court decisions \n     invalidated prior efforts by Congress to abrogate State \n     sovereign immunity in actions arising under the federal \n     intellectual property laws. The IPPRA encourages States to \n     participate in the federal intellectual property system on \n     equal terms with private entities, by conditioning a State's \n     receipt of future benefits under the federal intellectual \n     property laws on an unambiguous waiver of sovereign immunity. \n     As against States that choose not to participate, the bill \n     also provides new remedies for federal intellectual property \n     rights, to the maximum extent permitted by the Constitution.\n\n\n                            detailed summary\n\n   TITLE I--STATE PARTICIPATION IN THE FEDERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n                                 SYSTEM\n\n                        Subtitle A--Definitions\n\n                         Sec. 101. Definitions\n\n       Section 101 defines terms used in this title.\n\n     Subtitle B--Procedures for State Participation in the Federal \n                      Intellectual Property System\n\n                       Sec. 111. Opt-in procedure\n\n       Section 111 provides that no State or State instrumentality \n     may acquire a federal intellectual property right unless the \n     State opts in to the federal intellectual property system by \n     agreeing to waive sovereign immunity in any subsequent action \n     that either arises under a federal intellectual property law \n     or seeks a declaration with respect to a federal intellectual \n     property right. Thus, if a State elects to receive the \n     benefits of a nationally recognized right governed by uniform \n     federal laws, then it must accept the obligation to defend \n     any suits arising under those laws in the federal courts.\n       An assurance provided under section 111 is binding on the \n     State and fully enforceable. ``A State may effectuate a \n     waiver of its constitutional immunity . . . in the context of \n     a particular federal program,'' so long as the State's \n     intention to waive its immunity is unequivocal. Atascadero \n     State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238 n.1 & 241 (1985). \n     See also Litman v. George Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544 (4th Cir. \n     1999) (holding that a State's acceptance of federal education \n     funding resulted in a binding waiver of immunity in a \n     subsequent action against a State university under Title IX); \n     Innes v. Kansas State Univ., 184 F.3d 1275 (10th Cir. 1999) \n     (holding that a State university's agreement to participate \n     in a federal loan program acted as a binding waiver of \n     immunity).\n\n                Sec. 112. Breach of assurance by a State\n\n       Section 112 establishes procedures for determining whether \n     a State that has opted in to the federal intellectual \n     property system is in breach of its agreement to waive \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n        Sec. 113. Consequences of breach of assurance by a State\n\n       Section 113 sets forth three consequences of a breach of an \n     agreement to waive sovereign immunity.\n       First, under subsection (a), any pending applications by or \n     on behalf of the State for federal intellectual property \n     rights shall be regarded as abandoned and shall not be \n     subject to revival thereafter.\n       Second, under subsection (b), no damages or other monetary \n     relief shall be awarded in any action to enforce a federal \n     intellectual property right that is or has been owned by or \n     on behalf of the State during the preceding five years.\n       Third, under subsection (c), the State is barred from \n     acquiring any new rights under the federal intellectual \n     property laws for a period of one year. If, however, the \n     State opts back in to the system after a year has passed, by \n     providing a new assurance that it will henceforth waive its \n     sovereign immunity in federal intellectual property \n     litigation, it can then acquire new rights that will be \n     enforceable by the full panoply of federal intellectual \n     property remedies.\n\nSubtitle C--Administration of Procedures for State Participation in the \n                  Federal Intellectual Property System\n\n    Sec. 121. Notification by court of State assertion of sovereign \n                                immunity\n\n       Section 121 directs federal courts to notify the \n     Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks within 20 days of \n     finding that a State has asserted sovereign immunity in any \n     action to enforce or challenge a federal intellectual \n     property right.\n\n  Sec. 122. Confirmation by Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of \n                 State assertion of sovereign immunity\n\n       Section 122 directs the Commissioner of Patents and \n     Trademarks, within 20 days of receiving a notification under \n     section 121, to forward such notification to the Attorney \n     General of the State, together with a copy of title I of the \n     IPPRA, and inquire whether the State intends to withdraw its \n     assertion of immunity and consent tot he continuation or \n     refiling of the action in which it was made within the 60-\n     day grace period provided in section 112(b)(2).\n\n  Sec. 123. Publication by Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks of \n                 State assertion of sovereign immunity\n\n       Section 123 directs the Commissioner of Patents and \n     Trademarks, in consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture \n     and the Register of Copyrights, to publish in the Federal \n     Register and maintain on the Internet information concerning \n     the participation of each State in the federal intellectual \n     property system. The information must include, for each \n     State, whether the State's sovereign immunity has been \n     asserted, and the name of the case and court in which any \n     such assertion of immunity was made.\n\n                     Sec. 124. Rulemaking authority\n\n       Section 124 authorizes the Commissioner of Patents and \n     Trademarks to promulgate such rules as necessary to implement \n     the provisions of this subtitle.\n\n    Subtitle D--Amendments to the Federal Intellectual Property Laws\n\n  Sec. 131. Conditions for State participation in the federal patent \n                                 system\n\n       Section 131 amends the federal patent statute to require \n     any State that seeks to register for patent protection to \n     provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to \n     waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or \n     challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must \n     also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been \n     asserted in any such action during the past year.\n\n   Sec. 132. Conditions for State participation in the federal plant \n                       variety protection system\n\n       Section 132 amends the federal plant variety statute to \n     require any State that seeks to register for plant variety \n     protection to provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's \n     intention to waive sovereign immunity in any action to \n     enforce or challenge a federal intellectual property right. A \n     State must also certify that the State's sovereign immunity \n     has not been asserted in any such action during the past \n     year.\n\n Sec. 133. Conditions for State participation in the federal copyright \n                                 system\n\n       Section 133 amends the federal copyright statute to require \n     any State that seeks to register for copyright protection to \n     provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to \n     waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or \n     challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must \n     also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been \n     asserted in any such action during the past year.\n\n Sec. 134. Conditions for State participation in the federal mask work \n                                 system\n\n       Section 134 amends the federal mask work statute to require \n     any State that seeks to register for mask work protection to \n     provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's intention to \n     waive sovereign immunity in any action to enforce or \n     challenge a federal intellectual property right. A State must \n     also certify that the State's sovereign immunity has not been \n     asserted in any such action during the past year.\n\n Sec. 135. Conditions for State participation in the federal original \n                             design system\n\n       Section 135 amends the federal original design statute to \n     require any State that seeks to register for design \n     protection to provide an unequivocal assurance of the State's \n     intention to waive sovereign immunity in any action to \n     enforce or challenge a federal intellectual property right. A \n     State must also certify that the State's sovereign immunity \n     has not been asserted in any such action during the past \n     year.\n\n Sec. 136. Conditions for State participation in the federal trademark \n                                 system\n\n       Section 136 amends the federal trademark statute to require \n     any State that seeks to\n\n[[Page S13565]]\n\n     register for trademark protection to provide an unequivocal \n     assurance of the State's intention to waive sovereign \n     immunity in any action to enforce or challenge a federal \n     intellectual property right. A State must also certify that \n     the State's sovereign immunity has not been asserted in any \n     such action during the past year.\n\n                    Sec. 137. No retroactive effect\n\n       Section 137 ensures that the amendments made by this \n     subtitle are not given retroactive effect. Specifically, the \n     amendments do not apply to any application by a State that \n     was pending before the effective date of this subtitle, or to \n     any assertion of sovereign immunity by a State made before \n     the enactment of the IPPRA.\n\n TITLE II--RESTORATION OF PROTECTION FOR FEDERAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \n                                 RIGHTS\n\n          Sec. 201. Liability of States for patent violations\n\n       Section 201 replaces section 296 of title 35, which was \n     enacted pursuant to the Patent and Plant Variety Remedy \n     Clarification Act of 1992 and invalidated by the Supreme \n     Court in Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. \n     College Savings Bank, 119 S. Ct. 2199 (1999).\n       Subsection (a) ensures the full availability of prospective \n     relief to prevent State officials from violating the federal \n     patent laws, and to allow challenges to assertions by State \n     officials of rights secured under such laws, on the same \n     terms and in the same manner as if such State officials were \n     private individuals. Such relief is authorized under the \n     doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), which held \n     that an individual may sue a State official in an official \n     capacity for prospective relief requiring the State official \n     to cease violating federal law, even if the State itself is \n     immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment.\n       Subsection (b) provides a cause of action against States, \n     State instrumentalities, and State officials acting in an \n     official capacity for (1) taking a patent right in violation \n     of the Fifth Amendment or (2) depriving a person of a patent \n     right without due process of law in violation of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. Damages are fixed at ``reasonable and \n     entire compensation,'' which is the measure of damages \n     available against the United States for infringement of a \n     patent (see 28 U.S.C. 1498); treble damages are not \n     available under this subsection. Injunctive relief is \n     available to prevent or deter constitutional violations.\n       The remedy provided under subsection (b) is not available \n     against States that have waived their sovereign immunity from \n     suit in federal court, nor is it available against State \n     officials in their individual capacity, who do not partake of \n     the State's sovereign immunity. Such States and State \n     officials remain subject to the remedies provided by other \n     provisions of the federal patent laws, to the same extent as \n     such remedies are available in an action against any private \n     entity or individual. Thus, for example, a State official \n     sued in an individual capacity may not assert any defense or \n     claim of absolute or qualified immunity that would not be \n     available to a private individual under similar \n     circumstances.\n       Subsection (b) abrogates State sovereign immunity to the \n     maximum extent permitted by the Constitution, pursuant to \n     Congress's powers under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \n     and any other applicable provisions.\n       A claim under subsection (b) for taking a patent right is \n     ripe at the time of the taking. In Hawaii Housing Authority \n     v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229 (1984), the Supreme Court held that \n     the Public Use Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable \n     to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, prohibits a \n     State from taking private property for a non-public use, even \n     with just compensation. The Court further stated that ``[t]he \n     `public use' requirement is . . . coterminous with the scope \n     of a sovereign's police powers.'' 457 U.S. at 240. Because \n     States making unauthorized uses of federal intellectual \n     property rights are acting outside the scope of their \n     sovereign powers, a State's infringement of a patent, even if \n     compensated, is an unconstitutional taking of property for a \n     non-public use; accordingly, the patent holder need not seek \n     a remedy in State proceedings before filing a claim under \n     subsection (b) in federal court.\n       Subsection (b)(4) addresses the burden of proof when a \n     claimant produces prima facie evidence to support a claim \n     under this subsection. Under subsection (b)(4), the burden of \n     proof is on the State, except as to any elements of the claim \n     that would have to be proved if the action were brought under \n     another provision of this title. As to such elements, the \n     burden of proof is unaffected. Thus, for example, if the \n     adequacy of any State remedies became an issue, the State \n     would bear the burden of proof thereon.\n       Subsection (c) clarifies that the federal patent laws and \n     treaties supersede and preempt any power of a State to \n     acquire or otherwise affect patent rights through the \n     exercise of eminent domain.\n\nSec. 202. Liability of States for violation of plant variety protection\n\n       Section 202 establishes the same sorts of remedies for \n     violations of protected plant varieties as section 201 \n     establishes with respect to patents.\n\n         Sec. 203. Liability of States for copyright violations\n\n       Section 203 establishes the same sorts of remedies for \n     violations of copyrights as section 201 establishes with \n     respect to patents.\n\n         Sec. 204. Liability of States for mask work violations\n\n       Section 204 establishes the same sorts of remedies for \n     violations of federally-protected rights in mask works as \n     section 201 establishes with respect to patents.\n\n      Sec. 205. Liability of States for original design violations\n\n       Section 205 establishes the same sorts of remedies for \n     violations of federally-protected rights in original designs \n     as section 201 establishes with respect to patents.\n\n           Sec. 206. Liability of States trademark violations\n\n       Section 206 establishes the same sorts of remedies for \n     violations of federally-registered trademarks and service \n     marks as section 201 establishes with respect to patents.\n\n                    Sec. 207. Rules of construction\n\n       Subsection (a) makes clear that the district courts shall \n     have original jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1338 of any \n     action arising under this title. It follows that, pursuant to \n     28 U.S.C. Sec. 1295, the United States Court of Appeals for \n     the Federal Circuit shall have exclusive jurisdiction of any \n     appeal from a final decision of a district court in an action \n     arising under this title relating to patents, plant variety \n     protection, and exclusive rights in designs under chapter 13 \n     of title 17.\n       Subsection (b) provides that this title shall be construed \n     in favor of a broad protection of intellectual property \n     rights, to the maximum extent permitted by its terms and the \n     Constitution.\n\n                       TITLE III--EFFECTIVE DATES\n\n                       Sec. 301. Effective dates\n\n       Subsection (a) provides that the opt-in procedures \n     established by title I of the IPPRA shall take effect 90 days \n     after the date of enactment of the IPPRA.\n       Subsection (b) provides that the remedial provisions \n     established by title II of the IPPRA shall take effect with \n     respect to violations by States that occur on or after the \n     date of enactment of the IPPRA.\n\n                         Sec. 302. Severability\n\n       Section 302 contains a strong severability clause. If any \n     provision of the IPPRA or of any amendment made by the IPPRA, \n     or any application of such provision to any person or \n     circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the remainder \n     of the IPPRA, the amendments made by the IPPRA, and the \n     application of the provision to any other person or \n     circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n

Con. Res. 63\n\n       Whereas on October 27, 1999, several armed individuals \n     broke into Armenia's Parliament and assassinated the Prime \n     Minister of Armenia, Vazgen Sargsian, the Chairman of the \n     Armenian Parliament, Karen Demirchian, the Deputy Chairman of \n     the Armenian Parliament, Yuri Bakhshian, the Minister of \n     Operative Issues, Leonard Petrossian, and other members of \n     the Armenian Government;\n       Whereas Armenia is working toward democracy, the rule of \n     law, and a viable free market economy since obtaining its \n     freedom from Soviet rule in 1991; and\n       Whereas all nations of the world mourn the loss suffered by \n     Armenia on October 27, 1999: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) deplores the slaying of the Prime Minister of Armenia, \n     Vazgen Sargsian, the Chairman of the Armenian Parliament, \n     Karen Demirchian, the Deputy Chairman of the Armenian \n     Parliament, Yuri Bakhshian, the Minister of Operative Issues, \n     Leonard Petrossian, and other members of the Armenian \n     Government struck down in this violent attack;\n       (2) strongly shares the determination of the Armenian \n     people that the perpetrators of these vile acts will be \n     swiftly brought to justice so that Armenia may demonstrate \n     its resolute opposition to acts of terror;\n       (3) commends the efforts of the late Prime Minister and the \n     Armenian Government for their commitment to democracy, the \n     rule of law, and for supporting free market movements \n     internationally; and\n       (4) continues to cherish the strong friendship between \n     Armenia and the United States.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deepest \ncondolences to the family of the slain Prime Minister of Armenia, \nVazgen Sargsian, and the other assassinated leaders of the Armenian \nParliament who were tragically killed in the brutal attack on the \nArmenian Parliament on October 27, 1999. My thoughts and prayers are \nalso with the people of Armenia and the Armenian community around the \nworld and in the United States.\n  The tragic turn of events that took place earlier this week should \nnot be viewed as an impediment to the on-going positive trends the \nworld has seen in Armenia. Indeed, Armenia has proven its commitment to \na democratic future in its recent elections which were deemed free and \nfair by international election monitors. They have also made \nsubstantial progress on the peace process regarding Nagorno Karabakh.\n  The United States is enjoying a growing and mutually beneficial \nrelationship with Armenia. Our focus should be on our continued support \nof the Armenian people. We must not allow the recent terrorist activity \nto eschew our dedication in helping Armenia achieve the highest form of \nfreedom, liberty, and opportunity. To reaffirm our commitment to the \nprogress embodied by the fallen Armenian patriots not only should be \nour goal, but our duty as a global leader.\n  For this reason, I ask to submit a resolution that condemns the \nterrorist activities that took the lives of the Armenian Prime \nMinister, Vazgen Sargsian, and other leaders of the Armenian \nParliament, and pledges continued alliance between our two countries. \nOur thoughts are with the families, friends and loved ones of those \naffected by this tragedy, and we send our hope that those who \nperpetrated this horrible act will be brought to justice.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13567-2", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 64--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS \n CONCERNING CONTINUED USE OF THE UNITED STATES NAVY TRAINING RANGE ON \n        THE ISLAND OF VIEQUES IN THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Sessions, \nMr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Kyl) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 64\n\n       Whereas the success or failure of the Nation's Armed Forces \n     when sent into combat and the risk of loss of life, both to \n     United States military personnel and to civilians, are a \n     direct function of the degree of training received by members \n     of the Armed Forces before combat;\n       Whereas from World War II through the most recent crisis in \n     Kosovo the Nation's military has been able to meet the call \n     to arms due to training such as that afforded at the United \n     States Navy training range on the island of Vieques in the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico;\n       Whereas in April 1999, following an accident at that \n     training range that resulted in the death of a Navy civilian \n     employee, training activities at that range were suspended by \n     direction of the Secretary of the Navy pending a safety \n     review;\n       Whereas officials of the Department of Defense have \n     testified before congressional committees that the Vieques \n     training range is the only range along the Atlantic seaboard \n     that allows critical combined arms live fire training that \n     includes the coordinated use of naval surface fire support \n     training, Navy/Marine amphibious combined arms training, \n     Carrier Battle Group strike training and high altitude \n     tactics, and subsurface training;\n       Whereas officials of the Department of Defense have \n     testified before congressional committees that the safe \n     conduct of operations on the island of Vieques has been and \n     will remain the primary concern of the Department of the Navy \n     and that the recent death of the civilian Navy employee on \n     the range was the first civilian death on the range since its \n     purchase in 1941;\n       Whereas the John F. Kennedy carrier battle group, which was \n     unable to continue training at Vieques after the April \n     accident, deployed in September 1999 in degraded readiness \n     condition and the Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier battle group, \n     which is scheduled to deploy in the spring of 2000, will be \n     forced to deploy in a significantly degraded readiness \n     condition if not allowed to conduct training activities at \n     the Vieques training range before departing on that \n     deployment;\n       Whereas the suspension of training activities at the \n     Vieques training range has resulted in a loss of critical \n     combat training that is essential to the Nation's Navy and \n     Marine forces; and\n       Whereas, given that recently deploying Navy and Marine \n     Corps battle groups have been sent directly into combat \n     operations in Kosovo and Iraq, thereby placing service \n     personnel immediately in harm's way, it would be unthinkable \n     to knowingly deploy members of the Armed Forces in the future \n     without this essential training, since to do so would place \n     American lives, including the lives of members of the Armed \n     Forces from Puerto Rico, at high risk: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) calls upon the Secretary of the Navy and the Attorney \n     General of the United States to promptly ensure that the \n     Federal property located at the Vieques training range in the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is safe and secure and, once the \n     range is safe and secure, for the Secretary of the Navy to \n     resume critical live fire training at that range;\n       (2) calls upon the President, as Commander-in-Chief, to \n     ensure that United States forces deploy with 100 percent of \n     the combat qualifications needed to meet national security \n     requirements;\n       (3) strongly urges the Department of Defense and the \n     Government of Puerto Rico to reestablish a mutually \n     supportive relationship, to resolve the issues between the \n     Department of the Navy and the people of Puerto Rico, and to \n     implement a program that addresses the economic and social \n     needs and safety concerns of the residents of Vieques and the \n     citizens of Puerto Rico; and\n       (4) recognizes the significant contribution by the \n     residents of Vieques and the citizens of Puerto Rico to the \n     Nation's defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13567-3", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13567-S13568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 209--EXPRESSING CONCERN OVER INTERFERENCE WITH \n  FREEDOM OF THE PRESS AND THE INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIAL AND ELECTORAL \n                          INSTITUTIONS IN PERU\n\n  Mr. HELMS (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \nDeWine, and Mr. Jeffords) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred\n\n[[Page S13568]]\n\nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record, a letter from the President of the United States to this \nSenator.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 22, 1999.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter on the United \n     States Navy's training facilities on Vieques.\n       I share your concern for the combat readiness of deploying \n     Navy and Marine Corps forces. Military readiness is one of my \n     top defense priorities. I have ordered our forces into action \n     several times, most recently in Kosovo, and every time have \n     seen that the rigorous, realistic training they undergo is \n     essential for success in combat and for protecting our \n     national security. As Commander in Chief I will not permit \n     Navy or Marine Corps units to deploy unless they are at a \n     satisfactory level of combat readiness.\n       I believe that we can meet Navy and Marine Corps combat \n     readiness requirements will ensuring the safety and well \n     being of the people of Vieques. The U.S. Armed Forces work \n     hard to ensure that their training activities throughout the \n     United States, and abroad as well, do not adversely impact \n     the safety and livelihood of nearby civilian residents. The \n     Defense Department is also required by law to be \n     conscientious guardians of the environment. I am sure you \n     would agree that these requirements apply no less on Vieques \n     than in any other location where our forces train.\n       As you know, Secretary Bill Cohen established a special \n     panel to conduct an independent review of our training \n     operations at Vieques. I understand that Bill recently was \n     briefed by the panel members and that he is considering next \n     steps in the process. At the conclusion of the panel's \n     efforts, I expect to receive a recommendation from Bill on \n     the future of Navy training facilities on Vieques. In \n     reaching a decision, I will review carefully Bill's \n     recommendation, weighing Navy and Marine Corps combat \n     readiness requirements, the alternatives that may be \n     available to meet their training needs, and the safety, \n     environmental and economic concerns raised by the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and the people of Vieques.\n       Again, thank you for your letter. I hope that, working \n     together, we will be able to find a solution that fulfills \n     our essential national security needs and meets the concerns \n     of the residents of Vieques Island and the people of Puerto \n     Rico.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                                Bill.  \n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee has \ntaken cognizance of this very critical situation of our east coast \nfleet units being deployed, their state of readiness, and the degree of \nrisk these units are facing as they deploy into the operations in Iraq, \nthe operations in the Persian Gulf, and the unforeseen risks that seem \nto be ever present in that region of the world, the Mediterranean, the \nPersian Gulf, that arise so quickly and demand the instantaneous \nreaction, if so directed by the President, hopefully as a deterrence \nand then, if necessary, the actual combat.\n  We have seen this now for a decade. When we stop to think of the \nrisks taken by these young men and women flying aircraft off these \nships, and performing other military missions, the Senate owes them no \nless than the highest possible standard of training, the best possible \nequipment to reduce that risk.\n  Therefore, having chaired the hearings of the Committee of Armed \nServices of recent and, indeed, under the chairmanship of Senator \nInhofe, a subcommittee of our full committee, and under the \nchairmanship of Senator Snowe, a second subcommittee--two subcommittee \nhearings and a full committee hearing on that state of readiness and \nparticularly as that state of readiness could be affected adversely by \nthe absence of the ability of the United States to continue the use of \nthe ranges on the islands of Vieques in Puerto Rico. That is the reason \nwhy I offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  I shall read in general from this resolution and comment as I go:\n\n       In the Senate of the United States Mr. Warner submitted the \n     following resolution;\n       Resolution\n       Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the February \n     2000 deployment--\n\n  That is coming in just a matter of months--\n\n     of the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit to an area of potential hostilities and \n     the essential requirements that the battle group and \n     expeditionary unit have received [that] training needed to \n     certify the warfighting proficiency of the forces comprising \n     the battle group and expeditionary unit.\n       Whereas the President, as Commander-in-Chief of all of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, makes the final decision--\n\n  Under our Constitution--\n\n     to order a deployment of those forces--\n\n  And all our forces. That is his role under the Constitution. We \nrespect that role.\n\n       Whereas the President, in making that decision--\n\n  With reference to the Eisenhower battle group--\n\n     relies upon the recommendations of the civilian and military \n     leaders tasked by law--\n\n  Laws passed by this body and predecessor Congresses--\n\n     with the responsibility of training those forces, including \n     the Commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy and the \n     Commander of the Marine Forces in the Atlantic;\n       Whereas the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility--\n\n  At Vieques--\n\n     has been since World War II, and continues to be, an \n     essential--\n\n  Underline ``essential''--\n\n     part of the training infrastructure that is necessary to \n     ensure that maritime forces deploying from the east coast of \n     the United States are prepared and ready to execute their \n     assigned missions.\n\n  Not only execute their assigned missions, but to accept the risk of \nlife and limb in executing those missions.\n\n       Whereas according to the testimony of the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Island of Vieques is a \n     vital part of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility \n     and makes an essential contribution to the national security \n     of the United States by providing integrated live-fire \n     combined arms training opportunities to Navy and Marine Corps \n     forces deploying from the east coast of the United States;\n       Whereas according to testimony before the Committee on \n     Armed Services--\n\n  Just weeks ago--\n\n     and the report of the Special Panel on Military Operations on \n     Vieques--\n  Again, issued a week or so ago--\n\n     a suitable alternative to Vieques cannot now be identified;\n\n\n[[Page S13570]]\n\n\n  Much less identified and put into an operational status.\n\n       Whereas during the course of its hearings on September 22 \n     and October 19, 1999, the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate acknowledged and expressed its sympathy for the tragic \n     death and injuries that resulted from the training accident \n     that occurred at Vieques in April 1999;\n\n  We did that with heartfelt expression during the course of our \nhearings just weeks ago.\n\n       Whereas the Navy--\n\n  In the judgment of the committee--\n\n     has failed [at times] to take those actions necessary to \n     develop sound relations with the people of Puerto Rico;\n\n  Indeed, with the people most specifically on Vieques. The Navy has \nnot done a good job, in this Senator's judgment, and collectively, I \nthink, in the majority of the committee in carrying out its \nresponsibility of important relationships with the people and assuring \nthem, first, of the essential need and their contribution to our \nnational security and how to operate this range in a manner that is \nsafe. We acknowledge that.\n\n       Whereas the Navy should implement fully the terms of the \n     1983 Memorandum of Understanding between the Navy and the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico regarding Vieques and work to \n     increase its efforts to improve the economic conditions for \n     and the safety of the people on Vieques;\n       Whereas in February 2000--\n\n  Just months away--\n\n     the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit are scheduled to deploy to the \n     Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf where the battle group \n     and expeditionary unit will face the possibility of combat, \n     as experienced by predecessor--\n\n  Units deploying in the past years--\n\n     during operations over Iraq and during other unexpected \n     contingencies--\n\n  That arise in that dangerous region of the world.\n\n       Whereas in a September 22, 1999 letter to the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate, the President--\n\n  The Commander in Chief--\n\n     stated that the rigorous, realistic training undergone by \n     military forces ``is--\n\n  I quote the President of the United States--\n\n     ``is essential for success in combat and for protecting our \n     national security'';\n\n  The President realizes this. It is not a political document I am \nhandling. This is the recitation of the statements by the President \nthis year on this very subject, and he has put it down here very \nclearly. The purpose of this sense of the Senate is to give him the \nsupport necessary to make the tough decisions and resolve this problem.\n\n       Whereas in that letter the President also stated that he \n     would not permit Navy or Marine Corps forces to deploy \n     ``unless they are at a satisfactory level of combat \n     readiness'';\n       Whereas Richard Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, recently \n     testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that ``only by providing this preparation can we \n     fairly ask our service members to put their lives at risk.''\n       Whereas according to the testimony of the Chairman of the \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the \n     Commandant of the Marine Corps--\n\n  This testimony was just three days ago--\n\n     Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ``critical to \n     our readiness'', and the failure to provide for adequate \n     live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment \n     will place those forces at--\n\n  Listen carefully--\n\n     at unacceptably high risk during deployment.\n       Whereas Admiral Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and \n     General Jones, the Commandant of the Marine Corps--\n\n  On October 19, 1999--\n\n     testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that without the ability to train on Vieques, the \n     U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit scheduled for deployment in February 2000 \n     would not be ready for such deployment ``without greatly \n     increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go \n     in harm's way'';\n       Whereas Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander of the Sixth Fleet \n     of the Navy, recently testified before the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate that the loss of training on Vieques \n     would ``cost American lives''; and\n       Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of \n     unrestrained civil disobedience--\n\n  I repeat:\n\n       Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of \n     unrestrained civil disobedience--\n\n  In defiance of law, in defiance of a court order--\n\n       Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of \n     unrestrained civil disobedience from using the training \n     facilities on Vieques which are required to accomplish the \n     training necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of combat \n     readiness: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     President should not--\n\n  I repeat: Not--\n\n     deploy the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group or the 24th Marine \n     Expeditionary Unit until:\n       (1) the President, in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief of Naval \n     Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, reviews \n     the certifications regarding the readiness of the battle \n     group and the expeditionary unit made by the Commander of the \n     Second Fleet of the Navy and the Commander of the Marine \n     Forces in the Atlantic, as the case may be; and\n       (2) the President determines and so notifies Congress that \n     the battle group and the expeditionary unit are free of [any] \n     serious deficiencies in major warfare areas.\n\n  Mr. President, I feel very serious about this issue. I thank the \nindulgence of my colleagues and the Senate to come before you this \nafternoon to introduce this resolution.\n  I draw this resolution to the attention of all of my colleagues \nbecause this great body of the Senate, together with the House of \nRepresentatives, is a coequal--is a coequal--partner with regard to the \ntraining, the safety, above all, and the missions undertaken by the men \nand women of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Today's military has been put to one of the highest peaks of stress, \nstress on the actual men and women at sea and in the air and under the \nsea and on the land, stress on their families at home because of the \nhigh tempo, the high number of deployments of these forces all over the \nworld.\n  Statistically, President Clinton--and this is pure statistics--has \ndeployed the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States \ninto more contingency operations than any other President prior. I \nrepeat that: More times. I am not questioning, in any way, his \nauthority or his judgment. The fact is, he has done this.\n  The simple sense of the Senate says: Mr. President, in your own \nletter you talked about the seriousness of this situation at Vieques. \nThe Senate is on notice that you, your Secretaries of Navy and Defense, \nand the military are working to resolve this. But we, the Senate, \nexercising our coequal responsibility, are placing the concern we have \nfor the welfare of the men and women undertaking this deployment, and \nthe risks they share with their families at home, we, Mr. President, \nmost respectfully say to you we want to see absolute clarity in the \ncertifications from those military commanders and those civilian bosses \nof the military commanders.\n  We have a system in our country which is the right system. We have \ncivilian control of the military. They have the joint responsibility--\nthe civilian/military control, fleet commanders--to make those \ncertifications to our President that this group is ready, or, Mr. \nPresident, respectfully this group is not ready, to undertake this \nmission and assume those risks.\n  That is what we ask.\n  I request all Senators, as an obligation to those men and women of \nthis battle group--and I daresay there are soldiers and Marines and \nairmen from every one of the 50 States in that battle group--so I ask \nall Senators to review this and hope you will join me as a cosponsor.\n  According to Article II, section 2, of the Constitution of the United \nStates, the President is the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Armed \nForces. As such, he bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that \nthe men and women in uniform he orders into harm's way, receive the \ntraining necessary to protect their lives.\n  I have been working to preserve the access of the United States Navy \nand Marine Corps to the essential training facility on the island of \nVieques, since I was Secretary of the Navy. This facility is absolutely \nvital to the readiness of our naval forces.\n  Over the past several weeks, the Armed Services Committee has held a \nseries of hearings on this important issue. Over the course of these \nhearings, I have become increasingly convinced that it would be \nirresponsible to deploy our naval forces without the training provided \nby the Vieques facilities.\n  On Tuesday, September 22, 1999, the Readiness and Management Support\n\n[[Page S13571]]\n\nSubcommittee, under the leadership of Senator Inhofe, held a hearing to \nreview the need for Vieques as a training facility and explore \nalternative sites that might be utilized. At that hearing both Admiral \nFallon, commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and General Pace, \ncommander of all Marine Forces in the Atlantic, testified that the \nArmed Forces of the United States need Vieques as a training ground to \nprepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military \noperations.\n  On October 13th, the Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of \nSenator Snowe, heard from Admiral Murphy, commander of the Navy's Sixth \nFleet and the commander who receives the naval forces trained at \nVieques, who stated that a loss of Vieques would ``cost American \nlives.''\n  Earlier this month, after the release of the report prepared by the \nSpecial Panel on Military Operations on Vieques, I held a hearing of \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee to discuss with Administration and \nPuerto Rican officials the recommendations of that report, and to \nsearch for a compromise solution that addresses the national security \nrequirements and the interests of the people of Vieques. At that \nhearing, Secretary Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, stated that only \nby providing the necessary training can we fairly ask our service \nmembers to put their lives at risk. Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval \nOperations, stated that the Eisenhower Battle Group would not be able \nto deploy in February without a significant increase in risk to the \nlives of the men and women of that battle group unless they are allowed \nto conduct required training on Vieques. Furthermore, General Jones, \nCommandant of the Marine Corps, testified that the loss of training \nprovided on Vieques ``will result in degraded cohesion on the part of \nour battalions and our squadrons and our crews, decreased confidence in \ntheir ability to do their very dangerous jobs and missions, a decreased \nlevel of competence and the ability to fight and win on the \nbattlefield.''\n  At that hearing, I asked Admiral Johnson and General Jones ``Is there \nany training that can be substituted for Vieques live fire training \nbetween now and February that will constitute, in your professional \njudgment, a sufficient level of training to enable you to say to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Eisenhower Battle Group and \nthe 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are ready to go.'' In the response \nthey stated ``no, sir, not without--not without greatly increasing the \nrisk to those men and women who we ask to go in harm's way, no, sir.''\n\n  I remain convinced that the training requirement is real and will \ncontinue to directly affect the readiness of our Carrier Battle Groups \nand Marine Expeditionary Units. As General Shelton recently testified \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee, the training on Vieques is \n``critical'' to military readiness. He further stated that he \n``certainly would not want to see our troops sent into an area where \nthere was going to be combat, without having had this type of an \nexperience. We should not deploy them under those conditions.''\n  All of the military officers with whom we have spoken on this issue \nhave informed us that the loss of Vieques would increase the risk to \nour military personnel deploying to potential combat environments. The \nRush Panel, appointed at the request of the Resident Commissioner from \nPuerto Rico and at the direction of the President, recognized the need \nfor Vieques and recommended its continued use for at least five years.\n  What we have learned in these hearings is that Vieques is a unique \ntraining asset, both in terms of its geography with deep open water and \nunrestricted airspace and its training support infrastructure. The last \ntwo East Coast carrier battle groups which deployed to the Adriatic and \nPersian Gulf completed their final integrated live fire training at \nVieques. Both battle groups, led by the carriers U.S.S. Enterprise and \nU.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, subsequently saw combat in Operations Desert \nFox (Iraq) and Allied Force (Kosovo) within days of arriving in the \nrespective theater of operations. Their success in these operations, \nwith no loss of American life, was largely attributable to the \nrealistic and integrated live fire training completed at Vieques prior \nto their deployment.\n  Those calling for the Navy and Marine Corps to cease training \noperations on the island and convey Navy-owned land to the Government \nof Puerto Rico often point to the struggling economy of Vieques and the \nbanter posed by Navy training to the local citizens as supporting \nevidence. They express disappointment in the Navy's failure to more \nfully implement the terms of the 1983 Memorandum of Understanding which \noutlined the responsibilities of the Navy for assisting the economic \ndevelopment and safety of the local community. To address those \nconcerns, we can, and should, work together to initiate new programs to \nassist the Navy and the residents of Vieques in stimulating the local \neconomy and ensuring that all possible safety measures are adopted. \nHowever, economic concerns and correctable safety concerns should not \nforce the Navy to cease vital training when that would increase the \nrisk to the safety and security of our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. President, as long as we are committing our nation's youth to \nmilitary operations throughout the world; and as long as Vieques is \nnecessary to train these individuals so that they can perform their \nmissions safely and successfully; it would be irresponsible to deploy \nthese forces without first allowing them to train at their vital \nfacility. I hope that all of my colleagues will support this \nresolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13571-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13571-S13573]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   AFRICAN GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DeWINE AMENDMENT NO. 2413\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. DeWINE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed to \namendment No. 2398 submitted by him to the bill (H.R. 434) to authorize \na new trade and investment policy for sub-Sahara Africa; as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 5, of the matter proposed to be inserted, \n     strike all through line 13 and insert the following:\n       ``(E) Retaliation list.--The term `retaliation list' means \n     the list of products of a foreign country or countries that \n     have failed to comply with the report of the panel or \n     Appellate Body of the WTO and with respect to which the Trade \n     Representative is imposing duties above the level that would \n     otherwise be imposed under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of \n     the United States.\n       ``(F) Failure to implement wto dispute resolutions.--The \n     Trade Representative shall include on the retaliation list \n     and on any revised lists reciprocal goods, of the industries \n     affected by the failure of the foreign country or countries \n     to implement the recommendation made pursuant to a dispute \n     settlement proceeding under the World Trading Organization \n     except in cases where existing retaliation and its \n     corresponding preliminary retaliation list do not already \n     meet this requirement.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        MACK AMENDMENT NO. 2414\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. MACK submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \namendment No. 2361 submitted by Mr. Conrad to the bill, H.R. 434, \nsupra; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, which has United Nations oversight \nresponsibilities, and having been appointed by the President to serve \ntwo terms as a congressional delegate to the United Nations, I have \nfocused significant attention on the United Nations. On the anniversary \nof the founding of the United Nations, I think it is appropriate to \ntake time for us all to reflect on that important institution.\n  Fifty-four years ago this week, the members of the United Nations' \nfounding delegation met in San Francisco for the signing ceremony that \ncreated the United Nations. There was great anticipation and a \ncollective enthusiasm for this new, global institution. Delegates spoke \nof hope, of expectation, of the promise of peace. President Truman \nechoed the thoughts of those founding members when he told the \ndelegates they had, ``created a great instrument for peace and security \nand human progress in the world.'' Fifty-four years later, however, the \nUnited Nations is struggling to meet its potential.\n  In Congress, the need for the United Nations to reform itself often \novershadows the activities United Nations does well. As we saw in the \nPersian Gulf war, the United Nations can play a useful role in building \ncoalitions to address matters of international security. Moreover, the \nUnited Nations has the ability to effectively conduct traditional \npeacekeeping operations, such as those in Cyprus and the Sinai \nPeninsula, where hostilities have ceased and all parties agree to the \nU.N. peacekeeping role. In the areas of humanitarian relief, child \nsurvival, and refugee assistance, much of the work of UNICEF and the \nU.N. High Commissioner for Refugees deserves praise. And many of the \nU.N. agencies that focus on technical cooperation play a crucial role \nin establishing and coordinating international standards for \ngovernments and businesses, including the International Civil Aviation \nOrganization, the International Telecommunications Union, the Universal \nPostal Union, and the World Intellectual Property Organization.\n  However, the ability of the United Nations to live up to the goals \nstated\n\n[[Page S13574]]\n\nat its founding has been stymied by its massive, uncoordinated growth. \nFortunately, a consensus appears to be building that the United Nations \nneeds to reform in order to be a viable institution. As Secretary-\nGeneral Annan noted, ``a reformed United Nations will be a more \nrelevant United Nations in the eyes of the world.'' To this end, the \nUnited States must help shape the United Nations to be an organization \nthat the United States needs as much as the United Nations needs the \nUnited States.\n  In an effort to push the United Nations toward reform, the Senate has \npassed a comprehensive package that links the payment of arrears to the \nachievement of reform benchmarks. These are achievable, common-sense \nreforms. We are calling for a code of conduct with an anti-nepotism \nprovision; a mechanism to sunset outdated and unnecessary programs; and \ntransparency in the budget process. We do not need to micro-manage the \nUnited Nations, but we need to make sure a proper structure is in place \nfor the United Nations to be able to manage itself.\n  We must pay our arrears to the United Nations. In doing so, however, \nwe should put the arrears in perspective. Throughout the history of the \nUnited Nations, the United States has always been its most generous \ndonor. The United States contributes around $2 billion to U.N. \norganizations and activities every year. This is three times more \ngenerous than any other permanent member of the Security Council. I do \nnot believe success in any of the areas where the United Nations excels \nwould be possible without a high level of U.S. support.\n  The U.S. mission will have a difficult job implementing reforms when \na massive U.N. bureaucracy and numerous member states have a vested \ninterest in resisting reform and maintaining the status quo. And I \nrecognize the U.S. mission's job is more difficult without the arrears \npackage signed into law. But Ambassador Holbrooke has shown that it can \nbe done. He has already won a seat for an American on the budget \ncommittee of the United Nations and is making progress in getting our \nassessment rates reduced.\n  As I renew my commitment to champion the arrears package in the \nCongress, I want to underscore that the reforms proposed by the United \nStates are critical to ensure the United Nations is effective and \nrelevant. Any reforms that improve the effectiveness of the United \nNations must be viewed in this light. We must reform the United Nations \nnow and the United States has the responsibility to play a major role. \nIf we do nothing, and the United Nations collapses under its own \nweight, then we will have only ourselves to blame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13574-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13574-S13575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A SAND COUNTY ALMANAC\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

However, \nOctober 27, 1949 is the date that Oxford Press released the first \nedition of the book.\n  Aldo Leopold is considered to be the father of wildlife ecology. He \nwas a renowned scientist and scholar, exceptional teacher, philosopher, \nand gifted writer. It is for this book, A Sand County Almanac, that \nLeopold is best known by millions of people around the globe. The book \nhas been acclaimed as the century's literary landmark in conservation. \nIt led to a philosophy that has guided many to discovering what it \nmeans to live in harmony with the land.\n  When Leopold died in 1948, he had yet to see his Sand County Almanac \nin print, and it was through the efforts of his son Luna that the first \nversion of A Sand County Almanac was made available to the public.\n  Aldo Leopold's authority as a philosopher of conservation came from a \nlifelong love of wilderness and the recognition of his need to be \nsurrounded by ``things natural, wild, and free.'' Upon graduation from \nYale University, Leopold went to work for the United States Forest \nService in 1909, helped to found the Wilderness Society, and in 1924 \nwas responsible for the institution, through administrative action, of \nthe first of the United States' Wilderness Areas, the Gila National \nForest in New Mexico. From 1933 until his death, Leopold held a chair \nin game management at the University of Wisconsin.\n  Although Leopold's love of the land is apparent in the book, his book \ndoes not cry out in defense of particular tracts of land about to go \nunder the axe or plow. Rather Leopold deals with the minutiae of often \nunnoticed plants and animals, all the little things that one might \noverlook in the task of managing lands but which must be present to add \nup to healthy ecosystems.\n  Part I of A Sand County Almanac is devoted to the details of a single \npiece of land: Leopold's 120-acre property in central Wisconsin, \nabandoned as a working farm years before because of the prevalence of \nsandy soil from which the ``Sand Counties'' took their nickname. It was \nat this weekend retreat, Leopold says, ``that we try to rebuild, with \nshovel and axe, what we are losing elsewhere.''\n  Month by month, Leopold leads the reader through the progression of \nthe seasons with descriptions of such things as skunk tracks, the \nsongs, habits, and attitudes of dozens of bird species, cycles of high \nwater in the river, the timely appearance and blooming of several \nplants, and the joys of cutting one's own firewood. Part of Leopold's \nrequest, toward the end of the book, that we attach values to the \nthings in nature that have no apparent economic worth. At the time \nLeopold's Wisconsin sand farm itself was economically valueless because \nof its unsuitability for crops, timber or pasture. However, from \nLeopold's essays one comes to realize that here is a parcel of land \nthat is anything but worthless; the property that yields to its owner \nthe multitude of joys and insights that Leopold describes is a rich \npiece of ground indeed.\n  In Part II of A Sand County Almanac, titled ``The Quality of \nLandscape,'' Leopold takes his reader away from the farm; first into \nthe surrounding Wisconsin countryside and then even farther. Leopold \ndescribes an Illinois bus ride, a visit to the Iowa of his boyhood, on \nto Arizona and New Mexico where he first worked with the U.S. Forest \nService, across the southern border into Chihuahua and Sonora, Mexico, \nnorth to Oregon and Utah, and finally travel across the northern border \ninto Manitoba, Canada.\n  In each of these places, Leopold outlines the natural history of the \nregion. Leopold understood the difficulty of the choices before us, and \ncertainly knew the paradox with which we are faced: ``But all \nconservation of wildness is self-defeating,'' he writes, ``for to \ncherish we must see and fondle, and when we have seen and fondled, \nthere is no wilderness left to cherish.''\n  In the final pages of A Sand County Almanac, Leopold introduces the \nconcept of a ``land ethic'' and a plea that such an ethic be adopted. \nLeopold defines philosophical ethics as ``the differentiation of social \nfrom anti-social conduct'' for the common good of the community, and \ndeclares that a land ethic, wherein the ecologies in which we erect our \ndevelopments would be considered an integral part of the community, \namounts to the same thing as social ethics. A land ethic, in the \nauthor's terms, means a ``willing limitation on freedom of action in \nthe struggle for survival.''\n  A Sand County Almanac was not written specifically for wilderness \nactivists. It was written for everyone, regardless of vocation. I \nrecommend this book to colleagues not only because it is enjoyable, but \nalso because it raises important questions that the Senate will \neventually be forced to address. As members of the Senate, the \ndecisions we will make regarding land use are critically important. The \nresponsibility is there, as well as the rewards, for those who seek to \nconduct themselves in a fashion consistent with Leopold's vision.\n  A Sand County Almanac continues to inspire new generations of \nAmericans to take up the cause of conservation. And 50 years later, the \nland ethic continues to serve as the guiding beacon for American \nconservation policy. We do well in the Senate to mark this Anniversary, \nand to dedicate ourselves to Leopold's legacy.\n\n[[Page S13575]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13574-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13574-S13575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A SAND COUNTY ALMANAC\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD.

Mr. President, I rise today to join with thousands \nof Americans who this month are celebrating Head Start Awareness Month.\n  There are few federal programs like Head Start. Since its creation in \n1965, this marvelous program has provided comprehensive education, \nhealth, social and nutritional services to over 17 million young \nchildren and their families. Today, over 835,000 children are involved \nin Head Start, benefitting from the commitment of nearly 170,000 staff \npeople and just over 2,000 Head Start agencies nationwide.\n  Head Start is clearly much more than a program. It is a community \norganized around the principle that we must together take care of our \nyoung children. Head Start brings together parents, teachers and others \nin the community to support young children and meet their needs. \nSometimes that means health screenings and eye glasses; other times it \nmeans linking a parent up with job training services. The actions are \ndiverse but the effects are the same--enriching and improving the \nchild's life.\n  Next year, we will celebrate the 35th anniversary of this powerful \nprogram. And there is clearly much to celebrate. The anniversary will \nalso provide us with an appropriate opportunity to reflect on Head \nStart and consider how to continue to promote, improve and expand this \ncrucial program. In some ways, we began this process last year with the \nenactment of the 1998 Head Start reauthorization bill. This legislation \nincreased support for additional staff training and professional \ndevelopment, authorized further research into the long term benefits of \nHead Start, improved program accountability measures, and expanded \nEarly Head Start to serve more infants and toddlers, laying a strong \nfoundation for Head Start in the next century.\n  However, I believe there remains unfinished business with Head Start. \nMost notably, the program still serves just 40 percent of those \neligible. The President has proposed the laudable goal of serving one \nmillion children by 2002--but I think we must do more. We must also \nlook to Head Start for further models of how to serve young children. \nFor the last 35 years, the program has been a laboratory for the \ndevelopment of practices that are now commonplace in child care and \npreschool programs across the country. We must continue to build on the \nsuccess of Head Start to better serve Head Start children as well as \nother young children.\n  One of our key partners in this effort is the National Head Start \nAssociation (NHSA).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 2303, and \nthe Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2303) to direct the Librarian of Congress to \n     prepare the history of the House of Representatives and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2303, the History \nof the House Awareness and Preservation Act, and wish to take a moment \nof the Senate to congratulate the author of this legislation, the \nHonorable John B. Larson of the First Congressional District of \nConnecticut.\n  John has proven himself to be a skilled legislator and an articulate \nand creative advocate for the people of his district, the State of \nConnecticut, and indeed the entire Nation. For twelve years John served \nwith distinction in the Connecticut State Senate, serving as President \nPro Tempore for eight years. It is altogether fitting that this \ninitiative is John's first legislative accomplishment. As a former high \nschool teacher, John is in a unique position to understand the \nsignificance and importance of recording the deliberations and history \nof the House for the benefit of future generations.\n  As a newly elected member of the House of Representatives, John \narrived in Washington at a time when it appeared that partisanship and \nacrimony\n\n[[Page S13577]]\n\nwould be the order of the day. True to his reverence for our system of \ngovernment, and his respect and admiration for the institution he now \nserves in, John initiated this idea in response to calls for a return \nto civility in the House of Representatives. It is a testament to his \nskill and effectiveness that this legislation garnered 313 cosponsors, \nincluding both the Speaker of the House, Mr. Hastert, and the House \nMinority Leader, Mr. Gephardt, and was adopted by the House in just a \nlittle over four months from its introduction on June 22 of this year. \nThe United States Senate is deeply indebted to our distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Robert C. Byrd, for his considerable efforts to \npreserve the history of the Senate through his four-volume history. The \nHouse of Representatives, and students of government across this \nNation, will be indebted to John Larson for his efforts as well.\n  I am privileged to count John as a friend and an advisor and I \ncommend him on the enactment of this, his first, legislative \ninitiative. It is an honor for me, as the Ranking Member of the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration, to play a small role in \nassisting his efforts to preserve the rich history of the House of \nRepresentatives for future generations. I urge the adoption of this \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read three times, \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the table, and any \nstatements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2303) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13577-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-15\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 210, recognizing and honoring the \nNew York Yankees, introduced earlier today by Senators Schumer and \nMoynihan.\n  I will withhold my objection and make it a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 210) recognizing and honoring the New \n     York Yankees.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today \nwith my distinguished colleagues, Senator Moynihan and Senator \nLieberman, to introduce a resolution honoring one of the greatest \nfranchises in American sports history, the New York Yankees, or as so \nmany of us endearingly refer to them as--the Bronx Bombers.\n  Having grown up in New York during the 1950's, I am full of fond \nmemories of a team that as a child I idolized. After school, time after \ntime, I rode the dynamite D train with my friends from Sheepshead Bay \nto Yankee Stadium in the Bronx, sitting in the bleachers eating hot \ndogs and munching on peanuts, watching my idol Mickey Mantle play like \nno one else could, then returning home happy as a kid could be, all for \nless than three dollars At that time, the only thing in life I wanted \nto be was Mickey Mantle. Since I never reached that achievement, it is \nonly proper for me to honor the team in which he became a baseball \nicon.\n  The Yankee were then, and are now, the toast of the town. They have \nbecome a franchise synonymous with greatness, a team full of heroes, \nplaying in the greatest city in the world. Players such as Babe Ruth, \nMickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and Lou Gehrig are some of the \nmany Yankee legends of the past. Players like Bernie Williams, Derek \nJeter, and David Cone are our Yankee legends of the future. The Yankees \nare typified by character, commitment and achievement, values that \nrepresent all that is great about baseball, the State of New York, and \nAmerica. I can still remember listening to one of the greatest games of \nall time, Don Larsen's perfect game in Game 5 of the 1956 World Series. \nBut the memories do not stop there, five years later in 1961 Roger \nMaris hit a then-astonishing 61 homeruns, breaking the previous record \nof 60 set by the legendary Babe Ruth.\n  Sixteen Hall of Famers, countless no-hitters, and 25 World \nChampionships later, I stand before you to honor an American icon, a \nteam of this century, and also the next, the New York Yankees.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is with considerable glee that I \nrise today to commend a true titan of our national pastime, the New \nYork Yankees, who earlier this week cemented their legacy as the \npreeminent dynasty of 20th century American sports.\n  The Yankees four-game sweep of the Atlanta Braves in this year's \nWorld Series earned the franchise its 25th championship of the 1900s, \nproving that the Yankees belong right up there with Uncle Sam and Mom's \napple pie as inspirational symbols of America's greatness.\n  In Connecticut, the loyalties of baseball fans are split between the \nYankees, the New York Mets, and the Boston Red Sox. This made the 1999 \nMajor League Baseball season truly memorable, as all three teams \nadvanced to their respective league championships and vied for the \npennant.\n  I confess that I was once a Brooklyn Dodgers backer, but I have been \ncheering the Bronx Bombers for decades--since my eldest son, Matt, \ncaught Yankee fever at an early age. Some of my fondest memories are \nwatching games at Yankee Stadium with my family. Yet I cannot recall \nany of the teams' accomplishments being more impressive or fun to watch \nthan this world championship, the Yankees' third in four years, capping \na string of World Series triumphs that dates back to 1923.\n  I tip my pinstripe cap to Manager Joe Torre, Series MVP Mariano \nRivera, the indomitable Roger Clements, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, \nthe valiant Paul O'Neill, the heroic Chad Curtis, and the entire \nYankees organization for their inspirational and dominating play this \nOctober. The Yankees' remarkable success has brought untold joy to \ntheir neighbors in Connecticut.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating thereto be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I also add, the Texas Rangers will rise again.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 210) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JUNIOR, PAPERS PRESERVATION ACT\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Rules \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of S. 1791 and the \nSenate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1791) to authorize the Librarian of Congress to \n     purchase papers of Dr. Martin Luther King, Junior, from Dr. \n     King's estate.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I support passage of the pending bill, \nS. 1791, that Senator Lieberman and I introduced. This legislation \nwould authorize the Librarian of Congress to acquire Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Junior's personal papers from his estate.\n  Dr. King, as a minister, civil rights leader, prolific writer and \nNobel Price winner, was deeply committed to nonviolence in the struggle \nfor civil rights. He is quite possible the most important and \ninfluential black leader in American history.\n  When Dr. King was tragically assassinated on April 4, 1968, he was in \nhis prime, after having emerged as a true national hero and a chief \nadvocate of peacefully uniting a racially divided nation. He strove to \nbuild communities of hope and opportunity for all. He recognized that \nall Americans must be free if we are to live in a truly great nation.\n  The acquisition of Dr. King's papers would permanently place them in \nthe public domain. People from all over the United States, and the \nentire world, would have direct access to these important historic \ndocuments. Those people studying his life's work would have access to \nhis messages of justice and peace, and also to reflect on the civil \nrights struggle. The Library of Congress would be the perfect place for \nthese papers which already houses other great works of original \nAmerican freedom fighters such as Frederick Douglass and Thurgood \nMarshall. It is altogether fitting that these documents be together \nunder one roof.\n  Dr. King was a person who wanted all people to get along regardless \nof their race, color or creed. His call to all of us, that we should \njudge by the content of one's character rather than by the color of \none's skin, sums up the very core of how we can all peacefully live \ntogether as well as any other words ever spoken.\n  The establishment of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day as a national \nholiday was the result of the work of many determined people who wanted \nto ensure that we and future generations duly honor and remember his \nlegacy. In fact, our tradition of honoring Dr. King took another step \nforward when on October 25, 1999, the President signed into law S. 322, \na bill I introduced earlier this year that authorizes the flying of the \nAmerican flag on Martin Luther King Day, in addition to all of our \nNation's national holidays. This legislation builds on this work and \nwill ensure that Dr. King's legacy is preserved for generations to \ncome.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important bill.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time \nand passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1791) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1791\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Under the rule, those \nvotes will occur on Tuesday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes or at a \ntime to be determined by the two leaders.\n  By previous consent, a vote on the D.C./Labor-HHS appropriations \nconference report has been scheduled to occur at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, \nand the majority leader has announced that vote will be the first vote \nof the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13578-4", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13578-S13582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN CHAFEE\n\n  Mr. KYL. John Chafee was a gentleman with every quality that term \nconnotes. He always treated everyone with the utmost respect. He was \nunfailingly courteous to everyone. I never heard him utter a bad word\n\n[[Page S13579]]\n\nabout anyone. He took his job very seriously, but he did not take \nhimself seriously. He always evaluated proposals, first asking what his \nconstituents would think about them. He always sought to accommodate \nme, personally. I recall the last request I made of him to break some \nprecedents and quickly get a bill through to name a U.S. courthouse in \nPhoenix for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor because we \ndid have to break some precedents in order to accomplish that. He did \nit with no problem whatever.\n  Others have detailed his considerable service to this country, and I \nwill not repeat that. However, it runs the gamut from military service \nto service in the Senate and much, much more.\n  I simply want to recall John Chafee, the marine, the gentleman. If \nevery one of us in this Chamber comported ourselves as Senator Chafee \ndid, the Senate would be a much better place. That is a legacy that any \nperson, I believe, would be proud to have. It is John Chafee's legacy. \nHe will be missed. But he will be remembered.\n  God bless John Chafee and his family.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about an \noutstanding American who has left us. The flowers in this Chamber now \nrecall for us the life of John Chafee, the distinguished Senator from \nRhode Island who was 77 years of age. He served his country in an \nextraordinary number of ways.\n  I served for my first 2 years in this body on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee that he chaired. He was a wonderful person, a \ngentleman of the highest order, a man of propriety and decency, a \nclassic Yankee, a leader who loved his country. He not only loved it, \nhe proved his love to it.\n  He served in World War II in the Marines, landed on Guadalcanal with \nthe first invasion forces, and a few years later he was recalled as a \nrifle platoon leader in Korea. He served 4 years as Secretary of the \nNavy and 6 years as Governor of Rhode Island.\n  They wrote a book a few years ago entitled ``In Defense of Elitism.'' \nJohn, I want to say, was not an elitist. In fact, he wasn't an elitist \nbut he was of a higher standard than most of us will ever achieve. He \ncared about what was right and wrong. He fought for what he believed \nin.\n  He was highly intelligent, and he was blessed in a lot of different \nways. He went to the finest schools in America. He went to Deerfield \nAcademy in Massachusetts as a high school student, was a Yale \nundergraduate, Harvard Law--the very best education he could have. That \nwas during a time prior to World War II when there wasn't any doubt \nwhat those young men and women were taught. They were taught duty, \nhonor, humility, integrity, frugality, service to their country and \nfellow man, courage, and manliness. Those are traits that were part of \nhis growing up, traits he never gave up until he took his last breath.\n  He was not part of the ``do your own thing'' crowd. John Chafee was \npart of the crowd who won World War II and defeated the Soviet Union, \npreserved freedom and democracy around the world, and eliminated \ntotalitarian communism virtually from the face of the Earth.\n  John was helpful to me personally. I never had a harsh word with him. \nHe loved environmental issues. He was a strong environmentalist. We \ndidn't always agree. I came here from Alabama having talked to a lot of \npeople who were a little bit irritated every now and then about \ngovernmental regulations that seemed to have no benefit to the \nenvironment and caused great burdens on farmers and business people. I \nam at this moment quite prepared to consider improving those acts. But \nJohn was part of the drafting and crafting, and he didn't give them up \neasily. He knew the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act had historic \nbenefits in improving our Nation's environment. He would not give them \nup easily. He had to be convinced that you were right in every way \nbefore he would move toward any change in those laws.\n  He really was an effective public servant. He was effective as \nchairman of a committee. He was effective as an environmentalist. And \nhe was certainly able to keep that committee together in a most \nharmonious way, with Republicans and Democrats able to work together \nwith great harmony. It is a rare thing we see here when we have that \nkind of harmony. We had that kind of friendship.\n  His grandfather was Rhode Island's Governor. His great uncle was a \nSenator from Rhode Island. He had a great ancestry of personal service.\n  He announced a year ago that he himself would not seek reelection to \nthe Senate. But he was extraordinarily proud that his son Lincoln, the \nmayor of a city in Rhode Island, was going to seek the seat he had so \nlong and ably held. That was a source of great pride for him. And I \ntalked to him about that race.\n  I think many of our brethren in the Senate have shared here our own \nthoughts about John Chafee and the quality of life he led. Many knew \nhim much longer than I and knew him better than I. But my experience \nwith him was personal, it was real, and it was very positive.\n  I think he is one of the finest people I have known. He exemplified \nhigh ideals, the kind of high ideals with which he was raised and from \nthe community of which he was a part. He reflected that and carried it \nout with great integrity and ability.\n  We will all mourn his loss, and our sympathies are extended to his \nfamily, his daughter, and his four sons.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, tomorrow, most of us will make our way \ntoward Rhode Island. We will attend the memorial services for John \nChafee, our colleague and friend who we have all known and grown to \nrespect in our work in the Senate.\n  As I look across this Chamber and I notice the black pall and the \nflowers that grace the desk of Senator Chafee, my memory is triggered \nto the first time I ever met him.\n  When I first ran for the Senate back in 1988, he called me up. I was \ngoing through this agonizing process of making the decision whether to \nstand for election to the Senate. I received a call from Senator Chafee \ninviting me to a gathering of prospective candidates at Williamsburg, \nVA. I accepted that invitation. I met for the first time this giant of \na man from Rhode Island. I do not use the term ``giant'' loosely. He \nhas not diminished. This was the impression he made on me at our first \nmeeting, and over the years that has been the lasting impression.\n  In our daily work here in the Senate, did we agree on everything? No. \nDid I have a true understanding of his constituency in his State? No. \nNor did he of mine. So we did not agree on everything, nor should we. \nMen of substance do not need to agree but be men of honesty, of \ncivility, and of integrity.\n  When we refer to the legions of great Americans who have answered \nabove and beyond the normal call, John Chafee rightfully takes his \nplace among the most distinguished: A marine in the South Pacific, \nGuadalcanal, all during World War II; and, if that wasn't enough for \nhis country, he came home, graduated from law school, got his law \ndegree, and he answered his country's call again, serving in Korea. I, \na former marine, understand that. But that was not enough for this man \nyet who took public service very seriously--a Governor, Cabinet \nSecretary, Secretary of the Navy, and Senator. At every station, he \ndistinguished himself, his State, his Nation, and his family.\n  Though the voice has been silenced, his words of wisdom and \nleadership will echo through these Halls for generations. He was one \nwho quietly went about his way in making America a better place. What a \nlegacy we would all like to leave.\n  He was a leader of a generation. Tom Brokow got it right. It was a \ngeneration that quietly built a nation no matter their station in life.\n  So we say thank you, John Chafee. May we be men and women who protect \nand respect what you have done. You were a giant among men.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, this week, with the passing of Senator John \nChafee of Rhode Island, we lost a dear colleague and a friend. John \nChafee was a real statesman. His passing is a tragedy, and a loss for \nAmerica.\n  As a new member of this body, I regret that my time serving with \nSenator Chafee was brief. Fortunately, the lessons I learned from \nworking with him will last a lifetime. Senator Chafee was an all-too-\nrare voice for bipartisanship in the U.S. Senate. He was a force for \ncommon sense, and someone who always put politics aside and tried to do \nwhat was right for America.\n\n[[Page S13580]]\n\n  For those of us who value consensus over partisan politics, Senator \nChafee's approach to service will remain the standard we strive \ntowards. His central goal, he said, was to ``operate through consensus \nand cooperation wherever and whenever possible in order to get things \ndone.''\n  And ``get things done'' he did: after what for most men would be a \nfull and distinguished life in public service--World War II duty, \ncompany commander in Korea, Minority Leader in the Rhode Island State \nHouse, three-term Governor, Secretary of the U.S. Navy--after all that, \nJohn Chafee began his service in the U.S. Senate.\n  In twenty-two years as U.S. Senator from Rhode Island, John Chafee's \nmost remarkable accomplishments came when he managed to bring others to \nthe middle-ground on contentious issues such as budget and tax policy, \nenvironmental protection, and health care.\n  Senator Chafee understood the responsibility we shoulder here when we \nwrite a budget for the nation, and he had the vision to act responsibly \non behalf of future generations. He was a leader in efforts to reduce \nthe federal budget deficit. In 1996 he co-chaired the Centrist \nCoalition which produced a bipartisan balanced budget plan. More \nrecently, as Democrats and Republicans fought bitterly over their \nrespective $300 billion and $800 billion tax-cut proposals, I had the \npleasure of working with Senator Chafee as part of a bipartisan group \nfighting to pass a reasonable $500 billion tax cut. For me, working \nwith Senator Chafee reinforced the value of his consensus-building \napproach, and my desire to emulate that approach.\n  Senator Chafee was a longtime advocate for clean air and water, \nwetlands conservation, and open space preservation. As a result of his \ndedication to preserving our natural heritage, Senator Chafee was the \nrecipient of every major environmental award.\n  As a senior member of the Finance Committee, Senator Chafee worked \nsuccessfully to expand health care coverage for women and children, and \nto improve community services for persons with disabilities.\n  John Chafee served his country for many years and in many roles. \nPerhaps his most important legacy is the way he served America: \n``operating through consensus and cooperation wherever and whenever \npossible in order to get things done.''\n  We're all going to miss him very much.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to say some words about the loss \nof our mutual friend, John Chafee from Rhode Island.\n  His passing away this week was obviously sad for all of us in this \nbody, as well as his family and his friends.\n  He has left an impressive legacy both for this body and for his \nservice to the United States.\n  I would like to take a few moments to express my thoughts about this \ntruly heroic person.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1981, Senator Chafee was already one of \nthe body's giants. He was well respected. I remember the budget battles \nwe had in those years in the early 1980s, and the impact he had as a \nleader of moderate Republicans--usually about half dozen or so Senators \nwho always had a major influence on the budget process. Disagree though \nsome of us might with Senator Chafee's position on these issues, there \nwas no disagreement among any of us that the results of his efforts \nwere always a moderating influence on what this body did.\n  I served with Senator Chafee on the Finance Committee for many \nyears--the committee that has jurisdiction over taxes, over Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, foreign trade, and welfare. He had a \npassion; that was to preserve the safety net programs, and especially \nin the health sector. He was a strong supporter of the Community Health \nCenter Program of Medicaid, and most importantly children's health \nprograms.\n  In fact, one of the last meetings in which I joined Senator Chafee \nwas his handling of a hearing a week ago in which he was proposing and \nforwarding legislation to make sure that people who were part of the \nfoster care system did not fall through the cracks as far as their \nhealth care was concerned once they were forced out of the system \nbecause of age.\n  Above all else, Senator Chafee, as demonstrated by that hearing last \nweek and his promotion of that legislation, was committed to the proper \namount of health care and quality of health care. He also worked long \nand hard in a very generic area we call health care reform, sometimes \nminuscule fine-tuning, but also Senator Chafee was in the middle of the \nbig battles of health care reform.\n  During the time the Senate was considering the Clinton health care \nplan, then-majority leader Bob Dole appointed Mr. Chafee to chair a \nRepublican health care reform task force. Senator Chafee for several \nmonths convened meetings every Thursday in his Capitol office. During \nthose meetings, he led discussions on various aspects of health care \nreform. I had an opportunity to participate in a lot of those meetings \nand know firsthand Senator John Chafee's commitment not only to \ninforming and providing the procedure for informing fellow Members \nabout the issue but also his efforts working toward compromise that \nwould eventually get the votes to bring legislation to the floor and \nthrough the Senate.\n  The work we did in this task force culminated in a major health care \nreform bill that had the support of most of our Republican colleagues. \nIt was a major achievement, needless to say. It wasn't something that \nfinally was passed by this body because the whole Clinton health care \nissue got so overburdened with so many controversial aspects that the \nClinton health care proposal went down, and compromises, more moderate \nand more bipartisan, obviously, were taken off the Senate's agenda at \nthe same time.\n  That still does not denigrate in any way the hard work of John Chafee \non health care generally. In fact, it is a very good example of his \nhard work and, most importantly, his commitment to the overall issue, \nover a long period of time, leading up to that last hearing he chaired \njust 1 week ago.\n  More recently, Senator Chafee urged the modernization of the \ntraditional Medicare fee-for-service program. It is likely, as we go \nfurther down the road, that Senator Chafee will have had much influence \non what we as a body produce even though he is no longer with us. In \nthat regard, his influence will certainly have outlived his own life. \nThat is a hallmark of a truly great man and a great Senator.\n  I, along with my colleagues, will miss Senator Chafee for many \nreasons. I respected him. I liked him. I listened to him. I looked to \nhim as a leader. He spoke with authority and with credibility. Most \nimportantly, he was a very compassionate person. Above all, what is \nimportant in political leadership is that he was very independent. He \nstood up for what he believed in, sometimes in the face of opposition \nfrom even his own party, my party, the Republican Party. That is the \nquality of John Chafee I grew to admire most.\n  Senator Chafee's legacy is his extraordinary service to his country. \nThe way he knew to serve was in a very mighty way, whether it was on \nthe battlefield as a genuine war hero or his service as Governor, \nSecretary of the Navy, or for 23 years as a Member of the Senate from \nRhode Island. Not everyone is capable of making a big difference in \nthis world, but John Chafee did. We salute him. I salute him, his life, \nand his accomplishments. I join my colleagues in remembering his \ngreatness and appreciating the contributions he made to this country.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to reflect on the passing of one of \nthe true giants in the Senate, someone with whom I was privileged to \nwork for the last 15 years I have been in the Senate--Senator John \nChafee, a good man with a great heart and a great soul, a statesman in \nevery sense of the word, a public servant unequaled, a man who \ndedicated his entire professional life to the service of his country.\n  He was a good friend of people on both sides of this aisle. He was \nrespected by all who knew him and served with him, and he returned that \nrespect in kind. During all the efforts with which I had worked with \nhim through the years, he always returned respect. If you did not agree \nwith him, he respected your position. I never once heard John Chafee \nbelittle a\n\n[[Page S13581]]\n\nMember of this body or the other body because of a position that was \ntaken by that Senator or Congressman. He respected people's views. He \nrespected the fact you come from a different viewpoint.\n  He was a great bridge builder. He would reach out to people, always \nlooking for a way to craft a consensus, always having in mind ``I am \nnot right all the time and you are not right all the time, but if we \nwork together, we can build a consensus and find a middle way.''\n  He set aside partisanship. He put his energies into working for the \ngreater good. He won high praise from a wide spectrum of admirers, from \nthe American Civil Liberties Union to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. You \ncannot get much broader than that.\n  He is a true American hero. He never talked about it. He left college \nin 1942 and joined the Marine Corps and fought in one of the bloodiest \nbattles of the U.S. Marine Corps in Guadalcanal. If that was not \nenough, he fought during the invasion of Okinawa. Those were two of the \nbloodiest battles of World War II.\n  He left military service, but came back to fight, once again, in \nKorea in 1951. I do not mean sitting behind a desk either; I mean as a \nsoldier in the field. Between his tours of duty, he had already earned \nhis bachelor's degree at Yale and his law degree at Harvard. A career \nof distinguished service followed: Rhode Island House of \nRepresentatives, Governor of the State, Secretary of the Navy, and \nUnited States Senator. He was the first Republican Senator elected in \nRhode Island in 46 years.\n  Having known him well, I know, no matter where his public service \ntook him, his heart was always in Rhode Island. In talking with him \nwhen he announced he was retiring, he said he looked forward to \nretiring to his home State of Rhode Island.\n  He wore many titles in his lifetime--lieutenant, captain, Governor, \nSecretary, Senator, but he was proudest of being a husband, a father, \nand a grandfather. He was devoted to his family: Virginia, 5 children, \n12 grandchildren. I know their loss is tremendous, but I hope in the \ndays, weeks, and months ahead they will take comfort in John Chafee's \nmagnificent legacy.\n  When the major achievements of the 20th century are recounted, many \nwill bear his mark: the Clean Air Act, Superfund, Social Security \nimprovements, fair housing, civil rights. He played a major role in \nevery major piece of environmental legislation that has been passed in \nthe last two decades. He fought for health care coverage for low-income \nfamilies and expanded coverage for uninsured children. He fought hard \nfor the Family and Medical Leave Act. John made it his mission to make \nsure no American fell between the cracks. America's women, children, \nand families are the beneficiaries.\n  I had the privilege of working with John Chafee on a couple of major \nissues. I worked very closely with him for over a year tackling our \nNation's leading public health problem: the use of tobacco. With \nSenator Graham from Florida, we introduced the first bipartisan bill. \nWe called it the KIDS Act to protect our children from tobacco.\n  Senator Chafee had the courage to take on the tobacco industry and \nprovided great leadership on this issue. He did it because of his \nunwavering dedication to improve health, save lives, and protect our \nkids.\n  While we did not succeed with our bill, we did succeed on another \nimportant effort, and that is combatting teen smoking. Senator Chafee \nand I offered an amendment to fully fund FDA's initiative to have store \nclerks check the IDs of children and young people before they sell \ncigarettes.\n  And as you walk up to the counter in your 7-Eleven and other stores, \nright now you will see they have put in place an ID check. They check \nIDs before selling cigarettes.\n  Senator Chafee led that initiative.\n  Senate passage of this amendment was the first big defeat of big \ntobacco in the Senate in 10 years, since we passed the ban on smoking \non airlines. That effort has had a big impact. Thousands and thousands \nof kids have been prevented from buying a deadly addictive product.\n  As I said, that important victory would not have been possible \nwithout John Chafee and his skill at forming a bipartisan coalition and \ncrafting a creative solution to this very pressing problem.\n  I also had the privilege of working with John Chafee on disability \nissues. As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \nwhich passed and was signed into law by President Bush in 1990, Senator \nChafee and I formed a working relationship on this issue. He was a \nmajor champion for creating alternatives to institutions for people \nwith disabilities, to get people out of institutions and into their \nhomes and into their communities where they could be fully integrated \ninto all aspects of American life.\n  Senator Chafee's work to create the Medicaid home and community-based \nwaivers opened the door for independent living for tens of thousands of \npeople with disabilities across our country.\n  I can tell you this has been a movement that has taken hold in our \ncountry. It has provided so much joy to families. It has provided \nopportunities for people with disabilities.\n  I had a family in my office the other day from Iowa, the Piper \nfamily, Sylvia and Larry Piper, and their son Dan. I have known Dan for \na long time, since he was in high school. Dan has Down's syndrome, but \nhe was mainstreamed in school, after his parents had told him they \nprobably would have to put him in institutions for the rest of his \nlife. They got him in high school. He was the captain of the football \nteam. He acted in school plays. And after he got out of high school, he \nwent out and got a job. He has been working now for several years, and \nhe lives in a community setting. He has his own apartment. He has his \nown job, pays taxes, buys his own TV set. He told me he just bought a \nVCR. Community-based living. His parents are proud of him. They are \nhappy he is out there on his own. They know his future is going to be \nbright. He is not stuck in an institution someplace.\n  Well, sitting in my office with my friends, the Pipers, and my long-\ntime friend, Dan, I had to think of Senator Chafee and his leadership \nto create the community-based waivers that allow people with \ndisabilities to live independently.\n  He also worked in a true bipartisan manner to promote maternal and \nchild health programs. John Chafee's commitment to fighting for what he \nbelieved in was matched by the dedication of his long-time and loyal \nstaff. My heart goes out to all of them. I have worked with them for a \nlong time. They are a great staff.\n  John Chafee was a very humble, unassuming giant in the Senate. He had \na broad, inclusive vision. He was a principled and thoughtful person. \nHe was kind and generous. He asked and gave the best of himself in \neverything he did. He never sought recognition. He rolled up his \nsleeves and went to work. His spirit and his voice will be sorely \nmissed. I am privileged to have called him my friend.\n  In closing, at times such as this I always remember the question that \nwas put to John Kennedy one time. A reporter once asked President \nKennedy how he wanted to be remembered. President Kennedy gave it a \nmomentary thought, and he said he believed the highest tribute that \ncould be paid to anyone would be to be remembered as a good and decent \nhuman being. So if I could use that as the highest tribute that can be \npaid to anyone, we remember John Chafee as a good and decent human \nbeing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to end this session of this \nweek by once again remembering our colleague, John Chafee. We started \nthis week, Monday morning, with the tragic news of the passing of \nclearly one of the most beloved of all Senators sitting in this \nChamber.\n  During the week, Senator Chafee's desk has been draped in black with \nflowers on his desk. We have all talked in this Chamber about this \nwonderful man. We have all related so many of the great deeds he did, \nfrom his service in World War II to his service in the Korean war as a \nmarine who truly exemplified what ``Semper Fi'' means. We have talked \nabout what a wonderful human being he was and I think have renewed our \nefforts to make this a more civilized Senate because of him.\n  Today the people of Rhode Island began to pay their respects to their\n\n[[Page S13582]]\n\nformer Governor and their three-term Senator. He is lying in state as I \nspeak in the capitol he loved so much. All of us remember when he \nannounced that he would not seek reelection. He simply said: ``I want \nto go home.'' John Chafee is home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/10/29/senate-section/article/S13582-1", "month": "10", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, NOVEMBER 1, 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.
