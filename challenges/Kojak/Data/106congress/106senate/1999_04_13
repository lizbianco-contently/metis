Mr. President, I will take a moment to talk a little bit \nabout agriculture.\n  As the President knows, agriculture is a most important element in \nWyoming's economy and to Wyoming's culture. During this past week, I \nhad a chance to visit with many people in Wyoming who are very \nconcerned about agriculture and agricultural markets or the lack \nthereof. So I want to talk a little bit about my vision of the things \nwe are doing and can be\n\n[[Page S3614]]\n\ndoing in Congress with respect to agriculture in this country.\n  Certainly our purpose ought to be to strengthen markets so the price \nfor agricultural products is enhanced and so family farmers and family \nranchers are able to make a reasonable return on their investment and \non their time.\n  We have had a tough year in agriculture, in crops, and in livestock, \nand many of us have been working for some time to find some of the \nthings that are appropriate for the Government to do to strengthen the \nagricultural sector.\n  One of them, of course, is trade and the idea of reducing the \nunilateral sanctions we have had in place around the world. Many times \nin the past, countries such as Pakistan, when they set off the bomb and \nso on, we immediately then did not trade with them. We have changed \nsome of those unilateral sanctions. They are not useful for any other \nreason than to penalize our own markets.\n  We are pushing for stronger enforcement of trade agreements, \nparticularly in NAFTA, for example, where we need to make sure that \nthey are being administered properly, that goods are not being dumped, \nthat goods are not coming in from another country through, in this \ncase, the member of NAFTA that benefited from that, and working to \nreduce unfair trade barriers which have existed and continue to exist \naround the world in interesting places, such as the European Union, \nwhere the President has just been. These are the kinds of things that \nseem to me to be totally unfair, where we open our markets to others \nand, in return, we have market barriers.\n\n  I am very pleased with what is happening with regard to the \nnegotiations with China. I am not pleased with all the things that \nhappen in China, of course, but in terms of the WTO negotiations, we \nfind, for example, that we are going to make some arrangements to \nreduce the 40-percent to probably 10-percent tariff on our meat. That \nwill be a very good forward move.\n  I am hopeful we can find a way to get the largest potential customer \nin the world into the WTO so that not only will it open markets but we \ndo not have to deal unilaterally with someone; if we have an agreement, \nthen there is the World Trade Organization to enforce those agreements.\n  We are talking about the tax relief for agriculture. We had income \naveraging last year, which is very good because the income of the \nfarmers and ranchers varies very much. We have a proposition to have \nfarm accounts which allow farmers to put the money into sort of an IRA \nfor a period of time and draw it out before they pay taxes on it so \nthat they tend to level out in income.\n  Estate tax relief: I hope that is one of the things we talk about \nwhen we deal with the tax reform--estate tax relief. Currently \nlegislation is there to do that.\n  Meat labeling: I think we need to have, as we have proposed it here--\nand will again--meat labeling so that we know what the products are and \nso buyers, when they go to the grocery store, can determine whether the \nproduct is domestic. They need to have an opportunity to do that.\n  Also, grading: USDA grades are for domestic products, and will be \nused that way. Again, current legislation is pending.\n  One of the problems of the livestock industry has been, allegedly--\nand I agree with it--the concentration of packers. We have the latest \nfigures, and I heard that about four packers kill about 87 percent of \nthe product, which would cause you to think that there may be some \nlegislation on pricing. And we need to do that.\n  We met with the Attorney General and asked that we, again, take a \nlook at the potential of monopoly activities that may be there and do \nsomething about the concentration of packers. If they find again that \nthere is nothing illegal being done, as they have in the past, it seems \nto me that we ought to take a look at the underlying legislation, the \nPackers and Stockyards Act, to see if, in fact, that needs to be \nchanged. We need to have more competition. Things like owning the \ncattle, for example, and then using their own cattle instead of going \ninto the market, which can manipulate the price--that fact, that there \nis buying without reporting the market price. That is something we need \nto do.\n  We are trying to change the inspections for interstate shipment of \nmeat so that State inspections will suffice. We think that will help \nthe market a great deal.\n  Certainly, in the crop area we need to look at NAFTA to make sure \nthat there is not dumping of wheat and other products in this country. \nWe need to take a look at the Crop Insurance Program, which I think has \nnot worked that satisfactorily, to move the Freedom to Farm, and some \nof the things that are included in that.\n  Mr. President, I just think that there are a number of things that \nneed to be done. We have some unique issues, of course, in the West \nwhere in a great many of our States--in my State of Wyoming 50 percent, \nand in the case of Nevada, 87 percent--the land belongs to the Federal \nGovernment. Much of the land is grazed. Livestock grazes on much of the \nland. We need to make that accessible so we can have multiple use of \nthose renewable resources. We need to do something about the permit \nprogram so that they are not difficult. It isn't necessary, in my view, \nto have an environmental impact statement on every unchanged renewal of \nthe grazing permits.\n  So these are some of the changes that need to be done. I don't think \nagriculture is looking for subsidies, or looking for a farm program. \nBut they are looking for an opportunity to have the markets--an \nopportunity to go into the marketplace and get prices that are, in \nfact, reflective of the costs that go into the product.\n\n  This is a basic industry to our country. There will be changes made, \nof course, as time goes by. There have been tremendous changes in \nagriculture over the last 50 years. The family farmers are getting \nlarger. They are more mechanized and more efficient. They are also much \nmore expensive. And much more investment is required. When you have a \ngreat deal of investment, of course, when you have several years of bad \nprices, it makes it very, very difficult, which also leads to the need \nprobably for some additional lending capacity and some additional \nassistance in lending because of the 2 years that we have had.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that as we come back in after this recess \npeople will be more aware of the difficulty in agriculture, and that we \ncan address ourselves to the many opportunities that we have to \nstrengthen those markets and to provide more healthy and vigorous \nagriculture.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, for the time.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, are we still in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on the Tuesday before the recess, I voted \nagainst authorizing the air war in Yugoslavia. I did so because it \nseemed to me that the goal was a goal not worthy enough, not grave \nenough to begin what amounts to a war, even though under the \nPresident's leadership it has only been half a war.\n  Our goals were to be permitted to send young American men and women \ninto the midst of a 600-year-old civil strife in order to enforce an \nagreement that neither side wished. I also voted against that \nproposition, because it did not seem to me that the means were \nsufficient to gain even this questionable end. I voted against it, \nbecause it did not seem to me that the administration began to foresee \nthe terrible consequences that would ensue if, and as President \nMilosevic has, accelerated his expulsion of Kosovars from their own \nhomeland, or the refugee problem with which we would be faced. In other \nwords, there were no contingency plans.\n  At this point, almost 3 weeks later, all of those negative \nconsequences have transpired. We are in the midst of an air war. The \nair war has not been successful. It is being fought apparently\n\n[[Page S3615]]\n\nby a President who believes that one can have a war not only without \ncasualties on our side but with few, if any, casualties on the other \nside. You should not begin a war for reasons that do not justify the \nuse of force, and only the gravest national security reasons do so. \nAnd, if you get in one, you should not go into it halfheartedly or \nwithout a desire actually to win.\n  Mr. President, what are the potential outcomes? If we are \noverwhelmingly successful, we may get sometime in the next week, or the \nnext month, or the next year, exactly the privileges that we sought in \nthe first place--the right to send our soldiers into a now devastated \ncountryside in order to require people to live together who do not wish \nto live together, and perhaps to enforce an autonomy, which I have \nalready said both sides oppose, or, alternatively, maybe we can get the \nRussians or someone else to help us reach a negotiated solution in \nwhich the Kosovars will be worse off than they were before, and in \nwhich the barbarism of Mr. Milosevic will at least have been partially \nrewarded. Or we may end up sending our own troops into that devilishly \ndifficult part of the Balkans, whether from the south, or the west and \nthe north--and we do not yet know--with an escalation of what will \nstill be a halfhearted war with secondary goals, goals that will not \ninclude the removal of the present government in Belgrade and the \nestablishment of a real peace. Or, I suppose it is possible--just \nremotely possible--that the President and NATO may decide that we want \na full-scale war against Serbia until that regime is, in fact, \ndestroyed.\n\n  None of these is an appetizing outcome, by any stretch of the \nimagination. We are left with these alternatives only, I think, because \nthis administration did not seriously consider what it was doing before \nit began doing it, or seriously consider both the cost and expense in \nmen, material, money, and prestige of the United States for such a \ndubious goal.\n  I wish that I had a firm, accurate, and a favorable outcome to look \nforward to. I wish I could come up with the appropriate means to reach \nsuch a goal. However, it seems to me that if we have learned anything \nin the last several years from other parts of the world, and in the \nlast several weeks from this part of the world, it is that the armed \nservices of the United States should only be used for a vitally \nimportant interest of the United States. If they are then to be used, \nthey should be used with a clear and worthy goal, and with a degree of \nruthlessness that assures we attain that goal. At this point we have \ndone nothing but worsen our relationships with the Russians and with \nthe neighbors of Kosovo itself at great expense to ourselves and at a \nhorrendous expense to the victims in Kosovo who have been killed, \ndriven from their homes, or driven out of their homeland entirely, \nwithout any significant prospect of returning at any time soon.\n  We do need a serious national debate on the subject and we need a \nPresident of the United States who far more clearly articulates our \ngoals and how we are to attain those goals. We have not had that kind \nof presentation. For that reason, support for the United States efforts \nis extremely shallow and is almost certain to disappear once the \ncasualty lists begin to be published in this country.\n  It is time for candor. It is time for clarity. It is time for a clear \nstatement of our goals. In fact, we are well past time for both of \nthose and we have not received them. I think we are faced with an \nextremely serious challenge with no clear way to that proper and \nappropriate goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3615-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator reserves the right to object.\n\n[[Page S3616]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I object, and let's read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] moves to \n     instruct conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, the Concurrent \n     Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000, to include in \n     the conference report provisions that would reserve all \n     Social Security surpluses only for Social Security, and not \n     for other programs (including other retirement programs) or \n     tax cuts.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The motion is very simple. It instructs the conferees who are going \nto be reviewing the budget resolution to include in the conference \nreport provisions that will reserve all Social Security surpluses for \nSocial Security and for Social Security only--not other programs, \nincluding other retirement programs, as has been suggested, and not for \ntax cuts.\n  For years, Democrats have been arguing that our top fiscal priority \nshould be to save Social Security first, and we feel very strongly \nabout that. It is, after all, our party's creation that kicked off \nSocial Security, and we have spent decades since then protecting the \nprogram from attack.\n  In our view, Social Security represents a sacred trust between the \nGovernment and the people. It is a trust that should not and must not \nbe violated.\n  Nearly 44 million Americans now benefit from Social Security, and \nmany of them depend heavily on the program for their survival. For 66 \npercent of the elderly, Social Security provides half their income. \nWithout Social Security, the poverty rate among the elderly would be 48 \npercent; roughly 15 million more Americans would be living in poverty \nthan do now. For single, divorced, or widowed elderly women, the \npoverty rate without Social Security would be 60 percent--60 percent \nfor elderly women.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, under current projections, Social \nSecurity is adequately financed only until 2034. At that time, just \nwhen millions of baby boomers will be retired and struggling to get by, \nSocial Security may be unable to pay the full benefits to which these \nAmericans are entitled.\n  We need to act promptly to address this problem. President Clinton \nhas proposed policies which would extend Social Security significantly \nto the year 2059. Unfortunately, the majority has rejected those \npolicies, and in their place nothing has been proposed. Thus, the \nbudget resolution approved by the Senate included nothing to extend \nSocial Security's solvency by even a single day.\n\n  Having said that, while the Senate resolution did nothing to actually \nhelp Social Security, it at least seemed to do no harm. The resolution \nwas based on the premise that, at a minimum, Congress should not spend \nSocial Security surpluses on anything else. That would not extend \nsolvency at all, but at least it would not make matters worse.\n  Unfortunately, we now understand that the Republican leadership has \nbacked off from even this modest commitment. Instead, they reportedly--\nand we have not really seen the details--have agreed to include in the \nfinal version of the budget resolution a provision that could pose a \ndirect and serious threat to Social Security.\n  Although we have not seen any final language, this provision \napparently calls for using Social Security not just for Social Security \nbut for other programs as well. Apparently, the provision would allow \nSocial Security taxes to be diverted to other things that have some \nconnection to retirement security. That could be a catchword. It could \nmean a new privatized Medicare system. Perhaps it could include civil \nservice or military retirement programs. More likely, I am afraid it \ncould also mean tax cuts for the wealthy that are claimed to somehow \naffect retirement.\n  I was stunned when I heard about this provision, and I think it is \nremarkable that the Republican leadership would even consider using \nSocial Security surpluses for anything other than Social Security. \nAfter all, how many times during the debate on the budget did we hear \nabout the Republicans' commitment to preserving Social Security \nsurpluses? That was supposed to be a centerpiece of their whole \nresolution. But now it appears that when the Republican leadership met \nbehind closed doors, their commitment was overwhelmed with other \nconcerns.\n  This reversal is especially stunning in light of Republican \ncriticisms about double counting, and now the GOP seems to want to use \nSocial Security surpluses for all sorts of other programs. That sounds \nlike double counting to me, Mr. President. After all, you cannot use a \ndollar twice. If you use it as a Social Security dollar for Medicaid or \ntax cuts, that is one less dollar available to pay Social Security \nbenefits.\n\n  So we ought to stand up for a simple proposition; that is, to use \nSocial Security surpluses for Social Security. That is the message of \nthis motion to instruct. It is an effort to reverse yesterday's \ndecision and to get the entire Senate on record in support of saving \nSocial Security surpluses for Social Security, and exclusively for \nSocial Security.\n  I know my friends on the other side of the aisle will establish some \ntype of elaborate lockbox that will protect Social Security. But given \nthe agreement that developed yesterday, it makes one wonder: What will \nSocial Security surpluses be locked up for? Will they be locked up for \ntax cuts? For other retirement programs? For some new type of program \nthat is given the label ``Social Security''? Or will they be locked up \nto pay guaranteed Social Security benefits, as they are supposed to be?\n  I think Social Security taxes should be used for Social Security \nbenefits, not for other types of spending or tax cuts that somehow or \nother can be called retirement security. So I strongly urge the \nRepublican leadership to reverse the decision that was reached last \nnight. Social Security surpluses should be used for Social Security--\nand I drum the point home--and only Social Security, not other \nprograms, not tax cuts. If we are serious about that principle, let's \nreally make a commitment to it. Let's not endorse open-ended language \nlike retirement security that could encourage future abuses.\n  I hope and urge that my colleagues will support this motion to \ninstruct to reverse a commitment to language that permits an open-ended \nuse of that money under the umbrella of ``retirement security.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has now 14 minutes 55 seconds. The \nSenator from New Jersey has 7 minutes 47 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just make a couple points for \neveryone. First, I think everybody here understands that when you go to \nconference, you go to conference with the House. You do not go to \nconference with yourself. If that were the case, we would rule supreme \nand there would be no need to go to conference, and whatever the House \nthought about any of these measures would be totally irrelevant. I \nthink everybody understands that isn't the case. We have to go to \nconference with them.\n  Secondly, I would like to make two points about what we do in our \nbudget and what the President did so everybody will understand.\n  Senator Lautenberg talks about the Republican budget and the lockbox \nthat we contemplate and speculates that he does not know what it might \nbe used for. Let me tell everybody so they will understand. For \nstarters, in the first 10 years the Republican budget, and that which \nwill be locked in to be spent as we determine in conference, is $300 \nbillion--you got it, $300 billion--more than the President proposes to \nset aside for safekeeping for the Social Security trust account.\n  Why is that the case? Because we say, put 100 percent of the \naccumulated surplus that belongs in the trust fund in the trust fund. \nFor all the rhetoric about who is saving what, we put $300 billion more \nin there than the President, because the President concocted a 15-year \npayout for this trust fund. We have never even had a budget that \ncontemplates 15 years. In fact, the President, when he goes beyond 5, \nhe does\n\n[[Page S3617]]\n\nnot even have the programs enumerated in his budget, but he is telling \nus all, wait 15 years, and we will put enough money in that trust fund \nthat is supposed to be there for some security. We said, put it in now \nas it accrues year by year--not 62 percent of it; 100 percent.\n\n  In addition, for those who are wondering what we are doing about \nSocial Security and what the President does about it, let me remind \nyou, we do not spend one nickel of Social Security, of their money, for \nany new program. The President of the United States, in his budget, \ndecided that it was not important to save Social Security by keeping \ntheir money. He had contemplated spending out of the Social Security \ntrust fund $158 billion. Let me repeat, we now have a motion by the \nother side of the aisle, our good Democratic friends, challenging what \nwe are doing, when the President of the United States spent $158 \nbillion, in the first 5 years, out of the Social Security trust fund \nwithout any apologies--just said, ``Spend it.'' We say, ``Don't spend \nit. Keep it in the trust fund, and put it in a statutorily created \nlockbox that will be tied to debt limits so it can never be spent.''\n  Having said that, it is really ironic that the other side of the \naisle claims the President is doing so much for Social Security, and \nthey would like to join on his coattails, so much for Medicare, and \nthey would like to join on his coattails, and the facts are what I have \njust told you. The facts are what I have just told you.\n  Fellow Senators, you do not have to be worried about whether that \nSocial Security trust fund is going to be used for tax cuts, because we \ncannot direct that any of that money be used for tax cuts. In fact, go \nread the resolution. It says tax cuts are to come from a mandated \nreconciliation pot of money that is called on-budget surplus.\n  Mr. President, forget all the jargon. It means that tax cuts, if any, \ncome out of surpluses that have nothing to do with the Social Security \ntrust fund, by definition. So tax cuts are going to accrue over a \ndecade, and they will come out of surpluses, not the surplus that is \naccumulated in the Social Security trust fund.\n  Having said that, once again, the amendment is calculated to play \npolitics, and I see no reason why we should not accept the instruction. \nSo if the distinguished Senator would like us to accept it, we can get \non with our business and we can accept it right now. If he would like a \nvote on it, we will tell all our people to vote 100 percent for it \nbecause, remember, we have to go to conference with the House, and we \nwill do our very best, but we will be glad to accept it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I am very happy that the chairman of the Budget Committee is going to \nagree to Senator Lautenberg's language, because there is some confusion \nhere, if you read the press reports today. That wouldn't be the first \ntime there would be some confusion. But what it says here is that \n``[t]he final budget resolution will also contain language allowing the \nentire $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years to \nbe used for retirement security. . . .'' It could include Medicare, it \nsays.\n  Here is the nub of the argument that we had in the Budget Committee, \nof which I am proud to be a member. The Democrats on the committee \nwanted to see 15 percent of the surplus dedicated to Medicare and 62 \npercent for Social Security. We had a very good debate, I thought, in \nthe committee about that. And my colleague from New Mexico made the \npoint very clearly that Social Security would be put in a lockbox and \nwould be used only for that. And we really did not get anywhere on the \nMedicare debate because we did not set aside anything from the surplus. \nYes, there is money in there for Medicare at the current level, but \nthere is nothing additional out of the surplus. We wanted to see 62 \npercent of the surplus for Social Security, 15 percent for Medicare.\n  Now we read that that 62 percent would be used for Medicare, in other \nwords, stealing that money from Social Security. I am very glad that my \ncolleague from New Mexico is going to accept this language. It will \nclarify it. I assume that this report is incorrect and that this \nlanguage will not appear.\n  I also hope that this newspaper is wrong when it reports that the \nDodd-Jeffords language on child care was stripped from the resolution. \nThis was a 59-vote majority in this body, quite bipartisan, to do \nsomething about child care.\n  So I am very pleased that we are going to have agreement on this. I \nhope when we look at the budget language--and, hopefully, I will be \nthere looking at it with my colleagues--that we will not see such \nlanguage in the resolution.\n  I thank you very much and yield back my time to Senator Lautenberg.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. She is a valuable member of the Budget Committee and works \nhard in making sure that the commitments we develop are to be met.\n  I remind my good friend from New Mexico that we are pleased to have \nhis support, that the vagary that develops as a result of this new \nlanguage ``retirement security'' is kind of a red flag. It tells us \nthat there is something else. Knowing the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee as I do, when he says he is going to do this, I know \nthat he is going to do it. I know when he goes to conference again that \nhe is going to make sure that this is held. I am comforted by that \nnotion, as are millions of Americans who are one day to get Social \nSecurity as part of their retirement program.\n  This is kind of a happy day. I hope that all of the Republicans will \nsupport this, as will the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the \nBudget Committee. I do not see how they can resist.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico whether he is ready to yield back time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Shall we accept the amendment, or does the Senator want \nto have a vote?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like a roll call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am just wondering if we can't stack a few votes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That wouldn't be a problem. The question is in terms \nof whether we have our other amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If we don't, we will put in a quorum call. How much \ntime do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 9 minutes 49 \nseconds, and the Senator from New Jersey has 4 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield down to 4\\1/2\\, and then we can both yield \nback the remainder.\n  Let me say, first of all, I heard that the Senator from California \nhad recently been to my State. Incidentally, I was quite surprised. I \nwalked into the airport in New Mexico, our international airport. I ran \ninto the Senator and asked her if she was coming all the way to New \nMexico to try to defeat the budget that we prepared. She told me, ``No. \nI am here for other purposes.'' I was kind of glad of that, and I \nsurely didn't want New Mexicans to listen to her about the budget when \nI worked so hard to try to get them to listen to me. She did not quite \ndo that, because I looked around to see how much she got and it was \npretty Democratic, what she did, with a big D.\n  Anyhow, let me suggest, Senator, that you should be careful when you \nuse these percentages. You say that what we want, speaking for you, we \nwanted 62 percent that the President wanted to set aside, and then we \nwanted 15 percent for Medicare. The budget is a big document, big \nnumbers, but I just added those two up, and that is 77 percent.\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is right, of the surplus.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Frankly, we have 100 percent in the first 10 years. So \nthe 15 percent that would have gone to Medicare under the proposal in \nthe committee, added to the percent that the President saved of the \nSocial Security trust fund, is the astronomical percentage of 77 \npercent of the Social Security trust fund. Guess what we did in our\n\n[[Page S3618]]\n\nbudget resolution. One hundred. Let's do that one. What is the \ndifference there? Twenty-three percent additional accumulated surplus \nin the first 10 years is in the lockbox as we prescribed in our budget. \nHaving said that, I relinquish the remainder of my time, if the Senator \nwill relinquish his.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Lautenberg motion, \nwhich would instruct the budget conferees to reserve all Social \nSecurity surpluses for Social Security, and for no other purpose. This \nis what Senate Republicans promised to do in the budget debate just \nlast month. Now, just three weeks later, we are hearing disturbing \nreports that they are poised to renege on their pledge. The Republican \nconferees are contemplating a new raid on Social Security. In a move \nwhich would reflect a new level of cynicism, the Republican leadership \nis cutting a trap door in their so-called ``Social Security lock-box.'' \nThose dollars were raised by payroll taxes expressly dedicated to \nfinancing Social Security benefits. However, the Republicans now want \nto allow that money to be used for any type of ``retirement security'' \nplan. I hope such reports are wrong. But I fear they might be accurate.\n  This would open the door to risky schemes that use the Social \nSecurity surplus to finance private retirement accounts at the expense \nof Social Security's guaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan \ncould actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than \nit is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts. A genuine ``lock-box'' \nwould prevent any such diversion of funds, but not the Republican \nversion. A genuine ``lock-box'' would guarantee that all those dollars \nwould be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future \nrecipients. The ``lock-box'' in this budget apparently does not.\n  It is bad enough that the budget passed by Senate Republicans three \nweeks ago did not provide even one additional dollar to pay Social \nSecurity benefits to future retirees, that it did not extend the life \nof the Social Security Trust Fund by one more day. To our Republican \ncolleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to strengthen Social \nSecurity, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert dollars which belong \nto the Social Security Trust Fund for other purposes. Every dollar in \nthat Trust Fund is needed to pay future Social Security benefits.''\n  The Republican ``retirement security'' scheme could be nothing more \nthan tax cuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately \nbenefiting their wealthy friends. Placing Social Security on a firm \nfinancial footing should be our highest budget priority, not further \nenriching the already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend \nupon Social Security retirement benefits for more than 50 percent of \ntheir annual income. Without it, half the Nation's elderly would fall \nbelow the poverty line.\n  It appears that the Republicans may be planning to take these Social \nSecurity dollars and to use them instead to finance more tax cuts in \nthe guise of ``retirement security.'' If this occurs, there will be no \ndebt reduction. There will be no strengthening of the Social Security \nTrust Fund to meet the demands of the baby boomers' retirement. Every \none of those payroll tax dollars belongs to Social Security, and should \nbe used solely to strengthen the Trust Fund. If our Republican \ncolleagues have no ulterior motive, the wording of the Budget \nResolution should state that principle unambiguously. When instead we \nsee language as vague and open-ended as ``retirement security,'' \nsuspicions are understandably raised. If this gaping trap door is not \neliminated, the American people will know that the Republican ``lock-\nbox'' is nothing more than a cynical magician's trick. The millions of \nsenior citizens who depend on Social Security will know that the \nRepublican majority has abandoned them once more.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Lautenberg motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that we not proceed to the vote \nbut, rather, that we have a quorum call now and see if the \ndistinguished Senator can muster up another amendment on his side, and \nwe will just wait for awhile and see.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before the quorum call is begun, I \nagree with the Senator's mission here; that is, perhaps we can stack \nseveral votes together, but we will work on that during the quorum \ncall.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand that it is in order to send \na motion to instruct conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Under the time \nagreement, the motions to instruct have 30 minutes equally divided.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send a motion to instruct on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Daschle and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] moves to \n     instruct conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, to include \n     in the conference report provisions that would:\n       (1) allow targeted tax relief for low-and middle-income \n     working families; and\n       (2) reserve a sufficient portion of projected non-Social \n     Security surpluses to extend significantly the solvency of \n     the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and modernize and \n     strengthen the program, before--\n       (A) using budget surpluses to pay for tax breaks that would \n     give most of their benefits to the wealthiest Americans, or\n       (B) enacting new spending above the levels in the Senate-\n     passed version of the budget resolution, unless it is offset \n     in accordance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to review the motion to \ninstruct very quickly for the benefit of the Members so they have a \nkeen awareness and understanding of exactly what this motion is to the \nconferees. This motion is to instruct the conferees to include in the \nconference report the provisions that would allow the targeted tax \nrelief for low- and middle-income working families which has been \npresented here during the course of the debate on the budget; and, two, \nto preserve a sufficient portion of the projected non-Social Security \nsurplus to extend significantly the solvency of the Medicare hospital \ninsurance trust fund and modernize and strengthen the program. We are \neffectively asking that there be the allocation of resources to extend \nthe solvency of the Medicare program.\n  I think the percentage that we had identified earlier during the \ncourse of the debate on the budget was 15 percent. What we have \nindicated here is that it would be important to extend the solvency of \nthe trust fund before using any of the budget surplus to pay for the \ntax breaks which would give most of the benefits to the wealthiest \nAmericans by enacting new spending above the levels in the Senate-\npassed version of the budget resolution.\n  Effectively what this instruction is, Mr. President, is very easy to \nunderstand. It says given the size and the significance of the budget \nsurplus that we want to have the sufficient allocations of resources \nfor the protection of Medicare. In an earlier instruction on this \nparticular measure, we included an instruction to have sufficient \nfunding set aside for the solvency of the Medicare trust fund before we \nprovide any tax cuts or tax breaks for the American people. That is \nbasically and fundamentally the issue.\n  We in this body make choices and make decisions. This is certainly \none of the most important ones that we will make, not only for just \nthis year, but for future years. We are saying, given the kinds of \nresources that we have available, that we are going to do two things \nwith regard to this instruction; that is, to set aside sufficient \nresources for the solvency of the Medicare program, and be serious \nabout taking the steps to ensure that there will be the changes in the \nMedicare program that are responding to the particular needs of the \nMedicare program.\n\n[[Page S3619]]\n\n  Certainly there are a number of ideas about how we can strengthen the \nMedicare program. I think one of the most important is the addition of \na prescription drug proposal. The President of the United States, in \nhis speech to the American people on the State of the Union, indicated \nthat one of his high priorities with the restructuring of the Medicare \nsystem would be for a program to meet the prescription drug needs of \nthe elderly people in this country.\n  We want to make sure that we are going to have sufficiency in terms \nof the savings of the projected surpluses, and that then we will have \nan opportunity in the remainder of this Congress for the Congress to \nwork its will on the floor of the Senate. I hope that one of the first \nareas of priority would be in the area of prescription drugs.\n  As has been pointed out on many different occasions, when the \nMedicare issue was debated in 1964 it lost narrowly here in the Senate \nin the spring of that year. It became a primary issue in the 1964 \nelection. There was an extraordinary resonance across the country about \nthe importance of Medicare. There were 18 Members of the Senate that \nvoted one way in 1964 and another way in 1965. They had heard the \nvoices of the elderly people in this country in support of the Medicare \nprogram. When we adopted the Medicare program we did not include \nprescription drugs for one very basic and fundamental reason, and that \nis because about 95 percent of the private programs at that time did \nnot include prescription drugs. Now they do. The need is out there.\n  We will have an opportunity to do it, and it will be \ngreatly strengthened with this kind of an instruction to the conferees. \nIf we are able to set aside the kind of surplus that was included in \nthe President's recommendations and included in this instruction, then \nwe will know that we will have a sound Medicare system. The Medicare \nprogram will have greater solvency, and we will be able to deal with \nalterations and changes in the Medicare system. And, hopefully, we will \nbe able to address the prescription drug issue.\n\n  This issue is so basic and so fundamental that it is really the \nquestion of a priority. Do we think having broad kinds of tax cuts for \nthe American people is preferable to ensuring the financial security \nand solvency of the Medicare system? That is the issue that is \nincorporated in this particular instruction. It is as basic and \nfundamental as that. Do you believe that with the scarce but sufficient \nresources that are in the various surpluses that we are going to say \nlet's put a priority on Social Security and Medicare? This instruction \nsays we are going to give the priority to Medicare. And many of us who \nare supporting this also give high priority when we are going to have \nthat financial security to make sure there is going to be a \nprescription drug provision.\n  I see my friend and colleague. I would be glad to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nyielding for a couple of questions.\n  First, I thank him for his motion to instruct conferees. As a member \nof the Budget Committee, I can tell you that the Democrats on that \ncommittee fought very, very hard to get the committee to set aside \nenough funds from the overall surplus that we have to meet the needs of \nMedicare. And many of us brought out points that the Senator from \nMassachusetts has brought out before. I just want to ask him a couple \nof questions.\n  Does the Senator not agree that Medicare is really the twin pillar of \nSocial Security for our people? In other words, you save Social \nSecurity, but if you do not save Medicare, then our seniors will have \nto spend their Social Security income to pay for their health care. \nDoesn't the Senator feel that this is the twin pillar of the senior \ncitizens' safety net?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has made an excellent point and one which I \nagree with completely. If you look at a profile of who the Social \nSecurity recipient is, it is a person that is living alone, $12,000 in \nincome, a woman 76 years of age who has at least one chronic disease \nand is paying some 19 percent of her income in out-of-pocket health \ncare costs. That is 19 percent out of $12,000--paying that percent of \nher income out of pocket for health care. If the Senator understands \nthe amount that is being paid out of pocket by even those today that \nare getting Medicare, it is just about what it was at the time of the \nenactment of Medicare.\n  So for those that say, well, we really do not have to have this \ninstruction, we are going to be able to consider the Commission's \nrecommendations, that will effectively require $688 billion over the \nnext additional 12 years to get the kind of economic stability that \nwould be included in our particular instruction. And that is only going \nto be able to be achieved with higher copays, or higher premiums, or \nhigher deductibles. It is going to come out of the pocket or the \npocketbook of that senior citizen. I don't understand how we can do \nthat.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have one more question that goes to the heart of the \nSenator's point. What the Republicans are saying is we can reform our \nway. We don't think we need additional resources. They proposed tax \nbreaks for the wealthiest people in America instead of saving Medicare. \nWhat you do is very clearly say, yes, we will support targeted tax \nrelief for low- and middle-class families, but we want to save Medicare \nbefore we give back funds to the wealthiest among us, those at the \nvery, very top tier.\n  The question I wanted to pose to my friend is this: As I look at \nMedicare and the numbers we have in the Budget Committee, I want to ask \nmy friend if he agrees with these numbers. We are told that the \nMedicare program provides health care to 39 million Americans today, \nbut by 2032 the number of Medicare beneficiaries will double to 78 \nmillion as the baby boomers retire. So the question for the Senator is \nbasically this: We are looking at a program that is very important, and \nwe are looking at some good news. We are living longer. This is good. \nWe all work toward that. We want to live longer. We want to have a good \nquality of life. But can we just say we can reform our way out of this \nproblem, or do we have to commit some of the surplus to Medicare?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct in terms of the size of the \nMedicare population and correct in terms of allocating these additional \nresources for Medicare. Let's understand that the amount that we are \ntalking about effectively is money that is being paid in by working \nfamilies. Those are resources that are being paid in by those working \nfamilies. All we are saying is that we believe those working families' \ninterests should be protected with the previous instruction on Social \nSecurity and this instruction on Medicare before we provide tax breaks \nfor individuals who are not participants in paying into the system like \nthe workers have been in terms of the Medicare system and Social \nSecurity.\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I apologize to Senator Kennedy for not \nbeing here. I assume it is fair to say that I probably heard his \nargument as we put the budget through. It is similar to the one he made \nbefore. That doesn't mean I shouldn't have been here. But I just \ncouldn't. When the time is up, let me ask if we could get a unanimous \nconsent on stacked votes.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk just for a moment about the \nRepublican budget as it pertains to a blueprint for our country's \nfuture. When I have used up about 6 minutes of my 15, will the Chair \nadvise me? I appreciate that.\n  First of all, let me say to those who are listening that we have a \nsituation that is pretty unique in our country, and it is a situation \nthat we ought to look at very carefully to see what the public policy \nought to be and what would be best for America's future.\n  The American taxpayer has received a bonanza in new taxes. As a \nmatter of fact, there is now going to be over the next decade a huge \nsurplus. ``surplus'' means the taxes collected exceed the expenditures. \nThat is a surplus. We were used to living in a deficit. ``Deficit'' \nmeans the expenditures, the program costs, are more than the taxes that \ncome in.\n  For a variety of reasons, not the least of which is a sustained \nrecovery; low interest rates, partially attributable to good, sound, \nbudget policies; high productivity, because we have added new machines \nand equipment to\n\n[[Page S3620]]\n\nthe production of service organizations and what they sell to the \nAmerican people, we have more money coming in than we are going to \nspend. Over the decade, it is going to be a very large amount of money.\n  Where we depart from the Democrats who have been arguing on the \nfloor--not all Democrats--the principal position on our side is that we \nthink we don't need some of that big surplus paid in by the taxpayer, \nwhich means they are paying more than we need to run the Government \nyear by year; we think a portion of that should go back to the taxpayer \nby way of tax changes that will help our taxpayers and will help the \neconomy continue to grow and produce jobs and be a strong economy.\n  We say there are three very important things to take care of, one of \nwhich is to give back some taxes to the American people, who are paying \nin more than they expected in terms of our Government. There are some \nwho say we shouldn't do that or the budget resolution ought to state \nexactly how we are going to change those tax laws.\n  Frankly, in the Congress we do things a little differently. There is \na committee that will determine our tax reductions and our tax changes. \nAll we can do is say we are making some money available for doing that. \nWhat we do is take all of the Social Security surplus--not 62 percent \nof it as does the President, but 100 percent of it--and we say that \naccumulation, that surplus, is set aside and cannot be used for tax \ncuts. Under our budget resolution, it is to be used for Social Security \nreform to pay for any additional costs. We think that is very exciting, \nand we think that is better than what the President has in mind. It is \n100 percent of that surplus.\n  There is a Medicare program which is very important to seniors. We \nhave done three things in this budget regarding Medicare. One, the \nPresident cut $20 billion more out of Medicare during the next decade, \nand we said cut nothing, don't cut any more by way of expenditures out \nof the Medicare trust fund--$19 billion over 10 years. In addition, our \nbudget plan increases Medicare spending by $200 billion over 10 years, \nan average of $20 billion a year. Then, starting in the sixth year of \nthis budget, there is an additional $100 billion that does not go to \ntax cuts, does not go to the Social Security fund, that could be used \nby Medicare if Medicare needed it. In fact, we believe this is a very, \nvery, ambitious program to make sure Medicare is taken care of.\n  I remind everyone that a strong, powerful economy is one of the best \ntools to keep Medicare strong. Just a few weeks ago, the trustees in \ncharge said, because things have been going so well, we have increased \nthe life of the Medicare fund from the year 2008 to 2015. We have added \nbetween 7 and 8 years by keeping the economy going with a lot of \nemployment and people paying into the Medicare system.\n\n  We believe this budget is good policy for America. We think it is \njust as important to talk on the floor of the Senate about who pays all \nthese taxes as what programs we ought to spend the money on. We don't \nwant to just discuss how we can spend the money; we want to discuss the \ntaxpayers.\n  We are saying it is time to fix the Tax Code and make it more fair \nfor married couples, put some other reductions in and return some of \nthose tax dollars to the American people, because we are worried about \ntaxpayers; they deserve our concern.\n  At the same time, we have adequately provided for Medicare and \nadequately provided for an assured Social Security; that when the \nchanges are made, and only then, will this trust fund money be used for \nSocial Security.\n  We are involved in an air war over in Kosovo, Yugoslavia, and we are \ngoing to need more money for that war. Everybody understands we are \ngoing to do that when we are asked. We will have it. It will change how \nmuch can go for taxes and how much can be held in reserve. It will \nchange some of that, but actually that is a very high priority.\n  I say to Senators and my fellow Americans that in our regular budget \nwe provided for some very significant increases in defense and some \nsignificant increases in education. If you add that up, it is a pretty \ngood package. We will go to conference with the House. I don't know \nwhat we can get out of them, but we will get a good budget. It will be \nvery much like the one we produced.\n  Having said that, I reserve the remainder of my time and hope the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts might yield back some of his \ntime at some point.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes \n16 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will use that remaining time so we can \nmove along, then ask for the yeas and nays in accordance with the \nleadership proposal, and vote.\n  Mr. President, according to the trustees' report on the Medicare \ntrust fund, this particular measure will add some 7 years to the \nMedicare trust fund. Now it will be--instead of 2008, in the most \nrecent figures it is 2015. With 15 percent, as we talk about, a \nsubstantial increase, it will provide the stability and solvency of the \ntrust fund to the year 2027. That is what this amendment does.\n  If we do not take this action, then, if we look over a 25-year \nperiod, it is going to mean benefit cuts of 11 percent in 25 years, 25 \npercent in 50 years, and 31 percent in 75 years, to make up for the \nshortfall.\n  It seems to me, given the special circumstances, we ought to protect \nSocial Security and protect Medicare. We still have resources, even \nafter that, for individual accounts, as the President suggested--close \nto $500 billion for individual accounts, for savings and for investment \nfor individuals--and we also have resources that will be available for \na tax cut.\n  But let us say, with regard to Medicare, we are going to provide \nthese additional resources and we are going to commit them to our \nMedicare system and then in this Congress we are going to get about the \npossibility of making the alterations or changes in our Medicare \nsystem, primarily in the area of enhancing prescription drugs, and also \nother changes that will strengthen the Medicare system even further. \nThis is a sound, prudent investment.\n  Finally, the greatest percentage of the surplus was paid in by \nworking families. Working families often become dependent primarily on \nSocial Security and Medicare as they age. Some of them get some \npensions from companies they have worked for. But if you look over what \nis happening, even in terms of the pensions, they are gradually being \ncut back. They are gradually being reduced every single year. Medicare \nand Social Security are the rocks on which our elderly and seniors \nreally depend. We have an opportunity to go on record on that measure \nhere today with this amendment, and I hope the Senate will accept it.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support this motion to instruct \nthe conferees to set aside some of the on-budget surplus for Medicare.\n  The Budget Resolution approved by this body in March made the correct \ndecision with regard to Social Security by devoting the off-budget, or \nSocial Security, surplus to paying down the publicly held debt. That \nwas the right thing to do, especially if we are not going to come to \nclosure on a true Social Security reform plan that brings down future \nliabilities.\n  While the direction on Social security was the correct course, \nfailure to hold some of the on-budget surplus to deal with Medicare \ntakes us down the wrong fiscal path. Medicare's financial problems are \nnot only more acute than Social Security's but also much more difficult \nto solve. The fact of the matter is that even under the reform plan \nconsidered in the Medicare Commission, solvency would not be \nsignificantly extended.\n  Given these facts, it seems to me that the smarter fiscal policy over \nthe long-term would be to leave some of the on-budget surplus to \naddress Medicare. Using it all for a tax cut significantly reduces our \nflexibility to prepare for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation \nand the demands on Social Security, Medicare, and our overall budget \nthat will result from the doubling of beneficiaries eligible for these \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to \ninstruct if they are serious about acting in a fiscally responsible way \nto shore up Social Security and Medicare.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n\n[[Page S3621]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I propound the \nfollowing unanimous consent request, and it has been cleared on both \nsides. It has nothing to do with the amendment that is pending.\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending motion and any motions or \namendments regarding the appointment of conferees to the budget \nresolution be stacked to occur in the order in which they were offered \nat the conclusion or yielding back of time on the motions. I further \nask that there be 2 minutes before each vote for the explanation and \nthe votes in the sequence after the first vote be limited to 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Were the yeas and nays included, Mr. President? \nReserving the right to object--I do not intend to --will the Senator \nask it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays at this time for all of \nthose amendments?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, Senator; we want to wait until the time has \nexpired.\n  You want to get the yeas and nays now?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, please.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We can still amend. You could not, but we could.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has 1 minute.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I will be glad to yield it back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If he yields his back, I am going to yield mine back.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield mine back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 252 To The Kennedy Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, at the end of the Kennedy motion add the \nfollowing: Include in the conference report, No. 1, amendment No. 176, \noffered by Senators Roth and Breaux, regarding Medicare reform; and \nsection 209 of the Senate-passed resolution to the budget offered by \nSenators Snowe and Wyden, regarding the use of on-budget surpluses for \nprescription drug benefits.\n  I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 252 to the Kennedy motion to instruct the \n     conferees.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n       At the end add the following in the conference report:\n       (1) Amendment No. 176, offered in the Senate by Senators \n     Roth and Breaux, regarding Medicare reform; and\n       (2) Section 209 of the Senate-passed resolution, offered in \n     the Budget Committee by Senators Snowe and Wyden, regarding \n     the use of on-budget surpluses for a prescription drug \n     benefit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes equally divided on the \namendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me explain to Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will make a copy of that amendment and distribute \nit.\n  What we are going to do with this amendment is simply add to the end \nof the Kennedy amendment two provisions that were voted on by the \nSenate during the debate, just as most of his instruction was already \nvoted on. These two sections are essentially as follows: No. 1, the \nRoth, Breaux, and others amendment regarding a bipartisan proposal on \nMedicare; and, No. 2, an amendment offered by the Budget Committee in \nbehalf of the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. Snowe, which \nessentially said that any additional on-budget surplus, non-Social \nSecurity money, that existed beyond the tax cut--which is, as I \nunderstand, about $102 billion starting 5 years from now--could be \navailable for prescription drugs.\n  Essentially, what we will then do is we will get a request for the \nyeas and nays on our amendment. I understand, pursuant to the unanimous \nconsent, when it gets called up in order, we will get an additional 2 \nminutes, 1 minute per side, to explain it.\n  So, essentially I am just asking we add to the end of yours, two \nproposals that have already been adopted by the Senate: One, the Roth-\nBreaux et al. on the bipartisan Medicare proposal; and, second, the \nBudget Committee portion, which was Senator Snowe's amendment, which \nsaid any excess surplus beyond the tax cut and Social Security could be \nused for prescription drugs.\n  So we will vote on ours first and see what happens to yours.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator to Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator obviously is entitled to \nconform with the Senate rules. But we are as well. So we will continue \nto go along on this merry chase until we have an opportunity to vote on \nthis measure. We are glad to spend whatever time debating Medicare that \nthe chairman of the committee wants.\n  You can load this up as the rules permit, but the rules also permit \nus finally to get a rollcall, and we are going to take full advantage \nof the rules to make sure we do. I will just let the membership \nunderstand that now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey could tell us, were there any other instructions?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have potentially two more. The Senator from \nConnecticut is going to be offering a motion to instruct, and there may \nbe a question about another, which we will find out about in just a few \nminutes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how does this proceed?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask Senator Kennedy if he will yield \nback time on my amendment. I yield back mine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator from Massachusetts willing to \nyield back time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Are you talking about the second-degree amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes; it is the first-degree amendment to your \nmotion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. No, not at this time, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with reference to the issue that is \nbefore us, I ask unanimous consent that with respect to votes in order \nto the motion to appoint conferees, the Domenici amendment No. 252, \nwhich I have just described, be considered a separate motion to \ninstruct and the vote occur on, or in relation to, the Domenici motion, \nto be followed, pursuant to the consent agreement, by a vote in \nrelation to the Kennedy motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Having said that, with reference to mine, I yield back \nany time I have.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. May I inquire of the chairman, I can offer a motion?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, indeed.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] moves to instruct \n     conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, the Concurrent Resolution on \n     the Budget for Fiscal Year 2000, to include in the conference \n     report the Dodd-Jeffords amendment No. 160, as modified, \n     which passed the Senate on March 25 by 57-40.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, how much time is allowed on this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes equally divided, 15 minutes per \nside. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the President.\n  Let me begin these brief remarks by once again commending my dear \nfriend from New Mexico, the chairman of the committee. We use the word \n``friend'' around here to describe each other with great frequency. On \nnumerous occasions, we actually mean it, and this is one of those \ninstances. He is one of my best friends in the Senate. So it is with a \ndegree of reluctance I rise to offer this motion because this is in \nregard to an amendment that was passed by a pretty good vote, Mr. \nPresident, 57-40, during the consideration of the budget resolution.\n  Occasionally, there are matters that are bipartisan on these budget \nresolutions. I argue strongly this is one of them. Child care is an \nissue that does not have an ideological parent, does not have a \npartisan parent, if you will. This is an issue of which I believe \npeople all across the country appreciate the importance.\n  The average cost of child care is $4,000 to $10,000 per child. Even \nfamilies that have decent incomes and have two or three children can \nappreciate the cost of child care. One can imagine then, when talking \nabout working families who are struggling to keep food on the table, \nhow important this kind of a proposal is for them.\n  The amendment that was adopted expands an existing program--it does \nnot create a new program. It was almost a decade ago that my friend \nfrom Utah, Senator Orrin Hatch, and I offered the child care block \ngrant, which was adopted. President Bush, to his credit, supported and \naccepted the block grant proposal.\n  For almost 10 years now we have had this child care block grant. And \nit's only drawback is that it doesn't have enough funding to reach all \neligible children--only one in ten can currently receive assistance. So \nSenator Jeffords and I offered, along with 55 other Members of this \nbody--12 members of the majority and 45 members of the minority--a \nproposal that would increase the child care development block grant by \n$5 billion over 5 years, about $1 billion a year. It amounts to little \nmore than $12 billion over 10 years. We pay for that by reducing the \n$780 billion proposed tax cut by the same amount.\n  We also said in this amendment that it is our preference, if there is \na tax cut proposal, that we also do a child care tax cut for all \nworking parents as well as for stay-at-home parents.\n  Why do we need to add money to the block grant? When we passed the \nwelfare reform package a few years ago to move people from welfare to \nwork, all across the country States took what little money they had for \nchild care and provided it to the welfare recipient as they came off \nwelfare and went to work.\n  But tragically, what has happened in Idaho, Connecticut, and many \nother places is, the family that was not on welfare, that was on the \nmargin and working, now loses child care assistance. It is a great \nirony in a way.\n  So what Senator Jeffords, Senator Chafee, Senator Collins, Senator \nSnowe, Senator Abraham, Senator Frist, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, \nSenator Roberts, Senator Campbell, Senator Specter, Senator Warner and \nI, and others, are asking here in this budget resolution is that we \nought to try to do something about this.\n  The people who need this are working people with young children. They \nneed the kind of help this block grant can provide. Some people have \nmistakenly said, ``Well, I don't like this program because it says that \na parent couldn't choose a church-based child-care program.'' That is \nnot true. This money can go to church-based programs, neighborhoods, \nfamilies. It is not restricted as to the kind of child care setting \nthat a family can choose to use.\n  This is a good bipartisan proposal. It is with a great degree of \nreluctance that I offer this motion to instruct. But the reason I have \nto do it--and, again, I have such great affection for my colleague from \nNew Mexico; and he can straighten me out on this if he cares to; in \nfact, I wish he would--but I am reading now from this report--the \n``Daily Report for Executives''. ``U.S. Budget, Domenici and Kasich \nagree on final budget.'' This is dated April 13, Tuesday, today. It \nsays, my friend:\n\n       Domenici and Kasich also said they had stricken from the \n     final budget plan a Senate-passed amendment sponsored by \n     [yours truly] Sens. Christopher Dodd [of Connecticut] and \n     James Jeffords [of Vermont] that would have reduced the size \n     of the tax cut by $10 billion [over 10 years] and made that \n     money available to a child care program.\n       ``What they're going to do is they're going to have some \n     language in there that's going to say that out of the $780 \n     billion tax [cut] some consideration ought to be given to \n     families that have child care needs,'' Kasich said of the \n     language in the final budget that will replace the Dodd-\n     Jeffords amendment.\n       ``And we'll drop all add-ons like Dodd-Jeffords,'' Domenici \n     added.\n       Kasich [then] said they had no intention of creating a new \n     child care entitlement--\n\n  This is not new. It is a 10-year program. I am just adding resources \nto it; no question about that--\n\n     but suggested that the final budget will recommend that the \n     child care-related tax [cut] relief be looked at by the tax-\n     writing committees ``because there are needs out there.''\n\n  I appreciate the last phrase, ``because there are needs.''\n  The problem, of course, with just tax writing is that if you pay \ntaxes, you may get the benefit of it. But if you are down at that \n$20,000-a-year level--this is not a great mystery to anybody--the idea \nyou are going to get a tax break at that income level that can meet the \ncost of child care is just a fantasy.\n  So we want to increase the block grant by $12 billion over 10 years \nnationwide to help these families. I think this body, regardless of \nwhich side of the aisle we sit on, ought to be able to find room in our \nhearts and our budget for this, if we care about these working \nfamilies.\n  We understand the pressures, the tremendous pressures, on these \nfamilies. I was at a child-care center at the Justice Department \nyesterday here in Washington. It is a magnificent child-care center. As \nyou can well imagine, they have done a good job down there. But that \ngood care costs.\n  I spoke to a woman who is a lawyer with the Justice Department and \nhas children at the center. Her husband is a public interest lawyer. \nThey have three children in that child-care center, twins and a young \nchild. It cost them $26,000 a year--$26,000 a year. And they are happy \njust to have a place. The waiting list is a mile long, which is another \nproblem we face here and why I offer this motion.\n  All over the country we see this scenario replicated--in the State of \nCalifornia the waiting list is some 200,000 children. In Texas and \nFlorida, there are similar lists.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I would love to hear the members of the \nBudget Committee say, ``Listen, you know, we didn't like this amendment \nterribly, but we did have a strong bipartisan vote''--that is a pretty \nstrong vote, almost 60-40 here on this amendment; it was sponsored in a \nbipartisan fashion; it was passed in a bipartisan fashion--``while we \nweren't enthusiastic about this initially, this is one we are going to \ntake.'' If that is the case, then I do not want to have our colleagues \nhave to vote twice on something here. I do not like doing that. But \nwhen I read here that I am dropped, I am history, I am being kind of \nwritten off, then you do not leave me much choice but to defend myself.\n  I am forced to defend it for the families out there who got excited \nabout the fact that in this budget resolution we had made a place, for \nthe first time in years, to provide some assistance.\n  So I plead with my colleagues here to not oppose this, in fact even \naccept this instruction, if you will, and let's see if we can't \nconvince some of those recalcitrant voices who do not want to embrace \nthe idea that this Congress could do something about working families \nand their children.\n  With that, Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does Senator Dodd have?\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Dodd has 4 minutes 49 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to Senator Dodd, let me just put in perspective \nwhat we are going through here this afternoon.\n  I am a mild-mannered guy.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, you are.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That does not mean I do not get excited about things. \nLook, everything we are talking about here on the floor we just voted \non. You either won or you lost. You happen to have won. Senator Kennedy \nhas a proposal. That already was voted on. He lost. Let's see, what \nelse do we have? Oh, Senator Lautenberg has an instruction. We already \nvoted on that.\n  It is interesting. I would just put in perspective for the Senators \nand for those listening, normally--I have been here for a while; I have \nwrapped up a lot of budget resolutions--we appoint the conferees. That \nis what we are doing here, this little administrative job of appointing \nconferees. We normally do it at the same time we pass those \nresolutions. So if we finish at 10 o'clock at night, by 10:15 this is \ngone, they have been appointed. Nobody moves to instruct the conferees, \nbecause they just voted on it; they already got their instructions \nthrough their votes.\n  We made a mistake. We made a mistake. We should never have seen the \npress last night. We were not obligated to tell the press we had a \nmeeting. We like to keep them informed. But now, because of everything \nthey said about what we discussed, Senators are saying, ``Well, maybe \nthey are not going to do in that conference what the Senate said we \nshould do, so we are coming to the floor and reproposing the whole \nthing,'' bringing the issues all back up, even if they lost on them or \neven, in Senator Dodd's case, where he won on them, and we are going to \nhave to vote again.\n  Actually, everybody should understand, an instruction to the \nconferees, through the process we are doing this afternoon, is nice. It \nis a wonderful thing. You should be very pleased if you win. But the \nHouse isn't bound by it. That is just the simple truth of it. The \nconference is not between Senators asking for a second vote which will \nmake their will the law; they are asking that we do something with the \nHouse to make them go with us. I am not promising that I can do that. \nIf you win here on the floor, I am not promising that I can do that. As \na matter of fact, some Senators think I can, that if we are to vote \nagain on Dodd-Jeffords, I should just go over there and I will win \nthat.\n\n  Well, it isn't quite that easy. I do a little better here on the \nfloor sometimes with all these Senators from both sides than I do \nsometimes in those conferences. I am not going to offer a second-\ndegree. We all understand the issue. If you want to vote, we will have \na vote.\n  I guess I could tell you for myself, I understood very clearly who \nvoted. There were some Republicans who voted with you. I didn't happen \nto be one. But I am not going to be able to carry any more water with \nany more assurance or any more power in the water that I carry because \nwe vote again this afternoon than to go to that conference and wrap it \nup and say, Senator Dodd and Senator Jeffords won--not that they won \nthis instruction. That would be there. So if you want to save some \ntime, you might just urge me to do it better than the news reports, and \nI tell you I am going to try. I tell you that if we can't do that, I am \ngoing to find some way in the tax instructions to see if we can't do \nsomething significant in the area of child care through the Tax Code. \nBut if you would like a vote, that may be an easier way.\n  I say, though, there is a reason that we do not need to vote in \nadditional money for this program. I will tell you what it is. I do not \nknow the ultimate number, but I understand that almost all the States \nhave a very large surplus in the TANF program, the Temporary Assistance \nfor Needy Families program. That is the successor to the welfare \nprogram, Mr. President. When we sent them the money, we sent them a \nblock of money predicated upon a significant caseload and estimates \nabout how much it would be reduced.\n  It turns out that almost every State has a very large surplus there. \nWhat they plan to do with it, not every State but a very large number \nof them, is to use it for this program. As a matter of fact, I \nunderstand the regulations have been approved just yesterday which will \nauthorize the States to use their TANF, Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies, excesses for the block grant program, which we would still be \nfunding for child care. So essentially I think we are going to have an \nexpanded child care program. I do not think we need to do this, but I \ndo not go to conference based on that. That is just an explanation to \nthe Senate as to why a number of Senators did not think we needed to \nvote for that when it first appeared and won.\n  Now I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my colleague does that, again, I appreciate my \ncolleague from New Mexico, the chairman, has a difficult job. Having \nserved on the Budget Committee for many years with the chairman of the \ncommittee, I have a great admiration for his ability and the difficult \njob he has. I appreciate as well the fact that this is a somewhat \nunique procedure, although we have used it in the past. It is not \nuncommon for it to be done. I hope my colleague appreciates, that when \nI pick up and read that my amendment has been pushed out, before the \nconference has even met, that it makes it kind of hard on me and hard \non those of us who supported that amendment.\n  So, yes, this is taking advantage of a unique situation here, but \nmaybe, just maybe if we go into that conference--and I know the \nchairman does not agree with this amendment, but I know he has \nhistorically respected the will of the Senate even when he disagrees \nwith it, which is the mark of a good chairman, in my view, and he goes \non and says, look, ladies and gentlemen here, not only this crowd in \nthe Senate, over my objection voted for this once, they did it twice. \nThe bipartisan Senate cares about this and thinks it is an important \npriority. To that extent, it may have some value.\n  Mr. President, whatever time I have remaining, I see my colleague \nfrom Vermont.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I just want to say, whatever time Senator Jeffords \nneeds, a few minutes, we will make sure he gets them. I would like to \ntell you, since you indicated that you and I have worked together on a \nlot of things, do you know what you could do for me that would be the \nbest thing going? Not to have so many votes on budget resolutions. What \nis happening, we spend so much time voting on them that Senators are \nwondering what this whole process is all about. This year probably 50 \npercent of the votes, maybe 60 are all on the budget resolution and the \nfour or five today. My job is getting more difficult because of that. \nPretty soon Senators will be saying maybe it is not worth all this \ntrouble.\n  How much time do you need?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you have any left?\n  Mr. DODD. I don't know if I do or not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 2 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You yield your 2, and I yield him 3.\n  Mr. DODD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rushed over here in hopes of getting \nto the floor on time, and I appreciate very much the opportunity to \nspeak on this very important issue.\n  I have worked with the Senator from Connecticut for years on child \ncare. Every time we think we have a victory, it somehow disappears. Yet \nthe need for quality child care does not disappear. The need continues \nto increase. We must take advantage of the information we have learned \nand recognize that the early years of life are so incredibly important \nin a child's development. The first 3 to 5 years are critical. At this \npoint, we do little or nothing for this age group and these are the \nmost important years of your life in many respects. Fortunately, few \nbabies get totally ignored during that period. But this is the period \nin time which the brain develops most rapidly. It is the one which can \nbe most damaged by the lack of adequate child care.\n  I will be introducing on Thursday and I thought it was going to be \nthe filler for what we did on the budget bill. We were all ready to go, \nand now we are back to ground zero on this\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nissue. Well, I am going to introduce the bill on Thursday in hopes that \nthis issue does not go away and that it will continue to be heard \nbefore the conference. We must continue to try to do what must be done \nfor the children of this country.\n  In addition, we have to look at businesses and do something to give \nthem the incentives to have their own child care. We have to make sure \nthat we take care of the most critical thing and to make sure that we \ndeliver quality child care and learn how to maximize the period of time \nin a child's life which is so critically important.\n  I want to do everything I can, and I am sure the Senator from \nConnecticut joins with me in saying we are not going to let this issue \ngo away. We will do whatever it takes to make sure this country is in a \nposition to allow our children to maximize their opportunities in \nschool by having the best child care possible.\n  This is an incredibly important issue. I know that the Senator from \nNew Mexico is with us in the sense that he understands the essential \naspects of maximizing opportunities during the most critical period in \na child's life. In the past, the Senator has been supportive of us, and \nI hope he continues to do so. At this point, I will close and say, I am \ngoing to plow forward. I know we will work with the Senator from \nConnecticut and we are not going to let this issue go away.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, does the Senator yield back his time?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that means we have one proposal left, as \nI understand it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Motion To Instruct Conferees\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, moves to \n     instruct conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, the concurrent \n     resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, to include in \n     the conference report provisions that would provide \n     additional funding for income assistance for family farmers \n     above the level provided in the Senate-passed resolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are dealing with the budget and the \nnaming of conferees, and a number of priorities have been discussed \nhere on the floor of the Senate. That is what a budget is, establishing \npriorities. I offer this motion to instruct, and it is very simple. The \nSenator from New Mexico said he would like to take this, and if he \ndoes, I will not ask for a recorded vote.\n  In this motion, I move to instruct the conferees on H. Con. Res. 68, \nthe concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2000, to \ninclude in the conference report provisions that would provide \nadditional funding for income assistance for family farmers above the \nlevel provided in the Senate-passed resolution.\n  Why am I asking for favorable consideration on this motion? \nYesterday, I read on the Senate floor a letter from a North Dakota \nwoman that I want to read today. Her name is Susan Jorgenson. She wrote \nin her letter, describing the plight of family farmers, something that \nI think everybody listening to this debate should digest. Susan \nJorgenson has lost her husband. He died last August. She said he had \ndiabetes, but she said:\n\n       . . .what I really feel caused his death was trying to make \n     a living as a family farmer.\n\n  She said:\n\n       I had an auction last week to sell the [farm] machinery so \n     I can pay off some of the debt that [we] incurred after 26 \n     years of farming. I have a 17-year-old son who would not help \n     me prepare for the auction and did not get out of bed the day \n     of the [auction] sale because he was so heartbroken that he \n     could not continue [to farm] this land [that he loved].\n\n  She said this of her husband:\n\n       He chose to farm rather than to live in Phoenix where he \n     had a job with Motorola [early on] because he wanted to raise \n     his children in a place with clean air, no crime, and good \n     schools. He worked very hard, physically and emotionally, to \n     make this farm work and its failure was . . . no fault of his \n     own.\n\n  That is what this farm wife says about her deceased husband.\n  What is happening on the family farm? Everybody is making money but \nthem. They raise the crop and give it to a railroad; the railroad makes \na record profit hauling it. They raise steer and sell them to the \nslaughter house; the slaughter house makes a profit and the farmer goes \nbelly up. They raise grain and put it into a cereal manufacturing \nplant, and they then take that wheat or rice and puff it and send it to \na grocery store as puffed wheat or rice. The company that added the \npuff makes a mint and the farmer goes broke. Everything that touches \nwhat the farmer raises makes record profits, and the farmers are going \nbroke in record numbers.\n  We have a serious emergency on family farms. Here is a headline \nconcerning prairie dogs. Some groups have now decided --including in \nthe Government--that we have a big problem, that we have to save \nprairie dogs. I don't know if these folks have driven around my part of \nthe country much, but we have lots and lots of prairie dogs. We don't \nneed a Federal program to ensure that we are going to have them in our \nfuture. Prairie dogs will take care of themselves, thank you.\n  What we lack are family farmers. Every day in every way, every week, \nevery month, and every single year, we lose more and more family \nfarmers. Now, we have farmers raising wheat and selling it for \nDepression-era prices in constant dollars. How would you like to be \nreceiving wages that are Depression-era wages right now in constant \ndollars?\n  How about a minimum wage for family farmers? We debate minimum wage \nhere on the floor of the Senate and I always vote for it. I think the \nfolks at the bottom end of the ladder need to be given the chance to \nraise themselves up a bit.\n  What about an opportunity to provide a fair price for farmers? Wheat \nprices and grain prices have collapsed. Cattle prices and pork prices \nhave collapsed. Farmers are having auction sales and 17-year-old boys \nwon't get out of bed because they are so heartsick about losing their \nfarms.\n\n  We are told by people around here: Well, that's just the way the \nmarket system works. That is not a system that works at all. The system \nsays to those who gas the tractor in the spring, plow the ground, plant \nthe seed, and harvest the crop that their work has no value but the \ngiant agrifactories that make a fortune with it have value. I am saying \nthat this Congress must do something about that. This Congress must \ndecide that family farmers matter in this country's future.\n  I have watched the chairman of the Budget Committee fight for things \nthat matter to him. I have watched him fight for the National Labs and \nso many other things that are so important to him and there is no more \ntenacious of a fighter in the Senate than the Senator from New Mexico \nabout the things that matter to him. I feel the same way about family \nfarmers. That is what matters to me. I am not saying that [farming] \ndoesn't matter to him or anybody else. I am not making a judgment about \nthat. I am just saying that we have a full-blown emergency in rural \nAmerica.\n  I held up a chart yesterday that showed the counties in this country \nwhich are losing population, which have lost over 15 percent of their \npopulation in the last 15 years. What you have is a huge red swath in \nthe middle of America being depopulated--the middle part of our \ncountry.\n  We need a farm program that works. And when we see auction sale \nposters from wall to wall in small towns, and small town businesses \nboarded up--so many auction sales that they have to call retired \nauctioneers out of retirement to handle the sales--we ought to \nunderstand that this counts for something in this country and that we \nneed to develop a public policy that says we are going to try to do \nsomething to stop the flow of family farmers who are leaving the land \nand discovering that their hopes and dreams have come to an end.\n  Every single month, we add a ``New York City'' in population to this \nEarth. Every month, a new ``New York City'' is added in population to \nthis Earth. Yet, farmers are told that the food they\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\nproduce has no value. The market system says it has no value. That is \nnot logical. Over half of the people on this Earth go to bed with an \nache in their belly because they don't have enough to eat.\n  I have mentioned time and again--and I will do it again--that in \nSudan people talk about old women climbing trees to gather leaves to \neat because there is nothing to eat. Ask yourselves about the people in \nrefugee camps today and what their needs are. It is food. Somehow this \nsystem of ours, in a Byzantine way, says that those who produce the \nfood ought not to get full value for it, but those who make it into \ncereal, those who haul it, those who add value somehow should achieve \nrecord profits. There is something wrong with that system.\n  I hope this Senate will go on record saying that we need to do more \nand better. My personal feeling is that we need to take the caps off \nthe loan rates. The farm bill--which I didn't vote for because I didn't \nthink it was a good bill--was saying we will take away with the fine \nprint what we promised to give you in the large print. We promised a \nloan rate, and we promised that that loan rate would produce $3.25 in \nwheat, but in the small print it was limited to about $2.58.\n  Let's take away that provision that limits the amount of support and \nhelp farmers during this period of collapsed prices and see if we can \ngive them the opportunity to have a decent income when prices collapse. \nIf we don't build a bridge across those valleys, nobody will do it. We \nwill be left with a country full of giant agrifactories farming from \nCalifornia to Maine. We will get the food all right, but it will be \nmore expensive, and nobody will be living in rural America. We will \nhave lost something very important--family farmers, small towns, main \nstreet businesses, and a very special and unique part of this country's \ncharacter that comes from that part of America.\n  So I am offering this motion to instruct conferees to ask that money \nbe added above the Senate level for income support for family farmers.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I greatly appreciate the kind \nremarks of my good friend, and I say to him that on some of the issues \nhe cares about, such as agriculture and the problems of the family \nfarm, he has as much tenacity as anybody around here. I compliment him \nfor that.\n  We are going to accept his motion because it says we ought to try to \ndo better in conference than we did here, and everybody understands \nthat we will do that. If the Senate accepts this, we will try to do \nthat. However, in defense of the budget resolution, I will make two big \npoints that are very important.\n  The budget resolution increased the mandatory spending, the spending \nfor agriculture, $6 billion over what it would have been but for the \nchange we have made--$2 billion in each year, more or less, in this \nbudget resolution.\n  At first we decided we would do $4 billion at the behest of some \nSenators from the middle of the heartland of the agriculture country. \nThey asked for more. We put $2 billion more in. That has been done. Why \ndo I say that? Because the President of the United States, who has his \nagriculture Secretary traveling all over the United States in \nagriculture country talking about the needs of the family farm and the \nneeds of the farmers, did not put one penny of increase for agriculture \nin their budget. I don't know whether they expected that we would come \nalong because we have Senators who really pushed this and we would put \nthe money in.\n  But I believe for a President of the United States in the midst of an \nagriculture disaster, more or less, to leave it up to Senators to have \nto put more money in for agriculture--but you can count on it. They \nwon't be remiss in going out there and talking to the farmer about what \nthey did. They should put up their hand, like this, and say they did \nzero. At least we put $6 billion new money in for which the \ndistinguished Senator has thanked the Budget Committee when we put it \nin. And so did his colleague from his State. He thanked the committee. \nYou put in $6 billion. Nobody did at the White House. There was \nnothing.\n  So it isn't as if we are not concerned and as if we did nothing. As a \nmatter of fact, we have been spending a very healthy amount of money \nfor agriculture. And we are going through some cyclical problems in \nagriculture, with parts of the worldwide economy not in very good \nshape. And they used to buy a lot of our agricultural products. We know \nthat. We are getting better at producing more with less acreage, and \nthere seems to be no limit to that. We get better all the time. In \nother words, the farmer is producing prolifically in the United States, \nbe it the family farmer or the corporate farm. We are producing large \namounts.\n  Having said that, I don't know ultimately how we resolve this issue, \nbut for now we are going to conference with this proposal saying we \nought to do more, if we can. And, frankly, I appreciate the Senator \nbringing it to all our attention.\n  It will be accepted now, if he doesn't mind.\n  I yield any time I have.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Conrad, wanted to \nspeak for at least 5 minutes. I understand he is on his way. I hope we \ncan wait for just a moment. It appears he could use the remaining 5 \nminutes of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that I be vested back with any \ntime that I had remaining. I thought we would finish. That is why I \nyielded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me take a minute to say that I \nunderstand the point the Senator from New Mexico made. I appreciate the \nadditional $6 billion that was added over the 5 years. My point is, it \nis far short of what we need in terms of income support. It is the case \nthat the administration budget did not do nearly what it needed to do. \nBut there comes a time at some point when the urgency of the situation \nin rural America really requires us to say this isn't about us or them \nanymore; it is about what we are going to do together to respond to a \nreal problem of significant consequence to this country. We will simply \nnot have family farmers left unless we together, Republicans and \nDemocrats in Congress, recognize that we have a farm bill that says \nwhen market prices collapse, it's response is too bad. That can't be \nthe farm bill response.\n  When market prices collapse, if we want to save family farmers, we \nhave to build a bridge across those valleys. Only the largest corporate \nfarms will survive a collapse in market prices. They are big enough and \nstrong enough to survive. Family farmers can't and won't. So if we care \nabout having people live out on the land, if we care about the special \nquality family farms and small towns give this country, then we must \nreconnect and provide some kind of basic safety net for family farmers.\n  Again, I see all these headlines about prairie dogs. They are going \nto save the prairie dog. God bless the prairie dog. There sure are \nplenty of them in my State. We don't need a special effort to save \nprairie dogs. We need to save family farmers. That is the message, and \nthat is the urgency, in my judgment, for a public policy debate here in \nCongress and the establishment of the correct priorities in this budget \nto say to family farmers, ``You matter.'' Some say we need a national \nmissile defense system. Yes, that might be the priority for some. But I \nhappen to think we need a farm program that works for family farmers. \nIn the absence of it, we are going to see wholesale bankruptcies and \nmore and more auction sales, and this country will have lost something \nthat is very important to its character and its economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me say to the Senators who are not \nhere but are listening to what is going to be going on on the floor, \nthat in about 6 or 7 minutes, I hope not much longer than that, we are \ngoing to start voting. There is already a consent agreement to vote on \neverything. All votes are stacked this afternoon. That means we will \nhave about five or six votes. After the first one, they will be 10 \nminutes, with both sides having 2 minutes to explain each proposal, and \non each instruction 1 minute on the side. So we ought to be starting by \n4:15, and perhaps in an hour we will be finished.\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Dorgan, for \noffering this motion, and for bringing to the attention of our \ncolleagues in the Senate the disastrous circumstances we face in \nAmerican agriculture.\n  I represent North Dakota. I can tell you that in agriculture in our \nState we are on the brink of a depression. We are the victims of a \ntriple whammy of bad prices, bad weather, and bad policy. Bad prices \nare the lowest prices for farm commodities in 52 years. The bad policy \nis the last farm bill that was passed, and some of our trade policy \nthat has left America vulnerable to a very intense effort by our \ncompetitors. Mr. President, our chief competitors--the Europeans--are \nspending 10 times as much to support their farmers as we are spending \nto support ours. We are, in essence, saying to our farmers, you go out \nand compete against the French farmer and the German farmer, and, while \nyou are at it, take on the French Government and the German Government \nas well. That is not a fair fight.\n  In addition to the bad prices and the bad policy, we are also stuck \nwith bad weather. We have had 5 years of overly wet conditions in North \nDakota. The result has been the development of a disease called scab. \nThat is a fungus. It has dramatically reduced production. There are \nparts of North Dakota that saw their production reduced 40 percent.\n  So you put all of this together, what do you have? You have an \neconomic calamity, a disaster of its own, with the lowest prices in 52 \nyears and production reduced because of bad weather, and because of an \noutbreak of disease that is unprecedented in this century, and couple \nthat with the bad policy of a bad farm bill that has been put in place \nthat makes no note of what happens to farm prices but that cuts each \nand every year the support that is given to American agricultural \nproducers at the exact time our competitors are dramatically increasing \nwhat they are doing for their producers.\n  Mr. President, Members of the Senate, this is an emergency. It is a \ndisaster. It is stunning in its proportion. I just completed a series \nof meetings across the State of North Dakota. Everywhere I went, \nproducers took me aside and said unless something is done and done \nquickly, we are faced with a calamity of losing tens of thousands of \nfamily farmers across the heartland of America.\n  I hope very much that our colleagues will support this motion that \ninstructs the conferees to provide additional funding for agricultural \npolicy reform. It is critically needed. It must be done. The \nconsequences could not be more serious. A failure to act will lead to \nthe unraveling of the farm safety net in this country and will mean we \nwill lose literally tens of thousands of farm families this year. We \nare not talking about sometime in the distant future. We are talking \nabout right now. We are talking about an economic calamity.\n  Again, I hope my colleagues will support this motion. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't believe I need to respond. I gave my response \nto the principal sponsor. We have agreed to accept the instruction.\n  I yield back any time I might have and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, perhaps we could engage in a \nparliamentary discussion regarding order. If I am correct, the first \nvote would be on the Lautenberg Social Security motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is 1 minute on each side to discuss the motion.\n  The second vote will be on the Domenici motion. We will explain that \nwhen the time comes. Then we will vote on the Kennedy Medicare tax \nbreaks motion. Then we will vote on the motion of Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for all Senators who might be listening, \nthe first motion to instruct is Senator Lautenberg's on Social \nSecurity. This is essentially consistent with the budget resolution \nthat we voted for on our side of the aisle. I ask every Senator to vote \nfor it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Lautenberg Motion to Instruct\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 1 minute and the Senator from New \nJersey has 1 minute. Have the yeas and nays been requested?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senators should be on notice we will start this vote in \n2 minutes.\n  This motion to instruct says to the conferees, adopt the language \nregarding the Social Security trust fund that is in the budget \nresolution which passed the Senate with every Republican and one \nDemocrat supporting it. Since it is consistent with the budget \nresolution, and I still have to go to conference with the House under \nall circumstances, I recommend on our side, at least, that everybody \nvote for it.\n  I yield back any time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this motion is pretty simple. It \ninstructs the conferees on the budget resolution to include in the \nconference report provisions that would reserve all Social Security \nsurpluses for Social Security, and only Social Security--no other \nprograms, including other retirement programs, and not for tax cuts.\n  I hope when the conference is held that the distinguished chairman of \nthe Senate Budget Committee will be there to say, ``Here is a vote that \nis potentially 100-0 or 95-5. This is serious.''\n  It is not part of a scheme to go into conference and say, ``Sorry, we \nare dropping it.'' We don't want it dropped. I know that the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee doesn't really want it \ndropped.\n  We can differ about the approach, but all of us will make a single \nstatement: If Social Security has a surplus, we want it there for the \npeople who are going to retire when their time comes. It is as simple \nas that.\n  I am pleased to have the support of the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, if you would get everyone's attention, I \nwill tell everybody where we are going.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have three remaining votes. There is 1 minute in \nbetween each one. Then we are finished.\n  I say while many of the Senators are here, I am sorry that we have to \nvote over again on the same issues we voted on 2 weeks ago, but \nessentially most of the motions are revoting on what we already voted \non. Had we appointed conferees the very night we did this budget \nresolution, there would not have been any time to have motions to \ninstruct the conferees. So I am trying to hurry through, but I cannot \ndo any better.\n\n\n                  Vote On Domenici Motion To Instruct\n\n  What is up now is the Domenici motion to instruct.

Mr. President, can we have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order. Will those having \nconversations in the well cease their conversations. We are not going \nto be able to proceed until the conversations cease or those having \nthem go somewhere else.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just finish quickly.\n  The Domenici instruction takes into consideration the Breaux-Thomas \nbipartisan plan which includes prescription drugs as part of the \nreform. And this instruction includes that we adopt the Snowe-Wyden \nprovision which allows budget surpluses not currently allocated to the \nSocial Security trust fund, because it is not needed there for taxes, \nthat those surpluses may be used for major Medicare reform.\n  I hope we will adopt this motion. It will be followed by a Kennedy \nmotion that I will speak to later.\n  I yield back any time I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, as we could expect, explained \ncorrectly what this motion effectively does. If you vote in favor of \nthe motion, effectively you are saying you are not going to use any of \nthe surpluses of the Federal budget for the Medicare system, No. 1, \nbecause that is the recommendation of the Commission. And secondly, \nbefore we get overly excited about a reserve fund on the prescription \ndrugs, just read page 90 of the report and you will see that the trust \nfund is not utilized until there is significant extension of solvency \nfor Social Security. That is defined as 9 or 12 years. That comes to \neither premium increases or cost benefits of some $686 billion. So it \nis never going to go into effect.\n  I am all for having an existing fund. But this isn't it. It is right \nhere on page 90, the requirements for the fund.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. And it says it will not go into effect unless there is \nsignificant solvency from 9 to 12 years. That is what the trustees say, \n$686 billion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are now 2 minutes evenly divided \non the Kennedy motion to instruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this motion is very simple. It says to \ndevote a portion of the surplus--not all of it, just some of it--to \nsaving Medicare before using it for a tax cut or new spending. This \npolicy is supported by Alan Greenspan and by 100 leading economists \nbecause it makes economic sense and because it makes sense for \nMedicare.\n  My friend across the aisle has talked at length about how much he and \nhis party care about Medicare, but that budget resolution does not \ndevote one thin dime of new resources to Medicare beyond those required \nby law. This vote is a test: Tax cuts versus Medicare. That is the \nissue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate rejected an amendment on this \nby a vote of 56-43 just a few days ago. It is the identical issue.\n  Senator Kennedy would have us believe that the President's approach \nto putting 15 percent of the surplus into IOUs in the Medicare trust \nfund will help Medicare become solvent. He also suggests, Mr. \nPresident, that leading economists support the President's IOU; that \nis, we will pay for it later. They support that. They support it \nbecause we are not spending the money. But we already save $400 billion \nmore than the President and we would apply it to the national debt, \nwhich is what the economists thought was good. Our budget is better \nthan this in that regard and it does not put IOUs into a fund, which in \nthis case is a postdated check that somebody will pay for later on--our \nkids and grandkids.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the IOU is a payroll tax. This is the \nfull faith and credit of the United States. That is what we are talking \nabout. It is\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\nvery clear what this issue is. Let's make sure we have solvency in the \nMedicare system before tax cuts.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to table the Kennedy motion, and \nI ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague from Vermont, \nmyself and many others who supported this 2 weeks by a vote of 57-40 I \nwant to express my gratitude to my Republican colleagues for supporting \nthat amendment that day. Unfortunately, the House conferees, or \npotential conferees, have indicated they intend to drop this amendment \nwhich would add over 5 years $5 billion to the existing child care and \ndevelopment block grant, despite the fact that this was a bipartisan \namendment supported by a bipartisan coalition of Members here in the \nSenate.\n  I would not be asking for this vote except I think it is important we \nsend a clear message out of this Chamber that we care about working \nfamilies who need child care assistance.\n  With the few seconds remaining, I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on this side of the \naisle to vote in favor of this motion. It will keep the issue alive.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senate voted by a vote of 57 to 40 \nto approve this amendment when we had the budget resolution. We are \ngoing to go to conference and try to work it out. I am not asking \nanyone to vote against it. In terms of the chairman's position, vote \nhowever you wish.

Mr. President, I rise today to vehemently oppose \nsending American ground forces into Kosovo and to demand that if the \nPresident contemplates sending in ground troops, that decision be \ndeliberated and authorized by the Congress of the United States.\n  I am an American of Serbian-Slovenian ancestry. My father's family is \nfrom southern Croatia, which is known as Krijna, and my mother's family \nis from Ljubljana and Stranje in Slovenia.\n  I want to make it clear--I don't oppose sending ground troops into \nKosovo because I am Serbian. I oppose it because it is bad policy. \nHowever, my ethnic heritage does give me a special insight into the \nsituation that someone else might not have.\n  I have always opposed the leadership of Slobodan Milosevic. Like most \nAmericans, I consider him to be a war criminal.\n  However, Mr. President, I was 1 of 41 Senators who voted against the \nbombing because I was concerned that this bombing would not achieve our \nend of bringing Slobodan Milosevic to the negotiating table as \ncontemplated by the Clinton Administration and NATO.\n  These negotiations were designed to get Milosevic to sign the \nRambouillet agreement or something very similar, thereby guaranteeing \nthe basic human\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\nrights of the Albanian Kosovars and avoiding ethnic cleansing.\n  I also feared the bombing would only solidify Milosevic's leadership \nwith the Serbian people and ruin any chance of cultivating alternative \nleadership within Serbia.\n  I have to say that our problem has not been with the Serbian people, \nbut with their ruthless leader.\n  The main thing this bombing campaign has managed to do is fan the \nflames of centuries-old Serbian nationalism. Individuals who until the \nbombing campaign had little support for Milosevic and his activities in \nKosovo, now firmly believe their national pride is at stake. They have \nthrown their support behind Milosevic and have expressed a willingness \nto follow his leadership and fight for their country.\n  It is extremely important to remember--this is very important--Kosovo \nis to the Serbian people what Jerusalem is to Jews, Christians and \nMuslims. To the Serbians, it is a holy place. It is the scene of the \nmost important event in Serbian history--the battle of Kosovo in 1389 \nbetween the Turks and the Serbs, led by Tsar Lazar.\n  The battle of Kosovo has lived for centuries in Serbian literature. \nTo this day, Serbian children sing songs and read epic poems \ncelebrating this event.\n  The interesting thing about the battle of Kosovo is how outnumbered \nthe Serbian people were--and they knew it. And even though they lost, \nit is considered a glorious defeat because they fought valiantly \nagainst overwhelming odds. To quote from the epic poem ``The Battle of \nKosovo'':\n\n       Then the Turks overwhelmed Lazar, And the Tsar, Lazar, was \n     destroyed, With him was destroyed his army of seven and \n     seventy thousand soldiers. All was holy, all was honorable \n     and the goodness of God was fulfilled.\n\n  History, pride and heritage are deeply-seeded in Serb culture. That's \nwhy it is significant that Milosevic started his rise to political \npower in Kosovo and probably the most important event in his political \ncareer was when he spoke to 1 million citizens on the 600th Anniversary \nof the Battle of Kosovo--at the very site of the battle! I want you to \nalso know, Mr. President, the most sacred Serbian Orthodox monasteries \nare located in Kosovo.\n  Considering Serbian history, and where Milosevic started his career, \nAmerican and NATO leaders should have known that Milosevic couldn't \ngive in without losing face. Especially when he was told ``either sign \nthis or we'll bomb you''. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration \npresented Milosevic with an ultimatum which foreclosed all other \noptions that could have led to a negotiated settlement.\n  Our bombing campaign has given Milosevic cover to move forward \nexpeditiously with his policy of ethnic cleansing--precisely what we \nwere trying to avoid in the first place. Now, because he and his forces \nare not being tightly monitored--and that's because all the observers \nwere kicked out as soon as the bombing started--they can do as they \nwish. Therefore, we hear evidence of massacres and rape, and we have \nwitnessed the forced relocation of hundreds of thousands of people and \nthe total devastation of Kosovo.\n  To me there is no question that the decision to bomb Kosovo and \nSerbia was a terrible mistake in the first place, but now we face three \nbad choices--stop the bombing, continue the bombing, or go in with \nbombing and ground troops.\n  Although I disagreed with bombing in the first place, of the three, I \nbelieve the least objectionable is to continue the bombing campaign in \nhopes of securing the very negotiated settlement that has eluded us so \nfar.\n  Many public officials and foreign policy experts are loudly \nadvocating the introduction of ground troops to Kosovo in an effort to \nforce Milosevic to yield his grip on the Kosovar Albanians and to \nultimately ``win the war''. They claim it's the only way.\n  Let me say that I support the goal of restoring peace and stability \nto the region, returning to Kosovo those refugees that want to go back, \nnegotiating a new agreement that will guarantee their safety and self-\ndetermination and establishing a multinational force to monitor the \nnegotiated settlement. I support all this--but I absolutely oppose the \nuse of American ground troops to implement this goal.\n  I oppose using American troops in this manner not because I don't \nthink they can get the job done. Far from it. I believe our armed \nforces have performed magnificently, and I wholeheartedly admire the \neffort that each of them has been giving during the campaign in Kosovo. \nThey are doing the job we have asked them to do.\n  However, I see a situation developing in the Balkans that could be \njust as brutal as that which developed in Vietnam. As opposed to the \nflat deserts of the Persian Gulf area, the Balkans are a very \nmountainous region that is ideal for a sustained campaign of guerrilla \nwarfare.\n  A smaller, and less well-armed force could have the ability to use \nthis natural terrain to impede the progress and mobility of a NATO \ninvasion force for an extended period of time while racking up vast \nnumbers of casualties.\n  Remember that in World War II, more than 500,000 Nazi soldiers \nthought that they could just roll through Yugoslavia. They did not, due \nin large part, to the determination of the Serbian people.\n  It has been reported that it will take 6 to 8 weeks to even prepare \nfor a ground invasion. And I believe it will probably take even more \nthan that because we don't even have the troops in the region, we \nhaven't even mobilized and we haven't established a staging area.\n  This will give the Serbs ample time to disperse, fortify defensive \nworks, stockpile their arms, and so on. The steps the Serbs take now \nwill allow them to later harass the invasion force at every conceivable \nopportunity. It will make it that much more difficult for NATO to \nsecure a victory without incurring heavy losses.\n  The most important thing I think the American people should know--if \nwe put ground forces in Kosovo, we will go to war with Serbia. Period.\n  We will have to accept the fact that we will be at war, and that we \nwill have to take out Milosevic. And that means a long, extended war \nwith loss of life and a total destruction of the infrastructure in \nSerbia, in Kosovo, and what about Montenegro?\n  And another thing--we have to be seriously concerned about igniting \nthe entire southeast Europe region with our actions. What will the \nneighboring nations do? What will Russia do? Will NATO's action perhaps \ncause the radical elements in Russia to come into power?\n  These are serious questions that may not be of concern now, but the \nconsequences of our actions today may come back to haunt us tomorrow.\n  We must remember--our goal is to bring peace and stability to this \nregion. I am concerned that the introduction of ground troops may have \njust the opposite effect and destabilize the region over the long term.\n  And what happens after we win that war? And it will be won, although \nat a high cost in terms of lives and infrastructure. What will happen? \nWhat will be the disposition of the Kosovar Albanians, hundreds of \nthousands of whom are now refugees? Are we going to have a greater \nAlbania?\n  Who will monitor the ``peace'' and who will pay for the rebuilding of \nthe infrastructure in Serbia and Kosovo? What kind of commitment will \nNATO have to ``Pick up the pieces'' and rebuild Serbia? Will it fall on \nthe United States?\n  Make no mistake: the introduction of ground troops guarantees that we \nas a nation are committing to be involved for an extended period of \ntime and the expenditure of many billions of dollars. In order to \ncompare, my colleagues should remember that we have already spent--we \nhave already spent--over $12 billion in Bosnia.\n  I can't help but feel touched at times like these, in the face of \nsituations of national importance, to contemplate the times that I have \nvisited the Vietnam Memorial. All of us who have done that cannot help \nbut be moved. And I know on my part, tears always well up in my eyes.\n  Seeing the names carved on that wall, knowing that each name \nrepresents an individual who had loved ones and friends and had hopes, \ndreams and aspirations, is a poignant reminder of what it means to send \nyoung men and women into harm's way.\n  But let me just say that while I disagreed with the policy pursued to \nstop the humanitarian abuses in Kosovo, those abuses cannot be \noverlooked by the international community. You just\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\ncan't turn your head and forget about it. This morning, I participated \nin a commemoration of the Holocaust here in our Nation's Capitol. Let \nus remember so that we never forget.\n  I believe that in addition to pursuing our strategic interests and \nour trade interests, we must not forget that our status as a world \npower gives us a moral responsibility to defend human rights. I call \nupon my colleagues and all Americans to work toward a consensus on how \nwe as a nation respond to acts of genocide internationally.\n  Looking away in Croatia was a failure when 250,000 Serbs were driven \nout. As President Clinton acknowledged, looking away in Rwanda was a \nmistake where almost a million people were killed between the Tutsi's \nand the Hutu's. And what about the Kurds in Iraq and Turkey, and all \nthe other areas of the world where such troubles exist? We have it in \nmany, many places in the world.\n  Thus far, full engagement through bombing has been a failure in \nKosovo. Our moral responsibility is to identify the means and the goals \navailable to us to deal with such incidents before they escalate beyond \npeaceful resolution. We would be well-served--we would be well-served--\nto have a coherent policy to guide us in the future as to when we go in \nand when we do not go in.\n  Mr. President, what this country does in the name of NATO over the \nnext several weeks in regard to Serbia and Kosovo will have a dramatic \nimpact on this country's future. It is our obligation to the American \npeople to exercise our due diligence before we commit to a course of \naction from which we cannot extricate ourselves. This is very, very \nserious business that we are now considering.\n  We should pray to the Holy Spirit for the enlightenment to make the \nright decision for our country, for southeast Europe, and for the \nworld. Let us be constantly reminded of Jesus's exhortation on the \nSermon on the Mount that ``blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall \nbe called the children of God.''\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3630-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE MILLENNIUM DIGITAL COMMERCE ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to recognize the efforts of Senator \nAbraham who authored and spearheaded the effort to pass the Government \nPaperwork Elimination Act during the 105th Congress.\n  This good government measure, which the President signed into law \nlast year, requires federal agencies to automate their forms and allows \ncomputer users to complete, electronically sign, and submit government \nforms online.\n  Aside from saving thousands of square feet of storage space, this \nlandmark legislation will significantly reduce the amount of time it \ntakes Americans to complete government paperwork. The millions of hours \nfreed up translates into billions of dollars saved over time. This \nlegislation, which was supported by the Administration, will also help \nthe federal government transition to a paperless document management \nsystem. One that allows agencies to collect and maintain forms and \nother records faster, easier, and cheaper.\n  Mr. President, Senator Abraham, my friend and colleague, has once \nagain demonstrated his leadership on electronic commerce issues by \nrecently introducing the Millennium Digital Commerce Act. This \nbipartisan measure, which I cosponsored, is a direct outgrowth of and a \nnatural extension to the Government Paperwork Elimination Act. It \nprovides a national framework for online business to business \ntransactions. This important interstate commerce measure provides legal \nstanding for electronic signatures on contracts and other business \ntransactions without preempting state law on intrastate commerce.\n  Electronic signatures are the equivalent of an online ``royal seal.'' \nElectronic signatures are highly controlled and are far more secure \nthan manual signatures. As my colleagues are aware, it is not difficult \nto mimic someone's handwritten ``John Hancock.'' An electronic \nsignature, however, is verifiable and it becomes invalid if any of the \ndata in the electronic document is altered or eliminated. This \nrevolutionary communication tool can also time and date stamp someone's \nunique electronic signature. It is an emerging technology that will \nserve as a springboard for electronic commerce.\n  Over the last few years, states have recognized the importance of \nauthentication technology on trade and have already adopted rules \ngoverning its use. However, of the more than forty states that now have \nlaws on the books, none has adopted the same approach. Congress should \nnot allow an electronic signature hodgepodge to thwart the exponential \ngrowth occurring in electronic commerce.\n  In our fast-paced global and highly technical environment, where time \nis money, companies transacting business across state lines need \nassurance that electronically signed documents are fully and legally \nexecutable. Senator Abraham's Millennium Digital Commerce Act will \nensure that businesses located in different states are held to their \nagreements and obligations even if their respective states have \ndifferent rules and approaches concerning electronically signed \ndocuments.\n  This much needed and timely legislation is a necessary precursor to \nstate-by-state adoption of the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act \n(UETA). Once UETA is finalized, its enactment by all fifty states is \nnot expected to occur for several years.\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is an important interim step \ntowards eventual national uniformity. It merely establishes the legal \ncertainty of electronic signatures when used for interstate business \ntransactions. It strikes a necessary balance between a state's \nindividual interests and the need for reciprocity among and between \nstates. It fosters the expansion of trade on a state-wide, national, \nand international basis while promoting continued innovation.\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act is technology neutral and allows \nbusinesses to determine the methods they want to utilize for executing \nan online transaction. This legislation also establishes guiding \nprinciples for the use of electronic signatures for international \ntransactions. A framework based on open, non-discriminatory standards. \nLastly, Senator Abraham's bill requires federal agencies to identify \nrules or regulations that impede electronic commerce and \nrecommendations for improvements.\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot lag behind our industrial \ntrading partners. Already, the United Kingdom has called for the legal \nrecognition of electronic signatures.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Abraham and Chairman McCain as \nthe Commerce Committee gives prompt consideration to this important \npro-technology, pro-electronic commerce legislation.\n  The Millennium Digital Commerce Act will help move our nation's \neconomy forward into the 21st Century. I hope the rest of my colleagues \nwill support this responsible measure which will benefit both American \nconsumers and American businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3630-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3630-S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, while the Senate was in recess for the \nEaster/Spring break, a member of the Senate family ended his Senate \ncareer. Ron Kavulick, the Chief Reporter of Debates, retired.\n  As a matter of fact, Ron was to have ended his Senate career at the \nclose of the 105th Congress, but remained in his position as the Senate \nconducted the impeachment trial of the President. Ron's expertise and \ndedication to detail were needed throughout the tedious proceedings of \nthe trial.\n  Ron became an Official Reporter of Senate Debates in 1979 and served \nably in that capacity until he was elevated to the position of Chief \nReporter in 1995.\n  Ron has a very impressive reporting background. He was an official \ncourt reporter in the Air Force's JAG office. While employed with \nAlderson Reporting Company, Ron had the opportunity to work at the \nWhite House. Ron traveled extensively both with President Johnson and \nPresident Nixon.\n  Ron spent many hours and many nights working in the West Wing of the \nWhite House providing official White House transcripts of state \ndinners, press conferences and news briefings. Certainly Ron's \nexperiences at the White House were helpful as he endured many a late \nnight in the Senate.\n  My staff and I personally cannot thank Ron enough for his service. \nSince my arrival at the Senate in 1987, I have relied on Ron's \ninstitutional memory and unfailing kindness. He has always been \navailable, day or night, for any help that my staff or I needed. It \nwould be impossible for me to count the times that Ron and his very \nable staff have assisted us. Having said that, no one deserves a rest \nfrom the long, sometimes grueling hours of the Senate more than Ron \nKavulick. I can attest to the fact that he will be greatly missed here \nin the Senate.\n  As Ron goes on to enjoy time with his wife, Pat, his children and \ngranddaughter, Allison, I thank him for his diligence and perseverance \nin his service to his country and for his friendship to us here in the \nSenate. My staff joins me in wishing him all the best in the years to \ncome.\n  Ron, good luck and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3631-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ISABEL ``BELLA'' ROMERO\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President. I would like to take this opportunity to \nrecognize a truly remarkable woman, Mrs. Isabel ``Bella'' Romero, of \nGreeley, Colorado. This gallant woman's life was prematurely cut short \nlast year after courageously fighting ovarian cancer for six years. \nBella's dedication to improving our world transcends her career as an \ninspirational middle school principal and educator and as a woman \ndevoted to her family. Her selfless pursuit of bringing out the best in \nall she came in contact with has made her passing that much greater. \nShe is fondly missed by her friends and family, but her legacy lives on \nthrough all those whose lives she touched.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Denver Post on this \nremarkable Coloradan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Mar. 25, 1999]\n\n         Bella Romero's Life Displayed The Eloquence of Action\n\n                           (By Tomas Romero)\n\n       ``In our world of big names, curiously, our heroes tend to \n     be anonymous.''--Historian Daniel J. Boorstin\n       Americans tend to compartmentalize their emotions too much: \n     Feeling patriotic on July 4, remembering the deceased on \n     Memorial Day and putting on a happy face for the holidays.\n       Hispanics, though, see tragedy and joy as part of an ever-\n     intertwined continuum--so why not acknowledge them \n     concurrently as we do with Los Dias de Los Muertos? Thus, \n     just before Christmas, I've chosen to write a belated tribute \n     to one of those anonymous heroes described by Boorstin. After \n     all, what time could be better to celebrate a woman who gave \n     so many gifts to so many people?\n       My friend Isabel ``Bella'' Romero of Greeley died this year \n     after an unbelievably valiant six-year battle fought against \n     a cruel, unforgiving foe--ovarian cancer.\n       Action is eloquence. And the eloquently lovely manner with \n     which Bella Romero conducted her life journey must be \n     remembered: an unmatchable, deliberately executed, constantly \n     positive pattern for living.\n       She was a loving wife to Ray, a loving mother to Denny, \n     Mark, Juan and Andrea, and a passionate advocate for every \n     school child in need of a good past. As a Longmont middle \n     school principal, Bella knew that a child without a good past \n     couldn't easily aspire to a better future.\n       Bella was not related to me by blood, but she was my sister \n     in spirit since we were kids together in Brighton. This \n     winsome girl was married and a mother by age 16. She worked \n     in a cannery to help Ray attend the then-Colorado State \n     College in Greeley. It was an experience filed with bare food \n     cupboards, living in dingy basements. Ray became a teacher/\n     university administrator and successful civic leader.\n       Then it was Bella's turn to bring dreams to fruition. \n     ``I've decided to go to college and become a teacher,'' she \n     announced. Armed with a GED, she began a daily round trip \n     from Brighton to Greeley. Family needs still came first. Only \n     when everyone was asleep would she sit at a kitchen table to \n     study. In three years, Bella received her diploma--with a \n     straight A average. Later she fulfilled another aspiration \n     and became a respected principal--one of the state's best. \n     Probably her greatest skill was being able to defeat an enemy \n     by making them a friend.\n       Then came sudden, unexpected pain and a doctor's diagnosis \n     of ovarian cancer. Bella's war had begun. With prayer, \n     traditional medicine, visualization, holistic health \n     tactics--and, yes even laughter--Bella beat back her vicious \n     enemy. Tauntingly, cancer would retreat and then return. \n     Bella wept when she was finally forced to give up her \n     position as principal. ```It was six years of increasingly \n     difficult anguish for us and pain for her,'' husband Ray \n     says.\n       ``Death be not proud,'' I said in a eulogy. ``Bella's \n     intent was never to defeat death--no one does--it was to win \n     at life.'' Through study and reflection, Ray believes, Bella \n     found a spiritually higher level--a place beyond pain's \n     reach.\n       She endured beyond our comprehension to understand why she \n     simply didn't just let go. Never did she relinquish personal \n     power or allow physical frailties to become spirit-dominating \n     indignities. University of Northern Colorado President Howard \n     Skinner gladly came to her home when asked to join forces for \n     worthwhile programs. Bella wanted to leave Earth on her \n     terms--``thoroughly used up,'' as George Bernard Shaw wrote \n     in a poem.\n       Every grandchild of Bella's received a personal videotaped \n     message. So, too, were family members counseled, parents \n     called from a hospital bed and told goodbye. When visitors \n     came to her, she found strength to console us and offer \n     advice. When we'd been prepared to get on with our lives \n     without her, she left us.\n       It's been six months since Bella died, and sister Anna Lee \n     still mourns for a best friend.\n       Bella was Cathy Gleesing's mentor and school principal. \n     Cathy became a valued friend and was always there to offer \n     love and support in time of trying need. Bella ``led with \n     elegance, grace and style,'' Cathy says. ```I wish for Bella \n     when I strive to be excellent in my work, mood and \n     relationships.''\n       In other words, always.\n       Ray lost a beloved companion, one who at day's end every \n     day for 40 years would join her partner to talk and reinforce \n     familia and values.\n       We have all lost, and during this holiday season we need to \n     learn from her gift.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3631-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3631-S3632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THANKING KIM KOIVISTO FOR A JOB WELL DONE\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Today marks the final day of work in the \nSenate for Kim Koivisto, the associate director to the Democratic \nSteering and Coordination Committee. I didn't want the day to pass \nwithout taking a moment to thank Kim for a job well done.\n  The Democratic Steering and Coordination Committee is the liaison \noffice between Senate Democrats and a good portion of the rest of the \ncountry, including representatives of state, county and local \ngovernments and people from every imaginable interest group. The \ncommittee is an important part of our caucus's efforts to talk with and \nlisten to Americans from varying perspectives.\n  Kim has worked as associate director of the committee for the past \ntwo years. During that time, she has consistently demonstrated the \nhighest level of commitment, professionalism and creativity. She has \nworked most intensively on women's, Hispanic and labor issues.\n  One highlight of Kim's tenure is the creation of a new outreach \nprogram to strengthen relations between our caucus and national \nHispanic organizations, Latino elected officials and the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus. She also used her fluency in Spanish to translated \nmaterials into Spanish, and to organize Spanish-language press \nconferences for Senate and House Democrats.\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\n  Kim has also worked closely with labor organizations and women's \ngroups to advance causes that are important to American families--and \nto Kim personally. Issues she worked especially hard on include closing \nthe pay gap between men and women, raising the minimum wage, and \nstrengthening the federal commitment to breast cancer research. Kim was \nalso active in the fight to retain the Federal Disadvantaged Business \nEnterprise Program last year as part of TEA-21, the new Federal highway \nbill.\n  Kim's immediate plans include traveling through Indonesia. She will \nattend the Graduate School for Counseling at the University of Maryland \nin the fall.\n  On behalf of all Senate Democrats, I'd like to thank Kim for her hard \nwork, and wish her the best of luck in her travel and studies.

Mr. President, before the Senate adjourned for the \nEaster recess, my State of Mississippi suffered the loss of one of its \nfinest citizens, Richard Baxter Wilson, who died on Monday, March 15. \nHe was a national leader in the electric power industry. He served as a \nmember of the board of directors of Middle South Utilities, Inc., the \nEdison Electric Institute, and the National Association of Electric \nCompanies.\n  In addition to serving as president and chairman of the board of \nMississippi Power & Light Company, he was also a member of many other \ncorporate, charitable, civic, and educational institution boards.\n  He was a personal friend of mine whose advice and counsel I \nappreciated and relied upon, to my great benefit. His two children, \nRichard B. Wilson, Jr. and Miriam Weems, are two of my closest and \ndearest friends. And I extend to them, and all the members of the \nfamily, my sincerest condolences.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary that appeared in The \nClarion-Ledger of Jackson, MS, of March 16 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Clarion-Ledger, Mar. 16, 1999]\n\n              Richard Baxter Wilson, Ex-Company President\n\n       Madison--Richard Baxter Wilson, 93, a former president of \n     Mississippi Power & Light, died of heart failure Monday at \n     his home.\n       Services are 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at First Presbyterian \n     Church of Jackson.

Mr. President, today one of my State's most famous \ncitizens of all time celebrates her 90th birthday. Eudora Welty is \nknown around the world as a writer of enormous talent and \naccomplishment. She has lived for most of her life in Jackson, MS, and \nshe enjoys a level of popularity in our State that a politician can \nenvy but not match.\n  I invite the attention of all Senators to the May issue of Vanity \nFair which contains a toast to Eudora by my friend and fellow \nMississippian, Willie Morris.\n  In today's edition of the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, an article \ndescribes other activities that will be taking place in our State to \nhonor Miss Welty on her 90th birthday.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that newspaper article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Clarion-Ledger, April 13, 1999]\n\n  Morris' Tribute to Welty in `Vanity Fair'--Magazine Article Honors \n            Jackson Writer on 90th Birthday; Celebration Set\n\n                           (By Billy Watkins)\n\n       Eudora Welty, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author from \n     Jackson, turns 90 years old today.\n       To help commemorate the occasion, fellow Mississippi author \n     Willie Morris wrote a 4,000-word story about Welty for Vanity \n     Fair magazine's May issue, which is on newsstands now. Morris \n     calls it his ``toast to Eudora.''\n       ``And I all her Eudora because she's been my friend since I \n     was a little boy,'' Morris says. ``I very strongly support \n     the idea that she is the greatest living American writer. \n     She's full of wackiness and humor and loyalty to her friends. \n     She's just so generous. Always has been.''\n       Morris will participate in a tribute to Welty 5-7 p.m. \n     today at Lemuria Book Store in Jackson. Although Welty will \n     not be able to attend, Morris, along with Mississippi writer \n     Ellen Douglas, will be present at the celebration where two \n     new books will be unveiled.\n       University Press of Mississippi will release The First \n     Story, a limited edition reprint of Welty's first published \n     short story, Death of a Traveling Salesman. It includes an \n     essay by Welty looking back at that story. Only 500 \n     hardcovers have been printed. They sell for $75 each.\n       Hill Street Press of Athens, Ga., will debut Eudora Welty: \n     Writers' Reflections Upon First Reading Welty. It includes \n     essays by Morris, Douglas, Barry Hannah, Reynolds Price and \n     others.\n       John Evans, owner of Lemuria, says Welty books still sell \n     well.\n       ``We sell a lot to out-of-towners and people who just moved \n     here who know about Miss Welty,'' Evans says. ``And I keep \n     her work stocked. I feel like it's our duty that if somebody \n     asks for something by Miss Welty, we should have it.''\n       Morris' piece for Vanity Fair was originally 18,000 words \n     but had to be edited down. ``I was pleased with the way it \n     turned out,'' Morris says. ``I'll include the entire story in \n     my next book of essays, which will come out in about two \n     years.''\n       Morris contacted many notable writers--Shelby Foote and \n     William Styron among them--and included their views on Welty. \n     ``I sent out more than 30 letters to people who have known \n     her for years,'' Morris says, ``and I got 100 percent \n     response. I think that ways what people think of Eudora, the \n     fact that they took time to respond.\n       ``I really believe most people who love writing will read \n     this story--not because of me, but because of Eudora. She's \n     loved universally. And I was honored to write the story.''\n\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I just say to my colleague from Mississippi, I commend him \nfor\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nhis statement recognizing the contributions of Eudora Welty. This \nConnecticut Yankee loves her writing. And for my birthday present this \nyear I received a first edition copy of one of Eudora Welty's novels.\n  I prize and cherish her work. She is a Mississippi treasure, but she \nis also a treasure for this great country of ours. And I associate \nmyself with the remarks of my colleague from Mississippi and commend \nhim for recognizing this remarkable woman who has made such a rich \ncontribution to the literary heritage life of our Nation.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I thank the distinguished Senator very much for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3633-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3633-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered by \none of its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 15.

A bill to establish court-martial jurisdiction over civilians \nserving with the Armed Forces during contingency operations, and to \nestablish Federal jurisdiction over crimes committee outside the United \nStates by former members of the Armed Forces and civilians accompanying \nthe Armed Forces outside the United States; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n         military and extraterritorial jurisdiction act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Military and \nExtraterritorial Jurisdiction Act of 1999. This bill will close a legal \nloophole through which civilians who commit crimes while accompanying \nthe Armed Forces overseas evade punishment. Today, when a civilian \naccompanies the military outside the United States, whether a relative, \na dependent, or a civilian contractor--and there are many--the civilian \nis not subject to prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military \nJustice and does not fall under any of the general Federal criminal \nlaws.\n  These individuals can only be prosecuted for their crimes if the host \ncountry chooses to do so. However, there are many circumstances in \nwhich the host country does not choose to\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nprosecute. They just often do not have an interest in the case. \nAdditionally, in situations such as Somalia and Haiti, when our troops \nare rapidly deployed, typically no agreement exists governing how \ncivilians will be prosecuted until months into the operation. Indeed, \nmany times there are no laws in effect really in those countries. So we \nbelieve that something must be done in this regard.\n  There is a glaring deficiency here and it has come to my attention \nthrough a tragic incident. A U.S. Army dependent, not a soldier, living \non an Army base in Germany, sexually molested two dependent children. \nThe Army investigators found probable cause to believe that the sexual \nacts had occurred. However, under German law, no action could be taken \nagainst this juvenile.\n  Sometimes prosecutors are restricted by legal prohibitions, and \nsometimes they just have no interest in prosecuting a case involving \nAmericans.\n  As of March 31, 1996, there were more than 240,000 family dependents \nand 96,000 civilian employees overseas. These persons accompany our \ntroops to represent the United States, but many times they are in \neffect outside the law.\n  In addition to the sexual molestation incident that I have already \nmentioned, examples of crimes that have gone unpunished due do this \nloophole are rape, assault, battery, vandalism, and drug dealing. \nAlthough the offenders may receive some sort of administrative \npunishment, such as being barred from certain areas of the base or \nmonetary fines, these administrative noncriminal penalties are \ninadequate for the more serious violations.\n  Because the military continues to rely heavily on civilian assistance \nand support, the United States must develop an appropriate and \neffective criminal process to deal with the misbehavior of civilians. \nIt is important to the morale of our military forces that enlisted men \nand women working outside the United States along with civilian \npersonnel do not believe that civilians who may commit a crime against \nthem are beyond criminal prosecution.\n  This bill would extend the reach of title 18 of the United States \nCriminal Code to include those civilians that accompany the military \noutside the United States. When one of these civilians commits an \noffense that Congress has established as a maritime crime, the U.S. \nattorney's office would have the option to exercise jurisdiction and \nprosecute the offender in the United States. The bill would employ \ntitle 18, United States Code section 3238, which provides that an \naccused be tried in the U.S. district court where the offender first \nappears when he is brought back to the United States.\n\n  Finally, in order to prevent legal conflicts with a jurisdiction \nrecognized by the United States, this bill only applies if the host \ncountry has already prosecuted or is in the process of prosecuting the \naccused.\n  The need for this legislation was most recently described in a report \nsubmitted by the Overseas Jurisdiction Advisory Committee to the \nSecretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and to this Congress. This \npanel was established in section 1151 of the 1996 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  In the act, Congress recognized this jurisdictional loophole needed \nto be examined so it established this advisory committee to study the \nproblems of civilians who commit criminal acts when accompanying the \nArmed Forces overseas. This committee was composed of experts in \nmilitary and civilian law from all branches of the armed services, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the State Department. The advisory committee \nfound that this problem was serious enough that ``legislation is needed \nto address misconduct by civilians accompanying the forces overseas in \npeacetime settings.'' These experts believed that the jurisdictional \nvoid must be closed to ``maintain order and discipline.''\n  The American Government must have the authority to discipline people \nit sends overseas to represent and serve this country. It is \ninconsistent with the American system of justice that a civilian \nemployee working with service members and dependents of service members \nnot be subject to American criminal laws. This piece of legislation is \nan important step toward recognizing the changing nature of our Armed \nForces and making sure that the Criminal Code is keeping pace with the \nmilitary's changing dynamic.\n  As a former U.S. attorney for 12 years myself, and one who has met \nfrequently with victims, nothing can be more frustrating than to see a \nperson or a family victimized by some awful act and have to tell them: \nThere is no law that will vindicate you. Even though under various \nother circumstances it would be a plain crime, for some technical \nreason there is not a way to legally right this wrong.\n  So I believe this is an important bill. It closes a loophole \ninvolving more and more Americans each year. We simply do not need to \ncede away the authority to prosecute criminal acts to nations that may \nhave no interest whatsoever in vindicating the rights of an American \nservice man or woman who has been a victim of a crime.\n  I believe this is an important act. It has broad support, the support \nof the military and support of other officials of this Government. We \nthink it is a needed step and I commend it to my fellow Members of the \nSenate.\n  I also want to express my appreciation for an Alabama family whose \nchild was a victim of a crime, a sexual act, in a foreign country, who \nis here in this Capitol today, at the Senate today, and without whose \nsupport and encouragement this piece of legislation would not become \nlaw and would not have reached this point.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague, Senator \nSessions, to reintroduce legislation that would close the loopholes \nthat permit civilians accompanying the Armed Forces and those serving \nwith the Armed Forces from evading punishment for crimes they committed \nwhile abroad. Under current law, many illegal acts committed abroad by \ndependents, civilian employees, and those servicing with the Armed \nForces go substantially unaddressed by either military or civilian \ncourts. Administrative punishments have proven equally inadequate to \naddress this problem.\n  When civilians accompany the Armed Services outside the United \nStates, they are not subject to prosecution under Federal criminal law \nor the Uniform Code of Military Justice. This has proven to be a \ndouble-edged sword. While foreign nations frequently have no interest \nin vindicating crimes committed by American civilians against other \nAmericans, despite the extreme seriousness of the offense, there have \nbeen instances where the United States has had to turn over American \ncivilians to host countries for potentially harsh punishment because of \nthe absence of appropriate enforcement action. Unfortunately, this \nproblem is likely to worsen as there are a large number of dependents \noverseas, and the number of civilian employees of the Armed Services \noverseas is increasing. As for those serving with the Armed Forces, \ncriminal prosecutions by the military court or administrative \nalternatives sometimes simply discharge the individual and send them \nhome, rather than imposing any serious punishment for a crime.\n  The case that has united Senator Sessions and me behind this \nlegislation is that of an Ohio resident, Amy McGough, who was stationed \nin Germany, along with her husband who is from Alabama. Mrs. McGough's \n8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter were repeatedly raped and \nmolested by a neighbor boy who was supposed to be baby-sitting them. \nWhile the Criminal Investigations Division of the Army found sufficient \nfacts, neither the Army nor Federal prosecutors had jurisdiction to \nprosecute the case, and the German government would not intervene \nbecause of the age of the perpetrator.\n  In such cases, our bill would guarantee that civilians, or those \nserving with the Armed Forces in certain circumstances, who commit an \nillegal act punishable under the Federal law by more than a year's \nimprisonment, will be subject to the special maritime or territorial \njurisdiction of the United States for prosecution by a military court \nor for Federal criminal prosecution. Neither civilians connected with \nthe Armed Forces nor those serving with the Armed Forces abroad accused \nof rape, child molestation or some other serious felony will simply be \nallowed to resign or leave the foreign country to avoid punishment. \nThey will be subject to Federal prosecution.\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n  We need to make sure that an appropriate criminal process exists in \nthese circumstances. Letting these individuals back on America's \nstreets does little to hold them accountable, and nothing to protect \nour communities here at home. I appreciate the efforts of my colleague, \nSenator Sessions, who is also a member of the Armed Services Committee, \nin working with me to introduce this legislation to address our mutual \nconcern.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 769. A bill to provide a final settlement on certain debt owed by \nthe city of Dickinson, ND, for the construction of the bascule gates on \nthe Dickinson Dam; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         the dickinson dam bascule gates settlement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Dickinson \nDam Bascule Gates Settlement Act of 1999 and I am pleased that my \ncolleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is an original cosponsor \nof the bill. This legislation would permit the Secretary of the \nInterior to accept a one-time, lump-sum payment for the city of \nDickinson, ND, in lieu of the annual payments required under the city's \nexisting repayment contract for construction of the ``bascule gates'' \non the Dickinson Dam on the Heart River. This bill would resolve a \nlong-standing issue for the city of Dickinson and the Bureau of \nReclamation. The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act is nearly \nidentical to a bill I introduced last June, and it is my hope that the \nSenate will quickly consider and pass this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the history of the bascule gates is long and complex. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Dickinson Dam on the Heart \nRiver in 1949 and 1950 to supply water to the city of Dickinson, and \nfor flood control, recreation, and other purposes. The reservoir \ncreated by this dam was named Patterson Lake in about 1960.\n  The need for additional water supply for the city was identified in \nthe early 1970's, and the bascule gates were constructed in the early \n1980's, to provide additional water storage capacity in Lake Patterson. \nAt the time, the city expressed reservations over the cost of the \nbascule gates and the viability of the gates, since the city was not \naware of any other location in a northern climate in which the gates \nhad been tested or proven. In 1982, shortly after the gates were \noperational, a large ice block caused excessive pressure on the \nhydraulic system, causing it to fail. Construction modifications were \nmade to the gate hydraulic system and a de-icing system were added in \n1982, adding further costs to the project.\n  In 1991, the city began to receive its municipal water supply from \nthe Southwest Pipeline Project, a project constructed in part with \nfunds provided for North Dakota's statewide water project, the Garrison \nDiversion project, which is another Bureau of Reclamation project. The \nSouthwest Pipeline brings high-quality water from Lake Sakakawea on the \nMissouri River to the city of Dickinson and other communities in \nsouthwest North Dakota. The water is of much higher quality that the \nwater from the city's previous supply from Lake Patterson, and has \nhelped spur economic development in the region. While the citizens of \nthe area now benefit from a higher quality water supply, the city no \nlonger benefits from the additional water supply provided by the \nbascule gates. The result is the city is paying for two Bureau of \nReclamation projects, while it is using water from only one of those \nprojects for its municipal water supply. The city has repaid more than \n$1.2 million to the United States for the bascule gates, despite the \nfact that the gates now provide almost no direct benefit to the city.\n  The city has previously investigated alternatives to the current \nsituation. The city has discussed the option of assuming title to the \ndam and bascule gates, as well as attempting to negotiate a new \nagreement with the Bureau of Reclamation administratively. However, \nbecause the terms of the existing contract are outlined statutorily, \nnew legislation is required to make any changes to the current \nrepayment contract.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today would do three primary things. \nFirst, it would permit the Interior Secretary to accept a lump-sum \npayment of $300,000 from the city and terminate the remaining annual \npayments required under the existing repayment contract. This is an \nincrease from last year's legislation, which called for a $150,000 \nfinal settlement. Enacting this legislation would end the issue of \npaying for the construction of these gates for both the city and the \nFederal government.\n  Second, my bill would require the Secretary to reallocate the costs \nof operation and maintenance for the bascule gates and the Dickinson \nDam. The bill does not prescribe any particular reallocation formula, \nbut does require the Secretary to consider the fact that the current \nbenefits of the dam and bascule gates are primarily for flood control, \nrecreation, and fish and wildlife purposes. In my view, operation and \nmaintenance costs should be borne by those who benefit from a \nparticular project.\n  Finally, my bill would permit the Secretary to enter any appropriate \nwater service contracts in the future if the city or any other entity \nuses water from Patterson Lake for municipal water supply or for other \npurposes. It is only fair that if the city benefits in the future from \nthe water stored behind the bascule gates that we preserve an option \nfor recovering additional costs from those beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a win-win situation for \nthe residents of the Dickinson area and for the Federal Government. I \nhope this Congress will carefully study this issue and quickly pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 769\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates \n     Settlement Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1980 and 1981, the Bureau of Reclamation constructed \n     the bascule gates on top of the Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota, to provide additional water supply in \n     the reservoir known as Patterson Lake for the city of \n     Dickinson, North Dakota, and for additional flood control and \n     other benefits;\n       (2) the gates had to be significantly modified in 1982 \n     because of damage resulting from a large ice block causing \n     excessive pressure on the hydraulic system, causing the \n     system to fail;\n       (3) since 1991, the City has received its water supply from \n     the Southwest Water Authority, which provides much higher \n     quality water from the Southwest Pipeline Project;\n       (4) the City now receives almost no benefit from the \n     bascule gates because the City does not require the \n     additional water provided by the bascule gates for its \n     municipal water supply;\n       (5) the City has repaid more than $1,200,000 to the United \n     States for the construction of the bascule gates, and has \n     been working for several years to reach an agreement with the \n     Bureau of Reclamation to alter its repayment contract;\n       (6) the City has a longstanding commitment to improving the \n     water quality and recreation value of the reservoir and has \n     been working with the United States Geological Survey, the \n     North Dakota Department of Game and Fish, and the North \n     Dakota Department of Health to improve water quality; and\n       (7) it is in the public interest to resolve this issue by \n     providing for a single payment to the United States in lieu \n     of the scheduled annual payments and for the termination of \n     any further repayment obligation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Bascule gates.--The term ``bascule gates'' means the \n     structure constructed on the Dam to provide additional water \n     storage capacity in the Lake.\n       (2) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Dickinson, \n     North Dakota.\n       (3) Dam.--The term ``Dam'' means Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota.\n       (4) Lake.--The term ``Lake'' means the reservoir known as \n     ``Patterson Lake'' in the State of North Dakota.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the \n     Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n     SEC. 4. FORGIVENESS OF DEBT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall accept a 1-time \n     payment of $300,000 in lieu of the existing repayment \n     obligations of the City under the Bureau of Reclamation \n     Contract No. 9-07-60W0384, dated December 19, 1988, toward \n     which amount any payments\n\n[[Page S3637]]\n\n     made by the City to the Secretary on or after June 2, 1998, \n     shall be credited.\n       (b) Ownership.--Title to the Dam and bascule gates shall \n     remain with the United States.\n       (c) Costs.--\n       (1) In general.--In consultation with the City and the \n     State of North Dakota, the Secretary shall reallocate \n     responsibility for the operation and maintenance costs of the \n     Dam and bascule gates.\n       (2) Consideration of benefits.--The reallocation of costs \n     shall reflect the fact that the benefits of the Dam and \n     bascule gates are mainly for flood control, recreation, and \n     fish and wildlife purposes.\n       (d) Water Service Contracts.--The Secretary may enter into \n     appropriate water service contracts if the City or any other \n     person or entity seeks to use water from the Lake for \n     municipal water supply or other purposes.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad, in introducing a bill to provide a final settlement \non certain debts owned by the City of Dickinson, North Dakota, to the \nBureau of Reclamation. The legislation is virtually identical to that \nintroduced during the last Congress.\n  The Dickinson Dam Bascule Gates Settlement Act will provide long \noverdue relief to the citizens of Dickinson. Let me briefly explain why \nthe debt liquidation is needed and appropriate. For one thing, the \nBureau of Reclamation built a faulty project. The debt was incurred by \nthe City of Dickinson for construction of a dam with gate structures \nwhich never worked properly. In addition, the need for the dam to help \nprovide a reliable local water supply was eclipsed by the construction \nof the Southwest Pipeline, a project of the same Bureau of Reclamation.\n  The legislation itself is actually quite simple. It would permit the \nSecretary of the Interior to accept one final payment from the City of \nDickinson in place of a series of payments now required by city's \ncurrent repayment contract.\n  My colleague has described in some detail the complicated and \nfrustrating story of the dam and bascule gates project. Let me \nunderscore a couple of major points. In 1949 and 1950, the dam was \nconstructed to provide an adequate water supply for the City of \nDickinson, as well as some flood control and recreation. The bascule \ngates were added to augment storage capacity in the reservoir called \nPatterson Lake. Despite the city's concerns about the use of a gate \nstructure on the dam, which had not previously been used in a northern \nclimate, the gates actually failed in 1982. The ensuing modifications \nincreased the cost of the project.\n  Another twist in the story is that by 1991 the city no longer needed \nthe Patterson Lake water supply. As noted, it began to receive its \nwater supply from the Southwest Pipeline. This is a major distribution \nnetwork of the Garrison Diversion Unit, another Bureau of Reclamation \nproject. This system provides both higher quality and more reliable \nwater supplies than the city's previous supply from Patterson Lake.\n  Consequently, it makes no sense for the City of Dickinson to have two \nwater supply systems when it needs only one--especially when the first \nsystem was a faulty one. The city has already repaid more than $1.2 \nmillion for the bascule gates, even though they now provide virtually \nno benefit to the city.\n  Last year, I was able to pass an appropriations amendment to provide \npartial relief for the city's debt. Unfortunately, this provision \nstalled in the conference committee. The North Dakota delegation also \nadded an amendment for more complete debt relief to a package of water \nmanagement projects, which did not pass in the last days of 1998 \nsession.\n  Thus, we need to provide authority for Dickinson to settle its debt, \nto reallocate costs for operation and maintenance of the bascule gates \nand Dickinson Dam, and to permit the Secretary of the Interior to enter \ninto appropriate water service contracts with the city for any \nbeneficial use of the water in Patterson Lake. The proposed legislation \nwill address those three objectives while also providing a fair \nsettlement for the Federal Government and the City of Dickinson.\n  I want to commend my colleague from North Dakota for his leadership \nand cooperation in developing a sound solution to this problem. In \nterm, I urge my colleagues to consider and pass this needed \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Harkin, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 770. A bill to provide reimbursement under the medicare program \nfor telehealth services, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                THE COMPREHENSIVE TELEHEALTH ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Daschle, Senator Wellstone, Senator Inouye, Senator Harkin, and \nSenator Murkowski to introduce legislation to help improve health care \ndelivery in rural and underserved communities throughout America \nthrough the use of telecommunications and telehealth technology.\n  Telehealth encompasses a wide variety of technologies, ranging from \nthe telephone to high-tech equipment that enables a surgeon to perform \nsurgery from thousands of miles away. It includes interactive video \nequipment, fax machines and computers along with satellites and fiber \noptics. These technologies can be used to diagnose patients, deliver \ncare, transfer health data, read X-rays, provide consultation and \neducate health professionals. Telehealth also includes the electronic \nstorage and transmission of personally identifiable health information, \nsuch as medical records, test results, and insurance claims.\n  The promise of telehealth is becoming increasingly apparent. \nThroughout the country, providers are experimenting with a variety of \ntelehealth approaches in an effort to improve access to quality medical \nand other health-related services. Those programs are demonstrating \nthat telecommunications technology can alleviate the constraints of \ntime and distance, as well as the cost and inconvenience of \ntransporting patients to medical providers. Many approaches show \npromising results in reducing health care costs and bringing adequate \ncare to all Americans. For the first time, technological advances and \nthe development of a national information infrastructure give \ntelehealth the potential to overcome barriers to health care services \nfor rural Americans and afford them the access that most Americans take \nfor granted. But it is clear that our nation must do more to integrate \ntelehealth into our overall health care delivery infrastructure.\n  Because so many rural and underserved communities lack the ability to \nattract and support a wide variety of health care professionals and \nservices, it is important to find a way to bring the most important \nmedical services into those communities. Telehealth provides an \nimportant part of the answer. It helps bring services to remote areas \nin a quick, cost-effective manner, and can enable patients to avoid \ntraveling long distances in order to receive health care treatment.\n  We have made progress. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 includes a \nprovision that provides for some Medicare reimbursement of telehealth \nservices. Unfortunately, however, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration interpreted the legislative language too narrowly and \nseverely limited the services that are covered. This bill clarifies the \nintent of Congress regarding Medicare reimbursement and thereby \nincreases access to these services in underserved areas.\n  The first element of my proposal clarifies and expands Medicare \nreimbursement for telehealth. Medicare reimbursement policy is an \nessential component of helping to integrate telehealth into the health \ncare infrastructure and is particularly important in rural areas, where \nmany hospitals do as much as 80% of their business with Medicare \npatients. Because the Secretary defined reimbursable services so \nnarrowly in the BBA, this legislation clarifies that all services that \nare covered under Medicare Part B if you drive to a doctor's office, \nare covered via telehealth. In particular, it clarifies that the \ntechnology called ``store and forward'', which is a cost-effective \nmethod of transferring information, is included in this reimbursement \npolicy. Finally, this bill expands coverage from health professional \nshortage areas, as enacted in 1997, to cover all rural areas.\n  The second element of this proposal asks the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services to submit a report to the Congress on the status of \nefforts to\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nease licensing burdens on practitioners who cross state lines in the \ncourse of supplying telehealth services. Currently, consultation by \nalmost any licensed health professional in this situation requires that \nthe practitioner be licensed in both states.\n  In talking with telehealth providers in my state, and with experts on \nthe Ad Hoc Committee, I have been told repeatedly that this is one of \nthe most significant barriers to developing broad, integrated \ntelehealth systems. More importantly, they tell me states have actively \nbeen using licensure to close their borders to innovative telehealth \npractice. Many states have taken legislative action to ensure that out-\nof-state practitioners must be fully licensed in their state in order \nto provide telehealth services, even if they are fully licensed in \ntheir own state. During a discussion with a telehealth practitioner \nfrom my home state of North Dakota, I was told about a group of \ntelehealth specialists who, among their small group practice, were \nlicensed in more than thirty different states. That means they pay \nthirty different fees, are responsible for thirty different continuing \neducation requirements, and are overseen by thirty different regulatory \nbodies. This is a costly and burdensome procedure for many \npractitioners, but the burden falls particularly heavily on rural \npractitioners, who face long travel times to acquire continuing \neducation, and who frequently run on lower profit margins than urban \npractitioners.\n\n  While I am not prepared at this time to propose that the federal \ngovernment get involved with professional licensure, I have asked the \nSecretary to study the issue and report to Congress yearly on the \nstatus of efforts by states and other interested organizations to \naddress this issue. This will allow us to reach out to the states and \nwork together to find solutions to cross-state licensure concerns. As \npart of this report, I have asked to the Secretary to make \nrecommendations to Congress, if appropriate, about possible federal \naction to lower the licensure barrier.\n  A third element of my proposal involves coordination of the Federal \ntelehealth effort. The Department of Health and Human Services has \ncreated an informal interagency task force that is examining our \nfederal agency telehealth efforts. This group reported on Federal \nactivities related to telehealth and provided a thorough examination of \nmany of the important issues in telehealth.\n  My bill attempts to use that task force to inventory Federal activity \non telehealth and related technology, determine what applications have \nbeen found successful, and recommend an overall Federal policy approach \nto telehealth. Many departments and agencies of the Federal government \nare engaged in telehealth activity, including the Veterans \nAdministration, Department of Defense, Department of Agriculture, \nOffice for the Advancement of Telehealth, and many others. The more \nthese agencies work together to coordinate the Federal effort and \nconsolidate Federal resources, the more effective the Federal \ngovernment will be in contributing to telehealth in a positive way. I \nbelieve this is especially important in light of the GAO report calling \nfor an expanded role for this group and more coordination of telehealth \nissues across the Federal agencies. The efforts of this group, along \nwith the ongoing activities of the Congressional Ad Hoc Steering \nCommittee, will provide a renewed focus for telehealth across the \nFederal government. Such coordination will also help protect the \nAmerican taxpayer from unnecessary duplication of effort.\n  The fourth part of my proposal helps communities build home-grown \ntelehealth networks. It attempts both to build a telehealth \ninfrastructure and foster rural economic development and incorporates \nmany of the most important lessons learned from other grant projects \nand studies on telehealth from across the Federal government.\n  Clearly, the scarcity of resources in many rural communities requires \nthat the coordination and use of those resources be maximized. My bill \nencourages cooperation by various local entities in an effort to help \nbuild sustainable telehealth programs in rural communities. It plants \nseed money to encourage health care providers to join with other \nsegments of the community to jointly use telecommunications resources. \nUsing a unique loan forgiveness program, it rewards telehealth systems \nthat supply appropriate, high-quality care while reducing overall \nhealth care costs.\n  Most importantly, it does not create a system where various \ntechnological approaches are imposed upon communities. Rather it \nenables potential grantees to determine user-friendly approaches that \nwork best for them. This home-grown approach to developing user-\nfriendly telehealth systems, as well as the preference for coordinating \nresources within communities, will help ensure the long-term viability \nof such programs after the grant expires.\n  Mr. President, my proposal continues our national efforts to \nintegrate telecommunications technology into the rapidly evolving \nhealth care delivery system. I am very encouraged by the positive \nfeedback I have received from telehealth networks across the country. I \nhave continued to work with telehealth networks and representatives to \nstrengthen this proposal. As a result, I have made several changes in \nthe bill that I believe will make this a stronger proposal. But, as \nwith any complex issue, I understand that some may prefer different \napproaches. I would like to continue to encourage all interested \nparties to come forward with creative solutions to these important \nissues. It is my hope that telehealth legislation can be included in \nthe comprehensive rural health care legislation in this Congress so we \ncan continue to improve access to needed health care services for rural \nand underserved populations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 771. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe memorialization at the columbarium at Arlington National Cemetery \nof veterans who have donated their remains to science, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                          VETERANS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, late last summer, a Virginian contacted my \noffice to request my intervention in a matter which had brought \nconsiderable anguish and frustration to her family.\n\n  She informed me that her father, a decorated veteran of World War II \nand a career civil servant, had recently passed away. Before his death, \nhowever, he made two simple requests: one, that his body be donated to \nscience, and two, that his ashes be placed in the Arlington National \nCemetery. His widow, now 72, honored the first of those wishes. But in \nhonoring the first request, she found out that the second was \nprecluded.\n  The family learned that, due to various legal concerns, ashes of \norgan donors who donate their bodies to science are not returned to the \nfamilies of the donors. Unfortunately, due to the regulations governing \nArlington National Cemetery, veterans cannot be memorialized in the \nColumbarium unless their remains are actually inurned there. Oddly, it \nso happens that if his spouse had predeceased him, her remains would \nalready have been inurned in a niche at Arlington, awaiting his \nremains.\n  While I can appreciate that limited space at Arlington has \nnecessitated adherence to strict guidelines for burial and \nmemorialization, I cannot see the virtue in denying appropriate \nrecognition for an entitled veteran simply because he has donated his \nremains to science. In fact, I would like to encourage more veterans to \ndo just that.\n  All of us recognize the great need for viable remains for both \ntransplantation and for medical study. Veterans who make this \ncourageous commitment should be suitably recognized and their loved \nones should know that a grateful nation has made a place for them at \none of our country's most sacred memorials.\n  With that said, I submit this bill which seeks to modify current \nregulations to allow otherwise qualified veterans, who have donated \ntheir remains to science, to be memorialized at the Columbarium in \nArlington National Cemetery, notwithstanding the absence of their \ncremated remains.\n  Mr. President, I salute these veterans and their devoted families, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 771\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 8339(p) of title 5, United States \nCode, to clarify the computations of certain civil service retirement \nsystem annuities based on part-time service, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n        CIVIL SERVICE RETIREMENT SYSTEM ANNUITIES CLARIFICATION\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will \ncorrect current calculations of federal retirement annuities that \nunfairly penalizes federal civil servants who switch to part-time \nservice at the end of their careers.\n  The Congress included provisions in the 1986 Civil Service amendments \ncontained in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that \nreformed the part-time service calculations for retirement, so that \npart-time workers would not receive the same annuities as full-time \nworkers. I believe that was a fair and equitable reform. However, after \nreceiving a letter from one of my fellow Virginians, L. David Jones, it \nis clear that there have been errors in the interpretation of the \nprovision.\n  Mr. Jones worked for the Naval Research Lab until his retirement in \nFebruary, 1995. He worked there full-time for 30 years and part-time \nfor five years after his 30 years of full-time service. He elected \npart-time service at the end of his career to not only to ease into \nretirement, but to help his colleagues better manage an increased \nworkload. But because of the misinterpretation of the provision, he \nwould have been better off retiring at the end of his 30 years. Instead \nof being praised for his additional service, his situation now serves \nas a cautionary tale for others who wish to transition into retirement \nand help their colleagues: if you switch to part-time service after a \nlong career as a full-time worker, your annuities will be reduced. \nClearly, that is not the intent of the provision.\n  Mr. Jones and his wife sought judicial remedies to no avail. He and \nhis family simply want his annuity calculated accurately. That is why I \nam introducing this legislation today.\n  Mr. President, by passing this legislation we will ensure that \nfederal retirees like Mr. Jones and others are not unjustly penalized \nfor working part-time at the end of their careers. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on the Government Affairs Committee to \nensure its consideration and favorable recommendation as quickly as \npossible.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 772\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe active business definition relating to distributions of stock and \nsecurities of controlled corporations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          Amendment to Internal Revenue Code Section 355(b)(2)\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to again introduce a bill \nthat would make a technical change in the Internal Revenue Code. We \noften talk about the need to simplify the Tax Code. The change I \npropose today would do that.\n  This change is small but very important. It would not alter the \nsubstance of current law in any way. It would, however, greatly \nsimplify a common corporate transaction. This small technical change \nwill alone save corporations millions of dollars in unnecessary \nexpenses and economic costs that are incurred when they divide their \nbusinesses.\n  The Treasury Department agrees that there is a technical problem with \nthe drafting of the Tax Code and has agreed to work with me on this \nproposal. In fact, the President included a similar provision to \ncorrect this problem in his budget. I am introducing today the same \nbill I introduced during the last session of Congress, but expect to \nwork with Treasury to perfect the language and make sure that \ncorporations are not further hampered by this problem.\n  Corporations, and affiliated groups of corporations, often find it \nadvantageous, or even necessary, to separate two or more businesses. \nThe division of AT from its local telephone companies is an example \nof such a transaction. The reasons for these corporate divisions are \nmany, but probably chief among them is the ability of management to \nfocus on one core business.\n  At the end of the day, when a corporation divides, the stockholders \nsimply have the stock of two corporations, instead of one. The Tax Code \nrecognizes this is not an event that should trigger tax, as it includes \ncorporate divisions among the tax-free reorganization provisions.\n  One requirement the Tax Code imposes on corporate divisions is very \nawkwardly drafted, however. As a result, an affiliated group of \ncorporations that wishes to divide must often engage in complex and \nburdensome preliminary reorganizations in order to accomplish what, for \na single corporate entity, would be a rather simple and straightforward \nspinoff of a business to its shareholders. The small technical change I \npropose today would eliminate the need for these unnecessary \ntransactions, while keeping the statute true to Congress's original \npurpose.\n  More specifically, section 355 (and related provisions of the Code) \npermits a corporation or an affiliated group of corporations to divide \non a tax-free basis into two or more separate entities with separate \nbusinesses. There are numerous requirements for tax-free treatment of a \ncorporate division, or ``spinoff,'' including continuity of historical \nshareholder interest, continuity of the business enterprises, business \npurpose, and absence of any device to distribute earnings and profits. \nIn addition, section 355 requires that each of the divided corporate \nentities be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. The \nproposed change would alter none of these substantive requirements of \nthe Code.\n  Section 355(b)(2)(A) currently provides an attribution or \n``lookthrough'' rule for groups of corporations that operate active \nbusinesses under a holding company, which is necessary because a \nholding company, by definition, is not itself engaged in an active \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n This lookthrough rule inexplicably requires, however, that \n``substantially all'' of the assets of the holding company consist of \nstock of active controlled subsidiaries. The practical effect of this \nlanguage is to prevent holding companies from engaging in spinoffs if \nthey own almost any other assets. This is in sharp contrast to \ncorporations that operate businesses directly, which can own \nsubstantial assets unrelated to the business and still engage in tax-\nfree spinoff transactions.\n  In the real world, of course, holding companies may, for many sound \nbusiness reasons, hold other assets, such as non-controlling (less than \n80 percent) interests in subsidiaries, controlled subsidiaries that \nhave been owned for less than five years (which are not considered \n``active businesses'' under section 355), or a host of nonbusiness \nassets. Such holding companies routinely undertake spinoff \ntransactions, but because of the awkward language used in section \n355(b)(2)(A), they must first undertake one or more (often a series of) \npreliminary reorganizations solely for the purpose of complying with \nthis inexplicable language of the Code.\n  Such preliminary reorganizations are at best costly, burdensome, and \nwithout any business purpose, and at worst, they seriously interfere \nwith business operations. In a few cases, they may be so costly as to \nbe prohibitive, and cause the company to abandon an otherwise sound \nbusiness transaction that is clearly in the best interest of the \ncorporation and the businesses it operates.\n  There is no tax policy reason, tax advisors agree, to require the \nreorganization of a consolidated group that is clearly engaged in the \nactive conduct of a trade or business, as a condition to a spinoff. Nor \nis there any reason to treat affiliated groups differently than single \noperating companies. Indeed, no one has ever suggested one. The \nlegislative history indicates Congress was concerned about non-\ncontrolled subsidiaries, which is elsewhere adequately addressed, not \nconsolidated groups.\n  For many purposes, the Tax Code treats affiliated groups as a single \ncorporation. Therefore, the simple remedy I am proposing today for the \nproblem created by the awkward language of section 355(b)(2)(A) is to \napply the active business test to an affiliated group as if it were a \nsingle entity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF ACTIVE BUSINESS DEFINITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 355(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (defining active conduct of a trade or business) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following: ``For purposes \n     of subparagraph (A), all corporations that are members of the \n     same affiliated group (as defined in section 1504(a)) shall \n     be treated as a single corporation.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to distributions or transfer after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 774. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase \nthe deduction for meal and entertainment expenses of small businesses; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              Business Meal Deduction for Small Businesses\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a very important \nbill for small businesses in Louisiana and throughout our country that \nI also introduced during the 105th Congress. My bill would restore the \n80 percent deduction for business meals and entertainment expenses, \nthus eliminating a tax burden that has seriously hampered many small \nbusinesses in our country.\n  Small business is a powerful economic engine, both nationwide and in \nLouisiana. Small businesses have helped to create the prosperity that \nwe have all enjoyed in the last few years. They are leaders in the \ninnovation and technology development that will sustain our economy in \nthe 21st century. Nationwide, small business employs 53 percent of the \nprivate work force, contributes 47 percent of all sales in the country, \nand is responsible for 50 percent of the private gross domestic \nproduct.\n  For these reasons, I believe the tax code should encourage, not \ndiscourage, small business development and growth. For the more than \n225,000 self-employed and for the thousands of small businesses in \nLouisiana, business meals and entertainment take the place of \nadvertising, marketing, and conference meetings. These expenses are a \ncore business development cost. As such, a large percentage of these \ncosts should be deductible.\n  For many years, businesses were allowed to deduct 100 percent of \nbusiness meals and entertainment expenses. In 1987, this deduction was \nreduced to 80 percent. The deduction was further reduced in 1994 to 50 \npercent because of the misconception that these meals were ``three \nmartini lunches.''\n  Contrary to this perception, studies show that the primary \nbeneficiary of the business meal deduction is not the wealthy business \nperson. Studies indicate that over two-thirds of the business meal \nspenders have incomes of less than $60,000 and 37 percent have incomes \nbelow $40,000. Low to moderately priced restaurants are the most \npopular types for business meals, with the average check equaling less \nthan $20. In addition, 50 percent of most business meals occur in small \ntowns and rural areas.\n  In 1995, just one year after the deduction was reduced to 50 percent, \nthe White House Conference on Small Business established the \nrestoration of the deduction as one of its top priorities for boosting \nsmall business. In Louisiana alone, it is expected that the positive \neconomic impact of this proposal could exceed $67 million in \nindustries, such as the travel and restaurant industry, that employ \nover 120,000 people. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 775. A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to conduct a feasibility study for applying airport \nbubbles as a method of identifying, assessing, and reducing the adverse \nenvironmental impacts of airport ground and flight operations and \nimproving the overall quality of the environment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n             The Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Right To \nKnow About Airport Pollution Act, and ask that my remarks be placed in \nthe Record at the appropriate place. This important legislation will \nallow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in conjunction with \nthe FAA, to conduct a nationwide study of air, water, solid waste and \nnoise pollution generated by airports across the U.S. every day. In \naddition, the bill will direct the EPA to determine whether current air \nemission standards are sufficient to protect the environment, and will \nrequire airports to be listed under Community Right To Know laws \ngoverning the use of hazardous materials.\n  Many of my colleagues and I hear everyday from constituents who are \nconcerned by the pollution, including noise pollution, created by \nairports in our states. In 1996, a Natural Resources Defense Council \n(NRDC) report confirmed that US airports rival smokestack industries in \nthe amount of pollution they release into the environment. This growing \nproblem affects every state in our nation and millions of our \nconstituents. You do not have to be from a state with a large airport \nto understand that pollution associated with these facilities severely \naffects the health and impacts the quality of life of our constituents.\n  While we must recognize that airport expansion is an inevitable by-\nproduct of a vibrant economy, and that the government has a \nresponsibility to foster economic growth and jobs, we also have an \nequal responsibility to mitigate the hazardous affects of pollution and \nnoise on our constituents. The studies produced as a result of this \nlegislation will give us a better idea as to the magnitude of the \npollution problem caused by airports, and will allow us to prepare a \ncommensurate response.\n  Again, I would like to thank my colleagues who have demonstrated \ninterest in this issue and look forward to the passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD:\n  S. 777. A bill to require the Department of Agriculture to establish \nan electronic filing and retrieval system to enable the public to file \nall required paperwork electronically with the Department and to have \naccess to public information on farm programs, quarterly trade, \neconomic, and production reports, and other similar information; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                         freedom to e-file act\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto streamline the process our farmers follow when filing paper work \nwith the Department of Agriculture (USDA). Currently, when farmers are \nrequired to fill out USDA paper work, they are required to travel to \ntheir local USDA county offices, complete the paper work, wait in long \nlines and file these documents in paper form. This process is very \ninefficient and time consuming.\n  The bill that I introduce today simply requires USDA to develop a \nsystem for farmers to access and file this paper work over the \ninternet. This legislation entitled the ``Freedom to E-file Act'' \nsimply makes good common sense. As our society has become more \ntechnologically advanced so have our farmers. In fact, a 1998 Novartis \nsurvey found that over 72 percent of all farmers with 500 acres or more \nhad personal computers. Overall, over fifty percent of all farmers \nsurveyed had computers.\n  Our agriculturalists use computers not only for financial management \nand market information but for sophisticated precision agriculture \nmanagement systems. These sophisticated small business owners could \neasily file necessary farm program paperwork from their homes and \noffices if only this option was available.\n  Farmers are often frustrated with the long lines at county USDA \noffices, especially during their most hectic times such as harvest \nseason. Our nation's farmers are clearly overburdened by government-\nrequired paperwork. This bill is the first step in the right direction \ntoward regulatory reform for our U.S. food producers.\n  This legislation is budget neutral and USDA would implement the bill \nusing existing funds. I want to recognize and commend my colleague, \nCongressman Ray LaHood, for championing the companion to this bill in \nthe House of Representatives. This bill should enjoy bipartisan \nsupport.

A bill to provide that no Federal income tax shall be imposed \non amounts received by Holocaust victims or their heirs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             holocaust era assets tax exclusion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nHolocaust Era Assets Tax Exclusion Act of 1999, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Moynihan and Schumer. Mr. President, survivors of \nthe Holocaust who had assets withheld from them by Swiss banks or \nothers have finally received justice in the form of a settlement \nbetween the banks and the survivor's attorneys in August 1998. The \nsettlement was for $1.25 billion for survivors worldwide. This \nsettlement will finally return the assets to survivors more than fifty \nyears after they first entrusted them to the banks.\n  In addition to these recipients, there are survivors who are needy \nand have received one-time payments from the Swiss Humanitarian Fund \nestablished by the Swiss government. In both cases, any payment from \nthe Swiss banks or other similar sources like this, should be excluded \nfrom taxation because they are receiving back what was rightfully \ntheirs to begin with. The sum total of payments coming to the needy \nHolocaust survivors in the United States from this fund is $31.4 \nmillion.\n  Moreover, funds are being established by banks and corporations in \nFrance, Austria, Italy, and Germany to compensate claimants for \nwrongfully held bank deposits, insurance policies, slave labor, and \nother losses.\n  Survivors who have sued banks, insurance companies, and manufacturers \nwhich profited from slave labor during the Holocaust, did so because \nthere was no other way for them to seek justice. Deprived of their \nassets, or those of their families for over fifty years, survivors \nfought unsuccessfully until now to receive what belonged to them.\n  With the average age of Holocaust survivors at 80, there is little \ntime for debate over these payments which will ease life for the \nsurvivors in their final years. To tax them for the long overdue \nreceipt of assets would be wrong and immoral. What these survivors will \nreceive from the various funds will be money that is rightfully theirs \nin the first place.\n  The survivors of man's greatest inhumanity to man deserve justice. \nAfter escaping death at the hands of the Nazis, they were again \nvictimized by European bankers and insurers. Those who endured the \ntortures of slave labor have never been compensated for their servitude \nto the Nazis. Now that they have received some measure of justice, let \nus not make them wait any longer for what is rightfully theirs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord,  as follows:\n\n                                 S. 779\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. NO FEDERAL INCOME TAX ON AMOUNTS RECEIVED BY \n                   HOLOCAUST VICTIMS OR THEIR HEIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--For purposes of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986, gross income shall not include any amount received \n     by an individual (or any heir of the individual)--\n       (1) from the Swiss Humanitarian Fund established by the \n     Government of Switzerland or from any similar fund \n     established by any foreign country, or\n       (2) as a result of the settlement of the action entitled \n     ``In re Holocaust Victims' Asset Litigation'', (E.D. NY), \n     C.A. No. 96-4849, or as a result of any similar action.\n       (b) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to any amount \n     received before, on, or after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Fitzgerald, \nMoynihan, and Schumer in introducing this important legislation, which \nwould prevent the federal government from taxing away any monies \nobtained by Holocaust survivors or their families in a settlement \nrelated to thefts by the Nazis or their sympathizers.\n  The horrors of the Nazi regime and its atrocities remain very much \nwith us. Many people in America and around the world, particularly \nJews, must live every day with memories of atrocities suffered or \nwitnessed, either by themselves or by those they love, during the Nazi \nterror. Ghettoes, death camps and simple murder were the stuff of daily \nlife for millions of innocent people during this terrible time of Nazi \npower.\n  Only recently has public attention been properly directed toward \nanother great crime of the Nazi regime and those who cooperated with \nit: A 1998 study by the Institute of the World Jewish Congress \nestimates that between $90 billion and $140 billion in today's dollars \nwas stolen from the Jewish populations of countries occupied by the \nNazis. In addition to committing outright theft and looting, the Nazis \nseized liquid assets that could be converted easily into cash, such as \ninsurance policy proceeds and bank accounts. Documents discovered by \nRisk International Services, Inc., an insurance archaeology firm, show \nthat the Nazis specifically targeted insurance policies held by Jews as \na source of\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\nfunding for their expansionist, totalitarian regime.\n  Some insurance companies also specifically (and illegally) targeted \nJewish families. Knowing that Jewish policy holders soon would be taken \nto concentration camps, these firms sold specifically tailored \npolicies, taking as much cash as possible up front, with no intention \nof honoring their obligations.\n  After the war, Holocaust survivors attempted to collect on their \npolicies, access their bank accounts and/or reclaim assets that had \nbeen illegally seized. Unfortunately, governments, banks and insurance \ncompanies failed to fulfill their duty to treat Holocaust victims with \njustice and dignity. Instead, Mr. President, they refused to honor \npolicies or return stolen assets. In this way they compounded crime \nwith crime and denied people who already had suffered more than most of \nus could bear the rightful means by which to rebuild their lives.\n  Finally, after over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and \ntheir families are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. But, even as \nwe support these efforts to reclaim stolen property, I believe we must \ndo our part in protecting the proceeds. Under current law, any money \nreceived by Holocaust survivors in their settlements with banks and \nother organizations that once cooperated with the Nazis would be \ntreated as gross income for federal tax purposes.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that victims of the Holocaust have \nsuffered far too much for any such taxation to be just. These \nsettlements represent but a fraction of what is owed to those who \nsuffered under Nazi tyranny. To treat them as income subject to \ntaxation would be wrong.\n  This is why this legislation is so important. It will prevent the \nfederal government from taxing away any monies obtained by Holocaust \nsurvivors or their families in a settlement related to thefts by the \nNazis or their sympathizers. It will prevent yet another injustice from \nbeing done to those who survived the brutal Nazi regime. It will also \nkeep our nation firmly on the side of justice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 781. A bill to amend section 2511 of title 18, United States Code, \nto revise the consent exception to the prohibition on the interception \nof oral, wire, or electronic communications that is applicable to \ntelephone communications; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     Telephone Privacy Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \n``Telephone Privacy Act of 1999.'' This legislation would prohibit the \nrecording of a telephone call unless all the parties on the call have \ngiven their consent.\n  I am introducing this bill because our nation's telephone privacy \nlaws are confused and in conflict. We need a national law governing \ntelephone privacy so that telephone users have a uniform standard to \nrely on.\n  Currently, thirty-seven states require only the consent of one party \nto record a phone call. Fifteen states require the consent of all \nparties to be taped. This jumbled collection of telephone privacy laws \nleaves most consumers confused about their rights to protect their \nphone calls from surreptitious taping.\n  Today, consumers who seek to block surreptitious taping of their \nphone calls face an incredible burden. The problem is especially acute \nduring interstate calls because the legality of surreptitiously \nrecording a phone call depends on the state where the call is recorded. \nThus, when a party makes an interstate call, one's rights may depend on \nthe laws governing taping in other states.\n  The recent well-publicized taping of Monica Lewinsky's phone \nconversations by Linda Tripp illustrates this problem. Maryland, where \nLinda Tripp recorded the conversations, is a state that requires the \nconsent of all parties. However, Washington D.C., where Monica Lewinsky \nlived at the time, requires only one-party consent. Two people living \nwithin a half-hours drive from each other should have the same laws \napply to them.\n  In practice, any person who wants to protect herself against \nsurreptitious recording must know the telephone privacy laws of other \nstates. Our laws cannot reasonably expect a consumer to have this \nknowledge. People who make lots of interstate calls might be forced \ninto the position of knowing the telephone privacy laws of all 50 \nstates.\n  Not only will the Telephone Privacy Act of 1999 promote uniformity of \nlaws, it will also create a standard that better protects privacy. The \nTelephone Privacy Act would require an all-party consent standard for \ntaping phone calls no matter where one lived in the United States. It \nwould end the practice of one-party consent that exists under Federal \nlaw and in a number of states.\n  While surreptitious taping has legitimate uses, such as lawful \nsurveillance by the police, our laws should not reward the practice of \nsurreptitious taping. This practice violates individual privacy and \noffends common decency.\n  Phone calls remain one of the few avenues of communication where \npeople still feel safe enough to have intimate conversations. We should \nprotect this expectation of privacy. If a telephone user intends to \ntape a phone call, the other party on the line ought to be informed.\n  Moreover, the one-party consent standard is an anachronism. It is \ninconsistent with other more privacy-respecting provisions of our \ncommunication laws. Federal law makes it a felony, for example, for a \nthird party to tap or record a telephone conversation between others. \nIt is also a felony to surreptitiously tape a cellular telephone call.\n  The bill has been carefully drafted so that it does not affect the \nrights of law enforcement officials to tape or monitor conversations as \nthey are carrying out their duties.\n  Nor does it affect the practice of businesses taping customer calls, \nas long as the customer is notified at the outset that the call is \nbeing taped. It also does not affect the right of people to \nsurreptitiously tape threatening or harassing phone calls.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 781\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to protect \nthe medical privacy rights of patients when they talk to their health \ncare insurers or providers. The bill requires health care insurers and \nproviders to obtain patients' ``express consent'' before tape-recording \nor monitoring conversations.\n  Today, the health insurance industry routinely tape-records and \nmonitors incoming telephone calls of patients with questions about \ntheir health insurance coverage. This bill halts that common practice \nwith two simple rules.\n  First, health insurance companies and health care providers must \nobtain the patient's ``express consent'' before tape-recording or \nmonitoring a conversation. Second, health insurance companies and \nhealth care providers must give patients the option not to be tape-\nrecorded or monitored.\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n  The bill puts control of medical privacy back where it belongs--in \nthe hands of patients who have no choice but to share personal \ninformation with their health insurance and health care providers.\n  The bill protects all patients--\n  Whether covered by private or public health plans,\n  Whether covered by group, individual, or self-insured health plans,\n  Whether covered by Medicare or Medicaid,\n  Whether covered by Federal health plans, or\n  Whether covered by the Children's Health Insurance Plan.\n  Let me emphasize again who would be subject to the bill--the health \ninsurance and health care industry--a huge industry that necessarily \naffects all of us. First, the bill would cover communications between \npatients and health insurers. Second, the bill would cover \ncommunications between patients and ``health care providers,'' which \nincludes physicians and other health care professionals.\n  Federal law now requires that only one party must consent to the \ntape-recording or monitoring of a telephone conversation. In \nCalifornia, state law provides that all parties must consent before a \ntelephone conversation may be tape-recorded. Nearly a dozen other \nstates have adopted similar two-party consent laws. They include \nDelaware, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMontana, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Washington.\n  Even two-party consent laws, however, do not adequately address this \nproblem. Health insurance companies tape-record or monitor patients' \ncalls based on the patient's implied consent. Implied consent arises \nfrom the patient talking after hearing the health insurer's recording \nthat the call may be tape-recorded or monitored. In this case, courts \nhave held that consent is given implicitly.\n  Consequently, merely changing federal law to a two-party consent rule \nwould not solve the problem. The key requirement must be that the \nhealth insurer or health care provider obtains the patient's express \nconsent. Only this change will protect individuals when they call their \nhealth insurance provider with questions about their health care \ncoverage. When my office contacted the top 100 health insurance \nproviders in this country, we learned from nearly all who responded \nthat they routinely monitor or tape-record calls received from \npatients.\n  Let me share with my colleagues some responses that we received. \nKaiser Permanente operates in nineteen states and the District of \nColumbia, and provides care to more than nine million members. Their \npractice varies from state to state, depending on applicable state \nlaws.\n  Kaiser Permanente may: Monitor randomly selected calls, in which case \nit may, or may not, notify patients in advance; or tape-record all or \nrandomly selected calls, in which case it may, or may not, notify \npatients in advance.\n  United HealthCare wrote to me that they did not believe that tape-\nrecording or monitoring calls even presents a privacy issue. Their \nrationale was that they only randomly tape-record calls and only after \nadvising the caller that they may record the call.\n  Great-West responded that a patient has the option of communicating \nin writing if the patient does not want a telephone call to be tape-\nrecorded. Let me say simply--that is not good enough for me. Imagine \nthe undue burden the task of writing a letter may place on elderly or \nseriously ill patients.\n  Despite the two-party consent rule in California, New York Life Care \nHealth Plans, Inc., asserted that no violation of California law occurs \nwithout a ``confidential communication.'' Under California state law, \nthe definition of a ``confidential communication'' does not include \ncommunications where the parties may expect that the may be recorded. \nNew York Life asserted that, since they told patients that their calls \ncould be monitored, their calls were not confidential calls.\n\n  New York Life's display of legal bootstrapping shows little, if any, \nregard for medical privacy rights. Their interpretation of the word \n``confidential'' turns its commonly understood meaning on its head! In \nthe minds of most people, what could be more confidential than matters \nabout one's personal health problems? Surely little, if anything. How \nmany of my colleagues in the Senate would say that communications about \ntheir health problems with health insurance or health care providers \nare not confidential?\n  Blue Cross Blue Shield of the National Capital Area does not give \npatients any notice that their calls may be monitored. Their Associate \nGeneral Counsel responded that, in both Maryland and the District of \nColumbia, telephone communications in the normal course of business do \nnot meet the definition of an ``interception.'' Thus, consent is not \nrequired. Although Virginia law considers a telephone to be an \n``intercepting device,'' Virginia follows the one-party consent rule.\n  Finger Lakes Blue Cross Blue Shield randomly tape-records calls from \npatients and only now is setting up a front-end recording to inform \npatients of that practice. New York requires only one party to consent.\n  None of the health insurance providers who responded to my office \ngave me a valid reason for tape-recording or monitoring patients' \ncalls. The standard response from health insurers was that they tape-\nrecord or monitor patients' calls for so-called ``quality control,'' an \nambiguous term at best. Indeed, no one explained what that term means, \nhow tape-recording calls benefits patients, or why tape-recording calls \nwas necessary.\n  Of course, health insurance providers are not the only business \nentities that tape-record telephone conversations. How many of us \nrealize that when we call for airline tickets, bank account \ninformation, mutual fund transfers, or any myriad of other daily \nconcerns, the other party on the telephone line will be tape-recording \nthe conversation? Yet, personal health information is far more personal \nin nature and, accordingly, entitled to greater protection. It stands \nalone as uniquely different from other commercial transactions.\n  This bill does not attempt to change the consent rule for other \nbusiness entities. It would apply only to health insurance and health \ncare providers. Most patients today have almost no choice about their \nhealth insurer provider or, increasingly, about their health care \nprovider. In turn, the health insurer may give the patient no option \nexcept to submit to tape-recording the conversation. An elderly, or \nseriously ill patient, is simply not going to object.\n  Admittedly, much disclosure of medical information occurs both with \npatient consent and for valid medical reasons. For instance, insurance \ncompanies receive information from physicians based upon a written \nconsent form signed by the patient at the physician's request. Yet, \nincreasingly, threats to medical health privacy have become less \nvisible and, in that sense, more alarming. Many individuals are left \nwith a false sense of privacy. The potential for misuse of personal \nhealth information is real and growing.\n  A fundamental right to medical privacy is embedded in American \nsociety. Most Americans presume that telephone conversations about \ntheir health problems are confidential. Sadly, they are wrong.\n  Conversations with our health insurance and health care providers \noften contain deeply personal information, including prescription \ndrugs, psychiatric care, alcohol dependency--the list goes on and on. \nSurely they deserve protection. Traditionally, Americans have relied \nupon a confidential relationship with their doctors.\n  Let's restore at least some measure of protection to telephone \nconversations about our personal health problems. This bill allows \nhealth insurance and health care providers to continue their routine \npractice of tape-recording or monitoring patients' calls--but only with \nthe patient's express consent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows;\n\n                                 S. 182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit access to body armor by violent felons and to \nfacilitate the donation of Federal surplus body armor to State and \nlocal law enforcement agencies; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nJames Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999.\n  Currently, Federal law does not limit access to body armor for \nindividuals with even the grimmest history of criminal violence. \nHowever, it is unquestionable that criminals with violent intentions \nare more dangerous when they are wearing body armor.\n  Many will recall the violent and horrific shootout in North \nHollywood, California, just two years ago. In that incident, two \nsuspects wearing body armor and armed to the teeth, terrorized a \ncommunity. Police officers on the scene had to borrow rifles from a \nnearby gunshop to counteract the firepower and protective equipment of \nthese suspects.\n  Another tragic incident involves San Francisco Police Officer James \nGuelff, for whom this act is named. On November 13, Officer Guelff \nresponded to a distress call. Upon reaching the crime scene, he was \nfired upon by a heavily armed suspect who was shielded by a kevlar vest \nand bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff died in the ensuing gun-fight.\n  Lee Guelff, James Gueff's brother, recently wrote a letter to me \nabout the need to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:\n\n       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in \n     possession of superior firepower . . . But to have to \n     confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive \n     protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk \n     for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to \n     face the same set of deadly circumstances again.\n\n  I couldn't agree with Lee more. Our laws need to recognize that body \narmor in the possession of a criminal is an offensive weapon. We need \nto make sure that our police officers on the streets are adequately \nsupplied with body armor, and that hardened-criminals are deterred from \nusing body armor.\n  The James Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999 has three key provisions to \nachieve these goals. First, it increases the penalties criminals \nreceive if they commit a crime wearing body armor. Specifically, a \nviolation will lead to an increase of two levels under the Federal \nsentencing guidelines. Second, it makes it unlawful for violent felons \nto purchase, use, or possess body armor. Third, this bill enables \nFederal law enforcement agencies to directly donate surplus body armor \nto local police.\n\n  I will address each of these three provisions.\n  Enhancing criminal penalties for individuals who wear body armor \nduring the commission of a crime: Criminals who wear body armor during \nthe commission of a crime should face enhanced penalties because they \npose an enhanced threat to police and civilians alike. Assailants \nshielded by body armor can shoot at the police and civilians with less \nfear than individuals not so well protected.\n  In the North Hollywood shoot-out, for example, the gunmen were able \nto hold dozens of officers at bay because of their body armor. This \nprovision will deter the criminal use of body armor, and thus deter the \nescalation of violence in our communities\n  Making it unlawful for violent felons to wear body armor: This bill \nmakes it a crime for individuals with a violent criminal record to wear \nbody armor. It is unconscionable that criminals can obtain and wear \nbody armor without restriction when so many of our police lack \ncomparable protection.\n  The bill recognizes that there may be exceptional circumstances where \nan individual with a brutal history legitimately needs body armor to \nprotect himself or herself. Therefore, it provides a mechanism for \nviolent felons to obtain specific permission from the Secretary of the \nTreasury to wear body armor.\n  This provision has already been codified into law in California. \nSeveral other states are also actively considering legislation to \nrestrict violent felons access to body armor.\n  California police applied the law for the first time earlier this \nyear. Police arrested an individual for wearing body armor who had a \nviolent criminal record. Besides a conviction for second-degree assault \nin 1993, the suspect is independently facing charges for threatening to \nkill his ex-girlfriend. He also is facing trial for issuing death \nthreats against security guards at a West Hollywood Nightclub.\n  Direct donation of body armor: The James Guelff Body Armor Act of \n1999 speeds up the procedures by which Federal agencies can donate \nsurplus body armor to local police.\n  It is disturbing that so many of our local police officers do not \nhave access to bullet-proof vests. The United States Department of \nJustice estimates that 25% of State, local, and tribal law enforcement \nofficers, approximately 150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.\n  Getting our officers more body armor will save lives. According to \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, greater than 30% of the 1,182 \nofficers killed by guns in the line of duty since 1980 could have been \nsaved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times \nhigher for an officer without a bulletproof vest.\n\n  Last year, Congress made some inroads into this shortage of body \narmor by enacting the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n1998.'' This act established a $25 million annual fund to help local \nand State police purchase body armor. The James Guelff Body Armor Act \nof 1999 will provide a further boost to the body armor resources of \nlocal and State police departments.\n  This legislation has attracted the support of a broad cross-section \nof the\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\nlaw enforcement community. The Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' \nAssociation, the National Troopers Coalition, the International \nAssociation of Police Chiefs, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation (FLEOA), the Police Executive Research Forum, the \nInternational Brother of Police Officers, and the National Association \nof Black Law Enforcement Executives, have all endorsed the legislation.\n  Richard J. Gallo, President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation notes:\n\n       In the past, FLEOA members have confronted individuals, \n     with prior criminal convictions, wearing body armor and \n     violently resisting arrest. Federal, state and local law \n     enforcement officers, and the public, deserve protection from \n     this, and at the very least, will now know theses felons will \n     receive enhanced sentences for using body armor during the \n     commission of a criminal act.\n\n  Robert Stewart, Executive Director of the National Organization of \nBlack Law Enforcement Executives, writes:\n\n       There is a societal obligation to assure the men and women \n     in blue are afforded all the protection they need to maintain \n     public order. Very real fiscal constraints can, however, \n     compromise the ability of local governments to accomplish \n     that critical goal. Hence, NOBLE heartily endorses the James \n     Guelff Body Armor Act of 1999.\n\n  I look forward to working with my fellow Senators from both sides of \nthe aisle in turning this bill into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 783\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``James Guelff Body Armor Act \n     of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n     facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly \n     weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n     interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n     affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n     over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n     control this traffic within their own borders through the \n     exercise of their police power;\n       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n     Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers \n     of body armor and a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n     California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n     outfitted in body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to \n     community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor \n     during the commission of a violent crime;\n       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n     of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been \n     saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 \n     times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n     of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n     police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n     needed by Federal agencies; and\n       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n     that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing the \n``Medicare Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act of 1999'' with my \ncolleague from Florida, Senator Mack. This legislation would establish \na demonstration project to assure Medicare beneficiaries with cancer \nthat Medicare will cover their routine patient costs when part of a \nclinical trial.\n  I would like to thank Senator Mack for his leadership and dedication \non this issue. It has been a pleasure to work with Senator Mack, a \ntireless champion for cancer patients throughout his years of service \nin the Senate.\n  With 1,500 deaths due to cancer each day and 1.3 million new cancer \ndiagnoses this year, there is a clear and urgent need for this \nlegislation. Our senior population is especially at risk--Medicare \nbeneficiaries make up half of all cancer diagnoses and 60% of all \ncancer deaths. Yet, Medicare's policy toward covering quality cancer \ncare is ambiguous and its enforcement practices are unpredictable.\n  Our legislation represents a significant step forward in the fight to \nprevent, detect and treat cancer quickly and effectively. It is based \non a very simple premise: given the disproportionate impact that cancer \nhas on older Americans, Medicare should be responsible for the routine \npatient care costs associated with approved clinical trials.\n  Cancer clinical trials often represent a cancer patient's best hope \nfor survival, especially when their cancer fails to respond to \ntraditional therapies. Yet, under current law, Medicare beneficiaries \ncan be denied coverage for the routine patient care costs associated \nwith clinical trials. However, if the same care is provided outside of \na clinical trial setting, it is covered by Medicare.\n  It is a tragedy that the costs of participating in a clinical trial \nare discouraging patients from using what might be their best weapon in \na battle with cancer. Medicare beneficiaries who are cancer patients \nare left with only two choices: pay the costs out of their own pocket, \nor forgo treatment all together. It is unfair, and unconscionable, that \nwe force cancer patient to make this decision.\n  There are other compelling reasons to cover these costs. By paying \nfor these routine costs, we provide incentives for researchers to \ninclude more Medicare beneficiaries in cancer clinical trials. \nResearchers know that patients who are at different stages physically, \nmentally, and emotionally will react very differently to treatments--\neven if they are fighting the same cancer. But what they don't know is \nhow age and health interact with the safety and effectiveness of new \ndrugs and treatments. Our bill helps them find the answers to those \ncritical questions.\n  Our bill saves money in the long-run by ensuring the Medicare program \npays for treatments that work. Clinical studies can determine which \ninterventions work the best, and when they are the most effective.\n  Finally, in establishing a demonstration project, this bill will also \nprovide valuable information about the costs and benefits of providing \ncoverage for clinical trials for other life-threatening diseases. We \nstarted with cancer first because cancer is a major affliction of \nMedicare beneficiaries. In addition there is a well-established \nnational clinical cancer trial system to deliver this patient care.\n  Mr. President, our legislation does not create a new benefit. It \nmerely ensures that patients enrolled in clinical studies receive \nMedicare coverage for the same type of routine patient care costs, such \nas hospital and physician fees, that would be covered outside of a \ntrial setting. We are not asking Medicare to pay for the cost of \nresearch. These expenses will still be covered by trial sponsors, \nincluding pharmaceutical companies.\n  The ``Medicare Cancer Clinical Trials Coverage Act'' is a modest \nproposal, but it has the potential to become a new weapon in the fight \nagainst cancer. But we must act now. We have fought for this proposal \nin previous sessions of Congress, and I believe the momentum is \nbuilding to get the legislation passed this year. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Mack and others to take an important step forward \nfor cancer patients.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 784\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Cancer Clinical \n     Trial Coverage Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. MEDICARE CANCER PATIENT DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Not later than January 1, 2000, the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this Act referred \n     to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a demonstration \n     project that provides for payment under the medicare program \n     under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 \n     et seq.) of routine patient care costs--\n       (1) that are provided to an individual diagnosed with \n     cancer and enrolled in the medicare program under such title \n     as part of the individual's participation in an approved \n     clinical trial program; and\n       (2) that are not otherwise eligible for payment under such \n     title for individuals who are entitled to benefits under such \n     title.\n       (b) Application.--The beneficiary cost-sharing provisions \n     under the medicare program, such as deductibles, coinsurance, \n     and copayment amounts, shall apply to any individual \n     participating in a demonstration project conducted under this \n     Act.\n       (c) Approved Clinical Trial Program.--For purposes of this \n     Act, the term ``approved clinical trial program'' means a \n     clinical trial program that is approved by--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health;\n       (2) a National Institutes of Health cooperative group or a \n     National Institutes of Health center;\n       (3) the Food and Drug Administration (in the form of an \n     investigational new drug or device exemption);\n       (4) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (5) the Department of Defense; or\n       (6) a qualified nongovernmental research entity identified \n     in the guidelines issued by the National Institutes of Health \n     for center support grants.\n       (d) Routine Patient Care Costs.--\n       (1) In general.--For purposes of this Act, ``routine \n     patient care costs'' shall include the costs associated with \n     the provision of items and services that--\n       (A) would otherwise be covered under the medicare program \n     if such items and services were not provided in connection \n     with an approved clinical trial program; and\n       (B) are furnished according to the design of an approved \n     clinical trial program.\n       (2) Exclusion.--For purposes of this Act, ``routine patient \n     care costs'' shall not include the costs associated with the \n     provision of--\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\n       (A) an investigational drug or device, unless the Secretary \n     has authorized the manufacturer of such drug or device to \n     charge for such drug or device; or\n       (B) any item or service supplied without charge by the \n     sponsor of the approved clinical trial program.\n\n     SEC. 3. STUDY, REPORT, AND TERMINATION.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Secretary shall study the impact on the \n     medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act \n     of covering routine patient care costs for individuals with a \n     diagnosis of cancer and other diagnoses, who are entitled to \n     benefits under such title and who are enrolled in an approved \n     clinical trial program.\n       (b) Report to Congress.--Not later than January 1, 2004, \n     the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress that contains \n     a statement regarding--\n       (1) any incremental cost to the medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act resulting from the \n     provisions of this Act; and\n       (2) a projection of expenditures under the medicare program \n     if coverage of routine patient care costs in an approved \n     clinical trial program were extended to individuals entitled \n     to benefits under the medicare program who have a diagnosis \n     other than cancer.\n       (c) Termination.--The provisions of this Act shall not \n     apply after December 31, 2004.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleagues, Senators Rockefeller and Mack to introduce legislation that \nwill provide Medicare patients who are battling cancer with coverage of \ntheir health care costs when they participate in approved clinical \ntrials. For patients suffering from life-threatening illness such as \ncancer, the opportunity to participate in clinical trials often offers \nthem their best hope for access to the latest and most advanced \ntreatment modalities.\n  Medicare currently does not pay the costs of patient care associated \nwith clinical trials because they are experimental therapies. Our bill \nproposes that we begin a demonstration project through Medicare--the \nnation's largest third party payor--to provide coverage of routine \npatient costs associated with approved cancer clinical trials. It is a \ndemonstration program because there has been much debate over the costs \nassociated with clinical trials and a clear need exists to gather \nbetter cost data. Unfortunately, dispute still exists over how to \ndistinguish between routine patient costs and those associated with the \ntrial. The full impact on health care costs is not yet known.\n  Thus our bill requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nconduct this demonstration project to study the feasibility of covering \npatient costs for beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer and enrolled in \nclinical trials approved by the National Institutes of Health, the Food \nand Drug Administration, Department of Defense, and the Department of \nVeteran Affairs. The Secretary is required to report to Congress \nconcerning the incremental costs attributed to the trial and the \nadvisability of covering other diseases. Once Congress has these data \nin hand, we will be able to make the determination to enact legislation \nto make the coverage of routine care costs in clinical trials a \npermanent part of the Medicare program.\n  We have spent many years debating this bill and urging the \nAdministration to begin this demonstration project. As a research \ninvestigator involved in clinical trials, as a thoracic cancer surgeon, \nand as co-director of the Thoracic Oncology Clinic at Vanderbilt \nUniversity Medical Center, I know first-hand the critical importance of \nclinical trials in determining the very best therapies in our battles \nagainst cancer. Only through participation in clinical trials can we \nadvance quality care for patients with cancer.\n  Since I have come to the United States Senate, I have urged my \ncolleagues to make federal funding for both basic and clinical research \na national priority by doubling the budget of the National Institutes \nof Health over the next five years. Last year we witnessed an historic \nincrease of $2 billion that brought us closer to this goal. But we \ncannot stop there. If we do not capitalize on this investment by \nfurther supporting our clinical research infrastructure and the conduct \nof clinical trials, we will not reap the full benefits of our \ninvestment.\n  Clinical trials are scientific studies that allow us to investigate \nhow new medicines and clinical treatments work in patients. Patients \nshould recognize that clinical trials are by their nature \ninvestigational and therefore are not a magic bullet or without risk. \nPatients should be fully informed of the potential benefits and, \nequally important, the potential risks of participating in a clinical \ninvestigation. With this in mind, patients should be given the \nopportunity to participate in clinical investigations which may allow \nthem to receive cutting-edge treatments that may improve their chances \nof survival. Clinical investigations advance our scientific knowledge \nand help bring about medical innovations to find better treatments for \npatients.\n\n  We must continue to foster both public and private efforts to support \nclinical trials. I believe our foremost federal responsibility is to \naddress access to clinical trials in our publicly-financed programs \nsuch as Medicare. We must first determine the criteria the Medicare \nprogram will use to evaluate which clinical trials are eligible for \ncoverage and which costs will be covered. This has not been an easy \ntask.\n  We have also been reviewing the proposal to require private health \nplans and insurers to cover routine costs associated with standard \npatient care while participating in a clinical trial. The Senate Health \nand Education Committee, on which I serve, had an informative debate \nlast month on the issue of clinical trials coverage during our \nconsideration of S. 326, ``The Patients' Bill of Rights.'' The \namendment we were considering went beyond the Medicare demonstration \nproject by requiring private sector health plans to cover costs \nassociated with clinical trials for patients with any life-threatening \nor serious illness. Several members of our committee, including myself, \nexpressed concern that before mandating such broad requirements on the \nprivate sector, we should first determine what costs would be incurred. \nIn a time of rising health care costs, we must be cautious in our \nefforts to provide patient protections that do not drive up costs \nfurther or we will not be serving patients well.\n  Therefore, I offered an amendment to have a comprehensive study \nconducted by the Institute of Medicine to assess patient access to \nclinical trials and the coverage of routine patient care costs by \nprivate health plans and insurers. Our efforts should not end there. \nThat is just the beginning. I am encouraged by recent collaborative \nefforts between the National Institutes of Health and the American \nAssociation of Health Plans to increase participation of patients in \nclinical trials and to encourage health plans to cover routine patient \ncosts. We need to monitor this effort closely and explore other ways to \npromote public-private collaboration and to gather the necessary data \nthat will reveal the true impact on health care costs. I will continue \nto pursue this effort in a systematic way with my colleagues.\n  We must not wait any longer to launch the Medicare demonstration \nproject that our bill today addresses. The longer we wait, the longer \npatients are denied access to potentially life-saving therapies and the \nlonger it will take for new therapies to become standard therapy. And \nwe must continue to address the issue of clinical trial coverage by the \nprivate sector to bring about patients' access to new clinical \ntherapies while being mindful of the costs we are imposing. Patients \nand their families deserve that we give thoughtful consideration to \nboth of these legislative proposals this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Sarbanes, Ms. \n        Collins, and Mr. Lott):\n  S. 786. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to \nprovide that a monthly insurance benefit thereunder shall be paid for \nthe month in which the recipient dies, subject to a reduction of 50 \npercent if the recipient dies during the first 15 days of such month, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 social security family protection act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to talk about an issue \nthat is very important to me, very important to my constituents in \nMaryland and very important to the people of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  For the third Congress in a row, I am joining in a bipartisan effort \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe, to end an unfair \npolicy of the Social Security System.\n  Senator Snowe and I are introducing the Social Security Family \nProtection Act. This bill addresses retirement security and family \nsecurity. We want\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nthe middle class of this Nation to know that we are going to give help \nto those who practice self-help.\n  What is it I am talking about? We have found that Social Security \ndoes not pay benefits for the last month of life. If a Social Security \nretiree dies on the 18th of the month or even on the 30th of the month, \nthe surviving spouse or family members must send back the Social \nSecurity check for that month.\n  I think that is a harsh and heartless rule. That individual worked \nfor Social Security benefits, earned those benefits, and paid into the \nSocial Security trust fund. The system should allow the surviving \nspouse or the estate of the family to use that Social Security check \nfor the last month of life.\n  This legislation has an urgency, Mr. President. When a loved one \ndies, there are expenses that the family must take care of. People have \ncalled my office in tears. Very often it is a son or a daughter that is \ngrieving the death of a parent. They are clearing up the paperwork for \ntheir mom or dad, and there is the Social Security check. And they say, \n``Senator, the check says for the month of May. Mom died on May 28. Why \ndo we have to send the Social Security check back? We have bills to \npay. We have utility coverage that we need to wrap up, mom's rent, or \nher mortgage, or health expenses. Why is Social Security telling me, \n`Send the check back or we're going to come and get you'?''\n  With all the problems in our country today, we ought to be going \nafter drug dealers and tax dodgers, not honest people who have paid \ninto Social Security, and not the surviving spouse or the family who \nhave been left with the bills for the last month of their loved one's \nlife. They are absolutely right when they call me and say that Social \nSecurity was supposed to be there for them.\n  That is what our bill is going to do. That is why Senator Snowe and I \nare introducing the Family Social Security Protection Act. When we talk \nabout retirement security, the most important part of that is income \nsecurity. And the safety net for most Americans is Social Security.\n  We know that as Senators we have to make sure that Social Security \nremains solvent, and we are working to do that. We also don't want to \ncreate an undue administrative burden at the Social Security \nAdministration--a burden that might affect today's retirees. But it is \nabsolutely crucial that we provide a Social Security check for the last \nmonth of life.\n  How do we propose to do that? We have a very simple, straightforward \nway of dealing with this problem. Our legislation says that if you die \nbefore the 15th of the month, you will get a check for half the month. \nIf you die after the 15th of the month, your surviving spouse or the \nfamily estate would get a check for the full month.\n  We think this bill is fundamentally fair. Senator Snowe and I are \nold-fashioned in our belief in family values. We believe you honor your \nfather and your mother. We believe that it is not only a good religious \nand moral principle, but it is good public policy as well.\n  The way to honor your father and mother is to have a strong Social \nSecurity System and to make sure the system is fair in every way. That \nmeans fair for the retiree and fair for the spouse and family. That is \nwhy we support making sure that the surviving spouse or family can keep \nthe Social Security check for the last month of life.\n  Mr. President, we urge our colleagues to join us in this effort and \nsupport the Social Security Family Protection Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS (for himself, Mr. Enzi and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 788. A bill to amend the Federal Meat Inspection Act to provide \nthat a quality grade label issued by the Secretary of Agriculture may \nnot be used for imported meat and meat food products; to the Committee \non Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   usda grade rescission act of 1999\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to sponsor a bill on an issue \nof great importance to my state and the agricultural industry. The \nissue is that of rescinding the USDA Grade Stamp on foreign meat \nproducts coming into America from other countries and unfairly \nreceiving the USDA Grade Stamp.\n  This language offered today will insure that all meat products \nimported from a foreign country will not be graded USDA. For years \nother countries have used the USDA Grade Stamp to their advantage. \nParticularly, Canada and Mexico ship livestock into the United States \nand reap the benefits of the premium given for USDA Prime, USDA Choice \nor USDA Select.\n  USDA Prime and USDA Choice grades are given a premium price. \nCompetition from foreign countries effectively prevents that same \nnumber of American livestock producers from receiving a premium. USDA \nshould mean just that the meat was raised and slaughtered in the United \nStates, and given the stamp by the United States Department of \nAgriculture.\n  Currently, boxed beef is not eligible to receive the USDA Grade \nStamp. However, agricultural producers across the border ship livestock \nto the United States and feed them for a short period of time in order \nto bypass that restriction. The animals are then slaughtered here as \nUnited States product. This is not only unfair, it is a betrayal of \ntrust. It is one that we will no longer tolerate. My bill provides for \na 90 day feeding period to prevent this from happening, yet maintain \nthe profits light-weight cattle from foreign countries bring to \nAmerican feeders.\n  The huge influx of imports from both Canada and Mexico that American \nagricultural producers are currently faced with has provided an added \nhardship to the agricultural economy. Additionally, when consumers see \nthe USDA Grade Stamp on a meat product they are under the assumption \nthey are buying U.S. made product. In fact, this is usually not the \ncase. Even though carcasses are required to have a ``foreign origin \nmarking'', it is trimmed off for marketing purposes.\n  Essentially, this bill will protect both the American producer and \nthe American consumer. The USDA Grade Stamp on foreign product is a \ndetriment to both. It is a detriment to the producer because foreign \ncountries get the benefit of the grade stamp, without having to pay for \nit. America's producers need the assurance that the USDA label really \nmeans just that--produced in the U.S. It is a detriment to the consumer \nbecause they deserve to know that they are buying American. I've said \nit before and I'll say it again. U.S. consumers deserve to know that \nthey are buying absolutely the safest food supply in the world, which \nis grown by American farmers and ranchers. With this in mind we then \nshould be informing the American consumer that they really are \npurchasing American product.\n  I am proud and very pleased to serve as sponsor of this bill and I \nlook forward to moving it through the legislative process so we may \ngive our consumers and producers the information and advantage of \nknowing their meat was produced in the USA.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 789. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to authorize \npayment of special compensation to certain severely disabled uniformed \nservices retirees; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n  Legislation to Authorize Special Pay For Severely Disabled Retired \n                                Veterans\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \nauthorize special compensation for severely disabled military retirees \nwho suffer under an existing law regarding ``concurrent receipt.'' As \nmany of my colleagues know, current law requires military retirees who \nare rated as disabled to offset their military retired pay by the \namount they receive in veterans' disability compensation. This \nrequirement is discriminatory and wrong.\n  Today, America's disabled military retirees--those individuals who \ndedicated their careers to military service, and who suffered disabling \ninjuries in the course of that service--cannot receive concurrently \ntheir military retirement pay, which they have earned through at least \n20 years of service in the Armed Forces, and their veterans' disability \ncompensation, which they are owed due to pain and suffering incurred \nfrom military service. In other words, the law penalizes the very men \nand women who have sacrificed their physical or psychological well-\nbeing in uniformed service to their country.\n  The legislation I am introducing today does not provide for full \npayment\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nto eligible veterans of both the disability compensation and the \nretired pay they have earned. I regret that such a proposal, which I \nsupport in principle, would be far more expensive than many of my \ncolleagues could accept. I learned that lesson the hard way in the \ncourse of sponsoring more ambitious concurrent receipt proposals in \nprevious Congresses.\n  My current legislation would instead authorize special compensation \nfor the most severely disabled retired veterans--those who have served \nfor at least 20 years, and who have disability ratings of between 70 \nand 100 percent. More specifically, it would authorize monthly payments \nof $300 for totally disabled retired veterans; $200 for retirees rated \nas 90 percent disabled; and $100 for retirees with disability ratings \nof 70-80 percent.\n  These men and women suffer from disabilities that have kept them from \npursuing second careers. If we cannot muster the votes to provide them \nwith their disability pay and retired pay concurrently, the least we \ncan do is authorize a modest special compensation package to \ndemonstrate that we have not forgotten their sacrifices. At $42 million \nper year, this legislation comes nowhere near approaching the price tag \nof more expansive concurrent receipt proposals. Moreover, it involves \nonly discretionary, not mandatory, spending.\n  In short, it is affordable. And it is the right thing to do. But \ndon't take my word for it. The Military Coalition, an organization of \n30 prominent veterans' and retirees' advocacy groups, supports my \nlegislation, as do many other veterans' service organizations, \nincluding the American Legion and Disabled American Veterans. These \nhighly respected organizations recognize, as I do, that severely \ndisabled military retirees deserve, at a minimum, special compensation \nfor the honorable service they have rendered the United States.\n  My interest in actively resolving the concurrent receipt issue dates \nto 1993, when I included a provision in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense \nAuthorization bill directing the Department of Defense (DoD) to submit \na concurrent receipt legislative proposal to the House and Senate Armed \nServices Committees. When that deadline was not met, I took the \nopportunity at a Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee hearing \nto ask the then-Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military \nManpower and Personnel Policy about the status of the concurrent \nreceipt report. Although he replied that Congress would receive it in \nJune 1993, the report arrived seven months late. Clearly, the \nconcurrent receipt issue was not then a DoD priority, nor is it today.\n  I also worked with the Armed Services Committee to include \nlegislation in the FY 1994 Defense Authorization bill to exempt \nmilitary retirees who are rated as 100 percent disabled from the \nrequirement to offset their military pay by the amount they receive in \nveterans' disability pay. Although I had assumed that no one could deny \na military retiree with 100 percent disability from receiving both his \nretirement and his disability pay, my legislation was never enacted \ninto law.\n  Undeterred, in 1994 I introduced legislation, which was included in \nthe Senate version of the Defense Appropriations bill for FY 1995, \ndirecting the Secretary of Defense to authorize the concurrent payment \nof military retired pay and veterans' disability compensation. Although \nmy amendment had 16 cosponsors and received bipartisan support in the \nSenate, it was regrettably reduced to just a study by the House of \nRepresentatives during conference negotiations on the bill.\n  This amendment was heralded by more than 30 separate veterans' \nassociations as a means of redressing the unjust offset of retirement \npay with disability compensation. It provided for concurrent payment of \nretirement and disability compensation if the following criteria were \nmet:\n  (1) the veteran had completed 20 years of military service;\n  (2) the disability was incurred or aggravated in the performance of \nduty in military service; and\n  (3) the disability was rated as 100 percent at the time of retirement \nor within four years of the veteran's retirement date.\n  I introduced these concurrent receipt amendments because the existing \nrequirement that military retired pay be offset dollar-for-dollar by \nveterans' disability compensation is inequitable. I firmly believe that \nnon-disability military retired pay is post-service compensation for \nservices rendered in the United States military. Veterans' disability \npay, on the other hand, is compensation for a physical or mental \ndisability incurred from the performance of such service. In my view, \nthe two pays are for very different purposes: one for service rendered \nand the other for physical or mental ``pain and suffering.'' This is an \nimportant distinction evident to any military retiree currently forced \nto offset his retirement pay with disability compensation.\n  Concurrent receipt is, at its core, a fairness issue, and present law \nsimply discriminates against career military people. Retired veterans \nare the only group of federal retirees who are required to waive their \nretirement pay in order to receive VA disability. This inequity needs \nto be corrected.\n  In the 105th Congress, I was proud to have co-sponsored S. 657, a \nbill sponsored by Senator Daschle that would eliminate the offset on a \ngraduated scale based on the inverse of the retiree's disability \nrating. For instance, a veteran who is 90 percent disabled would have \nto offset his retirement pay by an amount equal to 10 percent of his \ntotal VA disability. This compromise would establish the right of a \ndisabled military retiree to receive at least a portion of his earned \nmilitary retirement. Unfortunately, the full Congress did not act on \nthis legislation before adjourning in October 1998.\n  In the past, Congressional attempts to rectify discrimination against \ndisabled career service members have been accompanied by staggering \ncost estimates, dooming to failure again and again proposed remedies to \nthe concurrent receipt dilemma. The concurrent receipt legislation I \nsupported in the 105th Congress reflected an attempt to ease the offset \nburden on retired disabled service members while avoiding significant \ndeficit expansion. My current legislation in the 106th Congress is even \nmore conscious of the costs associated with properly compensating \ndisabled military retirees.\n  Unfortunately, cost concerns must remain a consideration as we seek \nto promote a system of concurrent receipt that is both equitable and \nconsistent with our balanced budget objective. While I would prefer to \nimplement a system aimed first and foremost at severely disabled \nveterans, as my earlier legislation proposed, I believe S. 657 \nrepresented a step in the right direction and was worthy of Congress' \nsupport. Similarly, I believe the special compensation authorized by my \ncurrent legislation makes progress by targeting the most severely \ndisabled veterans, even if it does not revoke the discriminatory \nconcurrent receipt restrictions that remain in place today.\n  I continue to hope that the Pentagon, once it finally understands our \nmessage that it cannot continue to unfairly penalize disabled military \nretirees, will provide Congress with a fair and equitable plan to \nproperly compensate retired service members with disabilities. It is \nhard to disagree with the simple logic that disabled veterans both need \nand deserve our full support after the untold sacrifices they made in \ndefense of this country.\n  I look forward to the day when our disabled retirees are no longer \nunduly penalized by existing limitations on concurrent receipt of the \nbenefits they deserve. In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 789\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nrequire manufacturers of bottled water to submit annual reports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n         the bottled water safety and right-to-know act of 1999\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Bottled \nWater Safety and Right-to-Know Act of 1999. This legislation is \ndesigned to ensure that bottled water safety standards protect public \nhealth, and to give consumers the right to know about contaminants in \ntheir bottled water.\n  Mr. President, I have been interested in bottled water for several \nyears. Bottled water consumption has doubled in the U.S. since 1987, \nlargely due to the public perception that bottled water is cleaner and \nsafer than tap water. This is especially true in my state, where we \nhear so often about contamination of tap water. Unfortunately, bottled \nwater today does not have to meet all the same safety standards met by \ntap water. Nor do consumers have the right to know about the \ncontaminats found in bottled water. Let me discuss each of these issues \nin more detail.\n  There is an important disparity between contaminant standards for \nbottled water and those for tap water. Bottled water is regulated as a \nfood by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Food, Drug, \nand Cosmetic Act, while tap water is regulated by the Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA). Unfortunately, several contaminants are \nregulated less stringently in bottled water by the FDA than in tap \nwater by the EPA. In particular, the FDA has no standard for phthalate, \na probable human carcinogen which leaches out of some plastic bottles, \nno ban on fecal coliform of E. Coli, and weaker standards for several \nother contaminants. In addition, the infrastructure guaranteeing the \nsafety of bottled water is far weaker than the regulatory programs the \nEPA and its state and local partners have established for tap water.\n  There is, in addition, a disparity in the transparency of information \nabout the two types of water. Public water systems have long been \nrequired to monitor contaminant levels and allow no more than a maximum \namount of contamination in their water. Facing only these regulatory \nrequirements, however, water companies had little incentive to provide \nmore than the minimum-required level of drinking water protection. The \nSafe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 changed that by adding \nconsumer Right-to-Know requirements to the existing regulatory \nprograms. The purpose of the Right to Know requirements is to increase \npublic understanding of drinking water threats, foster public demand \nfor prevention of those threats, and thereby lead water companies and \nstate and local agencies to go beyond the minimum requirements in \npreventing the threats.\n  Unfortunately, no equivalent Right to Know exists for bottled water. \nCustomers have no way to know whether the bottled product--hundreds of \ntimes more expensive than what comes out of the tap--is the safer, \ncleaner product. In other words, Mr. President, bottled water is the \nsnake oil of the 1990's--it is sold as a cleaner product purely on the \nbasis of claims and perception, not facts.\n  The Bottled Water Safety and Right-to-Know Act of 1999 would correct \nthese deficiencies, establishing contaminant standards and Right-to-\nKnow requirements for bottled water at least as stringent as those \nplaced on tap water.\n  First, the bill would give the FDA two years to make all standards \nfor contaminants in bottled water as protective of public health as the \ntap water standards established by the EPA, the State of California, \nthe World Health Organization, and the European Union. If the FDA \nfailed to implement this requirement, the bill would transfer \nregulatory authority over bottled water to the EPA.\n  Second, the bill would require that bottled water companies list, on \ntheir products' labels, the concentration of any regulated contaminant \nfound at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects, and of any \nother contaminants whose presence in tap water would be disclosed to \nthe public under federal law. Bottled water without contamination would \nrequire no such contaminant labelling. In addition, labels would name \nthe source of the water, the type of treatment applied, and whether the \ntreatment meets the EPA's criteria of full protection of immuno-\ncompromised individuals from Cryptosporidium and other microbial \npathogens.\n  Finally, the bill would require bottled water companies to send the \nFDA information on the contaminants in the water, the source of the \nwater, and type of treatment applied.

\nTO FULLY FUND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION UNDER THE INDIVIDUALS \n                         WITH DISABILITIES ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Gregg, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lott, Mr. \nDeWine, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Ashcroft, \nand Mr. Coverdell) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas all children deserve a quality education, including \n     children with disabilities;\n       Whereas Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children v. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 334 F. Supp. 1247 (E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills v. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia, 348 F. Supp. 866 (Dist. D. C. 1972), found that \n     children with disabilities are guaranteed an equal \n     opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment to the \n     Constitution;\n       Whereas the Congress responded to these court decisions by \n     passing the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 (enacted as Public Law 94-142), now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 \n     et seq.), to ensure a free, appropriate public education for \n     children with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n     provides that the Federal, State, and local governments are \n     to share in the expense of educating children with \n     disabilities and commits the Federal Government to pay up to \n     40 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for \n     children with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Federal Government has provided only 9, 11, and \n     12 percent of the maximum State grant allocation for \n     educating children with disabilities under the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act in the last 3 years, \n     respectively;\n       Whereas the national average cost of educating a special \n     education student ($13,323) is more than twice the national \n     average per pupil cost ($6,140);\n       Whereas research indicates that children who are \n     effectively taught, including effective instruction aimed at \n     acquiring literacy skills, and who receive positive early \n     interventions demonstrate academic progress, and are \n     significantly less likely to be referred to special \n     education;\n       Whereas the high cost of educating children with \n     disabilities and the Federal Government's failure to fully \n     meet its obligation under the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act drain school budgets, jeopardize the quality of \n     education provided by local schools, and place a significant \n     burden on State and local taxpayers;\n       Whereas if the appropriation for part B of the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411 et seq.) \n     exceeds $4,924,672,200 for a fiscal year, the State funding \n     formula will shift from one based solely on the number of \n     children with disabilities in the State to one based on 85 \n     percent of the children ages 3 to 21 living in the State and \n     15 percent based on children living in poverty in the State, \n     enabling States to undertake good practices for addressing \n     the learning needs of more children in the regular education \n     classroom and reduce over identification of children who may \n     not need to be referred to special education;\n       Whereas the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has \n     been successful in achieving significant increases in the \n     number of children with disabilities who receive a free, \n     appropriate public education;\n       Whereas the current level of Federal funding to States and \n     localities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \n     Act is contrary to the goal of ensuring that children with \n     disabilities receive a quality education; and\n       Whereas the Federal Government has failed to appropriate 40 \n     percent of the national average per pupil expenditure per \n     child with a disability as required under the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act to assist States and \n     localities to educate children with disabilities: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress and the President--\n       (1) should, working within the constraints of the balanced \n     budget agreement, give programs under the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) the \n     highest priority among Federal elementary and secondary \n     education programs by meeting the commitment to fund the \n     maximum State grant allocation for educating children with \n     disabilities under such Act prior to authorizing or \n     appropriating funds for any new education initiative; and\n       (2) should meet the commitment described in paragraph (1) \n     while retaining the commitment to fund existing Federal \n     education programs that increase student achievement.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, joined by many of my colleagues, \nI am submitting a Senate concurrent resolution calling for a delay in \nauthorizing or appropriating of funds for new educational initiatives \nuntil we fully fund IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. My colleague, Representative Goodling, is introducing a companion \nresolution in the House today as well.\n  In 1975 Congress made a commitment to contribute up to 40 percent of \nthe national average per pupil expenditure (APPE) for each child with a \ndisability being educated by our Nation's schools. We are nowhere close \nto that target of 40 percent. We are committed to achieving that \ntarget, and until we do reach the target, we should refrain from \nundertaking major new education commitments.\n  According to the latest estimates from the Department of Education, \nthis school year there are 6.1 million children with disabilities being \nserved by our Nation's schools. States and local communities are \nspending $72.9 billion of non-federal dollars to educate\n\n[[Page S3655]]\n\nthese children. The federal contribution available to use in this \nschool year is $3.8 billion. That level of funding represents 10.8 \npercent of the national average per pupil expenditure for each child \nwith a disability. That represents a mere $635.83 per child. It's time \nto deliver on the missing 29.2 percent.\n  In a letter of March 24, 1999, the National School Boards Association \nurges us to increase funding for IDEA by $2.1 billion a year for the \nnext ten years. It reports that 38 cents of every new tax dollar is \nbeing spent on special education. Local school districts desperately \nneed our help. If IDEA had been fully funded in fiscal year 1999, my \nState, Vermont, would have received $20 million more than the $5.7 \nmillion it will receive this July 1.\n  By putting our urge to create and fund new initiatives on hold and by \nfocusing on increased funding for IDEA as our first priority, we will \nbe giving relief to school districts, resources to teachers, hope to \nparents, and opportunities to children with disabilities.\n  Please join us in cosponsoring this important resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3655-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3655]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ESTABLISHING THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE \n                        UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DOMENICI AMENDMENT NO. 252\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI proposed an amendment to the motion to instruct \nconferees proposed by Mr. Kennedy to the concurrent resolution (H.

Ripken Sr. retired in 1992, having spent 36 years with the \nOrioles' organization.\n  I will never forget going to the ball park, year after year, and \nseeing the competitive fire Cal Ripken Sr. brought to the Orioles.

His spirit will live forever \nin the hearts of every Baltimore Oriole and every Oriole fan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3656-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING INNOVATIVE EDUCATION AT OAK HARBOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize a \nschool in Oak Harbor, Washington for their wonderful success in \nbecoming a `school of choice.' Oak Harbor Elementary is another shining \nexample for why I began my ``Innovation in Education Award'' program--\nto highlight to my colleagues in the good things that are happening in \neducation at the local level.\n  When Oak Harbor Elementary underwent a massive remodel of its north \nannex, originally built in 1934, it had the opportunity to add 200 more \nstudents to its student body. Rather than change attendance boundary \nareas, the school board and superintendent saw it as an opportunity to \nmake it a magnet school to draw students from the most crowded schools \nin the district.\n  Over the course of a year, Principal Glenda Merwine met with parents \nand staff to determine what the ideal elementary school could look \nlike. After many meetings, surveys, and discussions, the school chose \nto make a series of reforms including: requiring uniforms for all \nstudents in grades K-5; including curriculum in every classroom about \nvarious positive character traits like honesty, generosity and \nintegrity; requiring parent compacts for participation in their \nchildren's education; and eventually implementing strong fine arts \nprograms.\n  With this innovative new structure, Oak Harbor Elementary attracted \nover 200 student transfers from other schools including private schools \nand home-schooled children in the area.\n  The Oak Harbor ``school of choice'' is now in its second semester \nunder the new plan. Staff and parents are highly enthusiastic over the \nimproved discipline, motivation and achievements of the entire student \nbody. Ms. Merwine said she has seen a dramatic change in the students' \nattitudes. The student body at Oak Harbor Elementary has increased by \n230, yet Ms. Merwine said suspensions and disciplinary incidents \ndecreased dramatically.\n  She gave one example of how the uniforms have brought down artificial \nbarriers between students. Last year, a kindergartener frequently asked \nMs. Merwine or a teacher to play with her, claiming the other children \nwouldn't. Ms. Merwine eventually observed another student telling the \ngirl she wouldn't play with her because she wasn't wearing the ``right \nbrand of jeans.'' This year, on the first day of school, Ms. Merwine \nsaid she saw the same two girls--now in 1st grade and wearing nearly \nidentical uniforms--happily playing in the school yard.\n  I hope my colleagues will recognize the importance educators like \nGlenda Merwine, and the exciting things happening in our local schools \nwhen they are given the freedom to innovate. I for one, want to do all \nI can to increase their flexibility and resources so local educators--\nour parents, teachers, principals, school board members and \nsuperintendents--can continue to make the best decisions about the \neducation of our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3656-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3656]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MICHAEL ``MICK'' BIRD AND THE TRANS-OCEANIC ROWING EXPEDITION\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my \ncolleagues' attention to a very exciting expedition. In September 1998, \nMr. Michael ``Mick'' Bird completed the second leg of an unprecedented \n24,000 mile voyage around the world. On August 19, 1997, Mick Bird \nstarted rowing out to sea from Fort Bragg, California in his vessel \nReach. After 66 days of rowing, on October 23, 1997, Mick arrived in \nHilo Bay on the Big Island of Hawaii.\n  After putting the Reach in drydock in Hawaii, Mick returned to his \nhome base in California to raise support and prepare for the next leg \nof his historic journey. Mick returned to Hawaii last summer and put to \nsea in Reach on July 18, 1998 rowing for the Gilbert Islands, about \n2500 miles southwest of Hawaii and halfway point between Hawaii and \nAustralia. On September 22, 1998, 66 days and more than 2200 miles from \nHawaii, Mick made landfall on Majuro in the Marshall Islands, a bit \nnorth of his intended destination in the Gilberts. Mick is now happily \nhome in California with his family preparing for his next leg to the \nnorth central coast of Australia; another 2500 mile row.\n  Mick Bird, a former U.S. Air Force officer, is of Pacific Island \ndescent and has family ties to the State of Hawaii. His voyage is more \nformally known as Trans-Oceanic, which is the name of the non-profit \norganization sponsoring this attempt at the world's first solo \ncircumnavigation of the globe by a rowing vessel. The goals of this \nexpedition are, among others, to explore the limits of the human \nspirit, to raise awareness about ocean ecosystems, to be an example of \nindividual achievement as well as teamwork, and to generate support for \nthe National Tuberous Sclerosis Association. The expedition is also \nusing its World Wide Web sites (www.naau.com and www.goals.com/\ntransrow) to create a direct link between Mick's vessel Reach and \neducators and students to share experiences and practical applications \nof math, science and geography.\n  I would like to congratulate Mr. Bird on his very impressive \naccomplishments to this point, and to express my good wishes for the \nsafety and success of the rest of this voyage around the world. I also \nwish to commend him and Trans-Oceanic for enhancing public awareness \nand education. I encourage my colleagues to have a look at Trans-\nOceanic's web sites and share them with educators at home to follow \nalong with this amazing journey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3656-4", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3656-S3657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO EDITH SCHMIDTCHEN ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

He has served the many members of organized labor in my \nhome state for over 25 years and at his retirement, he is to be honored \nfor his contributions to the Sheet Metal Workers Union.\n  Born and raised in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, Carol graduated \nfrom the Trenton High Vocational Sheet Metal Program. He began his \ncareer by serving a four-year apprenticeship with Sheet Metal Workers \nLocal #27, where he has remained a member until this day. He has served \nhis union as a local Union Shop Steward, Trustee, Executive Board \nMember, and as a member of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Fund. Carl \nalso served as a Trustee of the Education Fund, monitoring and managing \nthe Financial Training Facility and Teacher programs. As a member of \nthe Supplemental Unemployment Fund Board, Carl has helped his union \ncolleagues during periods of unemployment.\n  Carl was elected as Business Representative of Local 27 in 1990. In \nthis new position, he adeptly represented the concerns and the welfare \nof his Union in labor disputes and corrected violations of collective \nbargaining agreements. He was also responsible for the daily work \nassignments of all Local members and attended labor seminars in an \neffort to protect the union rights.\n  He has proudly served his members by serving on the Contract \nNegotiating Committee, and attending rallies to garner support for pro-\nlabor legislation. He recently became a Trustee of the New Jersey State \nLabor Council of Sheet Metal Workers, a member of both the Camden \nCounty Building Trades Council and the Warren County Building Trades \nCouncil. For over two years, Carl has served as Financial Secretary-\nTreasurer of the Mercer-Burlington Counties and Vicinities Building \nTrades Council.\n  On the eve of his retirement, it brings me great pleasure to \nrecognize the accomplishments of Carl Sommers and his actions and \nefforts should be commended. The New Jersey labor community should be \nproud to have had Carl as a member and should be assured that he will \ncontinue to monitor and participate in the labor movement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3657-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO BRAVE GEORGIAN RESCUERS\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize three \nGeorgians who went above and beyond the call of duty in a daring rescue \nmission yesterday. We watched with awe as Robert Clines, Larry Rogers \nand Matt Mosely successfully rescued Ivers Sims, a construction worker \nwho found himself suspended some 180-feet in the air trapped by a \nraging fire.\n  Roger Clines, a Georgia Department of Natural Resources pilot, and \nhis navigator Larry Rogers negotiated their helicopter through \ntreacherous wind, smoke and fire, as Atlanta firefighter Matt Mosely \ndangled on a rope to rescue Mr. Sims--a dramatic and heroic scene.\n  I want to take a moment to recognize and honor the teamwork, \ndedication and bravery that resulted in this successful rescue mission. \nThese three men, in the true spirit of heroism, risked their lives for \nthe sake of a fellow human being.\n  Addtiionally, I would like to take this opportunity to honor and pay \ntribute to all of Atlanta's firefighters, the Atlanta police officers, \nSheriff's deputies, and the Cabbagetown residents themselves, who \nworked together to fight the massive fire that engulfed the historic \ncotton mill. Our firefighters, facing shortages of equipment and \npersonnel, heroically fought and contained a fire that could have \ndestroyed an historic neighborhood currently being revitalized. \nResidents at home during the fire helped by rescuing neighbors' pets, \nand used garden hoses to extinguished burning debris.\n  As devastating as it was for residents of Atlanta's Cabbagetown to \nwatch this historic landmark burn, the heroism of the day--like \nAtlanta's symbol the Phoenix--rose from the ashes. Although we mourn \nthe loss of this historic landmark, it is good to know that we will \nremember this day not for the tragedy that could have been, but for the \nheroism that was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3657-3", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3657-S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL LIBRARY WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week from April 11-17 we are \ncelebrating the 41st anniversary of ``National Library Week.'' As a \nstrong and vigorous supporter of Federal initiatives to strengthen and \nprotect libraries, I am pleased to take this opportunity to draw my \ncolleagues' attention to this important occasion and to take a few \nmoments to reflect on the significance of libraries to our nation.\n  When the free public library came into its own in this country in the \n19th century, it was, from the beginning, a unique institution because \nof its commitment to the same principle of free and open exchange of \nideas as the Constitution itself. Libraries have always been an \nintegral part of all that our country embodies: freedom of information, \nan educated citizenry, and an open and enlightened society. They are \nthe only public agencies in which the services rendered are intended \nfor, and available to, every segment of our society.\n  It has been my longstanding view that libraries play an indispensable \nrole in our communities. From modest beginnings in the mid-19th \ncentury, today's libraries provide well-stocked reference centers and \nwide-ranging loan services based on a system of branches, often further \nsupplemented by travelling libraries serving outlying districts. \nLibraries promote the reading of books among adults, adolescents, and \nchildren and provide the access and resources to allow citizens to \nobtain reliable information on a vast array of topics.\n  Libraries gain even further significance in this age of rapid \ntechnological advancement where they are called upon to provide not \nonly books and periodicals, but many other valuable resources as well. \nIn today's society, libraries provide audio-visual materials, computer \nservices, internet access terminals, facilities for community lectures \nand performances, tapes, records, videocassettes, and works of art for \nexhibit and loan to the public. In addition, special facilities \nlibraries provide services for older Americans, people with \ndisabilities, and hospitalized citizens.\n  Of course, libraries are not merely passive repositories of \nmaterials. They are engines of learning--the place where a spark is \noften struck for disadvantaged citizens who for whatever reason have \nnot had exposure to the vast stores of knowledge available. I have the \ngreatest respect for those individuals who are members of the library \ncommunity and work so hard to ensure that our citizens and communities \ncontinue to enjoy the tremendous rewards available through our library \nsystem.\n  My own State of Maryland has 24 public library systems providing a \nfull range of library services to all Maryland citizens and a long \ntradition of open and unrestricted sharing of resources. This policy \nhas been enhanced by the State Library Network which provides \ninterlibrary loans to the State's public, academic, special libraries \nand school library media centers. The Network receives strong support \nfrom the State Library Resource Center at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, \nthe Regional Library Resource Centers in Western, Southern, and Eastern \nShore counties, and a Statewide database of holdings totalling 178 \nlibraries.\n  The result of this unique joint State-County resource sharing is an \nextraordinary level of library services available to the citizens of \nMaryland. Marylanders have responded to this outstanding service by \nborrowing more public library materials per person than citizens of \nalmost any other State, with 67 percent of the State's population \nregistered as library patrons.\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\n  I have had a close working relationship with members of the Maryland \nLibrary Association and others involved in the library community \nthroughout the State, and I am very pleased to join with them and \ncitizens throughout the nation in this week's celebration of ``National \nLibrary Week.'' I look forward to a continued close association with \nthose who enable libraries to provide the unique and vital services \navailable to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3658-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO STANLEY J. CHERRY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Stanley J. \nCherry, a World War I veteran and extraordinary citizen of Grand \nTraverse County, Michigan, who was recently awarded France's highest \ntribute, the Legion of Honor.\n  A son of Polish immigrants, Stanley Cherry enlisted in the United \nStates Army in May 1918, after which time he was sent to England with \nthe 330th Second Machine Company Battalion where he was trained to \noperate English Vickers, French Hodgkiss, and American Browning machine \nguns. He began his service in France in October of the same year where \nhe remained after the signing of the armistice, assigned to secure \nprovisions.\n  During his 62 year marriage to his wife Lucille, the couple owned and \noperated a general store in Elmira, Michigan, for over 30 years. In \naddition to running the store they raised two daughters, Joanne Hawly \nand Jeanette Galbraith, who both currently live in Traverse City, \nMichigan.\n  In commemoration of the 80th anniversary of the signing of the \narmistice, the French government chose to honor surviving allied war \nveterans who fought in France to help defeat the German Army. A \nrepresentative of the French Consulate General office in Chicago was \npresent at the February 19th ceremony to confer upon Mr. Cherry the \nrank of Chevalier of the National Order of the Legion of Honor. \nFrance's highest honor, the Legion of Honor was founded in 1802 by \nNapoleon as a way of recognizing citizens for their contributions to \nFrance.\n  In addition to the Legion of Honor award, Mr. Cherry was presented a \ncertificate of merit voted by the Michigan Legislature and signed by \nGovernor Engler.\n  Mr. President, Stanley Cherry is an outstanding American citizen. In \nApril he will be celebrating his 103rd birthday. I salute him for his \nmany remarkable contributions as a veteran and for his commitment to \nhis community and family. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nhim on being conferred the rank of Chevalier of the Legion of \nHonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3658-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3658]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING CASSADAGA JOB CORPS\n\n Mr. SCHUMER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nRaimondo Family as they are honored by the Fort Lee Chamber of Commerce \nas Family of the Year. The Raimondo name and family are synonymous with \nthe rich history of the Borough of Fort Lee.\n  Carmelo Raimondo, who emigrated from the Province of Coscenza in \nSouthern Italy, founded Raimondo Construction with his wife Madeline \nBattaglia in 1923. In 1942, they moved to Fort Lee with their two sons \nFrank and Charles. Since that time, numerous members of the Raimondo \nfamily have helped build Raimondo Construction into the pinnacle of \nsuccess that it is today. Raimondo Construction has been an integral \npart of the Fort Lee community, and the Raimondos have helped to make \nFort Lee the Borough that it is.\n  The Raimondo Family is now spread throughout Bergen County and across \nthe country, and every member of the family continues to be active in \ntheir community. Whether it is serving the United States in the Navy, \ncaring for the sick as a nurse, or shaping the youth of our nation in \nthe Boy Scouts, the Raimondo Family has contributed a great deal to \nsociety. They have worked on behalf of a diverse pool of civic \norganizations such as Christie Muhaw Scholarship Fund, the New Jersey \nSymphony, the Church of the Good Shepard, the York Street Project in \nJersey City, the Bergen 200 Club, the Police Honor League of New \nJersey, the Fort Lee Council of Youth and Community Services, and the \nBergen County Catholic Youth Organization. The Raimondo Family has set \na standard of community activism that we should all strive to meet.\n  The story of the Raimondo Family is the story of the American dream. \nIt is the story of Carmelo Raimondo coming to America in search of the \nopportunity that this great country offers. The success that the \nRaimondos have experienced is a testament to the fact that America is \ntruly the land of opportunity. My grandparents also came to America in \nsearch of opportunity, and it is this common experience that has built \na bond between myself and the Raimondo Family.\n  I am proud to recognize the Raimondos on this occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3658-5", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3658-S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ROCKVILLE HIGH SCHOOL RAMPAGE\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate a group of \nyoung constituents and journalists at Rockville High School's \nnewspaper, The Rampage. This year, the students on the staff of The \nRampage and their journalism teacher, Kevin Keegan, won recognition as \nthe best student newspaper in Maryland for the seventh year in a row. I \nam proud of these students for putting their minds and their hearts \ninto creating a first-rate newspaper for the Rockville community.\n  More than 200 years ago, when the Framers of the United States \nConstitution created the First Amendment, they recognized and enshrined \nthe importance of a free press in a democratic society. With its \ndeclaration that no law could abridge the freedom of the press, the \nFirst Amendment also bestowed on our Nation's journalists a\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\nunique and special role. The Nation has given reporters the awesome \nresponsibility to help communicate the needs of the Nation, report on \nand analyze the functioning of government, and chronicle the day-to-day \nevents that affect our communities. In return, we hope those \njournalists recognize the importance of their responsibility and \ncarefully tend their role as stewards of public information.\n  To maintain this profoundly important and delicate relationship, it \nis essential that journalists have strong training in writing, \ninvestigation, and ethics. That is why I am so proud of The Rampage, \nits staff, and its advisor. Mr. Keegan is teaching the important \nfundamentals of journalism, instilling in these young people the power \nand obligation of a free press, and encouraging them to grow personally \nand professionally in the process. Along the way, their hard work and \ncommitment has earned these young journalists great respect and renown.\n  I would like to say a special word of thanks to The Rampage advisor, \nMr. Keegan. He is well-known in Rockville and across the state for his \ncommitment to teaching and to his students. As a journalism teacher and \nadvisor for 20 years and coach of Team Maryland, a state all-star \nacademic team, Mr. Keegan embodies all that is great and good about \neducation in America. He inspires students personally, challenges them \nacademically, and donates enormous amounts of energy and time to give \nkids the extra attention and encouragement they need to succeed. In \n1997, he was recognized statewide when Hood College in Frederick \nhonored him with its Maryland Distinguished Teacher award.\n  Mr. President, I have worked with quite a few journalists in my years \nof public service. I have been proud that many Maryland reporters and \nnews outlets have earned national reputations and honors. But I am \nuniquely proud of The Rampage today because they represent great hope \nfor maintaining a strong free press and a strong democratic society. In \ntheir ranks we may well find some of the next generation's Pulitzer \nPrize winners. I congratulate them today on their tremendous \naccomplishments and wish them all the best for their future endeavors. \nMaryland is very proud of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3659-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MS. ROSA PARKS AND MR. OLIVER W. HILL\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words today \nabout two civil rights leaders to whom this nation owes an immense debt \nof gratitude. Ms. Rosa Parks and Mr. Oliver W. Hill, both, in very \ndistinct ways, took action that has helped make our children more free, \nour society more enlightened, our culture more enriched.\n  I was pleased to add my name to the list of cosponsors of S. 531, \nlegislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Rosa Parks, who \nas everyone knows stood up to segregation by sitting down in the front \nseats of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. It is difficult to \nadequately put in words the courage it took on the part of Ms. Parks to \noppose decades of institutionalized racism. It is also hard to describe \nthe pride we feel today in Ms. Parks' action, and in how our nation's \nconscience grew, although too slowly, in response to the bus boycott \nthat followed.\n  Ms. Parks' action set off a 382-day bus boycott by 40,000 people, \nwhich in turn led to a federal court challenge and the end of \nMontgomery's segregated buses. The decade of peaceful protests that \nfollowed brought us a string of liberating Supreme Court decisions and \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1964. Today, Ms. Parks, an unassuming \nseamstress, stands like a giant in the history of the 20th century.\n  Mr. Oliver W. Hill, an aggressive attorney for the Civil Rights \nmovement, is less well known. But Mr. Hill is no less courageous, and \nthe contributions he made to this country deserve much greater \nrecognition. For that reason, I've asked the President to award him the \nPresidential Medal of Freedom.\n  I describe Mr. Hill as ``aggressive'' because he trained as a warrior \nin the cause of justice: he went to law school specifically to overturn \nPlessy v. Ferguson. His training paid off. He prevailed in Alston v. \nSchool Board of City of Norfolk to grant equal pay for African American \nteachers. And he defended the rights of African American students in \nDavis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, which was one of \nthe five cases decided as part of Brown v. The Board of Education. \nSadly, all this success was not without cost. Mr. Hill remembers the \nterrible telephone calls to his home, and the cross that was burned on \nhis yard in Richmond.\n  The courage and accomplishments of this man and this woman are truly \nhistoric and important to our nation. I hope we can pass S. 531 quickly \nto recognize Ms. Parks, and I hope the President will decide very soon \nto reward Mr. Hill with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3659-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3659-S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DR. CHARLENE R. NUNLEY, PRESIDENT OF MONTGOMERY COLLEGE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ninstallation of Dr. Charlene R. Nunley as the new President of \nMontgomery College. After a national search by the College's Board of \nTrustees, Dr. Nunley becomes the sixth President of Montgomery College, \nMaryland's largest community college, founded in 1946.\n  Dr. Nunley has already contributed enormously to this institution in \nher former position as Executive Vice President and Chief \nAdministrative Officer, where she was responsible for a $110 million \nbudget, and provided academic leadership for 40,000 credit and \nnoncredit students each year on three different campuses. Dr. Nunley \ntakes over the helm from Robert E. Parilla, whose two-decade tenure was \ncritical to the vision and growth that enabled Montgomery College to \nbecome one of Maryland's premier community colleges. Not only was Dr. \nNunley Mr. Parilla's personal choice for President, she also has been \nwith Montgomery College even longer than he, beginning her involvement \nsix months prior to the start of the Parilla Presidency. It is, in \nfact, Dr. Nunley's longevity that is at the root of her deep and \npersonal dedication to this institution. This extensive institutional \nknowledge also gives her the wisdom and credibility to formulate a \nclear vision for the future growth of Montgomery College as we approach \nthe new millennium.\n  Dr. Parilla and the Board of Directors were certainly not the only \nones who felt strongly that Nunley was the right person for this job. \nCorporate securities advisor Gordon Macklin announced that he and his \nwife would be making a $1.26 million gift to the school after Nunley \nbecame President. This gift, announced on January 27, 1999, constitutes \nthe largest single charitable gift to a Maryland community college and \nwill provide for the establishment of the Gordon and Marilyn Mack in \nBusiness Institute. The Macklin Institute, expected to open in the fall \nof 1999, will offer an honors program for second-year students who will \nbe provided with a scholarship, a laptop computer, a summer internship, \nand a faculty and corporate mentor. Therefore not only does this \nInstitute offer an increased business curriculum and high-tech training \nto Montgomery College students, but it will encourage strong business \nstudents to enroll at Montgomery College, and will promote economic \ndevelopment in the area.\n  Additionally, on March 24, 1999, Montgomery College received its \nsecond historic gift since Nunley was named President on January 4 of \nthis year. Paul Peek, a computer systems manager from McLean, Virginia \ndonated $1.3 million to the College's Humanities Institute and Art \nDepartment. This represents the single largest individual gift ever to \na Maryland community college, and will be used to support the ongoing \nwork of both the Humanities Institute and the Department of Art. In \nappreciation for this gift, Montgomery College has named the Humanities \nInstitute and the Rockville Campus's Art Building in Peck's name.\n  Dr. Nunley was educated at Pennsylvania State University and received \na Ph.D. in Educational Policy Studies from George Washington \nUniversity. Before joining Montgomery College 26 years ago, Dr. Nunley \nserved as Director of Institutional Research at Howard Community \nCollege in Columbia, Maryland, and began her career in education at the \nPotomac State College of West Virginia University.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Nunley's creativity, effectiveness and dedication\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nhave already contributed enormously to Montgomery College, and have \nsignificantly furthered the strength of its links with the local \ngovernment and business communities. I have the utmost confidence in \nDr. Nunley's ability to lead Montgomery College into the next century, \nand look forward to working with her during another successful 20-year \ntenure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3660-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO MR. MICHAEL A. FERRARA, JR.\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nMichael A. Ferrara, Jr. as he is honored as an Outstanding Italian \nAmerican by the Sons of Italy organization. Michael has enjoyed a \nfruitful legal career, multiple philanthropic endeavors, and a \nbeautiful family.\n  Michael was born in South Philadelphia to the children of Italian \nimmigrants. His father worked hard for the Pennsylvania Railroad and \nhis mother worked for Wanamakers once Michael and his sister, JoAnn, \nwere grown. He was raised in this city and stayed close after \ngraduating high school, attending Villanova University on a NROTC \nscholarship. Michael graduated from Villanova with a degree in \nMathematics and soon after, began his naval service.\n  In the Navy, Michael served aboard both a submarine and a destroyer, \nvisiting Ireland, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia. His service was \nextended to five years due to the Vietnam War, which is where he spent \nhis last year. While in DaNang, Michael taught English to Vietnamese \nchildren for the U.S. Information Agency and helped deliver Marines, \ntanks, and ammunition to river bases along the demilitarized zone. At \nthe age of 23, Michael was in command of a mini-fleet of 25 boats and \n250 men. His service in Vietnam was rewarded with several commendations \nincluding the Combat Action Ribbon, Navy Unit Commendations, Vietnam \nCampaign Medal and Vietnam Service Medal with three bronze stars.\n  After completing his military service, Michael attended law school at \nthe University of San Diego. After graduation, he began his successful \nlegal career. Michael has been elected President of the Association of \nTrial Lawyers of America, as well as President of the 2500 member New \nJersey Trial Lawyer's Association. He has also served as President of \nthe National Civil Justice Foundation. Recently he was selected, along \nwith four other attorneys, to represent the Attorney General of New \nJersey in the lawsuit against the tobacco industry.\n  In addition to his extensive legal career, Michael has served his \ncommunity through various philanthropic endeavors, including the March \nof Dimes and the New Jersey State Aquarium's education program. As a \nfellow Italian American it gives me great pleasure to recognize Michael \nFerrara and his achievements, both in his career and his community. He \nis a man most deserving of this award and his actions should be highly \ncommended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3660-2", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3660]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 79, S. 148.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 148) to require the Secretary of the Interior to \n     establish a program to provide assistance in the conservation \n     of neotropical migratory birds.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 148, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of \n1999, introduced by Senator Abraham. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthis legislation. The bill would establish a program to provide \nfinancial assistance for projects to promote the conservation of \nneotropical migratory birds in the United States, Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n  Each autumn, some 5 billion birds from 500 species migrate between \ntheir breeding grounds in North America and tropical habitats in the \nCaribbean, Central and South America. These neotropical migrants--or \nNew World tropical migrants--are birds that migrate between the \nbiogeographic region stretching across Mexico, Central America, much of \nthe Caribbean, and the northern part of South America.\n  The natural challenges facing these migratory birds are profound. \nThese challenges have been exacerbated by human-induced impacts, \nparticularly the continuing loss of habitat in the Caribbean and Latin \nAmerica. As a result, populations of migratory birds have declined \ngenerally in recent years.\n  While there are numerous efforts underway to protect these species \nand their habitat, they generally focus on specific groups of migratory \nbirds or specific regions in the Americas. One program that stands out \nfor its success is Partners in Flight, administered by the National \nFish and Wildlife Foundation. Started in 1990, this program has\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\nraised more than $41 million for 480 projects for migratory bird \nconservation in the United States and Latin America.\n  The program established by S. 148 is intended to support and bolster \nthese existing efforts. It does so by creating a comprehensive program \nto address the varied threats facing the numerous species of migratory \nbirds across their range. Frequently there is little, if any, \ncoordination among existing programs, nor is there any one program that \nserves as a link among them. A broader, more holistic approach would \nstrengthen existing efforts, fill the gaps between these programs, and \npromote new initiatives.\n  I do not intend that this program would supplant or supersede \nexisting efforts, nor do I expect that Federal funds for implementing \nS. 148 be diverted from funds going to these existing efforts. New \nmoney should go to this new program to assist neotropical migratory \nbirds in new ways.\n  S. 148 is identical to a bill that was approved by the Senate last \nyear, S. 1970, but was never passed by the House. The bill is based on \nbipartisan negotiations with the sponsors of the bill, the House \nResources Committee, the administration, and the EPW Committee. \nNumerous groups, including conservation groups and the forest products \nindustry, have supported this bill.\n  The bill allows for the Secretary to establish an advisory group, and \nI urge that the Secretary do so. The success of this initiative will \ndepend on close collaboration with public and private organizations \ninvolved in the conservation of migratory birds.\n  I am very pleased with the legislation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it, and urge its speedy enactment. Thank you, Mr. President. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today the Senate again will pass \nlegislation to protect the habitat of the broad range of migratory \nbirds which spend the spring and summer months in the United States. \nThis legislation, which I introduced with my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Daschle and Senator Chafee, is designed to protect over 90 \nendangered species of bird spending certain seasons in the United \nStates and other seasons in other nations of the West Hemisphere. This \nis actually the second time this legislation has passed the Senate. \nLast year, after receiving considerable support from the environmental \nand conservation communities, this legislation passed the Senate by \nUnanimous consent. Unfortunately, time ran out for equal consideration \nin the House. Nevertheless, this year we returned with renewed \ndetermination and were able to again move this bill.\n  Every year, Mr. President, approximately 25 million Americans travel \nto observe birds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds \nat home. Bird-watching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, \nas well as a source of important revenue to states, like my own state \nof Michigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. \nBird watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every Year in \nrevenue across America.\n  Birdwatching is a popular activity in Michigan, and its increased \npopularity is reflected by an increase in tourist dollars being spent \nin small, rural communities. Healthy bird populations also prevent \nhundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses each year to farming \nand timber interests. They help control insect populations, thereby \npreventing crop failures and infestations.\n  Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, \nmany of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as \nendangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are \nof high conservation concern. In my own state we are working to bring \nthe Kirtland's Warbler back from the brink of extinction. A few years \nago, the population of this distinctive bird has been estimated at \napproximately 200 nesting pairs. Since then, a great deal of work has \nbeen done by Michigan DNR employees to preserve the Kirtland's Warbler \nhabitat in the Bahamas, where they winter. Thanks in large part to this \neffort, the number of breeding pairs has recently increased to an \nestimated 800. This is an easily grasped problem. Since the entire \nspecies spends half of the year in the Bahamas, the significant efforts \nmade by Michigan's Department of Natural Resources and concerned \nresidents in Michigan will not be enough to save this bird if its \nwinter habitat is degraded or destroyed.\n  This situation is not unique, among bird watchers' favorites, many \nneotropical birds are endangered or of high conservation concern. And \nseveral of the most popular neotropical species, including bluebirds, \nrobins, goldfinches, and orioles, migrate to and from the Caribbean and \nLatin America.\n  Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of \ninternational borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards \nat both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover \nareas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove \nsuccessful.\n\n  That is why Senator Daschle, Senator Chafee and I introduced the \nNeotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act. This legislation will \nprotect bird habitats across international boundaries by establishing \npartnerships between the business community, nongovernmental \norganizations and foreign nations. By teaming businesses with \ninternational organizations concerned to protect the environment we can \ncombine capital with know-how. By partnering these entities with local \norganizations in countries where bird habitat is endangered we can see \nto it that local people receive the training they need to preserve this \nhabitat and maintain this critical natural resource.\n  This act establishes a 4-year demonstration project providing $8 \nmillion each year to help establish programs in the United States, \nLatin America, and the Caribbean. The greater portion of these funds \nwill be focused outside the U.S. Approved programs will manage and \nconserve neotropical migratory bird populations. Those eligible to \nparticipate will include national and international nongovernmental \norganizations and business interests, as well as U.S. Government \nentities.\n  The key to this act is cooperation among nongovernmental \norganizations. The federal share of each project's cost is never to \nexceed 33 percent. For grants awarded outside the United States, the \nnon-Federal match can be made with in-kind contributions. This will \nencourage volunteerism and local interest in communities that lack the \nfinancial resources to contribute currency. Since domestic \norganizations and communities are more financially secure, the matching \nportion of grants awarded within the United States will be required in \ncash.\n  The approach taken by this legislation differs from that of current \nprograms in that it is proactive and, by avoiding a crisis management \napproach, will prove significantly more cost effective. In addition, \nthis legislation does not call for complicated and expensive \nbureaucratic structures such as councils, commissions or multi-tiered \noversight structures. Further, this legislation will bring needed \nattention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little \nattention in the area of environmental degradation.\n  This legislation has the support of the National Audubon Society, the \nNature Conservancy, the American Bird Conservancy, Defenders of \nWildlife, the Ornithological Council, Ducks Unlimited, and the American \nForest and Paper Association. These organizations agree with Senator \nDaschle, Senator Chafee, and I that, by establishing partnerships \nbetween business, government and nongovernmental organizations both \nhere and abroad we can greatly enhance the protection of migratory bird \nhabitat.\n  I want to take a moment to comment on the contributions of Senator \nDaschle and Senator Chafee with respect to this bill. For over a year, \nmy colleagues and their staffs have dedicated a great deal of time and \nhard work to this legislation. This bill would not have advanced as it \nhas, perhaps would not have moved at all, were it not for their \nefforts, and I wish to thank them for all they have done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 148) was considered read a third time and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\n                                 S. 148\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n     the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n       (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n     environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n     to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n     considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n     the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n     jeopardy; and\n       (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n     of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n     pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n       (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n     numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n     requires the commitment and effort of all countries along \n     their migration routes; and\n       (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n     migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n     significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n     coordination.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical \n     migratory birds;\n       (2) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n     birds by supporting conservation initiatives in the United \n     States, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and\n       (3) to provide financial resources and to foster \n     international cooperation for those initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, during the recent spring recess, I took the \nopportunity to travel to Brussels, Belgium, to meet with NATO officials \nabout the situation in Kosovo. Last week, I traveled to Macedonia in \norder to make a firsthand assessment of the refugee problem confronting \nthat small nation.\n  While in Brussels, I received an assessment of the ongoing military \ncampaign against Yugoslav military and security forces and strategic \ninstallations from Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of our NATO forces. I \nalso discussed NATO's objectives with respect to Kosovo and the more \nthan 600,000 Kosovars now displaced with NATO Secretary General Javier \nSolana, NATO ambassadors, and NATO military officials.\n  I found that NATO ambassadors were unified in their resolve to stand \nup to Slobodan Milosevic. They expressed a willingness to carry on the \nair campaign for as long as it might take to degrade Serbian military \nand security forces.\n  Let me also say how deeply impressed I was with Gen. Wesley Clark, \nthe supreme allied commander of NATO forces, our ambassador to NATO and \ntheir staffs. I urge colleagues who have the opportunity to go to \nBrussels and meet with these NATO officials to do so. At the end of \nnext week, there will be a gathering of the NATO nations' leaders here \nin Washington to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the most important \nstrategic alliance of the 20th century. I hope that my colleagues will \ntake advantage of the opportunity created by that historic gathering to \nspeak with as many of these ambassadors and NATO staff and personnel as \npossible about the situation in Kosovo.\n  After these meetings in Brussels, I traveled to Macedonia on a \nmilitary aircraft that was bringing urgently needed supplies to the \nrefugee camps. It was a long flight from Ramstein Air Force Base in \nGermany to Macedonia, and I was deeply impressed by the young crew and \ntheir hard work. Before I left Ramstein Air Force Base, General Brady \nand his staff gave me an excellent briefing on how they are helping to \nrelieve the suffering of the men, women and children displaced from \ntheir homes in Kosovo.\n  In Macedonia, I met with United States Ambassador Chris Hill and his \nstaff. Let me reiterate to our colleagues here how fortunate we are to \nhave someone of Chris Hill's talents and abilities representing us in \nMacedonia, particularly at a time such as this. He is a career foreign \nservice officer, has spent time in the Balkans, knows the region well \nand is handling a very difficult and tense situation with a great deal \nof energy, vision and creativity.\n  While I was in Macedonia, I also met with U.S. military personnel who \nare a part of a unit called Able Sentry. A brigadier general and his \nstaff briefed me on their operations. Before hostilities broke out, \nAble Sentry was intended as the base facility for a peacekeeping force \nin Kosovo. Now, these American service men and women are leading NATO's \nefforts to help the refugees on the ground.\n  I also spent some time with the enlisted personnel who make up the \nunit to which three young servicemen, Sergeants Ramirez and Stone and \nSpecialist Steven Gonzales were assigned before their illegal capture \nby Serbian forces.\n  I wish all of our colleagues could have joined me in that small room \nlast Saturday to hear these young American servicemen talk with great \npride about the work of their colleagues Ramirez, Stone, and Gonzales. \nRamirez, Stone and Gonzales were professionals doing a commendable job. \nWhen they were captured, they were not close to the Serbian border \nwhere they would have placed themselves and their units in any \njeopardy. When I spoke with this unit of highly competent individuals \njust three days ago, they were deeply worried that Members of Congress \nin Washington would misunderstand the role that they were engaged\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\nin and the professionalism with which they were conducting their \nresponsibilities. I assured them that my colleagues here, regardless of \nparty, had a deep respect for the job they were doing and admire them \nimmensely. And, like them, I pray for the safe return of their three \ncomrades.\n\n  The service men and women I met with are committed to getting the job \ndone, Mr. President. They know why they are there. They understand the \nseriousness and importance of this issue and are conducting their jobs \nwith a high degree of professionalism.\n  I wanted to take a moment here on the floor to express my confidence \nin them and speak their names on the floor of the Senate, as I assured \nthem I would. I urge my colleagues to do likewise and express their \nsupport for the hard and commendable job our men and women in uniform \nare doing.\n  Mr. President, the efforts of all of these men and women in Macedonia \ntoday are focused on alleviating the suffering of the thousands of \npeople who have been forced from their homes by Slobodan Milosevic's \nreign of ethnic cleansing. I fear that I am not capable of fully \ndescribing the scene at the refugee camps. For a generation of us who \nwere born at the end of World War II, the sites of a concentration camp \nor of the thousands of homeless people in Europe at the end of World \nWar II rest securely in the domain of documentary films and Hollywood \ndepictions.\n  Most of us in this Chamber have not had occasion to encounter \nfirsthand the kinds of scenes that our fathers and grandfathers \nwitnessed. Senators Thurmond and Hollings of South Carolina, Senator \nInouye, Senator Chafee, Senator Lautenberg, and others who were \nveterans of World War II can also speak of personal recollections of \nthose days.\n  In the past few days, however, the images from documentary films half \na century old became a reality for me. I was profoundly struck by the \nsight of 45,000 people gathered together in makeshift huts or tents in \nan area only slightly larger than half of the Mall here in Washington. \nThey were lining up for food, water, medicine and other basic \nnecessities, and using open trenches as latrines. Mr. President, it was \na sight to which TV film footage, television broadcasts, news \ndescriptions--despite their talent and ability--cannot really do \njustice. It was a truly compelling sight.\n  I was deeply impressed with the work being done by the British \nmilitary forces in this particular camp. It was stunning to learn that \nin less than 36 hours they had constructed and put up 4,000 tents to \naccommodate the 45,000 refugees that have poured into this particular \npart of Macedonia. There is another camp nearby in Brazda with some \n12,000 people in it. I am told by the distinguished Ambassador from \nMacedonia that some 16,000 other Kosovars are living in the homes of \npeople in Macedonia. In total, there are some 120,000 Kosovars in that \none small country, geographically the size of Vermont, with only 2 \nmillion people. To put it into perspective for Americans, this is \nequivalent to 5 million people arriving on our shores to seek asylum in \na 72 hour period. This influx of refugees represents a tremendous \ndisruption in the economic life of Macedonia as it has in Albania.\n\n  Mr. President, as I spent 4 hours or so wandering through the refugee \ncamp walking by rows and rows of families huddled in tents or standing \nin lines to receive food and water, I noticed on every single tent a \nhomemade sign written on cardboard with ballpoint pen or lipstick or \nwhatever else that family could use. These signs would give a person's \nname and which town they had live in followed by: If you see or run \ninto my mother, my father, my sister, my brother, or my child who is \nlost and separated, please tell them where I am. People wander by \nreading the signs, trying to find members of their own families. \nTeenagers are caring for small children who have been separated from \ntheir parents.\n  As people cross the border they tell the stories of being brutalized \nby the Serbian military and police forces in Kosovo. These stories of \nwhat they had to endure, how they were evicted from their homes, and \nseparated from their families, Mr. President, are haunting and \nshocking.\n  I have seen a lot of hardship in my years. I was a Peace Corps \nvolunteer in Latin America during the 1960s. I lived in countries where \nthere is a great deal of poverty and suffering. I have been to Haiti \nmany times. I have traveled throughout Central and Latin America over \nthe years. But never, Mr. President, have I seen anything quite like \nthe scene that I saw in this camp.\n  At times, however, there are moments amongst the despair of the \npresent which speak to the potential optimism of the future. In the \ncamp I visited is a field hospital operated by the Israeli military. \nSince the refugees began arriving, the Israeli doctors and nurses have \ndelivered 6 babies. I pray, Mr. President, that these 6 infants will \nnot know the horrors of ethnic-cleansing and hatred their parents have \nfled. Rather, may they grow up in the spirit of understanding and \nrespect for each other which drives these Jewish doctors to care for \nmostly Muslim refugees.\n  If there is any doubt in anyone's mind about whether or not we were \ntrying to do the right thing as a nation and as a group of nations \nunder the alliance of NATO, I promise my colleagues that had they been \nwith me last Saturday, seen what I saw, and talked to the people that I \ntalked to, there would be absolutely no disagreement in this Chamber \nabout whether or not the United States and NATO were taking the right \ncourse of action. Our efforts to restore these people to their rightful \nhome, bring an end to this conflict, and thus save the lives of \nthousands and prevent the spread of this conflict throughout the \nBalkans area are most assuredly the right thing to do.\n  I can only hope that Slobodan Milosevic will hear from this Chamber, \nfrom this Congress, and from NATO's member nations in the coming days a \nunanimous voice of determination to rid Kosovo of his brutal forces and \nstop to worst ethnic cleansing Europe has seen in decades. Furthermore, \nwe must clearly state that we will not second guess the decisions of \nthis administration, including President Clinton, Secretary of Defense \nCohen and General Shelton, of our leaders in NATO, and of our \ncolleagues in the diplomatic wing of NATO.\n  Mr. President, I think it is critically important that we demonstrate \nat this juncture as much bipartisan support as we can for NATO's \nmilitary campaign in Yugoslavia. Once President Milosevic understands \nthat the United States and other NATO countries are resolute in their \ncommon determination to continue a military campaign against Serbian \ntargets until NATO's conditions have been met, I am convinced he will \nback down.\n  We must also be prepared to make clear that President Clinton has \navailable all necessary means to carry out our mission against Serbian \nmilitary and security forces. The Governments of Macedonia and Albania, \ntogether with international private relief organizations, have been \nconfronted with a sea of refugees and are ill equipped to cope with \nthis problem. International relief efforts to provide food, clothing, \nshelter, and medicines to the still-growing refugee community must \ncontinue--and on an expedited basis, I might add.\n  The United Nations, and specifically the United Nations High \nCommission for Refugees, must dramatically step up their efforts to \nrespond to the refugee crisis in Albania and Macedonia.\n  It is also important to say a few words about the Governments of \nAlbania and Macedonia. These are both poor countries that have been \nconfronted with a situation even a wealthy nation like the United \nStates would find difficult to cope with. While there have been some \nbumps along the road, I would like the Governments and the peoples of \nMacedonia and Albania to know that we in the United States appreciate \ndeeply what they are trying to do to assist the Kosovar refugees and we \nrecognize that they need substantial economic assistance to help them \ncope with this situation.\n  Macedonia and Albania should receive, in my view, bilateral and \nmultilateral economic assistance including IMF assistance, debt relief \nin the form of debt forgiveness, trade assistance, in order to address \nwar-related economic dislocation in both countries.\n  The hundred or so refugees with whom I spoke made it clear that they \nwant to return to their home in Kosovo rather than be relocated \nthroughout\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\nthe globe. They also expressed deep appreciation of the international \ncommunity, and specifically the United States, in endeavoring to \naccomplish certain goals on their behalf. It does not go unnoticed by \nthem that the United States, once again, is standing up for those who \nhave been treated as poorly as these people have. It is in our \nheritage. It is part of our collective ethic in this Nation to try to \nhelp, try to do what is right rather than to be silent and stand by \nwhile outrages are perpetrated against innocent people.\n  I believe that what the United States and NATO are doing reversed the \nSerbian policy of ethnic cleansing and is a just cause that deserves \nthe support of the Congress and the American people.\n  I pledge to do all I can to support this effort. Particularly, I want \nto support our President, our military, and NATO as they endeavor to \nachieve this worthy goal. I hope before this week is out that we might \nfind some common ideas through some collective work here to express \nsome issues on which we can all agree. There are differences of opinion \non various aspects of this crisis, but I happen to believe we share a \ngreat deal in common on this issue.\n  I am confident that, under the leadership of the majority leader, \nTrent Lott, and the Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, the chairmen and \nranking members of the Armed Services Committee, the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, and the Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the \nAppropriations Committee, as well as the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee and other interested Members of this body, \nwe can find some common language and common ideas to send a clear, \nstrong signal this week of how much we appreciate the efforts of our \nservice men and women, of the front-line states, and of the \ninternational relief organizations. We must assure them that they do \nnot stand alone and that we are going to do everything we can to ease \nthe pressures and burdens that these poor refugees are facing. I am \nconfident that we will speak with a common voice when we express our \ndetermination not to let Slobodan Milosevic's genocidal behavior stand.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/04/13/senate-section/article/S3665-1", "month": "04", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11:30 A.M.
