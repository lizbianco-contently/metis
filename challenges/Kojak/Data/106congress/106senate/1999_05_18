The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to the consideration of S. 96, a bill to \n     regulate commerce between and among the several States by \n     providing for the orderly resolution of disputes arising out \n     of computer-based problems related to processing data that \n     includes a 2-digit expression of the year's date.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  In about 10 minutes, we are going to have another vote on cloture so \nthat we can proceed to the very important Y2K liability bill, S. 96. \nThe word is out that the Democrats will now again refuse to move \nforward with passage of this legislation. Last time, the excuse was, as \nI understand it from the Democrat leader's remarks, that they were not \nallowed to propose amendments to the pending legislation so this was \nsome form of protest. Now I am told the excuse will be--and we will \nfind out--because the juvenile justice bill has not been completed.\n  The entertaining aspect of that rationale is that while complaining \nabout not being able to move forward on the juvenile justice bill, they \nstill won't agree to amendments and time agreements so we could dispose \nof the juvenile justice bill.\n  What this is really all about is that there is a strong aversion on \nthe part of the American Trial Lawyers Association to this legislation. \nThat aversion is manifesting itself by preventing us from moving \nforward with this very important legislation.\n  Small, medium, and large businesses in America, high-tech firms all \nover America, have written or contacted us as to the importance of this \nlegislation. I recently received a letter signed by some 130 high-tech \ncompanies in America. I would like to read it.\n  This is from the Year 2000 Coalition. Actually, this letter was \naddressed to Senator Kerry, not to me. It says:\n\n       The Year 2000 Coalition, a broad-based multi-industry \n     business group, is committed to working with the Senate to \n     enact meaningful Y2K liability legislation. We fully support \n     S. 96 sponsored by Senator McCain, with amendments and \n     revisions agreed to by Senators Wyden, Dodd, Hatch, \n     Feinstein and Bennett, as the most reasonable approach to \n     curtail unwarranted and frivolous litigation that might \n     occur as a result of the century date change.\n       While we appreciate any effort that further demonstrates \n     the bipartisan recognition of the need for legislation, the \n     Coalition does not support the Y2K bill that is being \n     circulated in your name and believes it detracts from the \n     sponsors of S. 96 effort to build support for their bill. We \n     urge you to support S. 96 that is now pending before the \n     Senate. Your vote in favor of cloture is important to bring \n     the bill to the floor and allow the Senate to address the \n     challenge of Y2K confronting all Americans. A vote in favor \n     of S.\n\n[[Page S5438]]\n\n     96 is a vote in favor of Y2K remediation instead of \n     litigation.\n\n  A very impressive list of, I believe, 130 companies and corporations \naround America, a pretty impressive group of corporations that, I would \nsay, represents a substantial portion of America's economy, that is \nconcerned about this issue and wants us to move forward.\n  I had honestly believed that after the demonstration of solidarity \nlast week on this issue on the part of my friends and colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--I took the Democrat leader at his word. He \nsaid we will move forward; we will have a bill; we want to work \ntogether on this.\n  Apparently, that is not going to be the case this morning. If it is \nnot the case, then, obviously, I will do whatever the majority leader \ndictates as to what the Senate calendar will be.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield briefly? I don't know \nthe time situation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield myself some of the leader time if \nnecessary. I thank Senator McCain for his continuing effort on this \nimportant legislation.\n  I wonder how many people or how many Senators think the solution to \nthe year 2000 computer problem is litigation, lawsuits. I don't believe \nmost Senators believe that is the answer. I know the American people \ndon't believe that is the answer. What they want is a solution. They \nwant us to do everything we can to help small business men and women \nand the computer industry, everybody, address the problem. If we don't \nget it done by the year 2000, they certainly don't want lawsuits to be \nthe solution.\n  That is what is at stake. I have acted in good faith. I know Senator \nMcCain has. I was assured last week by Senator Dodd of Connecticut that \nthey were ready to go forward, that a number of Democrats would join \nthe overwhelming Republican vote to support getting cloture.\n  I want to emphasize this is on the motion to proceed. People need to \nunderstand that. This apparently is going to be an effort by the \nDemocrats to block even taking up the bill to deal with this Y2K \nlitigation problem.\n  This is the second time in 3 weeks political games are being played \nwith a very serious issue. If that is the way it is to be, I want the \nAmerican people to understand the Democrats do not want a solution. \nThey want to play games with this bill and they want litigation. That \nis what really is at stake.\n  As majority leader, I have to try to deal with a lot of important \nissues, including the juvenile justice bill, supplemental \nappropriations for disasters, the situation in Kosovo, bankruptcy \nlegislation, Department of Defense authorization, a whole long list of \nbills. We can't keep bringing up this bill or other bills. So this is \nit until somebody shows me that there is a good-faith effort.\n  As far as having votes on alternatives, I think Senator McCain and \nother managers would be glad to do that. If somebody has an alternative \nproposal--by Senator Kerry, Senator Daschle --fine, let's vote on that. \nBut to just block even the consideration of this bill I think is very \nquestionable action.\n  I hope the Senator will find a way to deal with this. At some point, \nif somebody shows me they are ready to go and we go to the substance \nand we have the votes to pass it, fine. Otherwise, the Democrats have \non their shoulders the fact they have killed the Y2K legislation. Let \nthem explain it to the businesspeople of this country, the men and \nwomen who have small businesses and to the computer industry, because \nthat is where the problem is.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter to \nSenator Kerry from the Year 2000 Coalition and the letter to me be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Year 2000 Coalition,\n\n                                                     May 12, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Year 2000 Coalition, \n     we are writing to express our strong support for S. 96, the \n     Y2K Act. The attached letter was delivered to Senator Kerry \n     this afternoon.\n       The Year 2000 Coalition strongly supports legislation that \n     would encourage cooperative problem solving outside the \n     courtroom in order to alleviate Y2K-related problems that \n     occur. We believe S. 96 would create a legal framework to \n     protect both plaintiffs and defendants, and prevent this \n     unique situation from triggering a crisis in our economy and \n     our legal

McCAIN. Mr. President, I will have more to say after the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we do not lose sight of the fact we \nare on the threshold of being able to do something very important for \nthis country. Those of us on this side of the aisle recognize we must \ndo something with Y2K, and we will.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are now debating one of the most \nimportant issues we face in this Congress. That is, What are we going \nto do with violence in our schools, violence in our society generally?\n  We could complete this juvenile justice bill in the next day or two. \nAmendments have been winnowed down to where we just have a handful. If \nwe stick to the substance of the bill, we could have something very \nimportant for the American people. I hope we are allowed to go forward \nwith this juvenile justice bill.\n  I see the manager of this bill who has done such an outstanding job. \nI yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate has considered S. 254 for \nportions of five days. The first day we were prevented from offering \nany amendments until almost 3 p.m. in the afternoon. When I tried to \noffer a first Democratic amendment, the underlying amendment to which \nit was offered was withdrawn and we started all over. Finally, we were \nable to offer amendments alternating back and forth across the aisle.\n  Three amendments were debated and voted on Tuesday evening and my law\n\n[[Page S5440]]\n\nenforcement amendment was offered and left pending overnight. On \nWednesday we continued to offer amendments on an alternating basis \nthrough the day and voted on four more amendments.\n  The Senate fell into a pattern of tabling amendments offered by \nDemocrats only to see those amendments come back as Republican \nsponsored amendments that were then adopted. Thus, after rejecting the \nLeahy law enforcement amendment we saw an amendment offered by Senator \nAshcroft to add back several of its measures and had the McCain \namendment on these same matters offered and withdrawn.\n  Unquestionably the Senate hit a real snag on this bill when it \nrejected, on a virtual party line vote, the Lautenberg amendment and we \nsaw first the Craig amendment and then Hatch-Craig II seeking to \nreclaim ground on the gun show amendment. Senator Schumer and I tried \nto point out problems with the Craig amendment only to be told that we \nwere wrong on Wednesday night and right the morning after the amendment \nwas adopted.\n  On Wednesday the Senate had under consideration eight amendments \nthrough the day and voted on four of those. On Thursday the Senate \nvoted on four more amendments and debated the Schumer Internet gun \namendment and Hatch-Craig II on gun shows.\n  On Friday, despite the plans of many Senators to travel to the \nBalkans and others to be away on other business, we continued debating \nand voting. There were two additional votes and six additional \namendments were offered for debate with votes to be scheduled this \nweek.\n  It was also on Friday that the Majority Leader attempted to leave \nthis juvenile crime bill and move off onto other matters. By my \ncalculation, it was after the Senate had been permitted only the \nequivalent of three days on the juvenile crime bill spread over the \ncourse of four calendar days. If I recall correctly, the Senate spent \nalmost that amount of time, a couple of years ago, renaming Reagan \nNational Airport.\n  Indeed, the Majority Leader filed cloture on his motion to proceed to \nS. 96 immediately after moving to proceed back to that bill and abandon \nSenate efforts on the juvenile violence legislation. It is that vote \nthat is now approaching. It is that vote that will determine whether we \nabandon our effort to craft a juvenile violence bill or not. I urge all \nSenators to stay the course and not abandon this effort.\n  Rather I would urge that we adopt the words of the Majority Leader \nfrom Friday when he said: ``Give it a reasonable time, give it full \ndebate, have reasonable amendments, and then vote.''\n  No one can seriously claim that Democrats are being dilatory or \nfilibustering this bill. We have proceeded promptly from the moment the \nMajority Leader called it up for debate and proceeded to offer \namendments from the earliest opportunity. I marvel at comments by the \nsponsors of the bill that it should have been passed with one day's \nconsideration.\n  The fact is that the bill was not the product of Judiciary Committee \naction but was introduced by the Majority Leader and the Chairman and \nfive other Republicans from the Judiciary Committee this January and \nplaced directly on the Senate calendar. The sponsors objected to its \nbeing referred to the Judiciary Committee and thereby prevented it.\n  It has sat on the Senate Calendar since January, without hearings, \nwithout an opportunity to be considered by the Judiciary Committee, and \nwithout any opportunity for any Democrats to offer improvements or \namendments to it.\n  It should not go unnoticed that in spite of the fact that they \ndrafted the bill, so far Republican cosponsors of the bill have \nsponsored 10 of the 13 Republican-offered amendments to it--the bill's \nsponsors have sponsored 10 of the Republican amendments so far. It is \ndisingenuous for Republicans to seek leave to revise, reedit and amend \ntheir own bill and deny Democrats a fair opportunity to help shape that \nlegislation through the amendment process. How about a commensurate \nopportunity for others to offer amendments to that work product, too?\n  The Senate last week had 13 roll call votes on amendments, Senator \nHatch accepted one and the Senate accepted one on a voice vote after a \ntabling motion failed. We have adopted seven amendments by roll call \nvotes, including the two Craig amendments, and tabled five amendments \nby roll call votes. We were making progress on the bill and I was \ngratified to hear the encouraging words of the Majority Leader on \nThursday.\n  By last Friday, we had whittled the 89 likely Democratic amendments \ndown by almost half and we have continued working to reduce them. On \nFriday we reached agreement on a finite list of possible amendments of \nwhich there were over 40 reserved not for Democrats but for \nRepublicans.\n  I have been working on a managers' package with Senator Hatch and \nbelieve that one should be ready to be accepted today that will go a \nlong way toward reducing the remaining amendments on both sides and \nclearing the way to concluding Senate action on this measure. I hope \nthat Senator Hatch will continue to work with me to offer that package \nwithout further delay.\n  After acceptance of that managers' amendment, I expect the remaining \nDemocratic amendments will number less than a dozen, probably less than \n10, and maybe less than that. Thus, if all the Democrats in the Senate \ncould just have the opportunity to offer a number of amendments equal \nto the number of amendments offered so far by three of the original \nRepublican sponsors of the bill, that would likely conclude Senate \nconsideration of the bill and we could move to a vote on final passage.\n  From all that Senator Hatch has been saying since Sunday, after \noffering amendments on Friday and Monday, the Republican side has only \nanother three amendments to offer. It would be a shame for the majority \nto pull the bill now.\n  In spite of the filing of the Republican motion to pull this bill and \nmove back to the Y2K bill that was debated last month, Democrats have \ncontinued offering amendments, when permitted by the Republican \nmajority. Unfortunately, Republican objection last Friday prevented \nSenator Lautenberg from offering his amendment in an effort to get a \nfinal vote on the language to be used in the context of gun show sales \nafter Hatch-Craig II modified that language for a second time. I trust \nthat there will be progress on that front today as we proceed and that \nother Democratic amendments will be allowed to be offered.\n  It is my understanding that the next two amendments to be offered \nshould be Democratic amendments, since we concluded Monday's session \nwith two Republican amendments in a row.\n  To date, after the filing of the cloture petition to end action on \nthe juvenile violence bill and move off it and back to a debate on Y2K \nliability protection for certain businesses, there have been 13 \namendments offered and now pending and awaiting Senate votes. As many \namendments were offered on Friday and Monday as were voted upon on \nTuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. It is hard to see how anyone \ncould say that we are not making progress and not making a strong good \nfaith effort on this measure.\n  Let me put this debate in its proper context. In the last Congress, \nthe Judiciary Committee considered S. 10, a juvenile crime bill, and \nthe predecessor to this measure. When Senator Hatch refers to years of \nwork on S. 254, he is referring to the work we did to improve S. 10 in \nthe last Congress. The Judiciary Committee met on six separate \noccasions to consider 52 amendments to S. 10--40 amendments were \nadopted by unanimous consent and 12 amendments were considered by roll \ncall votes.\n  As I have noted, the bill before us today, S. 254, was never \nconsidered by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The sponsors bypassed the \nJudiciary Committee. Democrats never had the chance in Committee to \ndebate it, to offer amendments to S. 254 or to improve it. Is it any \nwonder that Democrats have amendments to this bill and would like an \nopportunity to be heard on the important subject of juvenile violence? \nDemocrats' first opportunity to improve this bill is during this Senate \nfloor debate.\n  Also recall that when Democrats were in the majority and Republicans \nin the minority in 1994, there was a rather full debate on crime \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S5441]]\n\nThe Senate considered the 1994 crime bill for 12 days over three weeks, \nand considered 99 amendments to the 1994 crime bill.\n  Let us keep focused on the task of completing consideration of this \njuvenile violence bill without moving the Senate off onto other matters \nand abandoning this important effort. Does anyone really believe that \nthe consideration of liability limited Y2K legislation is more \nimportant this month than completing Senate action on a juvenile \nviolence bill? I urge a no vote on the Republican cloture motion and \nask Republicans then to join with Democrats to continue to work to \ncomplete action on the juvenile violence bill.\n  We are improving the bill by means of this Senate debate. Senator \nHatch and I are agreeing to include suggestions from Senators from both \nsides of the aisle in a managers' amendment that should be accepted \ntoday. We have made and are making excellent progress. The Senate \nshould be allowed to complete its work on this important legislation.\n  We were pleased when the Majority Leader honored his commitment, made \nduring the previous Senate debate on the Y2K bill, S. 96, to take up \nthis measure as a vehicle for youth violence amendments. It would be \nironic if we now abandoned that effort to return for a second time to \nthe debate on Y2K legislation before being given an opportunity to \ncomplete action on this measure. The Senate should reject cloture on \nthe motion to pull the juvenile violence bill and continue our \nimportant work on this measure.\n  Mr. President, we have not spent a great deal of time on the juvenile \ncrime bill. I think we spent the same amount of time renaming the \nNational Airport. We spent only a fraction of the time on the last \ncrime bill when the Democrats controlled the Senate because of the time \ntaken by the Republican side. There were 99 amendments on that crime \nbill, I point out.\n  The fact of the matter is that we can pass a good juvenile crime bill \nor we can give into a powerful lobby.\n  I have been a gun owner since I was 14. I trained my children in the \nuse of guns. I come from the only State in the Union with no gun \ncontrol laws, but I tell you right now my duty is first and foremost to \nthe Senate, not to a gun lobby. I believe Senators should determine the \nschedule on this bill, not the gun lobbies. Senators should vote this \nbill up or vote it down, not have it withdrawn at the behest of any \nlobby, even one as powerful as the gun lobby.\n  We worked all weekend--all weekend--and we have removed most of the \namendments pending.\n  I point out that so far the Republicans who cosponsored the bill, \nsponsored 10 of the 13 Republican amendments to this bill. We have \ntaken longer to vote on at least one amendment to accommodate Senators \nwho were out, some for a fundraiser, than we did on the debate on that \namendment.\n  We reached on Friday an agreement on a finite list of possible \namendments. We have a possible managers' package that could do this. We \ncan finish this bill. I think if we want to do the actual work, we will \nget it done.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Y2K Act from my \nperspective as the chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business. \nThe choice presented by this legislation is clear--if you are a \nsupporter of small business in America, you must support this \nlegislation and vote for cloture so that the Senate may proceed on this \nbill.\n  One of the highest priorities of the small business community for \nthis Congress is that we establish procedures to resolve disputes \nefficiently arising from the Y2K computer problem. The consequences \nthat may arise from this problem are as yet unknown. However, small \nfamily-owned businesses are understandably concerned that their \ncompanies may be in danger either from the problem itself or from suits \nbrought by trial lawyers concerned only with the fees they can obtain \nfrom settlements.\n  The small businesses concerned with Y2K litigation are located on \nMain Streets all across America, not just Silicon Valley. They are this \ncountry's mom and pop groceries, its dry cleaners and its hardware \nstores. The National Federation of Independent Businesses, the nation's \nlargest small business association, strongly supports this legislation. \nThe NFIB surveyed its members and found that an overwhelming 93% \nsupport capping damage awards for Y2K suits. The small business \ncommunity is speaking with a unified voice in support of Y2K liability \nlegislation and we should not ignore that voice.\n  I have heard during the debate that enactment of this bill will harm \nsmall businesses. That simply is not the case. By merely reading the \nbill, it is apparent that small businesses will benefit greatly from \nits provision. So that we may dispel the myths surrounding this bill \nonce and for all, it is important to point out several of the \nprovisions of this legislation that small women and family-owned \nbusinesses will find particularly helpful.\n  First, the legislation encourages alternative dispute resolution for \nY2K lawsuits. This will help small businesses tremendously. According \nto the Gartner Group, an international consulting firm, more than $1 \ntrillion will be spent on litigation relating to the Y2K problem. \nLawsuits are likely to occur up and down the supply chain. That is, if \nthe supplier of a family-owned business has a Y2K failure that impacts \nits abilities to serve its customers, it may have a lawsuit on its \nhands. That business, to recoup its losses, may then be forced to turn \naround and sue its supplier, which very well may also be a small \nbusiness. The supplier then will sue someone else to recoup its losses. \nThe litigation cycle is never-ending and small businesses have the most \nto lose.\n  A good example of a small business that may be caught in this cycle \nof litigation is a constituent of mine who owns a small medical supply \ncompany that provides oxygen to patients. He has already determined he \nhas a Y2K problem with his computers and is diligently trying to \ncorrect the problem. The Health Care Financing Administration has even \nrequired him to create a booklet to provide to customers regarding the \nsteps he has taken to become Y2K compliant. If his suppliers or vendors \nhave a Y2K failure and he cannot supply needed oxygen to his customers, \nhe may very well be subject to lawsuits that could cost him his \ncompany. This is the type of situation we must prevent from occurring.\n  Women-owned and family-owned businesses are the most vulnerable from \ncostly litigation, either as plaintiffs or defendants, because they \ndon't have the time to devote to it and don't have excess revenue to \nafford it. In addition, small businesses do not want to sue companies \nwith which they have long-standing relationships and whose survival is \ntied to their own. Therefore, encouraging resolution of disputes \noutside of the courtroom is of great assistance to these businesses.\n  Second, the legislation requires plaintiffs to provide defendants \nwith notice prior to filing a complaint and allows defendants 60 days \nto correct Y2K problems suffered by the plaintiff. Encouraging \nmitigation and prompt settlement of claims allows small women-owned and \nfamily-owned businesses to recover quickly from business disruptions \nand, most importantly, allows small businesses to continue doing \nbusiness. As I stated before, many of these businesses do not have the \ncash flow to engage in long, drawn-out disputes, if they want to stay \nin business. This provision will allow small women-owned and family-\nowned businesses to focus on correcting their problems and continuing \nin business. This is what small businesses want to do and what Congress \nshould encourage.\n  The bill also establishes punitive damage limits for suits against \nsmall businesses. The bill provides that under most circumstances a \nsmall business defendant cannot be subject to punitive damages greater \nthan 3 times the compensatory damages awarded or $250,000, whichever is \nless. I don't believe that anybody can reasonably suggest that this \nprovision will not help the small women-owned and family-owned \nbusinesses. Other than the obvious affect the cap will have, placing a \nlimit on punitive damages will allow plaintiffs in meritorious suits to \nrecover their actual damages quicker. Moreover, the cap will decrease \nthe number of frivolous lawsuits that small businesses may have to \nface, as unscrupulous attorneys will realize that large settlements \nwill not be forthcoming.\n\n[[Page S5442]]\n\n  It is also important to point out what this bill will not do. It will \nnot prevent a small business from availing itself of the judicial \nsystem when it has been wronged by another party's actions related to \nthe Y2K problem. The bill does not affect the enforcement of written \ncontracts nor does it prevent a small business from bringing a lawsuit \nalleging negligence or other grounds based in tort law. The bill merely \nestablishes a procedure to efficiently remedy disputes and preclude a \nfeeding-frenzy on the part of unscrupulous plaintiff's attorneys \nattempting to earn their fortune from the Y2K problem.\n  Earlier this year, Congress passed Y2K legislation that I authored to \nprovide small businesses with the means to fix their own computer \nsystems. The next step is to discourage frivolous suits and permit \nsmall women-owned and family-owned businesses to resolve Y2K disputes \nwithout costly litigation. The bill now before the Senate is a bi-\npartisan compromise that will accomplish this objective without \nadversely affecting lawsuits that have merit.\n  I believe that the choice is clear. If you are a supporter of small \nwomen-owned and family-owned business and you want to see them continue \nas the economic engine that runs this country, you must support this \nlegislation and vote in favor of cloture so that the Senate may proceed \non this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 2 minutes 42 \nseconds, and the Senator from Arizona has 16 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will yield 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I had a question: Could we reach a time \nagreement? We could certainly cut debate on any amendments from this \nside, I think, to a very short time, and then we ought to be able to \nreach a time agreement.\n  The majority leader would allow this bill to come up and we could \nhave the votes that the Senator would like to have, but we need an \nending date. We cannot go on with the ``walking'' filibuster that puts \nall the agenda of this Congress on hold because of an unlimited time \ndebate.\n  Could we do that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, before we vote, let me make a couple of \npoints very clear.\n  The first point is that we have done everything I know how to \ncooperate on the juvenile justice bill. We have offered a finite list \nof amendments. We have worked with our colleagues to reduce that list. \nWe have agreed to time limits. We have not second-degreed or \nfilibustered any amendments on the other side.\n  As I say, we have done it all. We even offered to offer amendments on \nFriday and Monday. That was rejected by our Republican colleagues \nbecause they didn't want to debate those particular amendments on \nFriday and Monday, after the majority leader made it clear that he \nwanted to have a full debate on both of those days. We didn't have a \nfull debate, but it wasn't the fault of Democrats.\n  So Members might understand my surprise when the majority leader, out \nof the blue, without any prior notification, filed this motion to \nproceed on Y2K. I am not sure why he is doing it today. I sense there \nare some on the other side who don't want to finish the bill, who would \nrather put the bill back on the calendar, for whatever reason, and who \ndon't want to do it cleanly. They want to do it in an obfuscated way so \nour fingerprints are on removing the bill. They want our fingerprints \non this bill as it is put back on the calendar.\n  We are not going to do that. We ought to stay on this bill until it \nis finished. We are getting closer. There is absolutely no reason why, \nthis week--early this week--we couldn't finish this legislation, if we \nset our mind to doing so.\n  So we are going to oppose cloture today, not because we don't want to \nmove to Y2K. I want to move to that bill, and I will support a motion \nto proceed to Y2K. I will do it and I hope we do it immediately, after \nthis bill is completed. We don't need to file cloture on it. I will \nsupport it, a lot of our colleagues will support it. We want to get a \nY2K bill passed. I hope we could do it in a way that would bring a 100-\n0 vote. I think we are negotiating in a way that could produce that \nresult, but maybe I am too optimistic.\n  Let's take these things one step at a time. Let us ensure that we \nfinish this bill before we move on to the next bill. And when we do, I \nwill move on to the next bill and I will move on to the bill after \nthat. We have to get our work done, but let's do it in an organized \nfashion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 16 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am amused and entertained by the remarks \nof the Democrat leader. All he has to do is agree to a time and date \nwhen the final passage of the juvenile justice bill would be voted on. \nHe knows it. I know it. We know it.\n  He is using the same excuse he used last time--almost exactly--that \nhe would move forward with the bill and we would have final passage. I \ncongratulate him on his rhetoric.\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The cloture motion \nhaving been presented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to \nread the motion.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 34, S. 96, the Y2K legislation:\n         Trent Lott, John McCain, Jesse Helms, Rod Grams, Connie \n           Mack, John H.

The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the motion to proceed to S. 96, the Y2K Act, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Brownback) \nis necessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New York (Mr. Moynihan) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Moynihan) would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say again how disappointed I am that \nit appears the Senate did not want to deal with the question of the \nyear 2000 computer liability problem. I think that is a devastating \nblow for business and industry in this country, big and small,\n\n[[Page S5443]]\n\nas well as the computer industry. If we do not do this, I predict by \nthis time next year our courts will be clogged with lawsuits. I do not \nbelieve that is the answer to the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5443-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5443-S5444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. So that Senators will know how we would like to proceed for \nthe next hour or so, we want to have a special order in honor of and \ntribute to one of the finest staff members I have ever known in the 26 \nyears I have been in Congress, Adm. Bud Nance.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that during the tributes to Admiral \nNance all staff of the Foreign Relations Committee be granted floor \nprivileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is anticipated that following those tributes, some time \nmight be spent hearing further from Senators expressing their concern \nat and disappointment about the vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the Y2K issue. Then we will work with the Democratic \nleadership and the managers of the juvenile justice bill to see how we \ncan proceed on that bill after the policy luncheon hour or two hours. \nHopefully, we could have some wrap-up debate on amendments that were \noffered Friday and Monday, because some of those amendments were \noffered and some debate was heard but the other side was not heard on \nthat particular amendment, and it could have been from either side of \nthe aisle. So some additional time might be needed for that, and I was \nthinking of maybe a series of stacked votes.\n  We have some 13 amendments that are pending. Hopefully, we would not \nhave to have a recorded vote on all of those, but whatever number would \nbe required, and then see if we can work for a way to complete the \njuvenile justice bill in a reasonable period of time with a reasonable \nnumber of amendments on both sides, and then go tomorrow, hopefully, \nnot later than noon, to the supplemental appropriations bill, assuming \nthe House passes that this afternoon or tonight.\n  I think it would be irresponsible for us to delay any longer than is \nabsolutely necessary to take up this legislation. It has been pending \ntoo long. It is supposed to be an emergency, supposed to deal with \ndisasters in Central America, in Kansas and Oklahoma, as well as the \ndefense needs in support of our men and women who are flying bombing \nraids right now over Kosovo. It would be my intent, as soon as we \nreceive it from the House, to go to that legislation. It is still my \nhope that we can complete juvenile justice in a reasonable period of \ntime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am extremely disappointed in the failure \nof the Senate to invoke cloture. I believe that there exists strong \nbipartisan support for the bill and it is a shame that the bill may die \nfor partisan reasons. But the Democrats held firm on cloture. Sometimes \nparty unity is a good thing, but in this case, it is a mistake.\n  The reason why it is a mistake is that the Y2K problem hurts America. \nWhat we face is the threat that an avalanche of Y2K-related lawsuits \nwill be simultaneously filed on or about January 3, 2000 and that this \nunprecedented wave of litigation will overwhelm the computer industry's \nability to correct the problem. Make no mistake about it, this super-\nlitigation threat is real, and if it substantially interferes with the \ncomputer industry's ongoing Y2K repair efforts, the consequences for \nAmerica could be disastrous.\n  Today we face the more immediate problem of frivolous litigation that \nseeks recovery even where there is little or no actual harm done. In \nthat regard, I am aware of at least 25 Y2K-related class actions that \nare currently pending in courts across the country, with the threat of \nhundreds more to come.\n  It is precisely these types of Y2K-related lawsuits that pose the \ngreatest danger to industry's efforts to fix the problem. All of us are \naware that the computer industry is feverishly working to correct--or \nremediate, in industry language--Y2K so as to minimize any disruptions \nthat occur early next year.\n  What we also know is that every dollar that industry has to spend to \ndefend against especially frivolous lawsuits is a dollar that will not \nget spent on fixing the problem and delivering solutions to technology \nconsumers. Also, how industry spends its precious time and money \nbetween now and the end of the year--either litigating or mitigating--\nwill largely determine how severe Y2K-related damage, disruption, and \nhardship will be.\n  Let me talk about the potential financial magnitude of the Y2K \nlitigation problem. The Gartner Group estimates that worldwide \nremediation costs will range between $300 billion to $600 billion. \nOther experts contend that overall litigation costs may total $1 \ntrillion. Even if we accept the lower amount, according to Y2K legal \nexpert Jeff Jinnett, ``this cost would greatly exceed the combined \nestimated legal costs associated with Superfund environmental \nlitigation . . . U.S. tort litigation . . . and asbestos litigation.'' \nPerhaps the best illustration of the sheer dimension of the litigation \nmonster that Y2K may create is Mr. Jinnett's suggestion that a $1 \ntrillion estimate for Y2K-related litigation costs ``would exceed even \nthe estimated total annual direct and indirect costs of all civil \nlitigation in the United States,'' which he says is $300 billion per \nyear.\n  These figures should give all of us pause. At this level of cost, \nY2K-related litigation may well overwhelm the capacity of the already \ncrowded court system to deal with it.\n  Thus, it is imperative that Congress should give companies an \nincentive to fix Y2K problems right away, knowing that if they do not \nmake a good-faith effort to do so, they will shortly face costly \nlitigation. The natural economic incentive of industry is to satisfy \ntheir customers and, thus, prosper in the competitive environment of \nthe free market. This acts as a strong motivation for industry to fix a \nY2K problem before any dispute becomes a legal one. This will be true, \nhowever, only as long as businesses are given an opportunity to do so \nand are not forced, at the outset, to divert precious resources from \nthe urgent tasks of the repair shop to the often unnecessary \ndistractions of the court room. A business and legal environment which \nencourages problem-solving while preserving the eventual opportunity to \nlitigate may best insure that consumers and other innocent users of Y2K \ndefective products are protected.\n  The Y2K problem presents a special case. Because of the great \ndependence of our economy, indeed of our whole society, on \ncomputerization, Y2K will impact almost every American in some way. But \nthe problem and its associated harms will occur only once, all at \napproximately the same time, and will affect virtually every aspect of \nthe economy, society, and government. What we must avoid is creating a \nlitigious environment so severe that the computer industry's \nremediation efforts will slacken and retreat at the very moment when \nusers and consumers need them to advance with all deliberate speed. \nWhat we must avoid is the crippling the high tech sector of our \neconomy.\n  As chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Alan Greenspan recently \nnoted, the tremendous growth of our economy is in large measure a \nresult of productivity gains resulting from the computerization of our \neconomy. America is unquestionably the high tech leader in the world \ntoday. Our technology is a major export item. Unless the Y2K bill is \npassed, the American high tech information industries and computer \nbusinesses will be swamped by an avalanche of lawsuits.\n  Mr. President, why kill the goose that lays the golden egg? Let the \nSenate vote on the underlying bill. Let the Senate vote on Democrat and \nRepublican amendments. But let us vote on the merits of the bill. Leave \npolitics aside. This issue is too important to be held hostage.\n  The excuse that the minority proffered is that the Y2K should not be \nbrought up until the Juvenile Justice bill is completed. How ironic. I \nhave been working around the clock to work on a time agreements for \namendments to the Juvenile Justice bill. The minority has been delaying \nthe Juvenile Justice bill and uses the delay as an excuse to vote no on \ncloture petition on a motion to proceed to the Y2K bill. That's called \nchutzpa.\n\n[[Page S5444]]\n\n  Look, a strong bipartisan substitute--a Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-\nGorton-Wyden-Bennett substitute--has been crafted. This substitute is \ncarefully drafted to assure an appropriate balance between the rights \nof citizens to bring suits for compensation and the need to protect the \nhigh tech community from onerous and wasteful litigation. This is a \nfair resolution of differences between Democrats and Republicans. I \nhope--for the sake of our Nation--that the minority allows us to debate \nthis provision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5444-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5444-S5445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 254\n\n  Mr. LOTT. So for the sake of discussions, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate now resume consideration of the juvenile justice bill, \nand there be 10 amendments in order per side to be selected from the \namendments in order pursuant to the previous consent of May 14, and \npassage occur by 12 noon, Wednesday, May 19.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object--and my distinguished friend \nfrom Mississippi discussed this with me before during the vote--and as \nI have told my friend from Mississippi and my friend from Utah, we are \ncontinuing to work to whittle down the number of amendments certainly \non our side. As I had assured my friend from Utah over the weekend, I \nand my staff have spent a lot of time talking to Democratic Members, \nand we have cut out a number of amendments.\n  I do want to see this bill completed. I do want a good juvenile \njustice bill. Also, I want to get us on to Y2K, as the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, said he is in favor of the Y2K \nbill. He is in favor of going immediately, after juvenile justice, to \nthe Y2K bill.\n  The distinguished majority leader is absolutely right in what he said \nabout the supplemental. I suspect--I have not talked with Senator \nStevens and Senator Byrd--that is going to go fairly rapidly.\n  We are going to have our caucus luncheons. The distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina wishes to begin a series of justly-deserved \ntributes to the admiral. I ask the distinguished leader if he would \nwithdraw for now the unanimous consent agreement, let us work during \nour caucus luncheons with other Members to try to get this up so we can \naccommodate both the Republican and Democratic side, get amendments \nvoted up or down, and get the bill voted up or down.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, based on that request and a full measure of \ntrying to be reasonable and get an agreement to get this worked out and \ncompleted, because I think juvenile crime in this country is a very \nserious issue, for the Senate to not deal with it seriously and to \ncomplete action would be indefensible.\n  My problem, as the majority leader, is that we have the supplemental, \nwhich is not going to be completed in 2 hours. This bill is going to \ntake some discussion. I think it is a tragedy that we are not going to \ndo the Y2K issue, but I am interested in getting a result. I think if \nwe can get some cooperation, we can achieve that.\n  Keep in mind that we have had some 25 amendments, I believe, that \nhave been offered and debated. This would call for 20 more. That is 45 \namendments on a bill that has been in the making for 2 years. So I \nthink my request is reasonable, and it is my third or fourth attempt to \nfind some sort of time agreement.\n  I thought and was assured that we would work to complete this bill \nlast Thursday. That didn't work out. And I understand. Sometimes the \nleadership on both sides of the aisle has goals we wish to achieve, but \nthe rest of the troops don't necessarily follow and fall in line, so we \ncan't quite fulfill that commitment. But the suggestion was made, well, \nwe will have amendments Friday and Monday, and we would vote on a \nseries of amendments Tuesday morning, final passage by noon. That was \nobjected to. Then we said, how about 5, with more amendments after the \nstacked votes on Tuesday morning. That was objected to. Then I said 6. \nThat was objected to.\n  Now I am saying, how about getting what we have standing, 20 more \namendments, and complete it by noon on Wednesday so we can go to the \nsupplemental. I think I am bending over backwards, not because I want \nmore of the type of debate that I heard last week where Senators even \nobject to a Senator amending their own amendment. I didn't realize that \nhappened in the Senate. I was very disappointed with that action. But \ninstead, we must come together and seriously try to deal with this \nproblem.\n  I know there are Senators on both sides of the aisle who want to do \nthat, and I am anxious to find a way to get it done and get it \ncompleted. I will withhold this request. I hope the managers will work \nthrough this, while we are having this very well-deserved tribute to \nAdmiral Nance, and then after the luncheon hopefully we can wrap up \nsome agreement.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the distinguished leader will yield further, I will be \nvery brief. In my 25 years here, I have seen majority leaders, \ndistinguished majority leaders, both Republican and Democrat, try to \nwhittle down bills in time, and usually when they propose time \nagreements, the number of amendments has expanded. In this case, I say \nthe good news for the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is, each \ntime he has done this, actually the numbers have dwindled, and dwindle \nand dwindle.\n  I suggest that perhaps the distinguished Senator from Utah and I \ncontinue our efforts and report to our respective leaders after the \ncaucus where we stand.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Utah on the floor. I know that \nhe wants the floor, and so I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I really appreciate the majority leader and \nhis patience and forbearance, because this bill is now in its sixth \nday. That is more than we give to most bills in the Senate, unless they \nare just hotly contested. This is one that should not be hotly \ncontested. Everybody ought to be for this bill.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I read a quote from a recent New York Times \neditorial, and I would like to read it again, prior to the time for \nSenator Helms.\n  This is from the New York Times editorial:\n\n       In the past it was not hard to be struck by the way time \n     seemed to roll over a tragedy like a school shooting, by the \n     disparity between the enduring grief of parents who lost \n     children in places like Paducah and Jonesboro and the swift \n     distraction of the rest of us. This time, perhaps, things may \n     be different. The Littleton shootings have forced upon the \n     nation a feeling that many parents know all too well--that of \n     inhabiting the very culture they are trying to protect their \n     children from. . . . The urge to do something about youth \n     violence is very strong . . . but it will require an urge to \n     do many things, and to do them with considerable ingenuity \n     and dedication, before symptomatic violence of the kind that \n     occurred in Littleton begins to seem truly improbable, not \n     just as unlikely as the last shooting.\n\n  That was the New York Times, May 11, 1999. While I may not agree with \nthe Times on everything, I doubt I could have described any better the \ntask we have taken on. This issue is a complex problem and one which \nrequires dedication, a spirit of cooperation, and an agreed upon set of \nobjectives.\n  I believe that spirit of cooperation has been lacking somewhat as \nthis is the sixth day we are on this bill and, as of this morning, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle still had over 25 amendments. \nNow, my friend from Vermont has indicated that he is working to try and \nget those cut down. I hope he is successful. I have spent several days \nurging Republicans not to offer their amendments--most have been \nagreeable--in the hopes that my colleagues on the other side would \nreciprocate. I spent the weekend here, and my staff was here working \naround the clock. We heard nothing from the other side during that \ntime. Indeed, we were told by them that staff would not be coming in to \nmeet with us at that time.\n  Now, perhaps they were trying to work on the Democrat amendments. \nCertainly, the distinguished Senator from Vermont says that is what he \nwas doing. But frankly, we were prepared to work and cut these matters \ndown and get this whole matter completed.\n  In fairness, we have been given some suggested changes to the \nunderlying bill. We were given those suggestions late yesterday. I \nwould be willing to accept a number of them if it meant we\n\n[[Page S5445]]\n\ncould pass this bill by a date certain. As well, staff has been working \nto clear several amendments as part of a managers' package of \namendments, which I hope Senator Leahy and I can do. Still, we have \nbeen given no commitment, assurances, or even a hint that my colleagues \nwill agree to a vote on a time or date certain. This bill is too \nimportant to be treated this way. The problem of juvenile crime and the \nvictims of juvenile crime deserve better.\n  We should pass this bill, but there are a number on the other side \nwho want to pull this bill down. You hear a lot of posturing about the \ngun lobby, which is complete nonsense. Let's just review the facts.\n  The President's gun package was framed as essentially containing the \nfollowing elements: Gun show loopholes; permanent Brady; one gun a \nmonth; juvenile Brady; juvenile possession of assault weapons, increase \nthe age to 21; child access to guns, liability; safety locks; increase \npenalties for guns to juveniles; firearms tracing; youth crime gun \ninitiative; gun kingpins penalties; and a clip ban.\n  More than half of the President's so-called ``plan'' has been acted \non by the Senate or is contained in a pending amendment. In other \nwords, we have agreed to a unanimous consent agreement limiting \namendments which allows for the remaining elements of the President's \nplan to be offered.\n  So the question is, Where is the President on this issue? Republicans \nwant to let this plan be voted on, but his allies in the Senate do not \nappear eager to move forward. I hope they will.\n  I believe my colleague from Vermont when he says that, given some \ntime and through the caucuses today, we probably can get this resolved, \nor at least he hopes we can. I do also. We have to get it resolved.\n  We are not trying to avoid the gun issue. I think some are concerned \nhow this bill, with its reforms of the entertainment industry, will be \nreceived by their friends in Hollywood. That is something I think \nreally bothers some on the other side. It bothers me, too. But we are \ndoing some things that really are valuable, really viable, really \nworthwhile, and really allow for voluntary compliance and an approach \nthat really will work in the best interests of the entertainment \nindustry.\n  Given the seriousness of this problem, and the number of warning \nsigns that future tragedies may be imminent--we are announcing them \ndaily--we cannot afford to filibuster this bill through amendment. We \nshould not play politics with this bill. Instead, we should come \ntogether and pass this bill. I am certainly hopeful that that is what \nwe are going to get done either today or tomorrow.\n  I think the majority leader has been more than accommodating on this. \nHe has indicated that he can only give so much time to this because \nthere are so many other pending bills. The distinguished Senator from \nVermont and I both know that we have to bring up the bankruptcy bill, \nthe Satellite Home Viewer Act, in addition to all these very important \nissues that involve the national defense and our people who are serving \nin the Balkan crisis, and, of course, the supplemental appropriations \nbill. We only have a limited time in which to do it.\n\n  So it is good that we get together today and get this matter \nresolved. I don't think we could have had a more cooperative majority \nleader, under the circumstances. We stand ready, willing, and able to \nwork with our colleagues on the other side to try to narrow these \namendments and, of course, work with them to try to get some of these \nproblems solved that they think are so serious.\n  I might add that a number of these gun amendments were already in the \nbill; juvenile Brady is a prime example. We had that already in the \nbill. You would think, from the President's remarks, that it wasn't \npart of our bill. We have worked on this bill for 2 years. I want it to \nbe bipartisan; I want our Democratic colleagues to be part of this; I \nwant them to feel good after it is all done. We have made every effort \nto try to accommodate them. But to have this thing go on for another \nday or two is basically not right, under the circumstances.\n  So I hope we can get together, and I hope we will work together and \nget our staffs together, and I hope we will resolve this either today \nor tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from Utah \nwould not want to leave a wrong impression about what has happened, so \nperhaps I might flesh out his remarks just a tad.\n  One, it should be noted that every single Democratic Senator wants to \nsee a juvenile justice bill passed. The comments about pulling the bill \ndown have all come from the Republican side of the aisle, not from the \nDemocratic side of the aisle.\n  As far as working on this, I am not sure to what the Senator is \nreferring. I don't know when I have spent so much time on the phone, \nthe computer and e-mails, and on a bill as I have this past weekend. \nOur staffs have worked late into the night. We were given a wish list \nfrom the Republican staff, as was appropriately done at the beginning \nof the weekend. We worked on that all weekend long, calling Senators \nall over the country on it. As of last night, we had cleared 40 \namendments. That is progress. That is very significant progress.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from Utah said on the talk shows this \nweekend that they need seven amendments on the Republican side. Four \nwere introduced yesterday, but this morning there are suddenly 10. We \nhave kind of floating numbers here. But the facts are such that we have \nbeen working and we have cleared a very large number of amendments that \nSenators never have to see.\n  The last crime bill took 12 days. There were 99 amendments. We walked \nthrough it, and we did it. I remember being on that committee of \nconference, and the distinguished Senator from Utah may recall that we \nwere there until 3, 4, 5 o'clock in the morning. These were complex \nissues, but we got it done. The crime rate has been coming down for 6 \nyears--something that I have not seen under any other administration \nbefore--Republican or Democrat. So we can get somewhere on this.\n  We have significant issues in here. Every single Member on this side \nof the aisle is committed to seeing a juvenile justice bill passed. We \nwant to go on to debate and vote on Y2K. The majority leader is correct \nin saying the supplemental has to be passed. We are not trying to delay \nit. I assure my friend from Utah that an enormous amount of work was \ndone this weekend, and it was done until very late last night. I think \nmy last e-mail on this came through to me at about 12:30, 12:45 this \nmorning. We are getting it done.\n  Now, the distinguished Senator from North Carolina has been sitting \nhere patiently and wishes to speak about a lifetime friend, a man who \ndeserves a great deal of honor and praise by this Senate from both \nsides. I think we would do the Senate well and the memory of the great \nman well by both of us holding this debate until after the caucus. I \nthank the distinguished Senator from North Carolina for his courtesy, \nwhich was doubly helpful this morning because I know this is a \ndifficult time for him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5445-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me take note that members of Adm. \nNance's family are in the family gallery. While the rules prohibit my \nsaying anything to them, I think they know that our deepest sympathy \ngoes to them from us.\n  Mr. President, when I heard the sound of Dr. Elaine Sloand's quiet \nvoice on the other end of the line at about 3:30 in the afternoon a \nweek ago, I detected an unmistakable sadness in it. I tried to brace \nmyself for the bad news that had been expected for a day or so. Dr. \nSloand, a wonderful, great, kind and compassionate physician, had done \neverything within her power to save Bud Nance's life. Many others at \nthe National Institutes of Health had\n\n[[Page S5446]]\n\nalso worked against the odds to save this great American, the \nremarkable retired Naval officer who had fought in almost a dozen of \nthe major battles of World War II.\n  So, Mr. President, when I picked up the phone and heard Dr. Sloand's \nvoice, I knew that James Wilson Nance was gone. And he was.\n  As I sat at my desk in silence and alone, I recalled the poignancy of \nAdlai Stevenson years ago when he lost the bid for the Presidency: ``It \nhurts too bad to smile and I'm too old to cry.''\n  A thousand memories crowded their way into my consciousness as I sat \nthere in those few quiet minutes. You see, Mr. President, Bud Nance and \nI could not have been more than 4 or 5 years old when we began playing \ntogether as little boys. On one occasion, he had scarcely had time to \nget to his home from my house a couple of blocks away in our little \nhometown of Monroe, when he was back knocking at the door. There he \nstood with his little hand thrust forward with a toy: ``Here,'' he \nsaid, ``this is yours; I took it home by mistake and I'm sorry.''\n  Just as the boy, Bud Nance, was unfailingly and impeccably honest, so \nwas Rear Adm. James W. Nance decades later when he skippered a series \nof U.S. warships, including the giant aircraft carrier, the Forrestal, \nthat had more sailors aboard than there were people in Bud Nance's \nhometown and mine.\n  During the past week, there has been an almost endless series of \nfriends and admirers of Admiral Nance expressing their sorrow and their \nadmiration for what I regard as a giant of a man fallen. Needless to \nsay, I have been deeply grateful to every one of those expressing their \nregrets and their comfort.\n  Anybody who has known Bud Nance did not merely like Bud Nance; it is \na far deeper and genuine feeling that so many have held for him. In my \ncase, nothing fits but the word ``love''. I loved Bud Nance like a \nbrother. In my final conversation with him 9 days ago, I told him so. \nHis voice, weak and raspy, but nonetheless unmistakably clear, replied, \n``I love you, too.''\n  Bud loved his family; oh, how he loved them. We had often discussed, \ndown through the years, his and my good fortunes. He once commented \nabout his dear wife, Mary Lyda, that it was she who did the hard part. \nHe used to say, ``I was away so much of the time, and she was back home \nraising our children and raising them right.''\n  Mr. President, I could go on, but I shall not, except for one final \nvignette, which underscores the goodness and tenderness of ``The \nAdmiral.''\n  Some years ago, on a cold and wintry night, a kitten was abandoned at \nBud's and Mary Lyda's front door. It was doubtful that the kitten--\ncold, shivering and wet--would survive, but Bud and Mary Lyda produced \nhot water bottles and a tiny bed for that little kitten who was too \nfragile and too young to handle solid food. For 2 or 3 nights straight, \nBud Nance sat up with that kitten, lovingly holding it in his arms \nwhile, with a teaspoon, feeding a little bit of warm milk into that \ntiny little fluff of fur.\n  But the kitten did survive. He named that kitten Kate. She slept at \nthe foot of Bud's bed from then on.\n  Mr. President, Dot and I visited Mary Lyda Faulk and the wonderful \nNance children that night following Bud's departure earlier in the \nafternoon. While we sat in the living room chatting, in strolled Kate. \nShe checked each one of the several of us, but she first went to Bud's \nempty chair. I believe Kate knew that her great benefactor and her best \nfriend was gone.\n  Kate was such a lucky little kitten, just as all the rest of us were \nlucky to have known Bud Nance, to have worked with him, to have had him \nas a true and faithful friend, a friend whom we not only admired, but \nloved.\n  I ask unanimous consent articles about Admiral Nance be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Charlotte Observer, May 14, 1999]\n\n        Bud Nance, Monroe Native Was an Officer and a Gentleman\n\n       James ``Bud'' Nance, who died Tuesday at age 77, was a \n     modest man with a wry, sometimes pointed sense of humor. \n     When, at Jesse Helms' request, he came out of retirement to \n     direct Sen. Helms' staff on the Foreign Relations Committee, \n     he was confident enough to allow staffers to talk to the \n     press on the record on a wide range of issues. He offered one \n     caution, he recalled with a smile: that ``If you leak \n     something [secret] to the press, and I find out about it, I'm \n     going to kill you.''\n       He grew up in Monroe, where he and the future senator were \n     playmates and members of the same band (Jesse on tuba, Bud on \n     clarinet). He graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1944 \n     and was assigned to the USS North Carolina, which survived \n     attacks by more than 150 Japanese suicide bombers.\n       After the war, he became a Navy test pilot. It was \n     dangerous work--five of the 10 men in one of his test pilot \n     units died in crashes. Later he commanded the aircraft \n     carrier USS Forrestal, then worked for the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff and for Gen. Alexander Haig, who become President \n     Reagan's secretary of state. When Admiral Nance became deputy \n     assistant to Mr. Reagan's national security adviser, the \n     Washington Post said he was ``among the most well-connected \n     military officers in Washington.''\n       When Sen. Helms asked him to reshape the Foreign Relations \n     Committee staff, he accepted pay only because the law \n     required it--$2.96 a week, the congressional minimum. After \n     automatic raises bumped it to $4.53, Sen. Helms observed. \n     ``Bud's worth every penny.''\n       Bud Nance was an officer, a gentleman and an American hero. \n     When he took the Foreign Relations post, he said, ``The only \n     thing I'm here for is to do a good job for the United States, \n     and to make sure Jesse gets a square deal.'' His nation, and \n     his old friend, will attest that, as always, he accomplished \n     his goals.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Rob Christensen: Jesse Loses a Boyhood Friend\n\n                          (By Rob Christensen)\n\n       They are breaking up Jesse Helms' old Monroe High School \n     Band.\n       One by one, the members have been going to their reward. \n     Gone is the oboe player, Henry Hall Wilson, once chairman of \n     the Chicago Board of Trade and a former U.S. Senate \n     candidate. Gone is the cornet player, Skipper Bowles, a \n     former gubernatorial candidate and the father of former White \n     House chief of staff Erskine Bowles.\n       And last week, the clarinet player, retired Rear Adm. James \n     ``Bud'' Nance, passed away.\n       Which left Helms, the tuba player, fielding condolence \n     calls from the likes of President Clinton and Gov. Jim Hunt. \n     Helms has lost his best remaining friend who isn't named Dot \n     Helms.\n       It's not just that Nance was Helms' chief of staff on the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Their relationship \n     started in 1921 in the Union County town of Monroe, where \n     Jesse and Bud were born two blocks apart, two months apart.\n       It was Jesse and Bud who used to go to The Strand to see \n     Tom Mix westerns. It was Jesse and Bud who put a ``For Sale'' \n     sign on their high school lawn one Halloween. And it was \n     Jesse and Bud who would slip behind the school to sneak a \n     cigarette.\n       Jesse was proud of Bud's Navy career--on the USS North \n     Carolina during World War II, where he endured 162 Japanese \n     air and kamikaze attacks; Navy test pilot along with such \n     pals as John Glenn and Alan Shepard; commander of an attack \n     squadron, an air wing and two ships--the USS Raleigh, an \n     amphibious ship he skippered off the cost of Vietnam, and the \n     aircraft carrier USS Forrestal.\n       As Jesse liked to say, Bud was the Monroe boy who amounted \n     to something.\n       I first met the admiral deep in the bowels of the White \n     House, where he was acting national security adviser to \n     President Reagan. Among his hires were Iran-contra figures \n     Oliver North and John Poindexter.\n       ``I'm the only guy who walked out of the place,'' Nance \n     would later say, laughing.\n       Helms brought Nance out of retirement to become his chief \n     aide on the Foreign Relations staff.\n       Nance, a pretty conservative fellow himself, cleaned \n     house--ousting some staffers who he thought were veering too \n     far off into right-wing conspiracy land. And he advised Helms \n     on a broad range of foreign and military matters. Jesse \n     trusted Bud completely.\n       In recent months, Nance had suffered from myelodysplasia, a \n     blood disease that made him unable to produce platelets. But \n     just a few days before his death, Nance was still showing up \n     in his office at 7 a.m.\n       In the end, Jesse and Bud were friends again in the \n     Virginia suburbs of D.C.--hundreds of miles from where they \n     started in life.\n       Nance once remarked to his friend that Helms had better not \n     be the first to die.\n       To which Helms quipped: ``I'll kill you if you do.''\n       ``I cannot describe the guy because he had as much \n     character as anyone I've ever known,'' Helms said last week. \n     ``He was thoughtful. He cared about people.

Nance was a boyhood friend of the Foreign Relations \n     Committee's chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms, North Carolina \n     Republican. Mr. Helms had no public statement yesterday but \n     the committee spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said Adm. Nance ``was \n     so beloved by so many.''\n       Adm. Nance graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy at \n     Annapolis in 1944. He served as an aviator in World War II, \n     Korea and Vietnam, earning two Distinguished Service Medals. \n     He rose to command of the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal.\n       Later he served as assistant national security adviser to \n     President Reagan and joined Mr. Helms' staff in October 1991.\n       Mr. Helms, the ranking Republican member of the Foreign \n     Relations Committee at that time, was having problems with \n     his 19-member staff and asked Adm. Nance--who had retired to \n     Virginia--to take charge.\n       ``I was home having a real good time,'' Adm. Nance told a \n     columnist in 1992. ``Jesse called and said, `Come on up and \n     help me get control of this zoo.' ''\n       Within three months, nine committee staffers were \n     dismissed.\n       As a condition of his own employment, Adm. Nance asked that \n     he not be paid, but Mr. Helms pointed out that federal law \n     required that Senate staffers be paid a minimum of $153 a \n     year.\n       ``Nobody can ever say Jesse gave his old buddy a job,'' \n     Adm. Nance said.\n       When Republicans took control of Congress after the 1994 \n     elections, the GOP pushed through a law requiring Congress to \n     abide by the employment laws that applied to U.S. businesses. \n     Along with a minimum wage increase passed in 1996, that \n     bumped Adm. Nance's pay to $204 a week.\n       Adm. Nance brought a caustic sense of humor to his Senate \n     job. Shortly after he joined Mr. Helms' staff, Adm. Nance was \n     questioning the benefits lavished on U.S. ambassadors, \n     including hardship pay.\n       ``I fought at Iwo Jima,'' he said. ``That's hardship.''\n       ``He's like a father figure to his staff,'' one of Mr. \n     Helms' assistants said of Adm. Nance in 1993. ``You just \n     can't put a price on that kind of wisdom.''\n       Adm.

Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) has a story he likes to tell \n     about James ``Bud'' Nance, the retired Navy rear admiral and \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff director who died \n     Monday.\n       Hagel remembers a Foreign Relations meeting where one \n     Senator was droning on and on, ``enjoying his own \n     eloquence.''\n       ``After a while,'' Hagel recalled yesterday, ``Bud leaned \n     over and whispered in my ear, `Senator, remember, you don't \n     have to be eternal to be immortal.' He said it with that \n     twinkle in his eye and then he winked at me.''\n       The exact cause of death for Nance was not disclosed, \n     although he told Roll Call last month that he was suffering \n     from myelodysplasia, a blood disease that rendered him unable \n     to produce platelets. He was 77.\n       Foreign Relations Chairman Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), who grew \n     up three blocks from Nance, had not released a statement on \n     his life-long friend by press time yesterday.\n       But in an interview last month, Helms praised the fact that \n     despite his illness, Nance beat ``everyone else to work,'' \n     often arriving at the office by 7 a.m.\n       Senators who worked closely with Nance said he was a \n     thoughtful man and a tough staff director.\n       ``I trusted him completely,'' said Foreign Relations \n     ranking member Joe Biden (D-Del.) in an interview this week. \n     ``I cared a lot about the guy personally.''\n       Biden added that both he and Helms benefited from Nance's \n     long experience with military affairs.\n       ``He knew the complexities of all this stuff,'' said Biden. \n     ``I never had any doubt I could confide in him.''\n       ``He was a gentleman,'' said Hagel. ``He was such a \n     complete person. People had tremendous confidence in him, \n     partly because they liked him and partly because they trusted \n     him.''\n       Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), a member of Foreign \n     Relations, said of Nance, ``This is just one of the finest \n     people I've met in my 18 years in the Senate.''\n       Dodd also spoke of Nance's steady had in dealing with the \n     committee's younger staffers.\n       ``He was a wonderful, tempering influence on the young \n     staff,'' said Dodd. ``I know this is a loss for Senator \n     Helms. I think it's a real loss for the Senate as well.''\n       Nance was particularly close to Helms, who brought Nance on \n     board in November 1991 to head up the panel's GOP staff. \n     Nance and Helms were boyhood friends in Monroe, N.C.\n       Nance joined the committee at a time when its staff was in \n     disarray, and three months after taking the post, Nance fired \n     nine top aides.\n       ``I felt we had too much overhead and not enough \n     operators,'' Nance told Roll Call in 1992. ``It was difficult \n     for me to see exactly who was doing what.''\n       When he first came on, Nance refused to take a salary. \n     Since federal law required that Senate staffers receive at \n     least $153 per year, Nance accepted that, and after the \n     minimum wage was increased, his pay jumped to $204 per week.\n       Nance, who entered the Navy as a midshipman in 1941 and \n     retired 38 years later as a rear admiral, saw active duty in \n     World War II, Korea and Vietnam. Nance said that during his \n     service in World War II, he endured 162 Japanese air and \n     kamikaze attacks.\n       Over the course of his Navy tenure, Nance commanded an \n     attack squadron, an air wing and two ships--the USS Raleigh \n     and the USS Forrestal. His military background had a profound \n     effect on the way he carried himself and on the way he \n     handled the committee's staff.\n       ``When you manage an aircraft carrier, you are managing a \n     small city at sea,'' said Hagel. ``It matures one rather \n     quickly.''\n       Nance was born Aug. 1921, in Monroe. He entered the U.S. \n     Naval Academy in 1941 and spent three years there, earning a \n     bachelor's degree in 1944. He later spent time at both the \n     Naval War College and the National War College, and in 1965 \n     he received a master's in international relations from George \n     Washington University.\n       After leaving the military in 1979, Nance went on to work \n     as assistant national security adviser during the Reagan \n     administration. He then joined the privates sector, working \n     for several years as head of naval systems for Boeing Co. \n     Nance had retired to Virginia when Helms asked him to come to \n     the Hill.\n       Nance is survived by his wife of 42 years, Mary, four \n     children and seven grandchildren.\n       A Senate GOP source said Helms will try next week to clear \n     some time on the Senate floor for Members to pay tribute to \n     Nance.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 13, 1999]\n\n    Adm.

Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), died of complications from \n     a preliminary form of leukemia May 11 at the National \n     Institutes of Health.\n       Adm. Nance, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and former \n     naval aviator and test pilot, was a self-described \n     conservative Republican who reportedly advised Helms, the \n     committee's chairman, to tone down his sometimes fiery \n     rhetoric and confrontational approach when tackling issues.\n       Their close relationship was based on a mutual trust that \n     stemmed from their days growing up in their native Monroe, \n     N.C. Over the years since they played in the same elementary \n     school band, they periodically kept in touch. Although the \n     two shared similar political philosophies, Adm. Nance was \n     considered Helms's opposite in many aspects, coming across as \n     a more courtly hard-nosed figure with an easy laugh and a \n     loathing of the limelight.\n       He did have critics. A POW group called on Helms to fire \n     Adm. Nance because of what they said was the committee's lack \n     of attention to their cause. Still, he was seen as an affable \n     father figure in Washington's corridors, where colleagues \n     referred to him simply as ``the admiral.''\n       At Helms urging, Adm. Nance, who had an illustrious 38-year \n     career in the Navy, joined the committee in 1991 to help \n     improve the minority staff's efficiency. Saying the \n     government already had done plenty for him, Adm. Nance \n     accepted the job on the condition that he would work for \n     free.\n       But, as it turned out, laboring without a salary was not an \n     option under Senate rules. He was paid Congress's then \n     minimum of $2.96 a week. Later, two cost-of-living pay \n     increases bumped his weekly salary to $4.53. Still, he wasted \n     little time with the task put before him, overhauling the \n     staff by releasing deadwood and malcontents, hiring whiz kids \n     and shifting old-timers around.\n       After the Republicans swept into the majority in the 1994 \n     mid-term elections, Adm. Nance was placed in charge of the \n     transition on the Foreign Relations Committee and predicted \n     that Senate members would play a larger role in foreign \n     policy hot spots. He was coming into the office as recently \n     as last week, showing up as he did every day at 7 a.m. and \n     returning to his home in McLean in the evening.\n       Adm. Nance was no stranger to the committee's workings, \n     having served as a consultant to the committee during the \n     SALT II deliberations. In 1981, he joined the White House as \n     President Ronald Reagan's deputy assistant for national \n     security affairs, and for a brief time, he was acting chief \n     special assistant for national security affairs, temporarily \n     replacing Richard V. Allen.\n       As a young man, he attended what is now North Carolina \n     State University and graduated from the Naval Academy in \n     1944. He was assigned to the battleship USS North Carolina \n     and served there throughout the remainder of World War II.\n       After the war, he underwent flight training and served as a \n     flight instructor at the Naval Air Basic Training Command of \n     the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla. He was assigned to \n     exchange duty with the British Royal Navy in the mid-1950s \n     and was a project pilot with the Flight Test Division at\n\n[[Page S5448]]\n\n     the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River. In the latter \n     assignment, he test-landed aircraft on carriers.\n       Before his military retirement in 1979, he served as the \n     senior naval officer on the staff of the commander of U.S. \n     forces in Europe when Alexander Haig held the combined job of \n     U.S. and NATO commander.

He was 77 and lived in McLean, VA.\n       Marc A. Thiessen, the spokesman for the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee, where Admiral Nance was staff director, \n     said the cause was complications of myelodysplasia, a pre-\n     leukemia condition.\n       On Capital Hill, Admiral Nance was known for having brought \n     order to the committee's Republican staff, which Senator \n     Helms, the senior Republican, and others on the panel had \n     found disorganized and riven by ideological differences.\n       ``When I came over here, I couldn't understand the \n     organization,'' Admiral Nance said in a 1992 interview with \n     The National Journal after agreeing to come out of retirement \n     a year earlier to help his old friend. ``It was a zoo to me. \n     My military mind has got to have all the men and women in \n     line.''\n       Admiral Nance's role was important then, when Senator Helms \n     was the committee's ranking minority member, and it became \n     more important later, when, after the 1994 elections, the \n     Republicans took control of the Senate and Mr. Helms became \n     chairman.\n       Before Admiral Nance was brought in, The National Journal \n     said in its 1992 article, there had been a movement among the \n     committee's Republicans to remove Mr. Helms as their leader \n     because of the minority staff's disarray.\n       Mr. Helms accepted Admiral Vance's recommendations that \n     eight members of the staff be fired, and although there was \n     an angry reaction at first, Republican leaders later said the \n     Vance replacements had brought order to the panel.\n       Admiral Nance was born in Monroe, N.C., where he and Mr. \n     Helms grew up two blocks from each other. He graduated from \n     the United States Naval Academy in 1944 and went on to serve \n     as a naval aviator in World War II, the Korean War and the \n     Vietnam War. By the time he retired from the Navy in 1979, he \n     had held several commands, including that of the aircraft \n     carrier Forrestal.\n       He became a humorous if caustic reflection of the dour \n     Senator Helms, who seems to enjoy saying no to State \n     Department requests. Once, when questioning the benefits \n     given to ambassadors abroad, including hardship pay at some \n     posts, Admiral Nance said: ``I fought at Iwo Jima. That's \n     hardship.''\n       He had many Navy decorations, including two Distinguished \n     Service Medals and the Legion of Merit.\n       After his Navy service, Admiral Nance served for two years \n     on the White House staff of President Ronald Reagan and later \n     worked for Boeing in its naval systems department.\n       Besides the Naval Academy, he graduated from the Naval War \n     College and the National War College, and received a master's \n     degree in international relations from George Washington \n     University.\n       Admiral Nance, who was known as Bud to his friends, is \n     survived by his wife of 51 years, the former Mary Lyda Faulk; \n     two sons, James Lee Nance of Richmond and Andrew Monroe Nance \n     of McLean; two daughters, Mary Catherine Worth of Atlanta and \n     Susan Elizabeth Nance of McLean, and seven grandchildren.\n       When Admiral Nance agreed to go to work for Senate Helms. \n     The Washington Times reported in an obituary on Wednesday, he \n     asked that he not be paid, but the Senator pointed out that a \n     Federal law required that Senate staff members be paid a \n     minimum of $153 a year.\n       Once he went to work for the $153.

Nance also had served in \n     the Nixon and Regan administrations.\n       ``I don't know of anybody . . . that had as much effect on \n     the country or that had any higher principles than Bud \n     Nance,'' Helms said in an interview Wednesday evening.\n       Helms said Nance, who died Tuesday, suffered from a blood \n     disease that prevents sufferers from producing platelets. \n     Without platelets, a person cannot stop bleeding once cut.\n       Funeral services for Nance will be held at 9 a.m. Wednesday \n     at Lewinsville Presbyterian Church in McLean, VA. He will be \n     buried with full military honors at Arlington National \n     Cemetary at 11 a.m. Wednesday.\n       Helms and Nance were born two blocks and two months apart \n     in Monroe in 1921. At Monroe High school, they played \n     together in a school band organized by the principal, Ray \n     House.\n       Nance played clarinet; Helms played tuba.\n       Two years ago, Helms and Nance returned to their hometown \n     to attend House's funeral.\n       After attending N.C. State College in Raleigh, Nance \n     enrolled at the Naval Academy in 1941 and eventually \n     commanded an aircraft carrier. He rose to senior command \n     positions in aircraft carrier operations before retiring as a \n     rear admiral in 1979.\n       Nance served as a consultant to the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee during SALT II deliberations and on \n     President Ronald Reagan's transition team. With Reagan's \n     inauguration, Nance was appointed Deputy Assistant to the \n     President for National Security Affairs.\n       He worked in the Reagan administration until 1983, then \n     became a consultant for Boeing. After retiring again, Nance \n     was persuaded by Helms to join the staff of the Senate \n     Foreign Relations Committee.\n       ``If a ship runs aground it's the captain's fault, and the \n     ship had run aground,'' Nance said in explaining some \n     reshuffling at the time.\n       Nance had asked that he be paid only $1 because his \n     government retirement benefits already were enough. But Nance \n     had to receive Congress' minimum of $2.96 per week. After two \n     cost-of-living increases, Nance was forced to take $4.53 per \n     week.\n       ``Bud's worth every penny,'' Helms said when he took his \n     salary hike.\n       Nance had been receiving platelet transfusions twice a week \n     at the National Institutes of Health. Nance said last month \n     he had switched to an electric shaver on doctors' orders and \n     had to be very careful in handling sharp objects.\n       Helms said he last spoke to his old friend in the hospital \n     on Sunday. They joked about old times, Helms said.\n       After Nance died, Helms said, a Capitol police officer \n     stopped to tell Helms how Nance had rolled down his window \n     every day to shake his hand.\n       Said Helms, ``I loved Bud.

We have been on \nopposite sides of a lot of issues, occasionally on the same side. I \nhave seen and listened to and been on the opposite end of some very \npowerful and difficult speeches he has made. But I am presumptuous \nenough, know him well enough to say until now he has never had a more \ndifficult time making a speech than today.\n  There is a reason for that, to state the obvious. There is an old \nexpression: You can know a man by his enemies. I suggest you can judge \na man by his friends. Anybody who had a man of the stature of Admiral \nNance love him as much as Admiral Nance loved this guy, means there is \nsomething awful, awful, awful, awful good about the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  I am not doing that really to be solicitous. I truly mean that and I \nbelieve that. The irony of all ironies, as I told the chairman, on the \nFriday before Bud died, the chairman asked him whether or not he could \ncome down to my office to see if we could work out--and we did, by the \nway--work out some legislative language and discuss a nominee. We sat \nthere with staff--his staff and mine. Afterwards, the staff left and \nAdmiral Nance and I sat there for the better part of 45 minutes, \nbasically asking\n\n[[Page S5449]]\n\nhim questions and him telling me stories.\n  They were all about Jesse Helms, his buddy. They are all about the \nguy he grew up with and loved. I suspect, one of the few men or women, \nother than Mrs. Helms, who has ever been able to tell the chairman: \nEnough, Jesse; slow down, Jesse; no, Jesse. Senator Helms, I don't \nthink in all the time I have known him, has ever respected anybody as \nmuch as he respected Admiral Nance.\n  It was a wonder to behold, I think my Democratic colleagues would \nagree with me, to watch this relationship. It was almost, I say to my \nfriend from North Carolina, like you had an older brother, a brother \nwho loved you and guided you and occasionally, like all of us do when \nyou sort of get off and you were going too far or not far enough, would \nwhisper in your ear, would put his hand on you--I watched him put his \nhand on your shoulder. It was like he didn't have to say anything to \nyou. So all Members on this floor and all Members watched in wonder and \nwith a sense of envy the relationship the Senator had with Admiral \nNance, and we have an appreciation for how difficult a moment this is \nfor you.\n  We respect you for your ability to pull it off with the grace that \nyou have thus far.\n  Mr. President, I have only on a couple occasions in 27 years come to \nthe floor to pay a tribute to a staff member. We have had great, great, \ngreat, great staff members who have guided us all. I think the best \nkept secret from the American people is the incredible quality, \npatriotism, capacity, educational achievement, and personal commitment \nof the staffs that sit back in these chairs behind that rail. It is a \ntrite thing to say, but the Nation could not run without them.\n  I know of no staff member who was the peer to this fellow, Bud Nance. \nThe Senate family and the Nation--it sounds like hyperbole--suffered a \nloss when Admiral Nance passed away. Since 1971, Admiral Nance has been \nthe staff director of the Committee on Foreign Relations, serving first \nas the minority staff director, and then as the staff director for the \nminority under the chairman and senior Senator of North Carolina, Mr. \nJesse Helms.\n\n  Working in the Senate was something of a second career for Admiral \nNance. Prior to coming to the Senate, Admiral Nance spent 35 years in \nthe U.S. Navy. A pilot by training, Admiral Nance rose to hold several \nsenior command positions on aircraft carriers, including command, as \nmentioned earlier, of the U.S.S. Forrestal and senior commands in the \nPentagon. He retired in 1979 with the rank of rear admiral. I might \nnote, parenthetically, one of the great, great, great, great advantages \nof having Bud Nance, with the ideological divisions that exist in \nmatters relating to foreign policy, was that you always knew you would \nget down to the final question of how it worked.\n  I remember two Fridays ago talking to him and him saying--I hope no \none is offended by my saying this--the reason why we haven't in the \ncommittee taken the administration to task on some of the NATO \nquestions is I know how hard it is to get consensus in NATO. I sat \nthere. I was in charge of planning. I know how difficult it is.\n  He also knew how easy it would have been for the committee, under the \nchairmanship of the Senator from North Carolina, to demagog the living \ndevil out of the targeting questions and whether or not the French and \nthe Germans and the Brits--he said until you are there and have to get \n15 other nations to agree on something, you have no notion how \ndifficult it is.\n  To steal a phrase from the chairman, this is one little vignette that \nillustrates how, even though he had serious disagreement with the \npolicy of the President of the United States, he believed it wasn't \nfair play--my translation, not his; mine--to take advantage of \nsomething, that the people wouldn't understand how complicated it was, \nbut he understood that it was complicated. It was just simply not fair \ngame to take advantage of it, in addition to the fact he always thought \nof the people who were jumping in the cockpits of those planes. He \nalways thought of the people who were over there putting their lives on \nthe line.\n  That came from 35 years of experience. It wasn't merely because he \nwas a good, honorable and decent man which you will hear more about, \nbecause he was. You can ask any of my colleagues, and I suspect my \nDemocratic colleagues will say the same. All Bud Nance had to do with \nme is say that this is what we are going to do, and I can absolutely, \npositively trust it as certain, as certain as if my closest staff aide \nsaid that to me.\n  The magic of Bud Nance was he made each of us feel like he was our \nstaff, like he was looking out for our interest. I knew without any \nquestion that if he said something to me, even if there was a \nmiscommunication between the chairman and Bud Nance, the chairman would \nnever undercut Bud Nance, either that whatever Bud Nance said was going \nto happen.\n\n  You have no--yes, you do, Mr. President. I was going to say you have \nno idea. You do have an idea. Anyone who serves here has an idea what \nan incredible, incredible asset that is. If we were able to do that, if \nwe had that kind of faith in each other's staffs, this place would move \nso much more smoothly than it does because so much is necessarily \npropelled by staff.\n  During the 1980s, Admiral Nance served as deputy assistant to \nPresident Reagan for national security affairs, and in private business \nwith the Boeing Corporation. In 1991, his boyhood friend, Jesse Helms, \nas the chairman has indicated, who grew up in the small town of Monroe, \nNC, called Bud Nance to serve his country once again. Although at the \ntime he got the call he had long-since retired and he was 70 years \nold--a time when most people would choose to take it easy, spend time \nwith their wives, their children and their grandchildren--Bud Nance \nanswered the call of his friend, Jesse Helms, and he came to work for \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. He did so not out of a desire for \npower or money, to state the obvious. In fact, he received only a \nnominal salary, which at one point, as he enjoyed putting it, amounted \nto a few dollars per week. That is literally true, by the way--\nliterally true. Because of this law we have about double dipping, \nliterally he worked for pennies here--full time, 60 hours, 70 hours a \nweek. He worked literally for nothing.\n  Rather than the dollars, he enjoyed the work--because of his powerful \nsense of duty to his country and its people and his powerful and \npalpable loyalty to the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  In the last several months, as he struggled with illness--and I might \npoint out, for the last year anybody else would have quit. Anybody else \nwould have walked away and everyone would have said: God bless him. We \nunderstand.\n  Here is a guy whose hands were literally beat up because of the \ntransfusions, because of the IVs, because of all of the painful way \nthey had to go to get blood. They could not get it out of his veins \nanymore. They had to go into his hands and his feet. He came in black \nand blue--black and blue, barely able to walk. I would say: Bud, what \nin the heck are you doing here? He'd say: We have to get this done. No \nproblem.\n  I never, never, never heard him complain. I never watched him even \nwince knowingly. This is a guy who literally dragged himself in and out \nof the hospital to show up for work. Instead of staying at home, \ngetting the care he needed in the hospital, he kept the staff and all \nof us focused on the task at hand.\n  In my 2\\1/2\\ years as ranking member of the committee, I came to know \nBud even better than I did the previous years, both as a professional \ncolleague, and, I am presumptuous to say, and this is presumptuous--as \na friend.\n  I was kidding with the chairman the other day. I said: You know, \nJesse, my mom has an expression.\n  I will not mention the little girl's name, but I remember as a kid I \ngot picked up second on the bus on a long bus ride to school, about a \n35-minute ride. Every morning, a little girl who was not very popular \nand wasn't very attractive, every morning would get on the bus. It \nwould be empty and she would sit next to me. Then everyone else would \nfill up the bus by the end.\n  I would get home and I would say to my mother: Mom, every morning--I \nwill not mention her real name; it was not Sally--Sally gets on the bus \nand sits next to me. All the guys make fun of me. The girls even make \nfun of me--because Sally was not a particularly popular little girl.\n\n[[Page S5450]]\n\n  I will never forget what my mother said. My mother said: Joey, \nremember one thing. Anybody who loves you, there is only one thing you \ncan do. Love them back.\n  It is real simple. I was kidding the chairman the other day. I know \nBud Nance loved me because he knew how much I thought of him. He didn't \nhave a choice. He may not have wanted to, but it was in his nature. He \ncouldn't return the affection. So, although I do not have one one-\nhundredth of the history or the relationship that the chairman had with \nBud Nance and it seems presumptuous for me to call him a friend in the \nshadow of his closest friend in life, I want you to know, Mr. Chairman, \nthat a lot of us--and you will hear from more--a lot of us took great \npersonal pride in believing that Bud Nance liked us. The mere fact that \nBud Nance liked us in part validated what we did here. That is a \nremarkable thing, Mr. Chairman. That is a remarkable thing to say about \nany individual.\n  His word was his bond in a literal sense. Although he worked for a \ndarned Republican, Bud Nance was far from partisan. I always wanted to \nask him--and I never did, Jesse--about back in the days when you were a \nDemocrat, I suspect he was, too, back in those days. I kind of harbored \nthe illusion in my soul a little bit that maybe--maybe he still was. I \nknew he wasn't, but maybe he still was.\n  Mr. HELMS. No.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I always want to say Bud, Bud--they are all laughing, all \nthe Republican staffers. But I would get back in the subway car and I \nwould head over here and I would say: You know, maybe . . . maybe.\n  I want to tell you, he was well liked by every Senator, every staff \nperson. The guy who is the minority staff director, Ed Hall, who is \nsitting in the back, considered him a close friend. It was remarkable \nto watch their relationship, watch how they dealt with one another. I \nhaven't found anybody who was better liked, more respected, more fair, \nor more knowledgeable than Bud Nance--of all the people with whom I \nhave worked. Above all, Bud Nance was--and this is not said lightly; I \ndon't often use the word--Bud Nance was a genuine patriot.\n  At all times, he would focus on the central question. We would get \ninvolved and we would be arguing, we would be talking, and Bud Nance \nalways, always brought us back to the central question: Is this in the \ninterest of the country? Is this in the interest of the country? \nBecause, as we Senators know, we can get carried away. We believe in \nwhat we are doing, but we get invested in what we are doing. We get \ninvested in our position. Sometimes, although we don't consciously do \nit, in my opinion, we get so wrapped up in winning our point that it \ntakes somebody like Bud Nance to say--and I know he has said it to \nJesse; he has said it to me--whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hold \nup here.\n  He had that great ability, as the old saying goes, to see the forest \nfor the trees. We get lost in the forest. We start numbering the trees. \nHe could stand back. He would stand back and he would say, Look at the \nwhole picture.\n  As I said, I will end where I began. I have a sense of envy that you, \nSenator Helms, had the relationship you had. My dad's expression is: At \nthe end of your days, if you can count one person who you can call a \ntrue friend, you are a lucky man.\n  You are one of the luckiest men that I know, Senator. You have had a \nguy who everyone is honoring, honoring you.\n  Our profound sympathy and our prayers go out to his loving wife of 53 \nyears. I don't know Mary, but I know of her. I have heard her name \ninvoked a thousand times. To Bud's four children and his seven \ngrandchildren, to use my grandpop's expression, I say: You got good \nblood. You got good blood. I am telling you, remember where you came \nfrom. This guy--your grandfather, your father--was the real thing. The \nreal thing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will not even try to match the eloquence \nof my esteemed colleague from Delaware. But I would like to just say a \nfew words about my friend, Adm. Bud Nance, and my friend, Senator \nHelms, as well. I will not be long because I see other members of the \nForeign Relations Committee who are here to speak.\n  I didn't have the privilege of serving on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee at the same time with Bud Nance. But I knew him. I respected \nhim. On a Capitol Hill that is completely covered with more youthful \nstaffers, staffers who are very young in many ways, not quite as \nexperienced, Bud Nance stood out as one of the most senior. He did not \nhave to be here. He probably could have enjoyed the remaining years of \nhis life much more by not being here. But he came to serve side by side \nwith his friend from his youth, Senator Jesse Helms, one of the \ngreatest Senators who has ever sat in the Senate.\n  Admiral Nance was one of the greatest people who ever served on the \nSenate staff, and he did it at a time when we had a lot of conflicts \nand difficulties and problems in foreign relations, and he did it with \nintelligence, with a mastery that was important, with an ability to get \nalong with people and to work with both minority and majority staffs.\n  This man is a true hero to me and true hero for our country, just the \ntype of person we ought to all try to emulate, somebody who really \nloved his country enough to give his last for the country. I believe he \nloved his country so much because of his family and because of his \nunderstanding of what a great country this is and what a great \nconstitutional form of government we have.\n  This is a man who reached the heights in the military and, in my \nopinion, reached the heights in the Senate as well. When he came on the \nstaff, the staff was reported to be having difficulties, and he brought \nthem together, coordinated them, unified them, and I think both the \nminority and the majority staffs have worked well ever since. It took a \ntrue leader to do that.\n  It took a true leader in Senator Helms to pick Admiral Nance, and I \nknow he feels highly privileged to have worked with his friend, his \ncolleague, and somebody who advised him in the best of ways and advised \nall of us in the best of ways.\n  I express my sympathy to his wife and his family and tell them that \nthey should be very proud of him, not just for the tremendous years of \nserving this country, as he did in the military, as a husband and as a \nfather, but for these years on Capitol Hill. It made a difference to \nthe country, to the world at large, and to all of us. I thank Senator \nHelms for having given us the opportunity to know him better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last week the Senate lost one of its \nmost able and committed staffers; the country lost a brave public \nservant, a true patriot. Beyond that, with the passing of Adm. James W. \n``Bud'' Nance, many of us have lost a good friend.\n  I want to touch for just a moment on his Maryland connections. \nAdmiral Nance graduated from the Naval Academy in Annapolis in 1944, \nthen went off to serve in our Navy in World War II. He in fact served \nin World War II, in the Korean war, and in the Vietnam war.\n  In the mid-1950s, he was a project pilot for the flight test division \nof the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River, MD, in St. Mary's \nCounty, the mother county of our State. I simply say we were honored to \nhave had his presence in our State for an extended period on those two \noccasions.\n  Here in the Senate, an institution sometimes marked by acrimony and \ndivisiveness, Bud Nance displayed a warmth and generosity of spirit. He \nwas able to work constructively with those on both sides of the aisle \nto enhance our Nation's interests. That was always first and foremost \nin Bud's mind--what served the interest of our great country.\n  Each time I had occasion to work with him, Bud listened to my \nconcerns and responded promptly and fairly. Others had the same \nexperience. He fought hard for the principles in which he believed, but \nalways in a manner that commanded respect and admiration.\n  As the chairman of our committee has indicated, his lifetime friend \nmade an invaluable contribution to our Nation's policies.\n\n[[Page S5451]]\n\n  I was particularly moved by the way Admiral Nance dealt with his \nillness. Having had an illustrious 35-year career in the Navy, he knew \nhow to surmount the gravest challenges and how to maintain strong \nleadership throughout. He demonstrated that once again by showing up \nfor work every day with a smile and a vitality that masked whatever \npain and discomfort he may have felt. Every day he reported for duty. \nRather than complaining about his own situation, he showed a genuine \ninterest in the health and well-being of those around him, and the \nother staff members of the committee will recount his unfailing \ncourtesies towards each and every one of them.\n  I join my colleagues in offering my deepest condolences to Bud's wife \nof 53 years, Mary Lyda, and to his four children and seven \ngrandchildren. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate \nitself were fortunate to have had the benefit of his dedicated service \nover the past 8 years. He will be remembered fondly, not only for his \nlifetime of service to this country--civilian as well as military--but \nalso for his integrity, courage, and grace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am not sure I can adequately thank the \nSenators for their comments. They know I appreciate them. We are trying \nto go from one side to the other, and I ask the Chair to recognize the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to join our colleagues in the \nSenate to provide this record of our recollections of this great \nAmerican who, in service to the Senate and in partnership with the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, left his mark. I feel very \nhumble about it because I was fascinated in some research that I did on \nthe U.S.S. North Carolina, the battleship on which he served.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record reference to \nthe engagements in the closing days of World War II in which this \ndistinguished ship participated with Ens. Bud Nance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            History of the Battleship North Carolina--BB-55\n\n\n                               background\n\n       The current Battleship North Carolina (BB-55) is the third \n     U.S. Navy ship to bear the name. Her commissioned service \n     lasted a little over six years, and only eleven years lapsed \n     between the time the ship was authorized and she was \n     decommissioned. During that short time however, she had quite \n     a record, and is now preserved in her original World War II \n     colors as a memorial to all those who gave their lives for \n     freedom.\n\n\n                the first north carolina--1818-10/1/1867\n\n       The first North Carolina was a ship of the line, built in \n     Philadelphia Navy Yard. The keel was laid in 1818, and the \n     ship was launched in 1820. She was just over 193 feet in \n     length, with a 53-foot beam, and was rated at 2,633 tons. She \n     carried 74 guns--32 pounders and 42 pounders. She was active \n     until 1839, when she was converted to a receiving ship. She \n     was sold for scrap on October 1, 1867 for $30,000. The \n     original figurehead of the ship, a bust of Sir Walter Raleigh \n     was given to the state of North Carolina in 1909.\n\n\n             the confederate north carolina--1863-9/27/1864\n\n       During the Civil War the Confederate States Navy had an \n     iron-clad sloop named North Carolina. She was 150 feet long, \n     with a 32-foot beam, and carried four guns. She was built in \n     Wilmington, North Carolina, and because she was structurally \n     weak, never crossed the bar out of the Cape Fear River. The \n     ship was active from late 1863 until September 27, 1864 when \n     she developed leaks and sank.\n\n\n             the second north carolina--3/21/1906-9/29/1930\n\n       The second U.S. Navy ship to bear the name was an armored \n     cruiser, number 12, built by the Newport News Shipbuilding & \n     Dry-dock Company in Newport News, Virginia. The keel was laid \n     March 21, 1905, she was launched on October 5, 1906, and was \n     commissioned on May 7, 1908. She was 504 feet 6 inches in \n     length, with a 72 foot 11 inch beam. She displaced 14,500 \n     tons, and had a top speed of 22 knots.\n       On November 5, 1915 she was the first ship in the world to \n     launch an airplane with a catapult while underway.\n       On June 7, 1920, her name was changed to Charlotte to make \n     way for the new super battleship, number 52. As Charlotte she \n     was decommissioned on February 18, 1921. Her name was struck \n     from the Navy list on July 15, 1930, and she was sold for \n     scrap on September 29, 1930.\n\n\n                          battleship number 52\n\n       Laid down in 1919, battleship number 52 was to have been \n     called the North Carolina. This ship was to have been a \n     monster for that era, with a displacement of 43,200 tons, a \n     length of 624 feet, a beam of 105 feet, and a speed of 23 \n     knots. Mounting 12 16-inch guns, the North Carolina and her \n     five planned sister ships, had they been completed, would \n     have been the largest and most heavily armed capital ships of \n     the world at that time.\n       Three years after construction was begun, however, the \n     Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 imposed a ten year limit, and \n     new size restrictions on warships of the era. All work was \n     stopped, and the hull was sold for scrap.\n\n\n         the current north carolina: navy day 10/27/37-6/27/47\n\n       Authorized by an act of Congress on June 3, 1936, the keel \n     of BB-55 was laid down at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on Navy Day, \n     October 27, 1937. This was the first time the United States \n     had started construction of a battleship in 16 years. A few \n     new cruisers and destroyers had been built, but in general, \n     the fleet was old if not obsolete at the time.\n       Ships are not built in a day. As they say, when you need \n     ships it's too late to build them. Four years of design work, \n     and three years and eight months went into her construction.\n       While building the North Carolina, war broke out in Europe, \n     and only four days before her launch Hitler's divisions \n     occupied Paris. In the Far East, Japan had invaded China, and \n     was threatening further aggressive moves in Southeast Asia.\n       On June 13, 1940, Governor Clyde R. Hoey of North \n     Carolina's daughter, Isabel, to the strains of ``Anchors \n     Aweigh'', smashed the traditional bottle of champagne against \n     the bow and launched the ship. Then, on April 9, 1941, after \n     completing her fitting-out, Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox \n     commissioned the ship. After all work was done, the ship cost \n     the taxpayers $76,885,750. Today, the sum would be vastly \n     greater.\n       After commissioning, the North Carolina had an unusually \n     extensive shakedown, lasting several months. During this long \n     ``shakedown'' period, the North Carolina returned often to \n     her building yard for adjustments and modifications. During \n     this time, New Yorkers, and in particular radio commentator \n     Walter Winchell often witnessed the great new ``battlewagon'' \n     entering and departing the harbor, and began to call her \n     ``The Showboat'', after the colorful river steamer in a \n     popular Broadway musical. The name has stuck ever since.\n\n\n  asiatic-pacific campaigns--war record post-service, 9/1945-6/27/1947\n\n       On September 5, 1945 the North Carolina finally anchored in \n     Tokyo Bay to pick up a group of about 100 men who had been \n     transferred from her August 20th, to help with the initial \n     occupation at the Yokosuka Naval Base, near Tokyo.\n       On September 6, the ship headed for home via Okinawa (to \n     take on passengers), Hawaii and the Panama Canal. On October \n     17, the ship arrived in Boston harbor for a hero's welcome.\n       Due to post-war disarmament, the battleship's remaining \n     active service was short. In the summer of 1946 she twice \n     visited the Naval Academy at Annapolis to embark midshipmen \n     for training cruises in the Caribbean. In October of that \n     year she returned to the place of her birth, the New York \n     Navy Yard for inactivation. She was decommissioned June 27, \n     1947, and placed in the ``mothballed'' Reserve Fleet at \n     Bayonne, New Jersey, where she remained in obscurity for the \n     next 14 years.\n       In 1960 the Navy announced its intention to scrap the \n     famous battleship, and two famous natives of North Carolina, \n     Hugh Morton and James S. Craig, Jr., with the endorsement of \n     then Governor Luther Hodges began a campaign to bring the \n     ship to North Carolina and preserve her as a war memorial.\n       Thousands of citizens, and countless school children \n     contributed money. $330,000 was raised to acquire the ship \n     from the Navy and prepare a suitable berth. In September 1961 \n     she was towed from New Jersey, and on October 2 she was \n     moored in her present berth across the river from downtown \n     Wilmington. On April 29, 1962 she was dedicated as a memorial \n     to all the North Carolina men and women who served in the \n     war, and in particular, to the more than 10,000 North \n     Carolinians who gave their lives in the war.\n\n       Asiatic-Pacific Campaigns of the Battleship North Carolina\n\n       Prelude to Combat--December 1941-July 1942.\n       Landings on Guadalcanal and Tulagi--7-9 August 1942.\n       Capture and Defense of Guadalcanal--16 August 1942-8 \n     February 1943.\n       Battle of the Eastern Solomons--23-24 August 1943.\n       I-19 Submarine Attack: USS WASP--Carrier--SUNK, USS \n     O'BRIEN--Destroyer--SUNK, USS NORTH CAROLINA--Battleship--\n     Damaged--15 September 1942.\n       New Georgia Group Operations: New Guinea, Rendova, Vangunu \n     Invasion--30 June-31 August 1943.\n       Gilbert Islands Operations: Tarawa, Mrakin--19 November-8 \n     December 1943.\n       Bismark Achipelago Operations: Kavieng Strike--25 December \n     1943.\n       Marshall island Operation: Invasion of Kwajalein Atoll, \n     Invasion of Majuro Atoll--29 January 1944-8 February 1944.\n       Task Force Strikes: Truk--16-17 February 1944, Marianas--\n     21-22 February 1944, Palau, Yap, Ulithi, Woleai--30 March-1 \n     April 1944, Turk, Satawan, Ponape--29 April-1 May 1944.\n\n[[Page S5452]]\n\n       Western New Guinea Operations: Hollandia--21-24 April 1944.\n       Marianas Operations: Invasion of Saipan--11-24 June 1944, \n     Battle of the Philippine Sea--19-20 June 1944.\n       Leyte Operation: Attacks on Luzon--13, 14, 19-25 November \n     1944, 14, 15 December 1944.\n       Luzon Operation: Attacks on Luzon--6, 7 January 1944, \n     Formosa--3, 4, 9, 15, 21 January 1945, China Coast--12, 16 \n     January 1945, Nansei Shoto--22 January 1945.\n       Iwo Jima Operations: Invasion of Iwo Jima--15 February-1 \n     March 1945, 15, 16 February 1945, 5th & 3rd Fleet raids on \n     Honshu & Nansei Shoto--25 February-March 1945.\n       Okinawa Invasion--17 March-27 April 1945.\n       3rd Fleet Operations: Bombardment and Airstrikes on the \n     Japanese Home Islands--10 July-15 August 1945.\n\n\n                Invasion of Okinawa (April 1945)--BB-55\n\n       Coincident with the air offensive of Task Force 58 against \n     Mainland Japan, other American forces were closing in for the \n     invasion of Okinawa, where the initial landings occurred on 1 \n     April. Three Marine Divisions (1st, 2nd, and 6th), plus four \n     Army Divisions (7th, 96th, 77th, and 27th) were employed in \n     this operation, the last of the major island assaults of the \n     Pacific war. Okinawa was needed because it was best located \n     to support the planned invasion of the Home Islands of Japan, \n     and because it offered airfields and anchorages required for \n     that purpose. Task Force 58 covered the operation, providing \n     air support and fighter defense.\n       The NORTH CAROLINA, in company with other fast battleships, \n     conducted a pre-invasion bombardment of Okinawa from very \n     long ranges on 24 March; and fired again, in support of a \n     feint landing on 17 April.\n       On 6 April, in the heat of air attack with all ships \n     firing, the Showboat was accidentally hit by a 5-inch AA \n     Common projectile fired at a low-flying kamikaze by a \n     friendly ship. The projectile struck the supporting trunk of \n     the secondary battery director (Sky 2), killing three men, \n     wounding 44, and disabling the director. During a lull in the \n     fighting, the dead were buried at sea with members of the \n     crew sadly bidding their shipmates a last farewell in the \n     traditional solemn rites.\n       Just before taps that night, the voice of the Chaplain came \n     over the ship's public address system with the following \n     prayer: ``Heavenly Father, today we committed to the deep \n     three of our shipmates who gave their lives so that others \n     may live. We are particularly mindful at this time of their \n     loved ones at home. Sustain them in their sorrow. Help them \n     to understand that those they love gave their lives for their \n     protection and care. Be with all the officers and men of this \n     ship. Give all of us heart and mind to serve thee and our \n     country willingly and faithfully. . . .''\n       The NORTH CAROLINA, with Task Force 58, was in the thick of \n     the fighting around Okinawa for a total of 40 days before \n     being ordered to withdraw for repairs to her battle damage. \n     During this 40-day period, hundreds of kamikaze attacks were \n     launched against naval units operating in the vicinity of \n     Okinawa, and a total of 73 ships were crashed by them. Of \n     these, 20 were sunk or so badly damaged they had to be \n     scuttled, and 22 were damaged to the extent that repairs \n     would not be completed before the war was over. However, for \n     every Kamikaze pilot who succeeded in crashing one of our \n     ships, there were scores shot down by our fighters and ship's \n     gunners.\n\n\n                      Reflections on the Kamikazes\n\n       A Kamikaze attack, as witnessed by a potential victim, can \n     be ranked among the most frightening experiences in the \n     history of modern warfare. As a rule, such attacks were \n     pressed home with fanatical determination, despite the most \n     intense antiaircraft fire. Virtually all Kamikaze attacks \n     ended in flaming violence and death, if only for the pilot \n     crashing into the sea amid a torrent of bursting shells and \n     tracers, some of which were often wildly and dangerously \n     erratic. Carriers were always the primary targets, but no \n     ships were immune. Once a kamikaze was damaged, he usually \n     selected whatever ship was nearest ahead as his target. The \n     specter of sudden holocaust created on board a ship by a \n     combination of the exploding bombs and gasoline carried by a \n     suicide plane instilled fear in the staunchest heart.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. In that period of time I was but a mere radioman third \nclass. Aboard a battleship, about the only thing lower than a radioman \nthird class is a bull ensign out of Annapolis. If the Admiral were \nhere, he would recall those days. Ensigns on battleships were almost \ndown in the bilge area. Nevertheless, he was privileged to serve with \nthat distinguished ship in a series of engagements.\n  I have also found a record of his second Distinguished Service Medal. \nIt is interesting. I am searching for the first because it is likely \nthat was in my period of tenure when a radioman third class had become \nSecretary of the Navy, because this one covers the period of June 1975 \nthrough December of 1978.\n  I want to read these remarks, signed by the then Secretary of the \nNavy:\n\n       For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of \n     the United States--\n\n  Rear Adm. James W. Nance, U.S. Navy--\n\n     while serving as the Assistant Vice Chief of Naval \n     Operations/Director of Naval Administration from June 1975 \n     through December 1978.\n       In directing the efforts of the vast human and physical \n     resources of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Rear Admiral Nance displayed the highest order of leadership, \n     superb managerial acumen, and unexcelled initiative.\n\n  The same qualities, Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the \ncommittee, that he exhibited on the Foreign Relations Committee. Isn't \nit interesting, these many years prior thereto, he was recognized for \nthose qualities?\n\n       His keen foresight and perception coupled with an extensive \n     knowledge of Navy organization were significantly \n     instrumental in successfully guiding the reorganization of \n     several major realignment programs.\n\n  Did he not do some reorganization for you, Mr. Chairman?\n\n       Utilizing dynamic leadership, keen administrative ability, \n     and steadfast perseverance, Rear Admiral Nance managed the \n     Navy's massive organizational network in a noteworthy manner, \n     thereby enhancing the shore establishment's support to the \n     fleet. Additionally, he personally initiated and implemented \n     important improvements in both procedural and institutional \n     aspects of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and, \n     by personal attention, example, and vigorous advocacy, he \n     provided positive leadership in the area of Equal Employment \n     Opportunity.\n       Rear Admiral Nance's distinctive accomplishments, \n     unparalleled effectiveness, managerial expertise, and \n     tenacious devotion to duty reflected great credit upon \n     himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of \n     the United States Naval Service.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the very \ndetailed briefing that goes behind this, the Navy's highest noncombat \naward, for which he received two. I hope to complete my research about \nthe first.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Summary of Action\n\n       Rear Admiral James W. Nance distinguished himself by \n     exceptionally meritorious service to the United States in a \n     position of great responsibility as Assistant Vice Chief of \n     Naval Operations/Director of Naval Administration (AVCNO/DNA) \n     from June 1975 thru December 1978. As the principal advisor \n     and executive to the Vice Chief of Naval Operations (VCNO) \n     and the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) for all \n     organizational matters embracing the Office of the Chief of \n     Naval Operations (OPNAV), and for all organizational echelons \n     under the command of the CNO, he has demonstrated the highest \n     degree of astute planning, detailed knowledge, exceptional \n     managerial skill, and the ability to identify requirements \n     that would compete for support in an increasingly austere \n     fiscal and personnel resource environment. In this broad area \n     encompassing more than 1250 shore activities, plus all the \n     operating forces of the U.S. Navy, Rear Admiral Nance \n     initiated and implemented many innovative improvements which \n     significantly enhanced the Navy's capability and ability to \n     support CNO in carrying out his mission. Astutely aware of \n     the operational and material expenditures for the operation \n     of the navy and the complex requirements of Mission and \n     Program Sponsors in the OPNAV organization, Rear Admiral \n     Nance was able to relate organizational changes to ongoing \n     efforts, and to estimate potential costs and effectiveness \n     with respect to the total navy effort and management decision \n     at hand. He arbitrated among the various OPNAV sponsors and \n     technical managers in order to develop a convincing and \n     balanced program for the VCNO and CNO. As the focal point for \n     all organizational matters Rear Admiral Nance demonstrated \n     the highest degree of patience, objectivity, sound judgment, \n     integrity and skill in both persuasion and application. These \n     traits, coupled with a superior management ability, enabled \n     him to overcome problems and maintain the proper perspective \n     during frustrating times. All of these qualities Rear Admiral \n     Nance has in abundance, and they have been demonstrated time \n     and again during his tenure as AVCNO/DNA.\n       Rear Admiral Nance initiated and implemented vital \n     improvements in both the policy and procedural aspects \n     regarding proposals for the establishment, disestablishment, \n     and modification of shore activities and of fleet activities \n     of the Operating Forces. Rear Admiral Nance has displayed a \n     flair for discovering organizational inconsistencies. In each \n     instance he instinctively recommends the best solution. In \n     these recommendations he exhibits a uniqueness in looking at \n     each proposal from the whole Department of the Navy \n     standpoint and not a more restrictive and narrow aspect of \n     program sponsors. His efforts in maintaining strict \n     compliance to the Secretary of Defense (SECDEF), Secretary of \n     the Navy (SECNAV), and the direction and decisions regarding \n     the reduction of operational expenditures and for providing \n     better utilization of limited manpower resources, while still \n     maintaining the highest degree of effectiveness and \n     efficiency, have contributed significantly to the United \n     States Navy.\n       Directly responsible for the management of an annual budget \n     of approximately 400\n\n[[Page S5453]]\n\n     million dollars, over 16,000 military and civilian personnel, \n     and approximately 200 commands within the CNO claimancy, Rear \n     Admiral Nance has demonstrated unique abilities in management \n     of these resources. Constantly aware of the worldwide \n     inflation and its adverse effects on the CNO claimancy and \n     the national priorities, Rear Admiral Nance fostered and \n     encouraged strong leadership, professional skills, and force \n     in fiscal and personnel management. Whether involving the \n     more than 125 activities for which the CNO provides direct \n     Operation and Maintenance Navy (O) appropriation financial \n     support or the more than 90 activities for which the CNO is \n     the civilian manpower claimant, Rear Admiral Nance \n     consistently and aggressively sought improvements in all \n     areas. Included in activities supported in the CNO claimancy \n     are such diversified commands as CINCPAC, CINCLANT, SEATO \n     Military Headquarters, MAAG China, all the Navy Sections in \n     the MAACs in South America and Europe, USN Member SHAPE \n     Headquarters, Naval Observatory, all the District \n     Commandants, COMUSJAPAN, Commander Iceland Defense Force, \n     most of the major Naval Support Activities in CONUS, all \n     Legal Service Offices worldwide, NAP Washington, COMOPTEVFOR, \n     Board of Inspection and Survey, the Vice President's quarters \n     and Presidential helicopters, just to name a few.\n       Rear Admiral Nance set realistic standards for the \n     management and administrative performance of these field \n     commands and activities in such areas as management policies, \n     procedures and controls, organizational structure, position \n     structure, staffing and delegation, management systems and \n     related management practices. In these areas, and while \n     servicing as resource and executive manager for the CNO, he \n     made significant contributions. Since the aforementioned \n     activities under the CNO claimancy are unique in that they \n     have no Systems Command or Bureau sponsorship and are \n     administered centrally under the CNO, they prove to be a \n     major undertaking. Management of these activities is further \n     complicated by the diverse programs represented in their \n     missions. Through Admiral Nance's direction and leadership, \n     the quality and level of services has been enhanced, and \n     services in such areas as property maintenance, personnel \n     services, and services to tenant commands have been greatly \n     improved even though funds and personnel have been reduced \n     over the years. As an example of the concern for real \n     property facilities, during Fiscal Years 1976 through 1978 \n     the CNO claimancy allocated resources for the maintenance and \n     repair of real property in a proportion to its backlog of \n     maintenance and repair that exceeded by over 50% the same \n     ration for the entire Navy shore establishment supported by \n     the O appropriation.\n       Rear Admiral Nance assumed his duties at a time when a \n     major reduction in force had been directed. Confronted with \n     this directed reduction of 12% in manning in OPNAV he \n     approached the task with a unique freshness which rallied the \n     support of all concerned. Apportioning these reductions to \n     the varied offices within the OPNAV would be no small task. \n     He personally conferred with each of the Deputy Chiefs of \n     Naval Operations (DCNOs) and the Directors of Major Staff \n     Offices (DMSOs) reviewing their mission and staffing. Gaining \n     immeasurable information and knowledge of each of these \n     complex organizations provided him with much of the data he \n     required preliminary to directing reductions. The knowledge \n     gained during this tremendous and time consuming effort and \n     his years of experience enabled him to determine those areas \n     where critical manning deficiencies were already developing \n     as a result of the many reductions already applied to OPNAV \n     and those areas where a reduction could be imposed. The \n     application of his knowledge made it possible to develop a \n     presentation which obtained the SECNAV's support for an \n     effort to stem the shrinking of the OPNAV staff and permit \n     the staff to meet its responsibilities. The required \n     reduction was effected with minimal disruption and was \n     superbly balanced among military and civilian positions. In \n     subsequent years additional personnel reduction actions were \n     directed. Rear Admiral Nance, after reviewing the OPNAV \n     staff, its requirements and the requirements of the SECDEP, \n     established an OPNAV Support Activity. This component \n     organization satisfied SECDEP's requirements for the \n     reduction of Navy Department Headquarters since those \n     personnel not involved in Navy-wide policy making were \n     assigned thereto. This fresh approach developed by Rear \n     Admiral Nance prevented the crippling of the OPNAV staff's \n     capability to perform its mission.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. But the interesting thing is the direct parallels \nbetween, Mr. Chairman, what he performed in the Navy in 1974 and what \nhe performed in the Senate in 1994. When I spoke of him as ensign, I \nheard on the floor of the Senate a little chuckle from a former ensign \nwho is over there now preparing to address the Senate. I am sure he \nmight expand a little bit on the relationship between an ensign and the \nhigher officers. I see him busily going over his notes over there.\n  But I say to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, we should \nconclude these remarks by saying: An officer and a gentleman--a phrase \nknown in the U.S. Navy. My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts \nearned that title, as did Admiral Nance.\n  I thank the Chair and thank my distinguished colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Distinguished Service Medal citation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                    The Secretary of the Navy,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n       The President of the United States takes pleasure in \n     presenting the Distinguished Service Medal to Rear Admiral \n     James W. Nance, United States Navy for service as set forth \n     in the following citation: For exceptionally meritorious \n     service to the Government of the United States in duties of \n     great responsibility from January 1970 to January 1972, while \n     serving with the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as \n     Deputy Director for Operations, National Military Command \n     Center, Operations Directorate, and as Chief of the Studies, \n     Analysis, and Gaming Agency.\n       As Deputy Director for Operations, Rear Admiral Nance was \n     responsible for monitoring the worldwide political/military \n     situation on an around-the-clock basis, acting as personal \n     representative for the Secretary of Defense; the Chairman, \n     Joint Chiefs of Staff; the Director, Joint Staff; and the \n     Director for Operations. He was particularly adept in \n     handling the many events, incidents, and sensitive operations \n     of national interest involving the highest governmental \n     authorities.\n       In his capacity as Chief of the Studies, Analysis, and \n     Gaming Agency, Rear Admiral Nance masterfully directed \n     studies and simulations prepared to analyze strategic and \n     general purpose force capabilities relevant to national \n     security decision-making at the highest level.\n       By his outstanding leadership, superior judgment, and \n     inspiring devotion to duty, Rear Admiral Nance reflected \n     great credit upon himself and the Organization of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, and upheld the highest traditions of the \n     United States Naval Service.\n\n                                            For the President,\n\n                                                   John H. Chafee,\n                                            Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing our \ncondolences to the Nance family. As Senator Helms has pointed out, \nthere are a number of them gathered today in the Senate gallery to hear \nthese tributes.\n  I cannot help but think what Bud Nance would think about a lot of \nthis language out here. I imagine that I would see a twinkling in his \neye. He might think we are getting excessive--to describe it politely. \nI do not think you can get excessive when talking about someone of the \nhuman quality that Bud Nance possessed.\n  The reason you are seeing this bipartisan demonstration here today is \nbecause I never knew what Bud Nance's politics were. I had my \nsuspicions because he was working with the chairman of the committee, \nbut I never detected an ounce of partisanship in any approach he ever \nmade to a Member of this body or members of the staff on either side of \nthe aisle.\n  It is a great tribute to his human qualities that he saw issues as \nthey were--either right or wrong--or ways in which to get a job done to \nmove a bill forward. Throughout that process, which too often brings \nout acrimony in people, Bud Nance seemed to attract the better angels \nin all of us. And it is that wonderful quality that he possessed that I \nadmired so much. I came to really respect and enjoy this man's \nwonderful company over too brief a period of time.\n  We lost a great friend and a wonderful member of the Senate family a \nfew days ago. Many of us knew Bud Nance simply as ``the admiral.'' He \nwas 77 years young. That is not a polite expression. Up until his last \nillness, he had great vitality. And I admired him. Less than a week \nbefore he passed away, I saw him here in the staff gallery. I went over \nand talked to him. I admired his tenacity. In spite of all that he was \ngoing through at the hospital, transfusions and all the rest, he \nremained determined to be here and determined to be involved.\n  It is a great lesson for all of us that we should live life to the \nfullest. He certainly did. The loyalty that many members of the Senate \nand the staff, many of whom are here today, felt toward Bud Nance \nshould be noted as well.\n  Both sides of the aisle respected Bud Nance enormously. We were \nextremely\n\n[[Page S5454]]\n\nfond of him personally. All of us who had the honor of knowing him are \ndeeply saddened to hear of his passing. I express my condolences to his \nwife and children and grandchildren as well.\n  As has been noted, he was the staff director of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. He took over the stewardship of the committee in \n1991. He was summoned out of retirement, as has been noted over and \nover again here by the chairman of the committee. It is not the first \ntime that the admiral had worked for the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Back in 1979 and 1980, he had served as a special consultant to the \nminority staff on the SALT II deliberations. Over the years, many \nSenators consulted with him on matters related to strategic arms \ntreaties. He was truly an expert in this area. When his wonderful \nfriend, his lifelong friend, and our friend, Jesse Helms, called him up \nin 1991, seeking his help in reorganizing the committee, the admiral \ndid what he had always done--he showed up ready for duty. He had \nretired to Virginia sometime before, but he could not say no. He \naccepted the challenge; and we are all the better because of it. In \nfact, he was excited to take on another challenge.\n  Some of you may know that the admiral had initially refused to take \nany salary. This is something of which not many Americans are aware. \nBut there are people around here who do work because they believe in \nthe work they are doing. Admiral Nance was one of those individuals. He \ninsisted he should not be paid lest someone think there was an \nappearance of impropriety. Of course that never crossed anyone's mind. \nThe words ``impropriety'' and ``Bud Nance'' just would not fit in the \nsame sentence, page, or book. He was a person of impeccable integrity.\n\n  Eventually, the two friends had to compromise, as I am told, on \nminimal, symbolic compensation in order to comply with Federal laws. \nBud Nance would also not want to be in violation of Federal laws. So \nthere was a symbolic compensation that became Bud's salary.\n  At any rate, Senator Helms and the admiral belonged to a mutual \nadmiration society. All of us became associate members of this \nwonderful friendship that these two individuals shared. Bud Nance had \nan excellent relationship with the chairman, as all of us know, based \non their deep loyalty to one another, deep appreciation of each other's \ntalents, abilities and sense of character, and deep friendship that \ngoes back to childhood.\n  We make friends in our lives through the various phases of our \ntravels in this world, but there is no friendship that is more enduring \nor more deeply appreciated than one that begins in childhood and \ncarries on through life. That does not happen often, but when it does \nit is a unique relationship.\n  The fact that Bud Nance and my great friend, Jesse Helms, had this \nfriendship at the young age of 4 or 5 years of age that lasted to Bud's \npassing says wonderful things about both of these individuals that they \nsustained that friendship over these many, many years.\n  For me personally, I say to the chairman, every day it was a pleasure \nto work with Admiral Nance. He was candid. He was straightforward. He \nalways tried to do what he believed was in the best interest of our \ncountry. He was truly a patriot. That word too often is used to \ndescribe too many people, but in this case it happily applies to Bud \nNance.\n  He was 77 years old and a veteran of several distinguished careers. \nAnd he was tapped by Senator Helms to take over the helm of the \ncommittee. Of course, he had a wonderful and distinguished career in \nthe Navy, as was noted by the Senator, and others. He grew up in North \nCarolina, attended North Carolina State, enrolled in the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, U.S. Naval War College, and specialized in world governments \nand strategic planning. He earned a master's degree at George \nWashington University. He had many wonderful accomplishments. But the \nmost important quality of all was he was just a wonderful human being, \nand all of our lives are enriched because he was a part of our lives. \nWe are going to miss him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his \nvery kind and heartfelt comments. I know Senator Helms appreciates it \nvery much also.\n  In case it hasn't been announced, I want all Senators to be aware \nthat Admiral Nance's graveside services will be at Arlington National \nCemetery at 11 a.m. on Wednesday, tomorrow. For any Senators who would \nlike to be there and participate, I am sure it will be a beautiful and \nappropriate ceremony.\n  I served 4 years as a staff member on the House side, working for the \nchairman of the Rules Committee. Now I have served 26 years in the \nHouse and the Senate. I have a very enduring appreciation for the \nimportance and the loyalty, the dedication and the fine service that we \nreceive from our staffs, both in this Chamber, in our committee work, \nand on our personal staffs.\n  Admiral Nance was one of those unique staff members, though, who had \na very close personal relationship, beyond a normal staff relationship, \nwith the chairman of the committee, but also with a lot of Senators. \nWhen I first came to the Senate, I found myself more than once back in \nthe back room seeking the advice and counsel of Admiral Nance, and he \nalways took the time to try to explain the situation and try to make \nclear what was in the country's best national interests. And so I feel \na personal sense of loss.\n  When you go through life and then you sort of get to the end of your \nroad and you look back, I think there are really at least three things \nyou hope for: a good name, good friends, and, hopefully, a little good \nfortune. But very important on that list is good friends.\n  I have had the privilege of having some great friends, going back to \nmy childhood days at Duck Hill, MS, people I still stay in touch with \nfrom high school and college years. We still get together. In less than \n2 weeks, we are all going to be together at the marriage of my \ndaughter. My friends from high school and college will be there. I know \nthat when you are in the greatest need of comforting, the greatest need \nof counsel, there are few friends that you turn to.\n  So we have had this unique relationship with Rear Admiral James W. \n``Bud'' Nance and our beloved chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, the senior Senator from North California. He was born in \nMonroe, NC--most folks probably have never heard of it, or certainly \nhave never been there--a small town, one block from the home of Jesse \nHelms. I wonder how many blocks there are in Monroe--probably not many. \nBut this son of the South from North Carolina went to the Naval \nAcademy, a 1944 graduate. He was a gunnery officer on the U.S.S. North \nCarolina at Iwo Jima. He was a combat pilot in Korea and Vietnam. He \nwas a test pilot. He was commander of the U.S.S. Raleigh, a cruiser, \nand commander of the U.S.S. Forrestal, one of our great carriers in \nhistory.\n  I had the pleasure one time of landing on the deck of that carrier. \nIt was a tremendous experience. My attitude ever since has been: I have \ndone that. I don't want to do it anymore.\n  To be commander of that great vessel is the height of success in many \npeople's lives. But he went beyond that. He went on to be Deputy \nNational Security Adviser in the Reagan administration. And then, of \ncourse, for the last 6 years, he was staff director of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  His wife, Mary Lyda, and their two sons--I know Phil--are grateful to \nhave had this man as husband and father. We all have been enriched and \nare better off because of his service to our country and to this \ninstitution and to his friend.\n\n  Bud Nance, sailor, public servant, patriot. God rest his soul.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, with sadness but with great pride, I join my \ncolleagues today to mark the passing of a remarkably patriotic and--I \nthink everyone would agree--extraordinarily committed public servant.\n  Rear Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance devoted his entire life to serving \nhis country, to public service. That was made up, as we have heard, of \na remarkable 35 years in the U.S. Navy, 2 years as Deputy Assistant for \nNational\n\n[[Page S5455]]\n\nSecurity Affairs under President Reagan, and then, as we heard our \ncolleagues recount today, great years of service here in the Senate, \nyears where all of us know he didn't have to serve. He could have \nchosen any number of other courses for his life, but right up until the \nend, he stood watch.\n  He earned, as we have heard, two Distinguished Service Medals in all \nof the campaigns that were listed by my colleagues. One of the things \nfor which I personally--and I am sure Senator McCain will join me--\nexpress the greatest respect was his service as skipper, commander of \nthe U.S.S. Forrestal, which our colleague, Senator McCain, has very \nclose ties to. I served one of my tours of duty in Vietnam at the Gulf \nof Tonkin, as we did a lot of search and rescue work with pilots and \noccasionally were doing guard duty right behind the carrier, so I \nbecame intimately familiar with carrier operations.\n  I think anybody who has ever been on a carrier, those 5,000-person \nfloating cities, understands the extraordinary leadership skills that \nare necessary to keep everybody in those close quarters working at the \npace they work under--the intense, stressful combat situation in which \nthey work. It is a remarkable tribute to this man that he rose to that \nlevel and, indeed, performed those responsibilities with such \ndistinction.\n  I first met him, obviously, when he came here, in 1991, and he became \nthe Republican staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Believe me, it became evident very quickly how fast he was \ngoing to be sort of the glue that helped to bring people together and \nkeep them together. Everybody here will remember the great smile, the \nconstant twinkle in his eye, and the wonderful kind of calm that he had \nabout him. Literally, I think 5 days or 6 days before he passed away, \nclearly without any inkling on our part that that might happen so \nsuddenly, we were down in Senate Foreign Relations room 116 dealing \nwith a number of issues. I went over to sit beside him and seek his \ncounsel on something. As was his manner, he sort of patted me on the \nknee in a calm way and said: I think we can take care of that; we can \ntake care of that.\n  That is the way he worked. He enjoyed the give and take. He loved the \nresponsibility. He loved the Senate. And most of all, he clearly loved \nhis country which he served so diligently.\n  Not only did he have the confidence and friendship--a very, very \nspecial friendship--with Senator Helms, but he also approached the job \nwith pure professionalism, with fierce determination, and great skill. \nSurely he was always committed to advancing the values and belief \nsystem--such a strong value system and belief system--of Senator Helms. \nTheir priorities were the same. But he also was every bit as committed \nto working out even the most contentious issues on a bipartisan basis.\n  I consider myself privileged to have worked very closely with Admiral \nNance when Senator Helms was a member of the Senate POW-MIA committee, \nwhich I then chaired. I will always be grateful to him for his very \nsteady support during that difficult and highly emotional time. He \nunderstood the importance of dealing with that issue head-on, \nregardless of partisanship or political consideration, and understood \nas well as anybody, because of his years of service, the need to begin \nto heal the wounds of war that still divided this country.\n\n  His participation with Senator Helms and the work of that committee \nwas a great service to this country. The admiral and I also worked \nclosely together during the 6 years that I was privileged to have the \nresponsibility as chairman, and then ranking member, of the \nInternational Operations Subcommittee for the State Department \nauthorization bill. I know that Bud Nance believed it was more than \njust another bill. To him, it was a reflection of our priorities in a \nglobal strategic sense, which he understood so well. So it wasn't just \na substantive issue to him; it was also an institutional issue, and he \ncared about that. He cared about the Senate prerogatives, he cared \nabout the committee priorities and prerogatives, and he shared that \nconcern with all of us.\n  Although we found much to agree on, we obviously sometimes disagreed. \nBut, boy, I can tell you it was never with anything except the deepest \nsense of respect and understanding for the substance of another \nperson's position. Even throughout those disagreements, I always knew I \ncould talk to Bud Nance and he was going to give me a fair hearing, \nand, working with Senator Helms, he was going to do his best to resolve \nthose differences.\n  We all know the degree to which Bud Nance was a devoted public \nservant. But of greater meaning and of greater consequence to him, \nsurely, Bud Nance was a devoted husband and father. We have heard \nothers talk of the wonderful marriage that he had to Mary Lyda for 53 \nyears. Together they had four children. I simply want to take this \nopportunity to extend my condolences to them and to their families for \ntheir loss.\n  It is also very hard to think about Bud Nance without obviously \nthinking about the special relationship he had with his closest friend \nand our colleague, Senator Helms. I will always fondly remember the \nmany stories that Senator Helms shared with us in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and here on the floor about two young tykes growing up within \nstreets of each other and spending literally their lives together, even \nwhen they weren't together. No one could ever doubt the strength of the \nbond between them or the personal loyalty they felt toward one another \nover so many years. This was really a rare friendship. That it has a \nmarvelous endurance is a tribute to both Bud Nance and Jesse Helms, not \njust as public servants or as partners in a public endeavor, but as \nprivate people, as human beings.\n  Modern politics is not kind to personal lives, to private lives. It \nis sometimes easy to lose sight of the importance of those friendships \nin this city, and that is why I think it is so important, in part, to \nrecognize the full measure of the friendship they shared.\n  I don't remember all of the words, but there is a wonderful poem by \nWilliam Butler Yates that speaks about the glory man shares here on \nEarth, but in the end he calls on us to hope that every individual \nwould say: And so my glory was I had such friends. Really, that is \nglory in itself, that he had a friend like Bud Nance.\n  Mr. President, this is a city marked by transients. People come and \npeople go. But Adm. Bud Nance was forever proud that his service here \nwas, in many ways, neither ephemeral or transient. It was a tireless \nservice to the country, the Senate, stellar leadership in the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, and lifelong devotion to country. It \ndefines patriotism. He will be greatly missed, but he will also be \nremembered very fondly by all of us who knew him and remembered him as \na good man who made no secret of his love of family, love of friends, \nand love of country. He epitomized the best of what can come from our \nNation's capital and from the country itself, as well as the best of \nwhat our foreign policy can be. We will miss him today, but so much \nmore so, we honor his legacy and his memory.\n\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I am touched by all of \nthese remarks. I hope the Chair will recognize Senator McCain next. But \nbefore he does, I want to make a point that Bud Nance said many times \nhow much he admired Senator McCain's father. With that, I hope the \nChair will recognize Senator McCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from North Carolina \nfor the love and friendship he bestowed on Bud Nance for many, many \nyears. It is a rare thing--the relationship that existed between my \ndear friend from North Carolina and Adm. Bud Nance. It was a \nrelationship characterized by mutual respect, political courage, and \nlove and affection, which is, as the previous speaker mentioned, \nsomewhat rare in this town--although not as rare as some would think.\n  Bud Nance was not only a friend of my father's, he also served under \nmy grandfather in World War II. Mr. President, there is a book that has \nbeen No. 1 on the best seller list for a long time. The title of that \nbook is ``The Greatest Generation,'' written by Tom Brokaw, a man known \nto all of us. It is one of the more moving books I have read in\n\n[[Page S5456]]\n\na long time. It chronicles the personal experiences of those of the \ngeneration that fought and won World War II and, indeed, did make the \nworld safe for democracy. It contains very moving stories. The impact \nof those stories gives us a renewed and indeed, perhaps, an \nunappreciated recognition of the service and sacrifice of that \ngeneration, what they went through, what they achieved, and the reality \nthat they really did make not only the world safe for democracy, but \nmake it possible for future generations to live much better lives in a \nbroad variety of ways.\n  Bud Nance was of the greatest generation and he was one of the \ngreatest Americans to serve in the greatest generation. In fact, his \nservice spanned three wars, and in all of them he served with \ndistinction and courage.\n  I believe that Bud Nance epitomized in the Senate all the best we see \nin people who serve the Nation. Unfailingly courteous, always \nconsiderate to others, he took into consideration with equal weight and \ngravity the views of those on the other side of the aisle. And although \nperhaps in disagreement, he always treated those views with the respect \nand consideration they deserved.\n  Obviously, as has been mentioned, the relationship between the two \nmen was remarkable and unusual. But it was also remarkable and unusual \nthat, in all the years that I saw Bud Nance here, never once did I see \nhim lose patience with anyone. His courtesy was unfailing, and, \nfrankly, he represented what we know of as the greatest generation in \nmore ways than just having served in combat and risked his life for his \ncountry in three wars.\n  Mr. President, when I think of Bud Nance, as I always have, as we not \nonly mourn his passing but celebrate his life, I could not help but be \nreminded of what is one of my favorite poems, written by Robert Louis \nStevenson, who also had an incredibly unusual life of adventure, with \ngreat and vast experiences and great contributions. Robert Louis \nStevenson wrote a poem that he wrote for his own epitaph called \n``Requiem,'' which I believe also fits our dear friend, Bud Nance.\n  The poem is a very simple one:\n\n       Under the wide and starry sky.\n       Dig the grave and let me lie.\n       Glad did I live and gladly die.\n       And I laid me down with a will.\n\n       This be the verse you gave for me:\n       Here he lies where he longed to be;\n       Home is a sailor, home from the sea.\n       And the hunter home from the hill.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North \nCarolina, I was thinking to myself that one of the things that rarely \ngets written about regarding politics, and it is almost the thing I \nhave enjoyed the most about being a Senator, is the kind of friendships \nthat develop here.\n  Senator Helms and I are not exactly in agreement on most issues, and \nAdmiral Nance and I weren't in agreement on most issues, but I tell you \nsomething, I came to love that man and I will never forget him. I agree \nwith what everybody has said about his impact on the Senate.\n  I think it started a couple of years ago; I would be walking with a \nbad knee and Bud would ask me how I was doing. We would start talking, \nand then we would talk more. It came to the point, Senator Helms, where \nI just decided--I never had a chance to know the admiral in the same \nway Senator Helms knew him as a dear friend, or the way some of my \nother colleagues have known him over the years--I just reached the \nconclusion that this was a man I really believed in. I hope and pray he \nfelt the same way about me.\n  I think he represented the very best of treating people well, the \nbest of being willing to stand up for what you believe in, the best of \npatriotism, the best of public service. As far as I am concerned, there \nare certain people you meet whom you never forget. They are with you \nfor the rest of your life. I celebrate this man's life. In all the work \nI will get a chance to do as a Senator or as a teacher, or whatever I \ndo, I will always try--I will never succeed--to live up to Bud's \nexample.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Rear Admiral \nJames W. Nance, a gentleman and a patriot. I will leave it to others to \ntalk about Bud's accomplishments in the Navy, at the White House, in \nthe private sector and in academia, and here in the Senate. They are \nlegion. I wish to highlight the central role he played in assisting the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which I \nchaired. Senator Helms was a Commission Member. Bud understood the \nimportance of keeping some secrets. But he also understood that \nexcessive secrecy is a mode of regulation. The most pernicious mode, \nreally, since we don't know what we don't know. It is a fitting tribute \nto Bud, his wisdom, and his talents that the Commission unanimously \nissued its report containing recommendations for protecting and \nreducing government secrecy.\n  Bud battled his illness gallantly, which is no surprise. His death \nfrom that illness is no surprise, either, but it hurts nonetheless. We \nwho were privileged to know Bud will miss him. The country will miss \nhim.\n  He and I were frequent correspondents. His last letter to me, from \nlast October, is characteristics. He wrote,\n\n       As I mentioned in a discussion we had several months ago, I \n     have myelodysplasia, or smoldering leukemia. I have had all \n     the experimental treatments they do out at NIH without \n     success. At present, I am living on transfusions. This \n     problem does not worry me in the slightest because I have had \n     77 wonderful years and have had the privilege of knowing some \n     of the great people of my time.\n\n  Not the slightest tinge of self-pity, remorse, regret, or bitterness. \nHe was confident in his faith and comfortable in his accomplishments. \nRather, he was concerned about the imminent dangers our country faced \nin the Balkans and elsewhere:\n\n       What does bother me, Senator, is I am extremely worried \n     about our country. In 1939, I did not register for the draft \n     for World War II. The reason I did not register was because \n     they already had me . . . Everywhere we look around the world \n     things are bad--Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, India/Pakistan (nuclear \n     testing), North Korea, Latin America is stewing in drugs, et. \n     al. We should remember what Charles DeGaulle said, ``There \n     are no friends in international politics.'' We have countries \n     that respect us; countries that fear us; and countries that \n     hold us in contempt. I see too many cases where we are held \n     in contempt. We have to do better internationally.\n\n  Bud wrote to me, with his characteristic modesty, ``In the roughly 60 \nyears that I have been with the government in both the executive and \nlegislative branches I have always tried to make our country a little \nsafer and a little better.'' This, rhetoricians will tell you, is \nunderstatement. If I may paraphrase General Robert E. Lee, Bud did his \nduty in all things. He could not do more. And it's obvious he never \nwished to do less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina, Mr. Edwards.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Thank you, Senator Helms, for allowing me to speak today \nin a tribute to an extraordinary North Carolinian, Adm. Bud Nance.\n  I found Senator McCain's poem very moving and very touching. I know \nBud Nance was an extraordinary friend to my senior Senator, who has \nbeen an extraordinary friend to me since I have been here in the \nSenate. They grew up together. I think they were born a couple of \nblocks away from each other, over in Monroe, NC, and even a couple of \nmonths apart, if I am not mistaken.\n  The things that Bud Nance did with his life are the things we would \nstrive for all of our children to do. He spent his life in service of \nthis country. Having attended the Naval Academy, having gone on to rise \nto prominence as an admiral in the Navy, having served on the U.S.S. \nNorth Carolina, and then, after retirement, when most people would go \non to spend time with their family and children, he went to his second \ncareer, which was working for his great lifelong friend, Senator Helms, \non the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  While I did not know Bud Nance intimately the way the Senators who \nhave spoken knew him, I have to say, whenever I went to Senator Helms \nfor advice--which seemed to be often--on issues of foreign relations, \nthe very first thing he would say to me is, you need to talk to Bud \nNance. I know how much he relied and depended on Bud Nance.\n  I might add, aside from the fact that I am so proud of Bud Nance as a \nNorth Carolinian, I have another connection with him, which is that my \nfather-in-law, Vince Anania, who was a captain in the Navy, went to the \nNaval Academy and was a classmate of Bud Nance\n\n[[Page S5457]]\n\nat the Naval Academy. My father-in-law was a career naval aviator, a \nman for whom I have great love, admiration, and respect, and he held \nBud Nance in enormous esteem and friendship, having gone to school with \nhim, having known him over the years.\n  I have to say, this man's career speaks for itself. The fact that he \nis held in such high esteem by Capt. Vince Anania, whom I love, admire \nand respect, just about says it all. I think this man was an \nextraordinary man who gave extraordinary service to his country. We \nhave lost a great American.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I ask unanimous consent that any further remarks by other \nSenators today or subsequent to today relative to Bud Nance be printed \nin tandem with the remarks that will already appear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, to my friend and distinguished colleague, \nthe senior Senator from North Carolina, chairman of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, I offer my sympathy, my condolences. I have \nexpressed those sentiments to Senator Helms in writing and face-to-\nface.\n  I have heard the eloquence of many of my colleagues here this \nmorning, expressing themselves about how they feel about a very special \nAmerican. The only weakness that has been presented here is that most \nof them have been Navy. Having been an Army sergeant in Vietnam in \n1968, I, too, have some sense of appreciation for a Navy admiral. Of \ncourse, when I was in Vietnam as an Army sergeant, I didn't know any \nadmirals, but I got to know this admiral rather well.\n  I wish to share a quick story that the Senator from North Carolina \nmay not know about Bud Nance. Two weeks after I was elected to the \nSenate from Nebraska in 1996, I received a call from Admiral Nance. It \nhad gotten around back here that I was interested in serving on the \nSenate Foreign Affairs Committee. Admiral Nance first congratulated me \non my victory and then said the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee would \nbe willing to even take an Army veteran--if it came to that--but wanted \nme to know that he was at my disposal to help me and assist me in any \nway with the staff that I was assembling, whether I joined the Senate \nForeign Affairs Committee or not.\n  We had a long talk--as I recall about 45 minutes--about our country, \nabout service to our country, military, foreign relations. After that \n45-minute conversation, I walked out of my office in Omaha and said to \nthe person who is now my chief of staff: I am going to seek a seat on \nthe Senate Foreign Affairs Committee if for no other reason than Bud \nNance.\n  Bud Nance and I talked about that occasionally, and that relationship \nbuilt. For me, it was a very important part of my service on the Senate \nForeign Affairs Committee and in this body.\n  I recall 4 months into my first year in the Senate at a hearing \nSenator Helms was presiding over--and I know this will come as a \nsurprise to some Members on the floor--one of our colleagues had an \nawful lot to say that day and was not inhibited by time or bashful \nabout how much he wished to contribute on this particular subject. As \none of our colleagues went on and on and on, Admiral Nance leaned \nforward and said, ``Senator,'' and I turned and I said, ``Yes, Admiral \nNance.'' He said, ``I want you to observe something.'' He smiled and \nwinked and looked down and then said, ``Senator, remember, you need not \nbe eternal to be immortal.''\n  I don't think that was an original, but it was at that time effective \nand framed the issue in rather simple Bud Nance eloquence that the \nSenator has come to know for so many years.\n  Of course we will all miss him; not only for what he represented--and \nmaybe, more than anything, what he represented was a role model. Each \nof us who has the privilege of serving our country should always \nunderstand that the greatest responsibility we have is to be as good a \nrole model as we possibly can. For his staff, as you know so well, Mr. \nChairman, you who loved this man, who adored this man--not because he \nwas a friendly man, but he guided them and he helped them; he was tough \nwhen he needed to be tough--for all those staff members who served with \nAdmiral Nance, I wish to say thank you on their behalf, since they do \nnot have the privilege of being on the floor of the Senate this \nmorning, acknowledging his service. And on behalf of this Army veteran, \nvery junior Senator, I wish to thank Admiral Nance. For you, Bud Nance, \nwherever you are: We will miss you, Admiral.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I think I have never heard such eloquence \nin my 27 years in the Senate. It was a glory to me just to sit here and \nhear the evaluations of a man whom I have known and loved all my life.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to just add a note of sympathy \nand condolence, but also, on this day, a note of admiration for Admiral \nNance's public service. As I said one day on the floor when we were \ntalking about the late Scott Bates, there are many people who serve \nthis country, and work in this Senate especially, who do so in ways \nthat are not obvious to people on the outside, but in ways that are \ncritically important to the workings of the Senate and the construction \nof good public policy in America.\n  I did not know Admiral Nance well. I knew him to see him. I, on \nseveral occasions, approached him with some questions about policy \nissues that I knew the committee was working on, that I knew he was \ninvolved in with Senator Helms. On each occasion, he answered my \nqueries with patience and with a great deal of understanding. I walked \naway thinking to myself, this is a person who really knows these \nissues, both from experience and just a general knowledge from a wide \nrange of interests and issues. It reminded me again, then, with him, as \nit has with so many others, of the wonderful service given the Senate \nby so many people on our staffs. But he was different. He was by all \naccounts, of all those who had many more dealings with him than I had, \na person who brought to this Senate a very substantial background and a \nvery special kind of knowledge about these issues in foreign affairs.\n  So I want to add my voice today to the expressions of gratitude for \nhis public service. Yes, condolence over his passing and sympathy to \nhis family and loved ones, but especially, at the same time, to say \nthank you to Admiral Nance for lending himself in service to his \ncountry in such a noble way and especially thank you to him for being \nof service to his country here in the Senate with Senator Helms for so \nmany years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to join many of my \ncolleagues this morning in saying just how grateful I am that I had the \nchance to work with ``the Admiral.'' When I call Bud Nance ``the \nAdmiral,'' I do so on purpose, because when a Senator referred to ``the \nAdmiral,'' of course you never had to question which one. We all knew \nthat Member was talking about--of course, Admiral Nance.\n  The Admiral was a great man, a true American hero. He survived over \n150 Japanese suicide bomber attacks during World War II. He became a \nNavy test pilot, which was dangerous work. In one of the 10-men units \nin which he served, five pilots died in crashes. So we know he was not \nonly brave but also blessed.\n  Later he commanded the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal and served \nas deputy assistant to the President for national security affairs \nunder Ronald Reagan.\n  Chairman Helms and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee benefited \nfrom his intense patriotism and vast experience. We are all very lucky \nthat he was willing to serve his country in this way, continuing his \nlifelong commitment to the defense of our Nation's interests.\n  Let me say something else about the Admiral. He was a modest man, a \nvery simple man, and he certainly would not\n\n[[Page S5458]]\n\nwant all of this fuss about his accomplishments over a very long life. \nBut Admiral Nance was a Navy man and, of course, loved to tell stories. \nIn his memory, I want to relate an anecdote about the Admiral which \nreflects his straightforward nature and, above all, his sense of humor.\n  This happened before my time in the Senate, but it is one of those \nstories that gets repeated by members of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. I share it with everyone today because if any of you did not \nhave the pleasure of knowing Bud Nance, you will have a better \nunderstanding of why he was so beloved by everybody with whom he \nworked.\n  It occurred in the summer of 1992 when Admiral Nance was the minority \nstaff director of the Foreign Relations Committee and he had requested \na document from AID on funds for Nicaragua. The answer the Admiral got \nfrom AID was not in English with dollar amounts, but rather it came in \nSpanish with amounts in cordobas.\n  So the Admiral wrote back to AID saying he had three staff members \nwho were Spanish speakers, but they were all busy, and since English \nwas obviously not AID's official language, he wanted all communication \nfrom AID to the committee to be either in Russian or Hebrew during the \nmonth of August. But--here is the real kicker--the Admiral sent his \nresponse to AID through the proper channels on Foreign Relations \nCommittee stationery, it was all very proper and official looking, \nexcept for one thing: He had a member of his staff draft it up in \nHebrew. And that is the truth. I have a copy of the letter right here.\n  By the way, the only bit of English was, of course, his signature at \nthe bottom of the letter: ``James W. Nance.'' According to the Admiral, \nhe never heard back from AID on that matter, but he never received \nanother foreign-language document without a translation as well.\n  So again, Mr. President, this is not just a time to mourn our loss, \nbut I believe very strongly it is a time to celebrate the Admiral's \nlife. He will be missed, but he will not be forgotten.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I associate myself with the remarks that have been made all morning \nconcerning the passing of Admiral Nance, and what a gentleman he was, \nand what a difficult thing it is for Senator Helms to lose a friend he \nhas had since childhood.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in 1941, Monroe, North Carolina, lost \nBud Nance, a favorite home grown boy, who traveled north to the U.S. \nNaval Academy. Last week, we all suffered the loss of Admiral Nance to \na different journey. He passed away after a life time of dedicated and \nsuccessful service to his country. But, what most of us will recall \nbeyond his distinguished record and credentials is the support and \nfriendship Bud offered many of us, especially to Senator Helms.\n  Bud brought the quiet confidence and certain purpose he had gained \nfrom growing up in a close knit community to each challenge and task he \nfaced. When he arrived to serve Senator Helms as chief of staff of the \nForeign Relations Committee there were no shortages to the variety and \ncomplexity of those challenges. But, Bud had a gift for dissecting and \nanalyzing complicated issues--whether personnel or policy--cutting with \ncertainty to the heart of any matter, giving guidance then moving on to \nthe next challenge. He saw each problem as an opportunity to support \nhis friends and serve his country.\n  The many conversations I enjoyed with Bud flowed from our common \nreverence for the history and stories so familiar in the South. He \nrepresented the best of North Carolina traditions--he had that strong \nstreak of country sense, yet was ever sentimental; his wisdom twinkled \nwith humor. He brought these strengths to every discussion we had on a \nwide range of issues from arms control to foreign aid--he made a \ndifference with Southern distinction.\n  Bud's loss will be felt most deeply by his life long and good friend, \n``Jesse''. I thank him for sharing Bud with us for the past 8 years. \nThe Senate and its Members are the richer for his contribution and \nservice.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in saying how much \nthis Senate, and this nation, will miss Bud Nance. I want, as well, to \noffer my condolences to Admiral Nance's family, to Senator Helms on the \nloss of his childhood friend and staff member, and to Admiral Nance's \ncolleagues at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Other Senators on both sides of the aisle have spoken of Admiral \nNance's distinguished careers--in the Navy, the White House, and here \nin the Senate. He was, as they have said, a war hero, and a true \npatriot. Senior Naval officer. Commander of U.S. forces in Europe. \nNational security advisor to two Presidents. Chief of Staff to the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Senator Helms is his dearest and oldest friend in the Senate. But \nAdmiral Nance leaves many friends here--on both sides of the aisle. He \nwas a good and decent man. A man of great accomplishment and true \nhumility. He was also a man of integrity. You knew, whenever you dealt \nwith Admiral Nance, that you were dealing with a fair and open man. You \nknew if Bud Nance made a commitment, it would be kept. His word was his \nbond.\n  He was also an tireless worker. Most mornings, he arrived at the \nCapitol at 7 o'clock. He was still at his desk late into most nights. I \ndon't know whether his work ethic was formed in the Navy, or earlier in \nlife, but it was remarkable. And it never wavered, even during his last \ngreat battle with sickness and pain. Admiral Nance was a steady hand on \nthe foreign relations Senate ship, just as he was in his command of the \naircraft carrier Forrestal. He displayed courage and grace in his fight \nagainst illness.\n  The Senate is served every day by men and women of great dedication, \ncommitment and industry who believe in the American system of \ngovernment. Even among these exceptional people, Admiral Nance stood \nout. He will be missed. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, \nMary Lyda Faulk; their children, James Lee Nance, Mary Catherine Worth, \nAndrew Monroe Nance and Susan Elizabeth Nance, and their many \ngrandchildren.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to join every member of \nthis body in mourning the loss of Admiral James W. ``Bud'' Nance. His \nloss is felt especially among those Members and staff who worked \nclosely with the Admiral on the Foreign Relations Committee. He is \nsurvived by his wife of 53 years, four children, and seven \ngrandchildren.\n  The much-celebrated friendship between Admiral Nance and Senator \nJesse Helms set the tone for the work of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Few committee chairmen have known their staff directors \nsince first grade. The level of trust between those two elevated the \nwork of the Committee to a distinct level.\n  Born in 1921 in Monroe, North Carolina, Admiral Nance went on to \ngraduate from the Naval Academy, fight in World War II, and serve 35 \nyears in the U.S. Navy. That was all before he began his second career \nafter 1979 in the Legislative and Executive branches of Government. In \nthe Navy, the Admiral was a first rate aviator, involved in some of the \nmore dangerous testing and developing programs for naval fighters. He \nserved as Commanding Officer of the Attack Carrier Air Wing Eight \naboard the U.S.S. Forrestal and later became the Commanding Officer of \nthat aircraft carrier--a ship that had more sailors (5,000) than his \nhometown of Monroe, North Carolina.\n  The Admiral concluded his naval career as Assistant Vice Chief of \nNaval Operations and Director of Naval Administration. He went on to \nserve as a staff member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in \n1979-80 and Deputy Assistant for National Security Affairs under \nPresident Reagan. In that capacity, he was responsible for managing the \nentire staff of the National Security Council at the White House.\n  Admiral Nance returned specifically to naval aviation by running \nBoeing's Navy Systems program from 1983 to 1990. In 1991, he returned \nto the Foreign Relations Committee as Deputy Staff Director for the \nMinority and has served the last four years as Majority Staff Director \nfor the Committee.\n  The Admiral's commitment to service can be seen throughout his life, \nand\n\n[[Page S5459]]\n\nthat was certainly the case in the four years that I worked with him as \na Member of the Foreign Relations Committee. In assuming the position \nof Staff Director, Admiral Nance told Senator Helms he viewed the job \nas a service to his country and wanted no compensation. Senate rules \nrequired some level of compensation to be an official Senate employee, \nhowever, so Admiral Nance began his tenure with the exorbitant income \nof $3.36 a week. When Congress became bound by the laws of the land, \nSenator Helms was forced to raise Admiral Nance's salary to minimum \nwage.\n  We smile as we reflect on the Admiral's paltry salary, but what a \nselfless display of service that was to his country and this body. \nEarning the minimum wage was not a publicity stunt. Admiral Nance \noperated behind the scenes almost entirely. This man was truly \nmotivated by gratitude to the United States.\n  Admiral Nance was a dedicated conservative, and his conservatism was \nrooted in respect for his fellow man and an unshakeable commitment to \nthe best interests of his country. His partisanship was good-humored \nand balanced. The Admiral had a verse displayed prominently in his \noffice from Ecclesiastes which read ``The heart of the wise inclines to \nthe right, but the heart of the fool to the left.'' Whether as a \nformidable opponent or valued ally in the work of the Senate, Admiral \nNance respected--and won the respect of--all members of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  This man was a warrior his entire life, placing himself in harm's way \nfor the good of his country. He died as he lived--he fought to the very \nend. Many Members of this body probably are not aware of the health \ndifficulties he struggled with during his entire tenure as Staff \nDirector of the Foreign Relations Committee. It would have been easy to \nwalk away. There was a reason he stayed, though.\n  Admiral Nance was a true American. His life was a testament to the \nideals which have made this country great. He believed in the United \nStates of America. He believed in prudent and decisive American \nleadership in the world. He believed in what this country stood for and \nwhat it could accomplish.\n  As we reflect on his life in the coming days, may each of us gain a \nrenewed sense of commitment to preserve the blessings of freedom which \nthe Admiral defended. My sympathies are with the Admiral's wife Mary \nLyda and their children. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great man and a \ngreat American who passed away last week. I had the privilege of \nworking with and knowing Admiral James `Bud' Nance. His passing was a \ngreat loss for me personally, for the Senate, and most importantly, for \nour country.\n  In both his long and distinguished naval career and his work \ndirecting the activities of the Foreign Relations Committee, Bud set \nthe highest standard in his selfless commitment to country and his \nloyalty to friends. His commanding presence, his decorum in all that he \ndid, and his model of sacrifice and service is an inspiration for all \nwho knew him.\n  While we are saddened by his passing, we rejoice in his memory and in \nthe legacy of loyalty and service he left behind. Chairman Helms, my \nsympathy and condolences to you in the loss of this great friend. Our \nprayers and thoughts are also with the Admiral's wife and children.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude these brief remarks with a \npoem by Ralph Waldo Emerson, titled ``Great Men.'' It captures, far \nbetter than I could in my own words, Bud's commitment and service to \nthis country.\n\n     Not gold, but only man can make\n       A people great and strong;\n     Men who, for truth and honor's sake\n       Stand fast and suffer long.\n\n     Brave men who work while others sleep,\n       Who dare while others fly--\n     They build a nation's pillars deep\n       And lift them to the sky.\n\n  Bud Nance was once of these great men who helped build our nation's \npillars deep and lift them to the sky.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I join my colleagues and the entire Senate \nfamily in honoring the life and memory of Admiral James Nance, the \nformer majority staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee. My deepest sympathies go out to Bud's wife, Mary, and to his \nfour children and seven grandchildren.\n  I also want to express to my Chairman, Senator Helms, my sincerest \ncondolences on the loss of his lifelong friend. He and Bud Nance, born \njust a few months apart, grew up a mere three blocks from each other in \nMonroe, North Carolina.\n  Bud Nance joined the Navy in 1941 and retired 38 years later as a \nrear admiral. He served this nation in active duty in three wars. \nDuring his service in World War II, he survived 162 Japanese air and \nkamikaze attacks. Over the course of his career, he served as a Navy \ntest pilot, led an attack squadron and an air wing, and commanded the \nU.S.S. Raleigh and the aircraft carrier, Forrestal. After leaving the \nmilitary in 1979, Admiral Nance served as assistant national security \nadviser until he joined the private sector as head of naval systems for \nBoeing.\n  In 1991, Senator Helms asked his old friend to bring his military \nknowledge and experience in world affairs to the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee. Admiral Nance refused to take a salary and \nreceived only the minimum compensation allowed under federal law--$153 \nper year.\n  Bud Nance will be remembered in this body as a gracious and kind \ngentleman. When I joined the Foreign Relations Committee this year, Bud \ncalled to welcome me and my staff to the Committee. It was typical of \nBud's courtesy and good manners.\n  Mr. President, in Bud Nance the Senate has lost a loyal public \nservant and the nation has lost a true patriot.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice to those \nof my colleagues who have risen today to talk about the remarkable \nservice given this body, and our nation, by Admiral James W. Nance, \nmajority staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Although I am no longer on the Committee, I had the honor and \npleasure of serving as a member of that Committee in the 105th \nCongress, and to come to know and admire ``The Admiral.''\n  In many ways, Admiral Nance was the living embodiment of what Tom \nBrokaw, in his recent book, has called ``The Greatest Generation.'' He \nhad a distinguished career in the Navy, serving in combat in World War \nII, as a test pilot, and later as commander of the aircraft carrier \nU.S.S. Forrestal.\n  Following his Naval career, he served as deputy assistant to the \nPresident for National Security Affairs in the Reagan administration, \nand then joined his boyhood friend, the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, in offering his service, and his expertise, to the U.S. \nSenate as staff director for the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  His kindness to me--as a junior member of the minority party--in \ngetting to know the ins and outs of the Committee was always \nappreciated, and his sage council and advice were always a welcome \naddition to the Committee's consideration of a range of pressing \nnational security issues.\n  The Admiral will be sorely missed--but I join my colleagues in \ncelebrating his life of service to the United States.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5459-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5459-S5460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         OLDER AMERICANS MONTH\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, May happens to be Older Americans Month. \nI believe we should honor older Americans through this month, not only \nbecause my State of Iowa has many fine senior citizens whom I am very \nwilling and happy to talk about because of their contributions to our \nState and our society, but also because I am chairman of the Aging \nCommittee.\n  It may be human nature to overlook the hardships of previous \ngenerations. We do not think about suffering that we do not have to \nendure, and that is the way it should be. That is the way\n\n[[Page S5460]]\n\nwe hope it is and it is the hope of American innovators who work to \nease the misfortunes for our children and grandchildren.\n  One of those innovators is a 101-year-old woman from Sioux City, IA. \nLouise Humphrey was a leading light in the battle against polio, one of \nthe most terrifying illnesses of our century. Because of her work and \nthe work of others devoted to finding a cure, polio is almost \nnonexistent in our country.\n  It is hard for anyone who did not live through the forties and \nfifties to understand fully the fear and hysteria which accompanied the \npolio epidemic during any particular summer. The disease was highly \ncontagious and sometimes fatal. It attacked the lungs and limbs. It \nimmobilized its victims. It made them struggle for breath and often \nforced them to breathe through mechanical iron lungs. Parents would not \nallow their children to go swimming or to drink out of public fountains \nfor fear of contagion.\n  Those children fortunate enough to escape the illness saw their \nclassmates return to school in the fall in leg braces and watched \nnewsreels of people in iron lungs.\n  At the height of the epidemic in the 1940s and early 1950s, polio \nstruck between 20,000 to 50,000 Americans each year. In 1 year, 1952, \n58,000 people caught the disease. Most of these people were children.\n  Mrs. Humphrey of Sioux City became interested in polio before the \nheight of the epidemic. In the 1930s, according to the Sioux City \nJournal, she saw firsthand the ravaging effects of polio after meeting \na man who had been disabled by the disease.\n  She and her husband, the late J. Hubert Humphrey, a Sioux City \ndentist, became leaders in the fight against polio. They headed the \nWoodbury County chapter of the National Foundation for Infantile \nParalysis. Mrs. Humphrey was elected State chairman of the women's \ndivision of that foundation.\n  The Humphreys raised thousands of dollars for equipment and therapy \nto battle the disease. They enlisted entertainers and circus performers \nin the cause, hosting these individuals at fundraising parties. Their \nguests included Bob Hope, clown Emmett Kelly, and even an elephant that \nloved ham sandwiches.\n  Their work contributed to a climate in which Jonas Salk developed the \nfirst polio vaccine. His vaccine, and another developed by Dr. Albert \nSabin, soon became widely available. Thus, polio is virtually \nnonexistent in our country, although it remains a Third World threat.\n  Mrs. Humphrey has said she has no secret for living such a long life. \nShe advises people to, in her words, ``just be happy and be well.'' She \nhas never had an ache or pain. What she did have in abundance was \nempathy, kindness, generosity, and devotion. Because of her \ncontributions, millions of American children will live without a \ndebilitating disease, polio.\n  On June 3, Mrs. Humphrey will be 102. In advance of her birthday, \nduring Older Americans Month, I thank Mrs. Humphrey for helping to make \nour country strong. Mrs. Humphrey, with her clear vision and \ncompassionate concern for America's children, perfectly illustrates the \ntheme of Older Americans Month, which is: ``Honor the Past, Imagine the \nFuture: Toward a Society for All Ages.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, at the end of my remarks I am going to \nmake a unanimous consent request--I see the Senator from Idaho is here; \nI want him to know that--that I be permitted to send an amendment to \nthe desk regarding the age people have to be before they can buy a \nweapon or gain access to a weapon. But I will not do that now; I will \nwait until the end of my remarks, and then I will make that unanimous \nconsent request. I wanted to make sure my colleagues knew I was going \nto do that.\n  I think it is really important, as we move forward on this juvenile \njustice bill, to debate all the issues surrounding juvenile justice as \nfully and as completely as we can. After all, there isn't a politician \nI know who does not say our future is our children. That is what our \nfuture is about. And as healthy as our children are, that is as healthy \nas our country will be. As stable as our children are, that is how \nstable our country will be. As productive as our children are, that is \nhow productive our country will be.\n  As we all attempt in various capacities in our lives--as parents, and \nas grandparents--to ensure that our children understand that in a \nsociety that is worthy there should be as little violence as possible, \nif we can just transmit that to our children, this will be a better \nworld.\n  In the course of the debate, we have talked about many areas in our \nsociety that need attention. There isn't one of us who could truly \nstand up here and say, well, I do everything I can; there is nothing \nwrong with me. And there is no industry that can stand up and say it. \nWe all have to look inside ourselves to make sure our kids understand \nthat violence is wrong, it is a black and white situation, and it isn't \nthe way to resolve our problems, et cetera. So this debate surrounding \nthis bill is very relevant to the lives of our people.\n  In my home State--and I have said this often on the floor, but it is \nworth repeating to some of my friends--the No. 1 cause of death among \nchildren happens to be gunshots. In other words, for children, from as \nsoon as they are born to age 18, that is the No. 1 cause of death--that \nthey are going to be killed by a gun.\n  Somebody could say, well, that is just the price you pay to live in \nAmerica. That is ridiculous. That is ridiculous. In our Constitution we \nhave the right to pursue happiness; we have the right to life, liberty, \nand the pursuit of happiness--life, liberty, and the pursuit of \nhappiness. So when we see gunshots causing so much death and mutilation \nin our society, we have to take a look at, Where have we gone wrong? \nWhat is wrong? Can we do something?\n  We have taken a couple steps in this bill to try to fix this problem \nof guns, but we have a long way to go. I want to show a chart here \nwhich indicates why this is such an important issue in America.\n  In the 11 years of the Vietnam war, we lost 58,168 of our precious \npeople, and this country--this country--was torn apart. Every one of \nthose deaths was mourned by family and by the greater American family.\n  In the last 11 years, we have lost 396,572 people to guns.\n  Yes, it might be time to spend a few more days on this bill when you \nfind yourself in this kind of situation. You cannot turn away from \nfacts. You may want to turn away from facts, but you cannot turn away \nfrom facts.\n  As I look around and see these numbers and I see what is happening in \nthe news--in the last few days we had about four or five other \nschoolkids who, it was found, thank goodness, were going to perpetrate \na massacre with guns at their schools --something rings out in my mind, \nand that is, angry kids and guns do not mix. Angry people and guns do \nnot mix.\n  It seems to me that since we know you have to be 18 years of age to \nbuy wine, to buy beer, to buy cigarettes, you ought to have to be 18 \nyears old before you can buy a gun.\n  Some people might say, well, haven't we fixed that? Well, for \nhandguns, 21; that is, if you go to a dealer. I believe Senator \nAshcroft said you have to be 18 to buy a semiautomatic at a gun\n\n[[Page S5461]]\n\nshow. You have to be 18 if you go to a dealer to buy a long gun. But if \nyou go to a gun show or you make a private purchase, you can be 14 to \nbuy a rifle or a shotgun under Federal law. You could be 12. So I think \nit is time for us to look at what we are doing in this country.\n  Eighteen to buy cigarettes, 18 to buy beer or whiskey or wine, 18 to \nbuy a semiautomatic handgun, 21 at a dealer. But you could buy these \nlong guns. And we have juveniles going to unlicensed vendors at a gun \nshow or at a flea market and buying a long gun in what we call private \nsales.\n  Now, I want to talk about what happened in the Colorado massacre, \nbecause one of the things people are saying is, well, many laws were \nbroken there so we don't need any more laws. The truth is, the young \nwoman who transferred those guns to the juveniles, because she said she \ndidn't know they were going to use it for adverse purposes, broke no \nlaw. She broke no law. She was 18. She purchased, as I understand it, \nthree weapons and gave them to these kids. She broke no law. She was \n18. She gave three long guns to the shooters, legal under Federal law. \nIt should not be. You should not be able to sell a gun to a juvenile, \nand you should not be able to give a gun to a juvenile unless you are \nthe parent or the grandparent or the legal guardian.\n  I could see that. I have talked to my friend, Patrick Leahy, who told \nme he gave up a hunting rifle to his daughter when she was 15 or 16. \nThat was his choice. So we have in our amendment the ability for a \ngrandparent or a parent or a legal guardian to give such a gun, but not \nfor a friend to run down to the store and get a gun and give it to you \nif you are 17 or you are 16 or you are 15. That shouldn't be \nappropriate.\n  So the amendment that I want to put forward here does not say a \njuvenile can't get a long gun from a parent, grandparent, or legal \nguardian. It would not make it illegal for that juvenile to possess a \nrifle or a shotgun or even to own such a gun, if a parent or a legal \nguardian gave it to them, or a grandparent. However, if it isn't a \nparent or a grandparent or a legal guardian, it would be illegal to \ngive a juvenile a gun, any kind of gun, any kind of firearm.\n  My children would call this a no-brainer. It is pretty clear that we \nset age limits for all kinds of things, but not to own a firearm, \nunless it is a handgun and now a semiautomatic weapon. So there is a \ngiant loophole.\n\n  As I understand it, all of these guns would be able to be bought by a \njuvenile under current law. What I want to do, Mr. President, is bring \nguns in line with cigarettes in terms of purchase.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that I may offer that amendment to S. 254 \nat this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we are in \nmorning business. We are not on the bill. This afternoon it appears we \nwould be back on the bill. At that time it would be appropriate to \nintroduce that amendment. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the Senator knows, I asked unanimous \nconsent to send this amendment to the desk now. I do not want people to \nbe confused. In the Senate, you can send an amendment to the desk any \ntime you want, if you ask unanimous consent and no one objects. The \nSenator from Idaho is objecting. He is not allowing me to send this \namendment to the desk to get a vote on this amendment, to put this \namendment at the desk, to put it in line, when all I am saying is you \nshould be 18 before you can buy a firearm.\n  I just want to be clear, I am very disappointed that this unanimous \nconsent request has been objected to. I will stay on the floor as long \nas it takes to offer this amendment, which merely says if you have to \nbe 18 to buy cigarettes, you ought to be 18 to buy a weapon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, how much time remains prior to adjournment \nfor the Tuesday lunches under the unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remain.\n  Mr. CRAIG. And the 6 minutes is in place by unanimous consent, is it \nnot?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, for discussion of S. 96.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed for 6 minutes as in morning business prior to adjournment \nfor lunch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I don't intend to object \nto my friend. I know that my friend objected to my laying down a new \namendment. There were two amendments that already have been debated--\nthe Kohl safety lock amendment and the Hatch-Feinstein gang amendment.\n  I am wondering if the Senator would object if I would ask unanimous \nconsent that at 2:15 we resume consideration of the Kohl amendment No. \n352, and that there be 5 minutes for debate, and that upon use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation \nto the amendment, and upon disposition of that, the Senate resume \nconsideration of the Hatch-Feinstein amendment No. 353, that there be 5 \nminutes for debate and, upon the use or yielding back of time, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment with no intervening \naction, provided provisions of the previous unanimous consent remain in \neffect. Would the Senator allow me to offer that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would object, but I hope the Senator from California \nwould not characterize that objection in the improper fashion. Both the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee and the ranking member, who are \nmanaging this bill, are not on the floor. The Senator from California \nknows that the leadership at this moment, both her leader and my \nleader, are trying to craft a unanimous consent agreement to allow the \nSenator from California and others to offer appropriate amendments. I \nam in no way attempting to obstruct. I say that I believe her offering \nis inappropriate and out of context of the way the Senate operates. \nCertainly, she knows, as I do, that we work through our leaders, and we \nalso work through the managers of the bill. I do not oppose her arguing \nher point before the Senate in the appropriate fashion, but I certainly \nwould object to the context under which she has offered it.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would the Senator yield for a brief comment on my part \nhere?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Very brief, unless you object to my unanimous consent to \ncomplete the morning?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make it clear to my friend, my purpose here, as \na Senator from California who views this issue as one of the most \nimportant we will ever take up, is to move the bill along. That is why \nI offered to send my other amendment to the desk, to push forward these \ntwo amendments that have already been heard, so that we can move things \nalong. But I appreciate the Senator has a different view.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mr. President, it is important that I characterize in the appropriate \nfashion an amendment that passed the Senate that the Senator from \nCalifornia voted for, I believe. That was the Ashcroft amendment on \nsemiauto assault weapons for young juveniles. She is wrong that it was \ntied to 18. It is tied to the 21 age limit that is already current law, \nas it relates to handguns and other restricted weapons. I helped craft \nthat law, along with Senator Kohl, several years ago, and it became \nlaw, and we are very proud of it.\n  She is absolutely right to be concerned about juveniles having guns. \nThat is why we were very restrictive. Any juvenile who brings a gun to \nschool is breaking the law. If it is a handgun and they are under 21 \nyears of age, they have broken the law.\n  What we are saying is that on private property, on a ranch or a farm \nwhere they are out hunting varmints, or if they are en route to a \nregistered shoot, if they have permission from their guardian, they \nfall outside the law--guardian or parent. So what the Senator from \nCalifornia was talking about in her proposed amendment is, in part, not \nunlike what is in current law in many respects.\n\n[[Page S5462]]\n\n  It is true what she has said about long guns after 18 years of age. \nNo question about it. But it is not true of the semiauto assault \nweapons, if you include the Ashcroft amendment that passed the Senate \nand is now incorporated into the juvenile justice bill.\n  Mr. President, in the juvenile justice bill, as it relates to guns, \nwe have crafted a juvenile Brady provision, a very important part of \nthe bill. We have dramatically restricted gun shows and demanded, if \nthis becomes law, background checks. We have now, with Senator Kohl and \nSenator Hatch, crafted a trigger lock provision that I think is an \nimportant piece of language and ought to become law.\n  As I have just said, we have prohibited juveniles from owning \nsemiauto assault weapons with extended loading devices. If we pass this \nbill, that becomes law.\n  Senator Feinstein was able to pass an amendment that restricts \ncertain importations of extended loading devices or clips. If we pass \nthis bill, it becomes law.\n  But if this bill becomes simply a gun control measure and not an \nextensive juvenile crime provision, it will not become law. I hope the \nSenator from California and others know that, that we ought to work \ncooperatively together to pass a much broader law and language to \ncontrol violent juveniles and their actions than to play the politics \nof guns, because that is what we have heard for the last day on the \nfloor, the last 3 days, is the politics of guns.\n  The Senator from California and I have voted for some new gun control \nmeasures. We believe those are extensive measures that craft a window \nand close the window that she and others were objecting to. But it is \ninteresting that once we close a window, they redefine and create a new \nwindow and say, and now this and now this, and the goalposts constantly \nmove.\n  Mr. President, if the goalposts are constantly moving, then there \nwill be no juvenile crime bill because the other side will have killed \nit. I think it is tragic that, after two years in a bipartisan effort \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee to craft a much broader bill dealing \nwith violent juveniles, we would see that prohibited by these actions. \nI hope we can get past that. I hope this afternoon we can craft a \nunanimous consent agreement for both sides to offer some reasonable \namendments and that we can see final passage of this bill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield to me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nbe given an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Under the previous order--\n--\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senator made a huge mistake in the \nanalysis of the Ashcroft amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have 30 seconds to set the record \nstraight on the Ashcroft amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would allow that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am holding the Ashcroft amendment in my \nhand. It says:\n\n       For purposes of this subsection, the term ``juvenile'' \n     means a person who is less than 18 years of age.\n\n  So the age was not raised to 21. There are some on this side who \nwould do that. My amendment talks about all other guns. There is no age \nlimit to go to a gun show. They can be 12 and buy a long gun, a shotgun \nor a rifle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5462-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning I opened the Washington Post \nnewspaper to the Metro Section and saw on page 1 of the Metro Section, \na headline that says, ``Killer Sent To Wrong Prison After 2nd Murder.'' \nI want to describe this killer and I want to describe what has happened \nin the District of Columbia, because I have spoken about this case, I \nsuppose, five or six times on the floor of the Senate over the last 4 \nor 5 years.\n  First, let me tell you about the man they are talking about, the \nkiller. His name is Leo Gonzales Wright. On June 10, 1974, he committed \na rape and committed a burglary. On June 18, 1976, armed robbery; shot \na store owner during an armed robbery. February 1, 1976, robbery and \nmurder of a cab driver, Joseph Woodbury. Apprehended, incarcerated, \npled guilty to second degree murder and armed robbery. Released on \nparole some 17 years later. Arrested for cocaine in the District of \nColumbia. Indictment in a drug case, arraigned on the drug charge, \nfailed to report for drug testing. Failed to report for drug testing. \nCarjacking and armed robbery of Kristina Keyes. Failed to report for \ndrug testing. Carjacking and murder of Bettina Pruckmayr.\n  Who is Bettina Pruckmayr? She was a young, 26-year-old human rights \nlawyer. You can't see this picture much. She had just graduated from \nGeorgetown, a young woman who one evening was getting into her car and \nthis Leo Gonzales Wright abducts here, forces her to drive to an ATM \nmachine, and gets her ATM code. She cooperates in every way: gives him \nthe PIN number for the ATM machine, says, ``I only have $20 in my \naccount,'' and then she tries to run away.\n  He follows her and, according to the paper, got angry and decided to \nkill her, this 26-year-old lawyer. He said he was so enraged he stabbed \nher 38 times, plunging the knife into her body with such force that her \nsternum was crushed and many of the wounds, inflicted with a 5.5 inch \nbutcher knife, were more than 6 inches deep.\n  This young lady, this wonderful young attorney, was killed by someone \nwho should not have been able to kill anybody. He was on the streets, \nreleased early. He had already murdered, was put in prison, but \nreleased early and then picked up again for an offense and not put back \nin jail. Then he murdered this young woman. So the judge sentenced him, \nand the judge said, when he sentenced him 3 years ago: It is my intent, \nsir, that you will never be released into society again. You, sir, will \ndie in jail. This court will do everything in its power to ensure that \nyou will never walk the streets of this country or anyplace again.\n  That is what the Federal judge said to Leo Gonzales Wright, a double \nmurderer, a man with a criminal record as long as my arm, someone who \nshould not have been on the streets to murder Bettina Pruckmayr.\n  This morning the story in the paper says that, while Judge Sullivan \nordered this man to be sent to Federal prison 3 years ago, he is not in \na Federal prison. He has been out here at Lorton in the District of \nColumbia for the last 3 years. In fact, at one point he was given part \nof a day to go home to attend his mother's wake.\n  The story talks about the judge's anger. The judge has a right to be \nangry. All of us have a need to be angry. This is gross, utter \nincompetence. I don't know anybody in the criminal justice system in \nthe District of Columbia. I don't know anybody there. But there is such \ngross incompetence there it just staggers the imagination.\n  I have spoken probably five times on the floor of the Senate about \nthis murder, only because it is so reflective of what is wrong in our \ncriminal justice system. We know this guy is a murderer. We knew it \nbefore and society put him in jail, and the parole folks let\n\n[[Page S5463]]\n\nhim out early so he could murder again.\n\n  Who is accountable for that? Is somebody going to lose his or her \njob? The last time a Federal judge sent him to Federal prison he didn't \ngo. Who is accountable for that? Or he gets to go to his mother's wake, \nthis fellow who has murdered twice. Who is accountable for that? Who is \ngoing to tell the Pruckmayr family: We are sorry. This is just the way \nbureaucracy works.\n  It ought not be the way the system works anywhere.\n  I want to say to the Mayor of this city and the folks who run the \ncriminal justice system in this city, I am not someone who bashes the \ncity of the District of Columbia. I have never done that. Some do, but \nI do not. But I say today I am on the Appropriations Committee and you \nare going to pay a price. You are going to pay a price for this gross, \nstaggering, incompetence, unless someone is held accountable for this \nkind of nonsense.\n  People have the right to expect the streets are safe. People have the \nright to expect that murderers are not walking up and down the streets \nin this country. And in the District of Columbia, at least, they knew \nthis fellow was a murderer--he had murdered before, committed armed \nrobbery before, committed rape before--only for them to say somehow: We \ndecided to put him back on the streets. Then a Federal judge says: I \nwant him in Federal prison forever. The District of Columbia cannot \neven get that right.\n  We need to understand why. I do not mean this as a threat. I just \nmean it as a promise. They are going to pay a price unless they \ndemonstrate to the American people and to this Congress they are \nholding people accountable for this kind of gross negligence and gross \nincompetence.\n  I never met Bettina Pruckmayr. I have spoken in the Senate about a \nyoung 11-year-old boy, I suppose, about a half dozen times as well. \nThey found that young boy dead. They found grass and dirt between his \nfingers. He was also killed by a guy who previously had been convicted \nof murder. That young boy was stabbed many times and left for dead in a \npond, except he was not dead. He tried to crawl his way out. He died at \nthe top of the embankment with dirt and grass between his fingers.\n  He should never have been murdered. He was murdered by someone we \nknew was a murderer, because he murdered before. But the system said it \nwas OK that he be let out of jail.\n  The exact same thing is true with this young woman, Bettina \nPruckmayr. She ought not have died. Her death is on someone's \nconscience. I do not know who it is. Who makes these decisions? Who \nmakes the decisions that these killers be turned loose on our streets?\n  I have come to the floor today only to ask the question: Who makes \nthe decision to say to a Federal judge you may want this person in a \nFederal prison out of society for life, but we have decided \ndifferently. We will stick him back in Lorton and when his mother dies, \nhe can go to the wake.\n  Who makes that decision? Who is going to be held accountable for \nthis, because this is the same kind of staggering incompetence that led \nto this person's release in the first place, that led to this person \nnot being apprehended when he failed a drug test while on parole. It is \nthe same staggering incompetence.\n  I am saying as one Member of the Senate that when we take a look at \nour obligations and I as an appropriator take a look at our obligations \nto the District of Columbia, I will insist that the mayor and others in \nthis system demonstrate to us that they have held people accountable \nfor this kind of behavior.\n  Too many innocent people die. I have had a piece of legislation in \nthe Senate--I have never been able to get it passed and I will never \nquit trying--that says if a unit of government, a city, a State, \ndecides they want to let killers out early, time off for good behavior; \nwe want to manage you in prison, so we will give you an inducement: If \nyou behave in prison we will give you time off. If you commit violent \ncrimes and murder, we will let you out early if you are good behind \nbars so you can walk the streets early and commit another crime.\n  What I have said is those units of government that decide to let \npeople convicted of violent crimes out early, if those people commit a \nviolent crime during a period when they would have still been serving \ntheir sentence in prison, should be held responsible to the victims and \nthe victims' families. Yes, that means lawsuits, recompense.\n  There ought to be responsibility. Let's find those who are letting \nthese folks out of prison and say to them: You be responsible. If you \nwant to let them out early, then you bear the consequences.\n  Am I upset by reading this story this morning? Yes, I am. Again, I \ndid not know this young woman, but I have spoken about her often, and \nmany others have, I believe, watched this case with bewilderment, \nwondering who on Earth could be in charge of a system that is so \nfundamentally incompetent, a system that, in my judgment, ultimately \nallowed this person to be free on the streets to kill this young woman, \na system that now can't even comply with a simple order by a Federal \njudge that this person ought to be in Federal prison forever, never \nagain to be released on the streets in this country.\n  People of this country deserve better and expect better. Those of us \nin the Congress who have some capability of applying some pressure to \nthe people of the District of Columbia to remedy these problems have an \nobligation, it seems to me, to use that leverage to force that to \nhappen.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5463-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       Y2K ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, I am going to offer an amendment with \nSenator Kennedy. We will be joined by other Senators as well. The \noperative language of this amendment, to give it some context, calls \nupon the States to ``address juvenile delinquency prevention efforts \nand system improvement efforts designed to reduce, without establishing \nor requiring numerical standards or quotas''--we make that explicit; \nnobody is talking about any quotas--``the disproportionate number of \njuvenile members of racial minority groups who come into contact with \nthe juvenile justice system.''\n  With some charts and with some numbers, I will be able to talk about \nthis amendment, as will other Senators. I want, for the record, to make \nit clear that since we are in a debate about whether or not we are \nready to proceed, I am on the floor with an amendment. I am ready to \ngo.\n  This particular amendment says that in our past juvenile justice \nlegislation, most recently an amendment that was adopted by the Senate \nand the House in 1993, we said to States, including my own State of \nMinnesota: You have a situation where you have kids, young people, \nminorities incarcerated all out of proportion to the percentage of the \npopulation in your State. So that if you have, let's say, a 7 or 8 or \n10 percent minority population but, in your juvenile justice system or \ncorrectional facilities, close to 40 or 50 percent of the kids \nincarcerated are kids of color, what we said back in 1993, based upon \nsome very good work by some very good people in this field was, States, \nplease take a look at your situation. Please collect the data. Please \nlook at the why of this and see what kind of strategies and programs \nyou can develop and implement to improve upon the situation. That is \nwhat this is all about.\n  For some reason in this bill that is before us, this language has \nbeen\n\n[[Page S5464]]\n\ndropped. There are some 40 States that are working on this. There are \nsome States that are doing a very good job, but as a Senator, I am not \nabout to let the Senate turn the clock back. I am not about to let us, \nall of a sudden, say that we no longer are interested in calling upon \nStates to deal with this problem of disproportionate minority \nconfinement. I do not think we should do so. We cannot pass quotas. We \nnever should. We cannot tell States how many kids should be \nincarcerated, for what crimes and all the rest.\n  What we can say is when you have disproportionate minority \nconfinement, when you have a situation where all too many times kids of \ncolor are given much stiffer sentences for having committed the same \noffenses as white kids, we want to know what is going on.\n  What this legislation does--and it purports to be juvenile justice \nlegislation--is take the justice out. It takes the justice out. The \njustice would be to make sure there is no discrimination. The justice \nwould be to make sure there is fairness. The justice would be to make \nsure there is justice.\n  The reason I mention this is that not only do the kids of color all \ntoo often find themselves way out of proportion to their numbers in the \nState to be incarcerated but also to wind up in adult facilities. \nMoreover, these corrections facilities, if you want to call them \ncorrections facilities, all too often become the gateway to kids then \nbeing imprisoned in adult life.\n  It is astounding, but in 1999, going into a new century, one-third of \nall African American men, I think ages 20 to 26, are either in prison \nor on parole or they are waiting to be sentenced.\n  I did not make an argument here on the floor of the Senate that we \nshould not hold all citizens, regardless of color of skin, accountable \nfor crimes committed. That is not my argument. But my argument is, when \nwe have some concern about possible discrimination, then let's at least \nbe willing to study the problem.\n  I see my colleague coming in. I want to, when the Senator from Utah \ngets settled in, try to explain the situation. I will give my colleague \ntime to catch his breath.\n  I say to Senator Hatch, I did not want to ask unanimous consent to \noffer an amendment because I did not see anybody on the other side. I \nwas saying to the Chair that I am ready to go forward with an \namendment, this one dealing with disproportionate minority confinement, \nbecause I know you want to move the bill forward.\n  I have been in contact with Senator Kennedy, and if you are ready, I \nam certainly ready to debate it, and we will try to do it within a \nreasonable time limit.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I believe the majority leader \nis going to propound a unanimous consent request. I am hopeful the \nminority will agree to this request so we can move this forward. If I \ncould suggest the absence of a quorum so we can get this done, and as \nsoon as that is granted, if that is granted, then we will move on to \nhis unanimous consent and then try to work out the time for the \nSenator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me say to my colleague that I think I will \ncontinue to, rather than go into a quorum call, speak about the subject \nmatter.\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That might help. I want to make it crystal clear that \nI am ready to go forward with this amendment. I am not asking unanimous \nconsent that I be able to send this amendment to the desk because I \nguess until we have this agreement, then it most likely would be \nrejected. But I am ready for debate on this amendment.\n  Let me just say that when we get into the thick of this debate, I \nwant to just bring to the attention of Senators, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, the strong support, the strong passionate support \nfor this amendment on the part of the civil rights community in this \ncountry, broadly defined, on the part of children's organizations, \nbroadly defined, and on the part of lawyers and people who have been \ndown in the trenches working with kids for years.\n  This is an extremely important amendment that speaks to a fundamental \nflaw in this legislation. So, for the record, I am ready to offer this \namendment. I will wait for the majority leader to come out.\n  I ask my colleague from Utah, who is leaving, could I ask unanimous \nconsent that when we go to amendments on the juvenile justice bill, \nthat this be the first amendment up?\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator would withhold, right now we are trying to \nwork out a unanimous consent agreement. We are trying to work out some \nother matters, but I am certainly going to try to work with the Senator \non this. It is an important amendment, and we have to face it. So, if \nthe Senator will just work with me, I will try to get this so that it \nworks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5464-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, while we are waiting, let me just \nrepeat a little bit of what I said yesterday. I have been speaking with \nsome other Senators about this as well. While I understand that we have \na very crowded schedule, I do believe that the Senate should take some \ntime this week to discuss or to debate our military action in Kosovo.\n  I have spoken now for the last several weeks about this. I will not \nrepeat all that I have said. Next time I come to the floor with \nspecific proposals and ideas, I hope to be able to do that with other \nSenators. And I see my colleague from Washington is on the floor, so I \nam going to yield in about 30 seconds, if I can. But quite apart from \nwhat specific proposals I want to make as a Senator about where we are \nand where I believe we must go as a nation, I want to make a larger \npoint right now, which is I believe the Senate ought to be debating \nthis question. I believe we should have full discussion and full \ndebate.\n  One thing I am certain of--and I mentioned this yesterday--when we \nvoted on authorizing airstrikes, I asked my colleague, Senator Biden, \nwhat is the purpose? I read yesterday from the Record; and in the \nRecord it was stated hopefully to be able to stop the slaughter, \nhopefully to be able to get Milosevic to the bargaining table, and to \ndegrade the military force.\n  I think in light of the last 8 weeks and what has happened, in many \nways the objectives have changed. The objectives have changed. The \nbombing is more than just degrading the military force. It has a \ndifferent set of goals.\n  I am not even right now going to argue about the pluses and the \nminuses of all that. I think it is irresponsible for the Senate not to \ntake up this question and not to have positive--not hateful, not \ndemagogic--really thoughtful, substantive discussion and debate.\n  I know we have other business right now, but I am going to come back \nvery soon and try to push this question much harder.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5464-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5464-S5465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BOMBING OF THE CHINESE EMBASSY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is focused on many important \nissues this week, including youth violence, the important Y2K issue, \nemergency appropriations for our Nation's farmers, victims of Hurricane \nMitch, and funding NATO's efforts in the Balkans. These are all very \ntimely and important debates, and I look forward to joining my \ncolleagues in discussing these important issues.\n  For a moment, though, I would really like to focus the Senate on the \nrecent accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and on the \nU.S.-China relationship.\n  The bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade cannot be trivialized. \nAs President Clinton has repeatedly expressed, the U.S. and NATO \naccepts full responsibility for this terrible mistake. We all extend \nour apologies to the Chinese people and the families of those who were \nkilled and injured.\n  I am prepared to accept that this unfortunate accident caused a lot \nof anger among the Chinese Government and the Chinese people. That is \nto be expected. Certainly our country would be outraged and saddened if \nour embassy had been bombed under such circumstances.\n\n[[Page S5465]]\n\n  But our regret and apologies to the Chinese people do not diminish \nthe fact that we cannot accept the deliberate harassment of U.S. \ncitizens and destruction of U.S. property in China. The reports from \nChina--the television images of our embassy targeted by orchestrated \nmobs--troubled me a great deal.\n  Americans are dismayed at the growing animosity of the Chinese people \ntowards the United States. For the U.S.-China relationship to succeed, \nboth countries must take strides to ensure that the presentation of the \nrelationship is balanced and fair. Clearly, this did not happen in the \ndays before or after the tragic embassy bombing.\n  I am heartened that things do seem to have calmed down throughout \nChina. It is encouraging that President Clinton and President Jiang \nhave spoken and resumed high-level discussions over the bombing and \nother important U.S.-China issues.\n  Some of my colleagues have mentioned the phenomenal work of our \nAmbassador in China, Jim Sasser, who is our former Senate colleague and \na close friend. He has served our country with great honor. I commend \nhim and all of our embassy and consulate officers who are serving in \nChina.\n  Ambassador Sasser has given us great insight as he addressed the \ntragic bombing of the Chinese Embassy and the demonstrations and \nviolence that followed in Beijing and other Chinese cities.\n  Let me share a few of Ambassador Sasser's comments with my colleagues \nas I do believe they serve as a reminder that the U.S.-China \nrelationship is, in my opinion, one of our most difficult and most \nimportant relationships.\n  Ambassador Sasser said,\n\n       When all the emotion has drained out of this terrible \n     tragedy, then wiser heads in both China and the United States \n     are going to realize it's in both countries' interest to try \n     and resume constructive ties. . . . When we are all through \n     grieving over this very tragic event that occurred, the \n     United States will still be the economic superpower in the \n     world and China will still be the most populous nation in the \n     world and an emerging power in this region.\n\n  Once again, our former colleague has offered wise counsel to the \nSenate that will be very important to future China debates.\n  The unfortunate Embassy bombing should not be used by those in China \nas a justification for severing or postponing ties with the U.S. Nor \nshould China think that this incident will lessen America's resolve as \nwe address the issues of human rights, weapons proliferation, or the \nissues related to espionage targeted at U.S. nuclear facilities.\n  One of my hometown papers offered the following in an editorial last \nweek, the editorial reads, ``China is furious and rightly so. The test, \nhowever, is whether China plays the incident like the country it wants \nto be, a world leader that sees events and relationships in a larger \ncontext.'' I completely agree and I believe that many in Congress will \njudge China's ability to play a larger role on the international scene \nby her handling of this temporary crisis in the relationship with the \nU.S.\n  The United States, and particularly the Congress, must also \ndemonstrate our commitment to responsible global leadership. We should \nbe cautious as last week's unfortunate events enter the contentious \npolitical debates over U.S.-China relations. I continue to believe a \nmature and stable relationship with China is in our national interest. \nIt is not a goal we should be prepared to abandon. A mature and stable \nrelationship is certainly in the best interest of the American and \nChinese people. Though progress toward this goal has been hampered by \nthe events of this last week, it is still a goal we should strive for. \nWe must continue our dialogue with China.\n  China should expect continued U.S. interest and in fact, vigilance, \non the variety of issues important to the U.S. government and the \nAmerican people. There will not be widespread concessions granted by \nthe United States. The Embassy bombing was a tragic mistake, not a \npropaganda tool to be deployed at the bargaining table.\n  Consistent with admitting the mistake and accepting responsibility, \nthe United States and NATO should be prepared to enter into talks with \nChina about appropriate compensation for individual and government \nlosses. This is not unprecedented. In the late 1980's, Iraq paid \ncompensation to the families of U.S. sailors killed in the accidental \nbombing of the U.S.S. Stark during the Iran-Iraq war. Following the \ndowning of an Iranian passenger plane, the United States offered to \ncompensate the victims families. And the U.S. is now in the midst of \npaying compensation for property damage and to the victims' families \nfor last year's cable car accident in Italy.\n  The U.S. and China both stand to gain by closer relations. China has \nbecome one of our largest trading partners, creating high-wage jobs for \nthousands of American families and opening markets for American \nbusinesses that depend on overseas trade. While trade is the foundation \nof the U.S.-China relationship, my home state of Washington's \nrelationship with China clearly illustrates the promise of broader ties \nbetween Americans and the Chinese people. Washington's many cultural, \neducational and commercial ties are fostering dramatic change in China; \nchange led by and on behalf of the Chinese people.\n  With the recent visit to the United States by Chinese Premier Zhu \nRongi and the ongoing negotiations between our two governments, the \nU.S. and China are poised to reach a truly historic agreement, paving \nthe way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization this year. \nI support China's entry into the WTO on commercially viable terms and I \nencourage the United States Trade Representative and her Chinese \ncounterparts to resume negotiations at the earliest opportunity.\n  Because of the importance of the U.S.-China relationship, I believe a \nhigh-level U.S. delegation to China, headed by Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Cohen, is warranted as soon as possible. I realize the \ndifficulties of sending the Secretary of Defense half way around the \nworld while the U.S. is prosecuting military action in the Balkans. But \nthe U.S.-China relationship is so important, and we have been \nstruggling with so many difficult issues within the context of that \nrelationship, that I believe the maximum effort must be made to provide \nthe Chinese leadership with a full and complete understanding of the \naccidental bombing of their embassy. I know that Secretary Cohen is \nwell respected by the Chinese, and a trip by the Secretary to China \nwould have the dual purpose of stressing to the Chinese the great \nimportance we place on having a mature and stable relationship and \nunderscoring the accidental nature of the Embassy bombing.\n  Much progress has been made on the U.S.-China relationship in recent \nyears. The Zhu Rongi visit was important. This followed two \nPresidential Summits in Washington and Beijing. It is my hope that the \nrecent tragic events do not derail the progress made toward building a \nstrong and comprehensive U.S.-China relationship, based on trust and \nmutual understanding. The relationship can only exist if both \ngovernments and both peoples can deal with each other honestly and \nforthrightly. Now is the time to address the issues standing in the way \nof accomplishing this. Now is the time to move forward.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We are on the verge of finishing our work \non this much-needed legislation, and it would have been, in my opinion, \na grotesque waste of time and effort to simply throw that away in some \nartificial rush to proceed to the Y2K bill. Despite my vote, I look \nforward to having the opportunity to turn our attention to the Y2K \nlitigation problem as soon as we have finished our work on the issue of \nyouth crime and violence.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday, in the New York Times, William \nSafire had an essay called ``Cut the Apologies.'' I am shortly going to \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. It perhaps says \nsome things beyond what I might, but I am concerned. I have watched \nwhat has happened and the reactions of China to the accidental bombing \nof their Embassy in Belgrade. I hold no brief for the totally \nnegligent--I might even say stupid--mistake made in the bombing of that \nEmbassy. It is as inexcusable and unexplainable as the maps that \nbrought about the death of the people in the cable car in northern \nItaly.\n  Having said that, however, for the Chinese, who will not allow any \nkind of demonstrations--and haven't since Tiananmen Square--criticizing \ntheir own government, to whip people into a frenzy and let them go and \ndestroy much of our Embassy and the British Embassy in Beijing, and to \nsay how shocked they are that this is going on, and that we have done \nthat, demanding all kinds of apologies, frankly, is irresponsible and \nunimaginable. I can't accept it. I don't know how many people would.\n  If the Chinese think that by doing this somehow we are now going to \njump in and let them join the WTO and everything else, that is a sad \nmistake. Their conduct is incomprehensible. We have apologized for \nbombing the Embassy, which we would expect somebody to do with a \nsimilar mistake damaging ours. This is a war going on, and things \nhappen, as General Schwarzkopf said, in the fog of war.\n  China is not the one to lecture the world on free and open \ndemonstrations. China is not the one to lecture us on how we should \nconduct our economy. China has a great deal to explain on everything \nfrom their attempt to steal our secrets, spying on our country, and \nhuman rights violations in their own country and their own repression.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Safire's column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 17, 1999]\n\n                           Cut the Apologies\n\n                          (By William Safire)\n\n       Washington.--After a week of whipping up hatred of \n     Americans by accusing us of deliberately murdering Chinese \n     journalists in Belgrade, President Jiang Zemin Deigned to \n     accept a call from The Great Apologizer.\n       For the fifth time, President Clinton apologized, expressed \n     regrets, sent condolences, kowtowed and groveled, begging to \n     be believed that we did not bomb China's embassy on purpose.\n       But it is America that is owed an apology. After an \n     accident of war, we have been falsely accused of killing \n     Chinese with malice aforethought. That is a great insult, \n     compounded by the calculated trashing of our embassy by a \n     bused-in mob encouraged by police.\n       The truth is that Beijing's leaders, worried about \n     demonstrations on the 10th anniversary next month of the \n     Tiananmen massacre, are milking this mistake for all it is \n     worth.\n       By lying about our intent and suppressing coverage of our \n     prompt admission of error, the nervous rulers are diverting \n     their people's anger toward us and away from themselves.\n       By demanding we investigate the accident, they seek to \n     water down the current Congressional investigations of their \n     nuclear spying--a series of penetrations of our laboratories \n     and political campaigns that was no accident.\n       By making Clinton beg forgiveness, they are able to cancel \n     human rights talks while extracting new trade concessions. \n     The deal: they will accept Clinton's apologies when he caves \n     in on their application to the World Trade Organizations.\n       No wonder that no reputable diplomat would accept the \n     President's pleas to replace our fed-up ambassador in \n     Beijing. Clinton is now trying to appoint an admiral whose \n     amiable association with the Chinese military and U.S. arms \n     contractors will be closely examined by the Senate.\n       Though Clinton is softer than ever on China, he's taken a \n     hard line in resisting Congress's investigations into \n     Beijing's penetration of our nuclear labs and our political \n     process. His latest trick: the improper use of documents \n     submitted for intelligence declassification to prepare \n     advance refutations of evidence of security lapses.\n       The White House has delayed for four months the three-\n     volume report on security laxity by the House select \n     committee headed by Representative Chris Cox. Clinton \n     spinners are already distributing a packet of reprints of \n     derogations by offended scientists, China-defenders and \n     favorite journalists.\n       Cox has used the ``clearance'' delay to rewrite the turgid \n     prose and to enliven the report with photographs and diagrams \n     showing what missiles and satellites were stolen; that might \n     even awaken television interest.\n       The Senate Intelligence Committee, headed by Richard Shelby \n     and Robert Kerrey, is not about to hold still for the abuse \n     of clearance. After it submitted one of its reports on \n     nuclear lab laxity for review to protect intelligence \n     sources, it learned of a refutation of that bipartisan report \n     in work by the National security Council response machine.\n       The White House was told that the submission of documents \n     was for security clearance only. It was not to be used for \n     (a) advance policy review so that ``rapid response'' would \n     occur in the same news cycle as the reports' release, or for \n     (b) leakage of portions to the press for ``inoculation'' to \n     later reduce its impact as ``old news.''\n       The intelligence business is not the publicity business. \n     National security reports are not to be equated with the \n     Starr report about hanky-panky. The Shelby committee made \n     plain to the Berger Rapid-Apology Center that if this \n     undermining of inter-branch comity did not stop forthwith, \n     ``we're going to zero out the N.S.C. staff budget.'' (By \n     withholding some $15 million, Congress could force the \n     spinners onto the Department of Defense payroll or cause \n     agonizing layoffs in the White House basement).\n       In both House and Senate, bipartisan committees are \n     discovering serious intelligence weaknesses: too little \n     analysis of too much collection. ``If there's a flare-up in \n     Iraq, North Korea or the Andes,'' worries an investigator, \n     ``we could not handle it and Kosovo, too.''\n       The most troubling breakdown is in counterespionage. The \n     F.B.I. and C.I.A., which are not blameless, are telling \n     Congress the weakest link is the Department of Justice. What \n     began as corrupt political protection became dangerous \n     national security laxity. Who will apologize for that?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Let me modify my request to make it no \nlater than 4 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. The five amendments that are going to come up in this \norder, and I hope people will not use their 5 minutes, are: the Allard \namendment on school memorials; the Kohl-Hatch amendment on safety \ntrigger locks; the Hatch-Feinstein amendment on gangs; the Byrd \namendment on interstate transportation of intoxicating liquor; and the \nFeinstein amendment to modify the laws pertaining to interstate \nshipment of liquor.\n  Senator Kohl, why don't we begin with the Kohl-Hatch amendment and we \nwill use our 5 minutes.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 352\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, our amendment is a reasonable, bipartisan \nmeasure that will help protect children from the countless accidental \ndeaths, suicides and violent crimes that result from improperly stored \nhandguns. Simply put, it would require that every handgun be sold with \na child safety device, but leaves the decision about whether to use a \nsafety device to individual gun owners. Here's why we believe you \nshould support it.\n  First, we've added a section that extends limited liability \nprotection to gun owners who lock up their handguns properly. This \nliability protection is very narrow--it does not extend any immunity to \nmanufacturers, and it does not apply if the gun owner acted \nnegligently. We believe that this provision actually improves the bill \nby creating incentives to use child safety locks.\n  Second, the American people overwhelmingly support it. According to a \nrecent Newsweek poll, 85 percent of the American public backs \nlegislation requiring the sale of child safety locks with new handguns.\n  Third, despite the pledges of some of the largest manufacturers to \nsell safety locks with every handgun, most manufacturers are still not \nincluding safety locks. In fact, the Los Angeles Times reported, ``only \na handful of the arms makers who eventually signed on are complying, \naccording to industry insiders.''\n  Fourth, and most importantly, child safety locks will help save \nlives. Each year, nearly 500 children and teenagers are killed in gun-\nrelated accidents, thousands are injured, and approximately 1,500 \nchildren and teenagers commit suicide with guns. Perhaps as disturbing, \nnearly 7,000 violent crimes each year are committed by juveniles using \nguns they found in their own homes.\n  Just last weekend, a 7-year-old Milwaukee boy named Brian Welch \nkilled himself accidentally with a gun he found in his father's drawer. \nWhat do we say to Brian's family, if we cannot takes steps as \nreasonable as this one?\n  You know, Mr. President, in the past few weeks there's been a lot of \ndiscussion about Republicans and ``gun control.'' Hardly a talk show \ngoes by without a pundit opining on whether it's a true epiphany or a \n``poll-driven ploy.'' Well, cynics can believe whatever they want. But \nmy sense is that, in the wake of Littleton, both sides have grown up a \nbit: Democrats in acknowledging that culture has something to do with \njuvenile violence today; and Republicans in endorsing reasonable \nmeasures to take handguns out of the hands of kids who shouldn't have \nthem.\n  So I applaud all of those on both sides of the aisle who have \n``converted'' on safety locks. I appreciate those who have been with us \nfrom the beginning, including our cosponsor Senator Chafee, who has \nbeen so resolute in support of reasonable gun control measures. And I \ncredit Chairman Hatch, Senator Leahy, and Senator Craig for their work \nin making this a better amendment. And one that we all believe will \nshortly become law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this child safety device amendment will, \nfirst, provide qualified immunity to law-abiding gun owners who use a \ntrigger lock or gun storage device, and two, it will require the sale \nof a child safety device lock or gun storage device with the sale of \nevery handgun sold by a licensee.\n  In the past week it has been clear that some on the other side of the \naisle believe that playing politics is more important than taking \naction. Some--but not all. So I am pleased to say that Senators Kohl, \nChafee, and I have joined forces to produce a compromise on child \nsafety locks that lays aside partisan rhetoric and demonstrates the \npositive steps that can result from putting aside such rhetoric and \nfocusing on protecting our children.\n  Under the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment, for the first time every \nhandgun purchased from a manufacturer, importer, or licensed dealer \nwill have to be sold with a storage or child safety lock device.\n  This amendment will not change the fundamental principle that \ngovernmental action cannot be used to micromanage specific methods of \nparental responsibility. We do not expect parents to let their small \nchildren drive a car or play with matches, and we do not expect them to \npermit their children to have unsupervised access to firearms. This \namendment will provide parents with a tool to help prevent such access.\n  Last year the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to an amendment that \nfunded gun safety education by State and local entities. It also \nrequired gun dealers to stock safety devices. These efforts encouraged \npeople to lock up their guns and to act safely and responsibly. This \namendment is another step in enhancing this successful effort.\n  I should add that no child safety lock or gun safe will ever make our \nsociety safe from gun violence if criminals who\n\n[[Page S5468]]\n\nuse firearms are not aggressively prosecuted and punished. No safety \ndevice will stop a felon, but jail will. So once again I call upon the \nAttorney General to start prosecuting criminals who use guns. Only then \nwill we truly be able to create a safer environment for our children.\n  This amendment gives law-abiding gun owners the peace of mind of \nknowing their children are protected. Further, it will give law-abiding \ngun owners qualified immunity from civil suit if they use the child \nsafety device or child safety lock.\n  This amendment is a good idea for gun owners and a good idea for \nchildren. I am pleased we have bipartisan support in the Senate for \nthis amendment. I hope it will be agreed to.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Kohl in \nsupport of the commonsense child safety lock amendment. The amendment \nwe had offered last Friday addresses a shameful--and uniquely \nAmerican--tragedy: that of children finding handguns, and accidentally \ncausing great harm to themselves or others.\n  Most of these terrible shootings occur in the home, when a curious \nyoungster finds a parent's loaded handgun in the closet, under the \ncouch cushions, or in a bedside table drawer. The child then shoots a \nsibling, a friend, or him- or herself. And all too often the result is \ndeath, or permanent injury.\n  One of the most tragic examples of children accidentally shooting \nother children occurred last year in Greensboro, North Carolina. A 4-\nyear-old who was attending the sixth birthday party of a friend, found \na loaded gun in a purse in the house where the party was taking place. \nThe 4-your-old shot and killed the 6-year-old.\n  The National Center for Health Statistics tells us that every day in \nAmerica 13 children are shot and killed, and every day at least one of \nthose deaths is accidental. Every year in America, approximately 1,500 \nchildren and teens commit suicide with guns. The Bureau of Alcohol, \nTobacco and Firearms estimates that about 7,000 violent crimes are \ncommitted by juveniles each year with guns they found in their own \nhomes. Today, in few other countries are children so affected by gun \nviolence, accidental or otherwise: CDC tells us that the rate of death \namong children under age 15 from guns in this country is 12 times that \nof the other 26 major industrialized nations combined.\n  A 1995 study by the Journal of the American Medical Association found \nthat there is a gun in approximately half of all U.S. households. \nAnother 1995 study by the SAFE KIDS Campaign found that 59 percent of \nparents with guns admitted that they don't lock-up their guns.\n  The statistics about children who are harmed accidentally by handguns \nare appalling. They are a national shame. And to grieving parents, \nsiblings, and friends, they are not just statistics. For them, the loss \nor serious injury of a child is absolutely devastating. Yet these \naccidents are wholly preventable.\n  That is why we are taking action today. The child safety lock \namendment, No. 352, that we are proposing would require that all future \nsales of handguns be accompanied by a locking device--a mechanism that \nprevents the guns from being discharged without a key or combination \nlock.\n  Earlier in the debate on S. 254, the Senate voted overwhelmingly to \napprove an amendment offered by Senators Hatch and Leahy that requires \ninternet services providers to give parents a tool to filter violent \nmaterial their children could be exposed to on the internet. It was an \namendment to provide parents with a tool to help keep their children \nsafe. The amendment Senator Kohl and I are offering with Senator Hatch \nis identical in its purpose. It is meant to provide parents with a \ntool--the trigger lock for a handgun--to keep their children safe.\n  I appreciate the support of the Judiciary Committee chairman and urge \nmy colleagues to show the same level of support for this amendment as \nthey showed for the internet filtering amendment last week.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into a \ncolloquy with the Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl, regarding his \nSafe Handgun Storage and Child Handgun Safety Amendment (#352) to S. \n254, the juvenile crime bill.\n  The amendment makes it unlawful for any licensed manufacturer, \nimporter or dealer to sell, deliver or transfer any handgun to any \nperson (other than under certain exceptions) unless the transferee is \nprovided with a secure gun storage or safety device. I am interested in \nclarifying the intent of the amendment with regard to gun safety \ndevices.\n  Senator Kohl, as you know, a company in my home state of Arizona has \ndeveloped a handgun safety device called Saf-T-Hammer. It is a \nremovable hammer which can be incorporated into new guns or retrofit \nmost handguns now in circulation. When the top of the hammer is \nremoved, the gun cannot be fired. Parents can take off the hammerhead \nand carry it with them when they leave home, secure in the knowledge \nthat no unauthorized user--including children--will be able to fire the \ngun.\n  Because Saf-T-Hammer is a removable safety device, is it your intent, \nSenator Kohl, that Saf-T-Hammer would still qualify as a gun safety \ndevice for purposes of your amendment?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \nquestion. I am indeed familiar with Saf-T-Hammer and share the \nSenator's enthusiasm for the promise of handgun safety that this device \noffers. I commend the intent of the developers of the device to \nsafeguard the lives of innocent children and others who might otherwise \nbe killed or injured by handguns.\n  I can assure the Senator from Arizona that it is indeed the intention \nof the amendment that devices such as Saf-T-Hammer, an easily removable \nhammer, are included within the purview of the amendment. I also \nbelieve that on its face the definition of a safety device in 18 U.S.C. \n921(34) would include a device such as Saf-T-Hammer. Accordingly, when \na handgun is manufactured or retrofitted with Saf-T-Hammer, it would \nbe, under the terms of the amendment, exempt from the amendment's \nprohibitions on transfer. Handguns so equipped with a Saf-T-Hammer may \nbe freely transferred under the amendment.\n  I hope this answers your question and clarifies the legislative \nintent of the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for his \ntime and clarification of the amendment regarding this important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin and distinguished Senator from Utah have worked in good faith \non this amendment. My one concern is that the immunity provision does \nnot define the term ``person,'' so it could include not only individual \ngun owners but also dealers, manufacturers, possibly even governments. \nI mention that not to in any way deter this from being agreed to, but I \nsay to the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, we will all be on the conference if this bill \npasses. That provision I suggest we may want to define more narrowly in \na conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on the amendment has expired.\n  The Senate will move to the next amendment.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 351\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I understand I have 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will be talking about amendment No. 351, which is the \nAllard amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator will have 2\\1/2\\ minutes and the other side \nwill have 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I stand corrected. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Basically, there are two parts to this amendment. There is a part \nwhich we refer to as the ``findings'' part, and another part which \ndeals with the actual statutory change.\n  The first part, in findings, just says the local school district, \nworking with the school board and the administration and the parents \nand the students\n\n[[Page S5469]]\n\nin a school, if they decide to hold a memorial service or to erect a \nmemorial, if they reach a local consensus, there is a finding by the \nSenate and by the Congress that it is OK for them to go ahead and do \nthat. It is just a finding. It is not a change in law.\n  There is a second part that does deal with statutory changes where \nthere is a change in law, and that says if there happens to be a \nlawsuit based on the first amendment or one of the other amendments, \nthen on the first amendment it says the school district would pay for \nits own legal expenses and then the litigants would then pay for their \nown; whoever is suing would pay for their own legal expenses.\n  The second part of it says the U.S. Attorney General may defend the \nschool district in the lawsuit. It is a very straightforward amendment.\n  The parents of Cassie Bernall recently contacted me about the \ndifficulty they have encountered in establishing a memorial for their \ndaughter. This is in relation to the Columbine High School tragedy. To \nquote Cassie's father:\n\n       Our Cassie was the young woman who boldly answered to a \n     gunman ``yes'' when he asked if she believed in God, \n     prompting him to pull the trigger. Cassie's response did not \n     surprise us. . . . It was from her strong faith in [Jesus \n     Christ] and His promise of eternal life that she was \n     empowered to make her stand.\n       My wife . . . and I both believe any Columbine incident \n     memorial should memorialize each individual in a personal \n     way. Everyone knows . . . that Cassie was a very strong \n     Christian. To leave this facet of her persona out would be to \n     mis-memorialize her and others.\n\n  Mr. and Mrs. Bernall strongly support the amendment that I am \nproposing today because they have experienced already a threat to their \nfirst amendment rights.\n  I urge the Senate to vote yes for the Allard amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, reclaiming my time, I have been informed that I have \nanother 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am sorry, I misstated.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I misunderstood.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will be glad to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I commend Senator Allard for offering this \namendment that conveys the Senate's heartfelt sympathy to the families \nand friends of all school shootings.\n  His amendment allows the families and friends of all victims of \nshootings to grieve and honor the victims at a memorial service held on \nschool grounds. This amendment tells these families and friends that \nthe Senate believes they have a right to congregate at a memorial \nservice on school grounds to mourn the deaths of students and faculty.\n  Further, this amendment states that the Senate believes it is \nconstitutional for these memorial services to include spiritual \naspects, including the reading of prayers and scripture and the \nperformance of religious music.\n  This amendment also states that the Senate believes that an \nappropriate and constitutional permanent memorial can be erected on \nschool grounds, a part of which can include religious symbols, motifs, \nor sayings.\n  This amendment will, hopefully, ease some of the pain associated with \npreparing memorial services for loved ones killed in any act of school \nviolence. I thank the Senator from Colorado for offering this amendment \nand commend him for it.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I cannot think of anything that a parent, a \ncommunity, or a family would want to do more than to join in their \nexpressions of grief if a disaster struck.\n  In my family, a disaster like Columbine--in fact, it is almost \nimpossible to say how one would even get through it. I suspect we would \ngather as a family; we would gather with our community; we would go to \nour church. Expressions are made in schools, of course.\n  I do not question the concerns of the distinguished author of this \namendment, which are heartfelt. I know him as a good and honest man. I \nworry, though, that we set a precedent involving our first amendment.\n  Our Constitution says everyone has equal access to the courts to \nassert constitutional rights. This amendment can be read to promote one \nconstitutional viewpoint while depriving those who hold the opposing \nviewpoint of their day in court.\n  If this becomes law, those who complain of free exercise clause \nviolations by public authorities that exclude religious observances \nfrom public spaces could do so with the benefit of additional fee-\nshifting, whereas those who make the opposite claim--that the \nestablishment clause has been violated--will be disadvantaged.\n  The first amendment's religion clauses are meant to ensure that the \nGovernment is neutral in matters of religion. It says you can practice \nany religion you want or none if you want, but the Government will \nremain neutral, thus providing the diversity in this Nation of so many \nreligions, a diversity which has greatly promoted our democracy.\n  This legislation, by offering the Attorney General's assistance to \nthose who take one viewpoint, while depriving those who take the \nopposite viewpoint of normal civil rights law remedies, violates this \nmost basic principle of neutrality.\n  The congressional finding paints with far too broad a brush. It could \nencompass a variety of activities that violate the first amendment.\n  While I joined in my own State in gatherings to express condolences \nto those of the tragedy, I have been in memorial services, I have been \nin churches and in synagogues where we have prayed for those who have \nbeen the victims of tragedies. We have done it knowing that was an \nappropriate place to do it. I have gathered with families in public \ngatherings where we have expressed, within the context we do in a \npublic setting, our feelings, and that is appropriate.\n  As I said, I do not know how the people, not only Columbine but so \nmany communities which have been visited with tragedy, can even get \nthrough the tragedy. I do not know how a parent in these tragedies \nagain, without fear, can ever send their child off to school.\n  Let us not, in our unified intent within this body to show our \nsympathy, in any way diminish the protections of our first amendment. \nIt is too important to all of us.\n  I have great respect for the sponsor of this amendment. I have great \nrespect for his honesty and his feelings of sympathy. I have joined \nwith other Senators on the floor of the Senate in expressing my \nsympathy. I worry this is overly broadly against the first amendment, \nand because of that, I have to oppose it. I am perfectly willing to \nyield back time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have great sympathy for the motives and \nobjectives of the Senator from Colorado in offering this amendment. We \nall want to support the appropriate service and memorial for victims of \nsuch tragic events. However, I did not support the Allard amendment \nbecause, in my judgement, it too broadly states a view regarding \nconstitutionality under the First Amendment and arbitrarily singles out \nmemorials for victims who are slain on the campus of a public school, \nexcluding memorial services involving victims of slayings during a \nrobbery or other event not on the school's campus or victims of a \ntragic accident, for example. Also, I do not believe that the Senate \nshould take the step of authorizing the Attorney General to become \ninvolved in litigation on one side or the other.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I have a question to ask of the chairman. \nIs he ready for the yeas and nays on this amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are going to vote in a stacked sequence.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I will wait for that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Why don't we ask for the yeas and nays. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the yeas and nays be ordered on all five amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to it being in order to \norder the yeas and nays? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n[[Page S5470]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 353\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the amendment which I offered with the \nSenator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, is a much refined version of \nlegislation we offered last Congress to address the serious and \ntroubling issues of interstate and juvenile gangs.\n  I commend Senator Feinstein for her hard work and dedication to this \nissue.\n  Our amendment includes improvements to the current Federal gangs \nstatute, to cover conduct such as alien smuggling, money laundering, \nand high-value burglary, to the predicate offenses under the penalty \nenhancement for engaging in gang-related crimes, and enhances penalties \nfor such crimes.\n  It criminalizes recruiting persons into a gang, with tough penalties, \nincluding a 4-year mandatory minimum if the person recruited is a \nminor.\n  It amends the Travel Act, of 1952 18 U.S.C., to include typical gang \npredicate offenses.\n  It includes the James Guelff Body Armor Act, which provides penalty \nenhancements for the use of body armor in the commission of a Federal \ncrime. This provision also prohibits the purchase, possession or use of \nbody armor by anyone convicted of a violent felony, but provides an \naffirmative defense for bona fide business uses. However, our amendment \nplaces no duties or restrictions on the sellers of these legitimate \npersonal safety products. Our amendment also enhances the availability \nof body armor to law enforcement. It includes penalties for teaching, \neven over the Internet, how to make or use a bomb, with the knowledge \nor intent that the information will be used to commit a Federal crime.\n  Finally, our amendment enhances penalties under the Animal Enterprise \nTerrorism Act (18 U.S.C. 43) to address the growing problem of attacks \non businesses and research facilities, as well as establishes a \nclearinghouse to track such offenses. These crimes are increasingly \nbeing committed by some juvenile gangs, particularly in my State of \nUtah.\n  Gangs are an increasingly serious and interstate problem, affecting \nour crime rates and our youth. A 1997 survey of eighth graders in 11 \ncities found in 1997 that 9 percent were currently gang members, and \nthat 17 percent said they had belonged to a gang at some point in their \nlives. These gangs and there members are responsible for as many as 68 \npercent of all violent crimes in some cities.\n  My home state of Utah continues to have a serious gang problem. In \n1997, there were over 7,000 gang offenses reported to the police in \nUtah. Although we have seen some improvement from the unprecedented \nhigh levels of gang crime a couple of years ago, gang membership in the \nSalt Lake area has increased 209 percent since 1992. There are now \nabout 4,500 gang members in the Salt Lake City area. 770 of these, or \n17 percent, are juveniles.\n  During 1998, there were at least 99 drive by shootings in the Salt \nLake City area. Also, drug offenses, liquor offenses, and sexual \nassaults were all up significantly over the same period in 1997. And in \nthe first 2 months of 1999, there were 14 drive by shootings in the \nSalt Lake City area.\n  An emerging gang in Utah is the Straight Edge. These are juveniles \nwho embrace a strict code of no sex, drugs, alcohol or tobacco, and \nusually no meat or animal products. Normally, of course, these are \ntraits most parents would applaud. But these juveniles take these fine \nhabits to a dangerous extreme, frequently violently attacking those who \ndo not share their purist outlook.\n  There are 204 documented Straight Edgers in Salt Lake City, with an \naverage age of 19 years old. Like most gangs, they adopt distinctive \nclothing and tattoos to identify themselves. Although not all Straight \nEdgers engage in criminal activities, many have become very violent \nprone. They have engaged in coordinated attacks on college \nfraternities, and a murder outside the Federal Building in downtown \nSalt Lake City last Halloween night was Straight Edge related. This \ncrime, in which a 15-year-old youth named Bernardo Repreza occurred \nduring a gang-related fight against the Straight-Edgers. Three Straight \nEdge gang members, have been charged with the murder.\n\n  And these gangs are learning some of their tactics on the Internet, \nwhich is why our amendment includes a provision making illegal to teach \nanother how to make or use an explosive device intending or knowing \nthat the instructions will be used to commit a federal crime, has \npassed the Senate on at least three separate occasions. It is time for \nCongress to pass it and make the law.\n  Sites with detailed instructions on how to make a wide variety of \ndestructive devices have proliferated on the Internet. As many of my \ncolleagues know, these sites were a prominent part of the recent \ntragedy in Littleton, Colorado.\n  Let me give my colleagues an example of one of these sites. The self-\nstyled Animal Liberation Front has been linked to numerous bombings and \narson across the country, including several in my home State of Utah. \nPosted on their Internet site is the cyber-publication, The Final Nail \n#2. It is a detailed guide to terrorist activities. This chart shows \njust one example of the instructions to be found here--in this case, \ninstructions to build an electronically timed incendiary igniter--the \ntimer for a time bomb.\n  And how do the publishers intend that this information will be used? \nThe suggestion is clear from threats and warnings in the guide. One \npage in the site shows a picture of an industry spokeswoman, warning \nher to ``take our advice while you still have some time: quit your job \nand cash in your frequent flier points for a permanent vacation.'' Now, \non this chart, which comes from The Final Nail #2, we have redacted the \nspokeswoman's address and phone number to protect her privacy. The \npublishers weren't so considerate. And this is just the beginning. This \nsame document has a 59 page list of targets, complete with names and \naddresses from nearly every U.S. State and Canadian province.\n  Let there be no mistake--the publishers know what they're doing. For \ninstance, the instructions on how to make milk jug fire bombs come with \nthis caution: ``Arson is a big time felony so wear gloves and old \nclothes you can throw away throughout the entire process and be very \ncareful not to leave a single shred of evidence.''\n  It is unfortunate that people feel the need to disseminate \ninformation and instructions on bombmaking and explosives. Now perhaps \nwe can't stop people from putting out that information. But if they are \ndoing so with the intent that the information be used to commit a \nviolent federal crime--or if they know that the information will be \nused for that purpose, then this amendment will serve to hold such \npersons accountable.\n  Unfortunately, kids today have unfettered access to a universe of \nharmful material. By merely clicking a mouse, kids can access \npornography, violent video games, and even instructions for making \nbombs with ingredients that can be found in any household. Why someone \nfeels the need to put such harmful material on the Internet is beyond \nme--there certainly is no legitimate need for our kids to know how to \nmake a bomb. But if that person crosses the line to advocate the use of \nthat knowledge for violent criminal purposes, or gives it out knowing \nit will be used for such purposes, then the law needs to cover that \nconduct.\n  Mr. President, the Hatch-Feinstein Federal Gang Violence Act \nincorporated in this amendment is a modest but important in stemming \nthe spread of gangs and violence across the country and among our \njuveniles. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I am happy to yield to the distinguished Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I want \nhim to know it has been a great pleasure for me to be able to work with \nhim on these three issues, and now on the gang bill, for the past 3 \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I think the chairman has very accurately and \nadequately stated what these amendments do. I would like to just \nprovide a little bit of filler material with respect to the need. There \nare over 23,000 youth gangs in all 50 States in the United States. I \nthink it will come as no surprise for people to learn that California \nis the No. 1 gang State, with almost 5,000 different gangs, more than \nthree times as\n\n[[Page S5471]]\n\nmany as the next State. Overall, there are over 600,000 members of \ngangs. And they have increased tenfold since 1975.\n  This legislation is a direct result of the importuning of many in \nlocal law enforcement who have come to me and others in this body and \nsaid: Could the Federal Government give us a hand in fighting gangs?\n  In Los Angeles alone, over the past 16 years, 7,300 people were \nmurdered from gang warfare--more people than have been killed in all \nthe terrorist fighting in Northern Ireland.\n  Today, modern gangs are organized. Take, for one, the Bloods and \nCrips, which began in Los Angeles. They now have a presence in 119 \nAmerican cities, as you can see on this chart. Take, for instance, \nChicago's Gangster Disciples, which have expanded into 34 Midwest and \nSouthern cities, with a board of directors inside prison and a board of \ndirectors outside prison.\n  These gangs operate very often as modern Mafia-type enterprises. They \nmove across State lines. They move drugs. They practice a whole series \nof crimes. And they do so in a very organized way.\n  In Los Angeles alone, the 18th Street Gang now deals directly with \nMexican and Colombian drug cartels. They have expanded their operations \nto Oregon, Utah, El Salvador, Honduras and Mexico. And it goes on and \non and on; virtually every ethnic and racial group has some gang that \nis operating in the United States.\n  The chairman has accurately stated what this amendment would do. It \nincreases sentences for gang members who commit Federal crimes. It \nenhances the ability of Federal prosecutors to prosecute gangs. It \namends the Travel Act to include some offenses which gangs perpetrate. \nIt adds serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal \nAct. And it provides a 3-year mandatory minimum sentence to knowingly \ntransferring a firearm for use in a violent crime or drug trafficking \ncrime where the gun is transferred to a minor.\n  Let me move now to the second part of it. This has to do with bomb \nmaking on the Internet. In the Judiciary Committee not too long ago, I \nremember somebody presenting a manual called ``The Terrorist Handbook'' \nthat could be pulled up on the Internet. I went back and we downloaded \nit from the Internet.\n  What I saw really chilled me, because what I saw was accurate \ninformation on how to steal chemicals, how to break into chemistry \nlabs, what to buy in stores, and how to go home and make pipe bombs, \ntelephone bombs, letter bombs, and mailbox bombs. Virtually every use \nin the manual is illegal. And you have to ask, Why?\n\n  The youngsters in Colorado who perpetrated the crime indicated they \ngot the formula for the pipe bombs directly from the Internet. It well \ncould have been from this very volume I hold up today.\n  Since Littleton, CO, there has been a rash of these. Police arrested \nfive students in Brooklyn for possessing this manual that they found on \nthe Internet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent just for one \nadditional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will ask to print in the Record a list of counties \nand cities where we have had incidents directly following Littleton: \nSalt Lake; Cobb County in Georgia; Port Aransas, TX; Wichita Falls; \nWimberley, TX. More than 50 threats of bombs and other acts of violence \nhave occurred in the last few weeks since Littleton, CO.\n  This amendment essentially says it will become a Federal crime to \nteach or distribute information on how to make a bomb or other weapon \nof mass destruction if the individual intends the information be used \nto commit a Federal violent crime or knows that the recipient of the \ninformation intends to use it to commit a Federal violent crime.\n  The Justice Department has reviewed the legislation. We believe that \nit is constitutional. The Fourth Circuit has heard a case and has \neffectively declared the methodology herein as constitutional.\n  The final part of this bill is the James Guelff Body Armor Act. It \nspeeds body armor of 10,000 surplus pieces from the FBI and the DEA to \nlocal and State governments. It makes body armor more difficult to \nobtain by felons. And we are very hopeful this will be included.\n  So we have the gang amendments, we have the lawmaking amendment, and \nthe body armor.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the predecessor to this bill was \nintroduced in the last Congress, I raised a number of concerns about \nthe bill. I am glad to see that this amendment is much improved from \nthe Hatch-Feinstein gang bill in the last Congress.\n  This amendment also contains proposals that Senator DeWine and I have \nworked on together. For example, this amendment contains new procedures \nfor law enforcement to obtain clone pagers. These are pagers held by \nlaw enforcement that duplicate the numeric messages received by a drug \ndealer or other criminal. This is a useful tool for law enforcement and \nI have long worked to streamline the procedures for the FBI, the DEA \nand other law enforcement agencies to obtain legal authorization to use \nclone pagers.\n  For including this clone pager proposal in the amendment, along with \nthe other improvements made by the sponsors, they should be commended. \nI know they worked hard on this amendment.\n  I remain concerned about some of the penalties in this amendment. The \namendment calls for a new death penalty and new mandatory minimums that \nshould be revised in conference.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to see that an important \nprovision that is based on a bill I introduced earlier this year has \nbeen included in the pending legislation.\n  This provision would provide Federal matching grants to help our \nstate and local law enforcement officers acquire life saving bullet \nresistant equipment. This provision is based on S. 726, the Officer \nDale Claxton Bullet Resistant Police Protective Equipment Act of 1999. \nS. 726 is named in memory of Dale Claxton, a Cortez, Colorado, police \nofficer who was fatally shot through the windshield of his patrol car \nlast year. A bullet resistant windshield could have saved his life.\n  Unfortunately, incidents like this are far from isolated. All across \nour nation law enforcement officers, whether in hot pursuit, driving \nthrough dangerous neighborhoods, or pulled over on the side of the road \nbehind an automobile, are at risk of being shot through their \nwindshields. We must do what we can to prevent these kinds of tragedies \nas better, lighter and more affordable types of bullet resistant glass \nand other equipment become available.\n  While I served as a deputy sheriff in Sacramento County, California, \nI became personally aware of the inherent dangers law enforcement \nofficers encounter each day on the front lines. Now that I serve as a \nU.S. Senator here in Washington, DC, I believe we should do what we can \nto help our law enforcement officers protect themselves as they risk \ntheir lives while protecting the American people from violent \ncriminals.\n  One important way we can do this is to help them acquire bullet \nresistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held bullet \nresistant shields and other life saving bullet resistant equipment. \nThis assistance is especially crucial for small local jurisdictions \nthat often lack the funds needed to provide their officers with the \nlife saving bullet resistant equipment they need.\n  This Claxton bullet resistant equipment provision builds upon the \nsuccesses of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, which \nI introduced in the 105th Congress and the president signed into law \nlast June. This program provides matching grants to state and local law \nenforcement agencies to help them purchase body armor for their \nofficers. This provision builds upon this worthy program by expanding \nit to help them acquire additional types of bullet resistant equipment.\n  The central part of the Claxton provision authorizes a new $40 \nmillion matching grant program to help state, local, tribal and other \nsmall law enforcement agencies acquire bullet resistant equipment such \nas bullet resistant glass and armored panels for patrol cars, hand held \nbullet resistant shields and other life saving equipment.\n\n[[Page S5472]]\n\n  This matching grant program is authorized for fiscal years 2000 \nthrough 2002 and would be administered by the Bureau of Justice \nAssistance according to a formula that ensures fair distribution for \nall states, local communities, tribes and U.S. territories. To help \nensure that these matching grants get to the jurisdictions that need \nthem the most the bureau is directed to make at least half of the funds \navailable to those smaller jurisdictions whose budgets are the most \nfinancially constrained.\n  Another key part of the Claxton provision allocates $3 million over 3 \nyears to the Justice Department's National Institute of Justice (NIJ) \nto conduct an expedited research and development program to speed up \nthe deployment of new bullet resistant technologies and equipment. The \ndevelopment of new bullet resistant materials in the next few years \ncould be as revolutionary in the next few years as Kevlar was for body \narmor in the 1970s. Exciting new technologies such as bonded acrylic, \npolymers, polycarbons, aluminized material and transparent ceramics \npromise to provide for lighter, more versatile and hopefully less \nexpensive bullet resistant equipment.\n  The Officer Dale Claxton provision also directs the NIJ to inventory \nexisting technologies in the private sector, in surplus military \nproperty, and in use by other countries and to evaluate, develop \nstandards, establish testing guidelines, and promote technology \ntransfer.\n  Our nation's state, local and tribal law enforcement officers \nregularly put their lives in harm's way and deserve to have access to \nthe bullet resistant equipment they need. The Officer Dale Claxton bill \nwill both get life saving bullet resistant equipment deployed into the \nfield where it is are needed and accelerate the development of new \nlifesaving bullet resistant technologies.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this provision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, unless there is opposition, I would yield \nthat 2 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  Has the Senator from California said all she wants to say on this?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe so, Mr. President. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 339\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, the next amendment is that of Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I have been \nadvised by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia that he \nwill not require his time in favor of the amendment, other than the \nminute he has reserved just prior to the vote. I was prepared to yield \nback 5 minutes as a proponent. There may be, however, those who seek \ntime as opponents.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I would like to take about a \nminute of Senator Byrd's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. And then protect the right of the Senator from California \nto speak in opposition.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to support this amendment, which is \nnearly identical to a bill I introduced earlier this year, S. 577, The \nTwenty-First Amendment Enforcement Act. If nothing else can be said \nabout this issue--it is absolutely imperative that states have the \nmeans to prevent unlawful access to alcohol by our children.\n  If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it delivered \nby merely ``borrowing'' a credit card and making a few clicks with her \nmouse, there is something wrong with the level of control that is being \nexercised over these sales and something must be done to address the \nproblem.\n  I am a strong supporter of e-commerce. But the sale of alcohol cannot \nbe equated with the sale of a sweater or shirt. We need to foster \ngrowth in electronic commerce, but we also need to make sure that \nalcohol control laws are respected.\n  The growth of many of our nation's wineries is tied to their ability \nto achieve name recognition and generate sales nationwide--tasks the \nInternet is uniquely suited to accomplish. I do not want to preclude \nthem from using the Internet; I want to ensure that they use it \nresponsibly and in accordance with state laws.\n  If there is a problem with the system, we need to fix the system, not \nbreak the laws.\n  The 21st amendment gives states the right to regulate the importation \nof alcohol into their states. However, efforts to enforce laws relating \nto the importation of alcohol have run into significant legal hurdles \nin both state and Federal courts.\n  The scope of the 21st amendment is essentially a federal question \nthat must be decided by the federal courts--and ultimately the Supreme \nCourt. For that reason, among others, I believe a federal court forum \nis appropriate for state enforcement efforts.\n  Most states do not permit direct shipping of alcohol to consumers. \nTherefore most Internet sales of alcohol are currently prohibited. If a \nstate wants to set up a system to allow for the direct shipment of \nalcohol to consumers, such as New Hampshire and Louisiana have already \ndone, then that is their right under the 21st amendment. But the \ndecision to permit direct shipping, and under what conditions, is up to \nthe states, not the purveyors of alcohol.\n  The bill is supported by a host of interests including, inter alia, \nUtah interests (Governor Leavitt, Attorney General Graham, Utah's \nDepartment of Alcoholic Beverage Control, the Utah Hospitality \nAssociation, numerous Utah Congressional Representatives and Senator \nBennett), SADD, the National Licensed Beverage Association, the \nNational Beer Wholesalers Association, the Wine and Spirits \nWholesalers, Geerlings and Wade (leading direct marketer of fine wines \nto 27 states and more than 81 percent of the wine consuming public), \nAmericans for Responsible Alcohol Access, the National Association of \nBeverage Retailers, the National Alcohol Beverage Control Association, \nand the National Conference of State Liquor Administrators.\n  Having said that, I will yield back the remainder of any time the \nproponents have.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the Senior Senator from West \nVirginia for his dedication to enforcing state liquor laws. But I must \ndisagree with his approach. The Byrd amendment would permit the \nenforcement of state liquor laws in Federal court. This expansion of \nthe jurisdiction of the Federal courts is not warranted and raises \nconstitutional problems because one state may impose its laws on the \ncitizens of another state under this amendment.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, we recently held a hearing on this issue \nof direct sales of alcohol products over the Internet and via mail \norder. In our hearing, several expert witnesses raised questions about \na similar bill by Senator Hatch, S. 577. I would like to work with \nSenator Byrd, Senator Hatch and others on the Judiciary Committee to \nsee if we can refine this legislation to make sure it will pass \nconstitutional muster. I have my doubts about constitutionality of the \nlanguage before us today and will have to vote against the Byrd \namendment as currently drafted.\n  If the full Senate is to pass an amendment today on the interstate \nshipment of alcohol, I believe the amendment by Senator Feinstein is a \nmore targeted and sounder approach.\n  Her amendment would require clear labeling of alcoholic beverages \nshipped interstate and require the signature of an adult upon delivery \nof the alcoholic beverages.\n  The Feinstein amendment does not raise constitutional issues and is \ntargeted at preventing any underage purchase of alcoholic beverages \nover the Internet or through other direct sales.\n  I will vote against the Byrd amendment and for the Feinstein \namendment, because I believe that hers is constitutionally far more \nacceptable but also hits the problem far better.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, before I relinquish the floor to Senator \nFeinstein, let me say that I think States need the ability to take \naction on their own to enforce their State liquor laws. Senator Byrd's \namendment provides States with a Federal court forum to enjoin \nviolations of their alcohol laws, denying violators the ability to hide \nbehind a jurisdictional curtain.\n  Mr. President, this is a summary of the Byrd amendment:\n  First, it permits the chief law enforcement officer of a state to \nseek an\n\n[[Page S5473]]\n\ninjunction in federal court to prevent the violation of any of its laws \nregulating the importation or transportation of alcohol;\n  Second, allows for venue for the suit where the defendant resides and \nwere the violations occur;\n  Third, no injunctions issued without prior notice to the opposing \nparty;\n  Fourth, requires that injunctions be specific as to the parties, the \nconduct and the rationale underlying the issuance of the injunction;\n  Fifth, allows for quick consideration of the application for an \ninjunction; conserves court resources by avoiding redundant \nproceedings; and\n  Sixth, mandates a bench trial.\n  Having said that, I probably will support both the Byrd amendment and \nthe next amendment by the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the ranking member for his comments. My views \nparallel his. I think the Byrd method is very well intentioned. I \nhappened to be on the floor when the Senator presented it. However, I \nmust say I believe it is overly broad. It would essentially permit \nStates to deputize the Federal courts which exist to enforce Federal \nlaws, not State laws. I believe it would have the unintended \nconsequence of dramatically expanding the power of any one State in a \nmatter which would diminish consumer choice and really harm legitimate \nbusinesses.\n  This is more or less an intra-industry fight. California is home to \n90 percent of the domestic wine industry. The vast majority of these \nwineries are small family farms. The wine industry is certainly vital. \nMany of these small wineries essentially have wine tastings. \nIndividuals come in, taste the wine. They do not have shelf space. The \nwine is expensive, and they will use the Internet to be able to ship \nthis wine.\n  The problem which has been presented for remedy is children obtaining \nthis kind of alcoholic beverage through the Internet. I happen to doubt \nthat children would buy $90 bottles of wine, but, nonetheless, the \nsecond amendment I will present in essence tackles the question at hand \nby saying that any of these shipments must be clearly labeled, and they \nmust be received by someone who has the qualification to receive them, \nidentification showing that that individual is entitled to receive them \nand is in fact an adult.\n  Therefore, I do not believe this throwing of State alcohol law into \nthe Federal courts is necessary to solve the problem at hand.\n  I urge a no vote on the Byrd amendment and an aye vote on the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 354, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now move to the debate on the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, if I may, I ask unanimous consent to \nmodify my amendment No. 354.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is modified.\n  The amendment (No. 354), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. INTERSTATE SHIPMENT AND DELIVERY OF INTOXICATING \n                   LIQUORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 59 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 1263--\n       (A) by inserting ``a label on the shipping container that \n     clearly and prominently identifies the contents as alcoholic \n     beverages, and a'' after ``accompanied by''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``and requiring upon delivery the \n     signature of a person who has attained the age for the lawful \n     purchase of intoxicating liquor in the State in which the \n     delivery is made,'' after ``contained therein,''; and\n       (2) in section 1264, by inserting ``or to any person other \n     than a person who has attained the age for the lawful \n     purchase of intoxicating liquor in the State in which the \n     delivery is made,'' after ``consignee,''.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, the modification I have sent to the \ndesk changes the penalty, and I will explain that in a moment.\n  The amendment, as I have just described it, would require persons who \nship alcoholic beverages across State lines to: First, clearly and \nprominently label the contents as alcoholic beverages; second, state \nthe full name of the person causing the package to be shipped; i.e., \nthe seller; and third, state that an adult's signature is required. It \nwould require the shippers--for example, Federal Express--to not \ndeliver a package so labeled unless they can: One, verify that the \nperson receiving the delivery is of legal age for purchasing alcoholic \nbeverages; and, two, obtain that person's signature.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I sent to the desk to modify would \nsimply provide that existing penalties would apply to this bill. Those \nare criminal penalties of up to 1 year imprisonment and fines of up to \n$200,000 for organizations or $100,000 for individuals. A seller who \nviolates this requirement on three or more occasions may have their ATF \nbasic permit revoked. That is the effect of the law today, and we would \nrepeat that penalty in this particular instance.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does any Senator wish to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back all the time in \nopposition to this amendment on our side. We are prepared to vote.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 351\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n351. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will withhold. The Senate will be \nin order. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we are making headway. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the remaining votes in this series be limited to 10 \nminutes in length.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, just a point of clarification before we \nstart to vote. Each side gets 1 minute before these votes. I urge \nSenators on both sides to give attention to both proponents and \nopponents so they can be heard. Senator Hatch and I have worked very \nhard to get it down to this list, so we should make sure both sides are \nprotected and can be heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 352\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nKohl-Hatch amendment. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me just make one quick comment and then \nyield to Senator Kohl.\n\n[[Page S5474]]\n\n  The Kohl-Hatch amendment provides qualified immunity to law-abiding \ngun owners who use a child safety lock or gun storage unit and requires \nthat all handguns be sold with a child safety lock or gun storage unit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, none of us is naive enough to believe \ntoday's vote signals a bipartisan consensus on all gun control issues, \nor even most of them. But after a week of back-and-forth--and forth-\nand-back--over firearms, it is good to see a consensus developing on at \nleast this commonsense measure to keep handguns away from children. \nSimply put, the Kohl-Hatch-Chafee amendment will ensure that a child \nsafety device--or trigger lock--is sold with every handgun.\n  This proposal will move us forward today, and it will help save \nlives. I hope we can all support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. We yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nagreeing to the Hatch-Kohl amendment. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 353\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this next amendment is the Hatch-Feinstein \namendment. It is an amendment to give enhanced authority to combat gang \nviolence. In addition to combating gang violence, this also is an \namendment that bans bombmaking information on the Internet or \ninformation on the Internet with intent to injure.\n  I described this rather fully in my opening remarks earlier in the \nday. I give the rest of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, I say to the Senator. And thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  This amendment essentially has four parts. One relates to gangs that \nmove across interstate lines practicing criminal enterprise, the second \nis body armor, the third is bombmaking, and the fourth is animal \nterrorism.\n  Essentially, with respect to gangs, this bill will increase sentences \nfor gang members who commit Federal crimes. It will enhance the ability \nof Federal prosecutors to prosecute gangs for this crime. And it will \nadd serious juvenile drug offenses to the Armed Career Criminal Act.\n  With respect to body armor, there are about 10,000 surplus pieces of \nbody armor that the FBI and DEA have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Does anyone yield time in opposition to the amendment? The Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is not in opposition, but I will use \nthat time if nobody else is seeking it.\n  This is much improved from what it was last year. It has included a \nproposal that Senator DeWine and I have worked on together. My one \nconcern is the penalties. It does call for a new death penalty and new \nmandatory minimum.\n  I will tell the distinguished Senator from California and the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, these are issues that will be raised \nin conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, this proposal by Senator Kohl and myself \nsimply authorizes the attorney general of a State to go into Federal \ndistrict court and seek an injunction against any person importing \nalcohol into that State in violation of that State's law. \nUnfortunately, recent Federal court decisions have held that States do \nnot necessarily have the power to seek such an injunction despite the \nfact that the 21st amendment to the Constitution and the Webb-Kenyon \nAct give States the power to prohibit alcohol importation. As a \nconsequence, many States are at a loss when it comes to enforcing their \nown laws.\n  For those who may have concerns with this proposal, let me state \nunequivocally that the amendment will not restrict the lawful \nmanufacture, advertisement, sale, transportation, or importation of any \nalcoholic beverage. As long as a distiller, or a brewer, or a winemaker \ncomplies with the laws of the given State, they will have no additional \nrestrictions placed upon them by this amendment. The only ones who need \nto fear this amendment are those who are conducting their business in \nan unlawful manner, particularly those who are willing to sell alcohol \nto our children.\n\n[[Page S5475]]\n\n  Mr. President, as the Senate considers this juvenile justice bill, \ndesigned to reduce the scourge of youth violence and crime, I beseech \nmy colleagues to remember that alcohol use and abuse constitute an \nimportant facet of this national problem. Let us not overlook the \npernicious effects that alcohol has on our young people. Let us not \nturn our backs on them by foregoing this opportunity to put a stop to \nthose who choose to evade our laws. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment. The \namendment really is developed because of problems with alcohol being \nshipped to minors, and the amendment has major concern to the \nCalifornia wine industry. We believe it opens the Federal courts to \nState law. It does not focus on underage drinking, it is not supported \nby Mothers Against Drunk Driving, and it is opposed by the largest \nInternet trade group and by the wine industry.\n  Rather, my amendment would focus directly on underage drinking by \nrequiring that any shipment be clearly marked with a label as to what \nthe contents are and require that the recipient be qualified to receive \nit--in other words, be able to present identification that that person \nis, in fact, an adult.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to Amendment No. \n339.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN (when his name was called).

The question now is on the Feinstein \namendment. There are 2 minutes equally divided.\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HATCH. May I ask the distinguished Senator from California, since \neverybody understands this, why don't we yield back the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. HATCH. If I could ask the distinguished Senator from California--\nI certainly support this amendment; I believe everyone understands \nthat--why don't we just yield back the time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield back the time on this side.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Can't we just voice vote it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Can we voice vote this amendment? I ask unanimous consent \nthat the yeas and nays be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 354), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in just a few minutes we believe we can get \nconsent to have three more votes this evening and we will put over a \nstacked group of amendments for tomorrow, but we are just a few minutes \naway from having that consent. I suggest the absence of a quorum while \nwe get it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nresume S. 254, and the amendments, in this order tonight: Amendment No. \n358, followed by amendment No. 348; that these will be the next two \namendments, previously debated, to the pending juvenile justice bill, \nwhich will now be the pending question, in the order in which they were \noffered, with up to 5 minutes equally divided for additional debate \nprior to a vote on or in relation to these two amendments.\n  I further ask that notwithstanding a vote in relation to an \namendment, if any amendment is not tabled or skipped in the voting \nsequence, it then be laid aside for additional votes in the sequence, \nwith the amendments reoccurring at the end of the sequence ending with \namendment No. 361.\n  I further ask that following the disposition of each debate on each \namendment, the amendment be laid aside, and at the hour of 5:50 p.m. \ntoday the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the amendments, \nin the order in which they were offered, with 2 minutes prior to each \nvote for explanation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I shall \nnot----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for one other question? I believe I \nsaid amendment 358, but the two amendments tonight will be 359 and 348, \nin that order. I ask unanimous consent.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand, the Senator has asked for rollcalls on \nthose two votes, but then he asked for consent after that to sequence \nwhich amendments and in what order?\n  Mr. HATCH. To sequence the remaining amendments, the skipped \namendments, in the order in which they were following amendment No. \n361. In other words, we are putting them at the end of the group of \namendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have no objection.\n  I understand that Senator Harkin is not here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am here. I am trying to figure it out myself.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. What this does, I tell Senators on my side of the aisle, \nis say we will have two votes tonight. They have to go out of the \nsequence, but then we go back to the sequence. It is my understanding, \nfrom the distinguished Senator from Mississippi, that\n\n[[Page S5476]]\n\nthose will be the only two rollcall votes we will have tonight, and \nthen we will be back on the sequence tomorrow, if I am correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  If I could get recognition, if the Senator desires to have some \ndebate on his amendment tonight, that will be fine and will be \nanticipated also. So we will do these two out of sequence, with the \nlast vote occurring probably around 6:15 or so.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Or earlier.\n  Mr. LOTT. Or perhaps earlier. That will be the last vote tonight. The \nnext amendment in order will be the amendment the Senator from Iowa is \nconcerned about. And if he would like to debate that tonight, that \nwould be fine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding \nthat for 359 and 348, we will have those two votes. That will be all \ntonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. Right.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Then what will occur after that? What is the next thing \nin sequence?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I make it clear? After that will occur No. 360, then \nNo. 361, then No. 356, then No. 357, and last will be No. 355, which is \nthe amendment the distinguished Senator is concerned with.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And your unanimous consent did not put any time limit on \nthat?\n  Mr. LEAHY. No.\n  Mr. HATCH. We did not. I ask unanimous consent that they be put in \nthat order, with No. 355, the one with which the distinguished Senator \nis concerned, last on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, is there a time limit?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is not.\n  Mr. HARKIN. On any of these?\n  Mr. HATCH. No.\n  Mr. LEAHY. No. It is my understanding that there is a time limit on \nonly the two this evening.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are hoping we can set aside basically the other \ncontroversial, but not seriously controversial, amendments to be \nstacked tomorrow at some time, in accordance with the wishes of the \nmajority and minority leaders, and they will proceed in the same way \nthese have. But we understand on No. 355 there is not a time limit.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will not object as long as I understand and the record \nis clear that on amendment No. 355, the Frist-Ashcroft amendment on \nIDEA, there is no time limit.\n  Mr. HATCH. No time limit. It will be the last of the amendments in \nthe order we are listing them.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I hope we can move to these two amendments. We have 5 \nminutes to debate them.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 359\n\n  Mr. HATCH. The first amendment coming up will be Senator Wellstone's \non domestic violence for 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Might I ask a question first? I am sorry. I do not \nintend to take a lot of time.\n  Is there a time limit on this amendment tonight?\n  Mr. HATCH. The time limit of 5 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Could we have order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, this amendment goes right to the heart of this \nlegislation. If we are serious about youth violence, one of the things \nwe want to do is help kids before they get into trouble.\n  This amendment would authorize grant money which would go to the \ncommunity level for counselors and courts and schools and health care \nproviders and teachers and battered women programs to provide support \nand help to those children who witness violence in their homes.\n  We have focused on the violence against the adult--usually the woman, \nI am very sorry to say. But one of the things I found around the \ncountry, I say to my colleagues, is that we have not provided the \nsupport for kids. If you care about this issue of family violence, and \nif you care about trying to get more support for children who witness \nthis and see it all the time and then cannot do well in school and are \nin trouble, then you need to support this amendment.\n  In the bill right now, the language is not specific; it is very weak. \nIt just simply talks about kids at risk, but it does not focus \nspecifically on the problem of violence in homes and the effects on \nchildren who witness this violence. This is one of the best amendments \nwe could support.\n  For those of you who have done this work dealing with the issues of \nfamily violence, for those of you who care about reducing violence in \nfamilies and supporting children, this is really an important \namendment. I hope it will have strong support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time on \nthis amendment, except let me just say this: I very much appreciate the \nefforts of the Senator from Minnesota. As I read it, it provides for \nsix new grant programs totaling $170 million.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the issue of domestic violence, including \nits impact on children, is one that has been of paramount concern to me \nover the past 10 years. Working with Senator Biden, and the Senate, the \nSenate acted decisively in 1994 by passing the Violence Against Women \nAct. Moreover, in the years following passage of this landmark \nlegislation, this Senate has consistently funded programs authorized by \nthat legislation.\n  I do agree with my colleague; we probably could do more. We certainly \ncan do better. For that reason, Senator Biden and I have begun working \non a significant and thorough review of the act.\n  In 1994, we created many new programs, and we have spent hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to fund them. I think it is time to examine what \nworks and what doesn't as we look to reauthorizing this Act. Further, I \nthink we need to examine carefully whether and what kind of additional \nprograms are necessary and appropriate.\n  The Senator's amendment raises an important issue--the impact of \ndomestic violence on children and what can be done to alleviate this \nproblem. I am not prepared, however, at this time, to endorse his \nsolutions.\n  I understand why the Senator would try to use this bill as a vehicle \nfor his amendment, but I disagree. Rather, these suggestions, along \nwith others, ought to be considered in the context of reauthorizing the \nViolence Against Women Act. For example, several of the NEW grant \nprograms proposed sound to me as if they ought to be considered as a \ndiscretionary use of funds in existing VAWA programs. Further, whereas \nwe have a major Act on the books that deals with domestic violence, the \nnew Wellston grant programs contain a new and different definition of \ndomestic violence. Mr. President, these are not the kind of changes we \nshould be making in the context of a juvenile crime bill.\n  Let me close by commending the Senator from Minnesota. But for the \nreasons stated, I will at the appropriate time move to table his \namendment because I think we are going to work this out in the future. \nAnd let's work it out in the appropriate bill.\n  I yield back any further time we have.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 348\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we now move to the Ashcroft amendment No. \n348.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, 50 percent of all arsons, 37 percent of all burglaries \nare committed by juveniles, 17 percent of all forcible rapes.\n  Our juvenile justice system is no longer being asked to deal with \nchewing gum and spitballs in the hall but real violent crime.\n  This amendment is very straightforward and simple. It says that while \njuveniles are committing adult crimes with firearms, they should be \ntreated as adults; that if juveniles are going to be involved in rapes, \nmurders, armed robberies, armed assaults, that kind of violent crime, \nusing firearms, that we\n\n[[Page S5477]]\n\nwant to provide the encouragement, incentive, and resources from the \nFederal level for States to treat those individuals as adults. So this \namendment provides States with incentives to try juveniles as adults \nwhen they commit armed violent crimes.\n  Specifically, this amendment encourages States to try juveniles as \nadults when youth over 14 use firearms. This is not just any kind of \ncrime, but when youth over 14 use firearms to commit murder, forcible \nrape, armed robbery, armed assault, and use firearms in major drug \ncrimes. We have a real serious situation where young people are \ncommitting crimes that we once thought were reserved to adults.\n  Juveniles should understand that we will not consider this to be some \nsort of status offense or delinquency, that the commission of real \nviolent crime by juveniles will be treated as adult crime. The \nunpleasant fact is that all too many juveniles commit serious armed \ncrime. The answer is to prosecute these crimes vigorously to the full \nextent of the law.\n  This amendment provides States with substantial incentives to give \nadult time to juveniles who commit adult crimes. The purpose and thrust \nof this amendment, thus, is very narrow. For a narrow range of crimes--\nmurder, rape, robbery, assault, major drug crimes--committed with a \nfirearm, we provide Federal incentives and resources to try those \ncriminals as adults with adult penalties.\n\n  It is with that in mind that this amendment obviously is one which I \nbelieve merits the support of all the Members of the Senate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How many States presently have laws on the books which \nimpose the penalty of add-ons for children, those under the age of 14, \nfor these crimes?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. First of all, this amendment refers to children 14 or \nover, not under the age of 14.\n  Mr. DURBIN. How many States?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I don't know the exact number of States, but a number \nof States do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will tell the Senator from Illinois, \nthere are only two States, Kentucky and Mississippi, that would be in \ncompliance with this amendment's mandate, only two States in the whole \ncountry. Basically, the amendment would tell all the other States, your \nlegislatures are irrelevant. We know better here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Surely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Do I understand, then, that 48 other States would be \ndisqualified from Federal grants?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right. In fact, the National Governors' \nAssociation wrote to both the Republican and Democratic leaders of the \nSenate last year and asked them to oppose this kind of intrusion into \nthe domain of State legislatures.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So under the provision of this amendment, only two \nStates, Mississippi and Kentucky, could receive Federal funds to try to \ndeter juvenile crime?\n  Mr. LEAHY. That is right. The other 48 States would be cut out.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is a good idea for Mississippi and Kentucky. I don't \nknow about the rest of us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It kind of hurts the rest of us.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 27 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have to oppose this. I have to oppose \nthis, because, one, it would help only two States in the country, \nKentucky and Mississippi. It conditions the juvenile accountability \nblock grant in the bill to the other 48 States only if their \nlegislatures did something that they have all refused to do.\n  We are telling these other States that their legislatures are totally \nirrelevant; they must change their law because we know better here. I \nreally don't think that is the way to go. I come from a State that has \nprobably the toughest juvenile laws in the country, but I am not going \nto tell my State how they must do. Frankly, Mr. President, I oppose the \namendment. I hope the 48 States that would be cut out by this would \nlisten to what the National Governors' Association said when they, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike, urged the Senate not to go forward \nwith this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I made a mistake in the sequence. Number \n358 should follow immediately after No. 357, so I ask unanimous consent \nthat that be so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Hlavacek, \na fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor for the \npendency of this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 359\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the Wellstone amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \nSenate will resume the juvenile justice bill at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, \nwith Members offering new amendments from the list\n\n[[Page S5478]]\n\nof amendments. However, votes will occur on previously offered \namendments, beginning at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, so I urge my colleagues \nto offer their amendments in the morning for swift passage of the \njuvenile justice bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, if there are things we can do \non the bill tonight we will still do them but without recorded votes, \nis that correct?\n  Mr. HATCH. We are going to be working on the managers' amendment this \nevening.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 348\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is to be 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Ashcroft amendment No. 348. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I ask the Senator to yield back his time?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back my time if \nthe other side is prepared to yield back theirs.\n  Mr. LEAHY. In fairness to the Senator from Missouri, I will speak for \n30 seconds on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, violent crime by juveniles is a major \nproblem: forcible rape, murder, armed robbery, armed assault. This \namendment simply says if you are going to commit armed robbery, \nforcible rape with the use of a firearm, murder using a firearm, \nassault using a firearm, or major drug crimes using a firearm, you \nshould be tried as an adult. This is a way of sending the clearest \nmessage that adult crime deserves adult time and that use of a firearm \nis unacceptable. Chapter 44 in the code addresses the use of a firearm \nover and over again. Use of firearms is something we care about \nfederally. We spend a lot of time debating it.\n  The question is, are we serious about curtailing the use of firearms, \nespecially among young people? I think we should be. This amendment \nprovides for trying those as adults and provides access to resources in \nreturn for so doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the reason the Governors of these States, \nall of them, wrote to the Democratic and Republican leaders in \nopposition to this is it would knock out the juvenile accountability \nblock grant in the bill to 48 of the States--48 of the States. The only \ntwo that would get anything would be Kentucky and Mississippi. It would \ntell the other 48 States that their legislatures are irrelevant, their \nlaws are irrelevant. We know better. That is true even in some States \nthat have tougher laws than this would propose.\n  Because of that, I agree with the Governors, Republican and Democrat; \nwe should not override our States this way. I oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Ashcroft \nAmendment No. 348. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Winston Churchill once said that we build \nour homes, then our homes build us. I can say happily that my home \nbuilt me! I was fortunate to have had a great childhood--with two \nwonderful parents, a great church, and more than a few wise and \nsupportive teachers throughout my school years. I grew up in Lithonia, \nGeorgia, in a community that cared. Unfortunately, not all children \ngrowing up in America today are so blessed. Not all children have homes \nthat shape and prepare them to deal with the culture of violence in the \nworld today.\n  Back in the 50s, my action heroes were Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger, \nand Gene Autry. They were the good guys, who righted wrong and always \ngot the girl. A witness at a Commerce Committee hearing 2 weeks ago \ndescribed today's action heroes: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and \nMighty Morphin Power Rangers, whose TV show, we were told, averaged 100 \nacts of violence every single episode.\n  When I was in school, the strongest drug around was aspirin, and the \nmost lethal weapon was a sling shot. Last year, over 6,000 students \nwere expelled for carrying a weapon to school--and most said they \ncarried the weapon ``out of a need for protection.'' So far this year--\nand the year is only 5 months old--19 young people have met a violent \ndeath while in school. Our schools were once safe havens in this \ncountry, and there is something very wrong, as President Clinton points \nout, ``when kids are more worried about guns and violence than math and \nscience.''\n  The underlying fear of Littleton is that it is symptomatic of a \nbroader pattern of youth violence in this country. Events at Columbine \nHigh echo the school shootings in Springfield, OR, when a student \ninvaded the cafeteria, killed a fellow student, and wounded 22 others. \nIt echoes events in Jonesboro, AR, where two Middle School students \nopened fire, killing five students all under the age of 13 and wounding \n10 others. One of the young killers was reportedly angry over the \nbreakup with his girlfriend. It echoes the West Paducah, KY murders in \nwhich a fourteen-year-old student stormed a prayer group meeting before \nschool, killed three teenaged girls, and wounded five more students. It \nwas reported that the teen killer may have been teased by members of \nthe prayer group as well as members of the school's football team.\n  In interviews with the neighbors of the Littleton killers, each one--\nalmost without exception--saw little sign of the tragedy that lay \nahead. These are the words of one of those neighbors:\n\n       I turn on the news and I see their house, and I think, \n     ``That's my house! . . . It's the exact same house, the same \n     windows, same driveway, same trim, everything except the \n     color. I lie in bed thinking: 200 feet from my bedroom is \n     where the guy conceived this idea to destroy everything we \n     thought we had. Everything you thought you knew about your \n     neighborhood, your schools, your churches--all just \n     shattered. Vaporized. We feel like we are at ground zero.''\n\n  What causes two seemingly ``normal'' teenagers to go on a killing \nrampage? Is it a change in our culture? Is it our marketing of violent \nmovies like ``The Basketball Diaries'' and gory video games like \n``Doom?'' Is it access to Internet recipes for building bombs? Is it \nthe plight of ``latchkey'' kids who come home every day after school to \nan empty house? What is the WHY of Littleton? What are the toxic \nfactors that are producing the alarming trend in this country where \nyoung people settle their grievances with mass murders?\n\n[[Page S5479]]\n\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment by Senator Lieberman \nwhich would create a National Commission on Youth Violence. It will \nbring together religious leaders, educators, Cabinet heads, experts in \nparenting, in law enforcement, and psychology all focused on a single \nmission: To understand what factors conspire to create a Littleton and \nwhat actions we can take to address the possible causes of youth \nviolence. The task will not be easy and the answers will not be simple. \nBut this amendment is a critically important step in addressing the \nculture of violence that is pervading every segment of our society.\n  It is obvious to me that we are in a cultural war in this country for \nthe hearts and minds of our young people. And in anything and \neverything we can do to help and strengthen our children through safe \nschools, through smaller classrooms, through greater adult interaction \nand support, we should absolutely do. This Congress has a role. And one \nof the things we can--and should do--is to adopt the Lieberman \namendment. The national commission will seek answers to the perplexing \nquestions of how we deal with the hearts and minds of our youngsters in \nthis cultural war. And, sadly enough, like real war, there are \ncasualties. Littleton, CO is an example of that. Our hope is that we \ncan take some positive action that mitigates the death and destruction \nof the Columbine tragedy.\n  What is at stake is no less than this Nation's most precious \nresource, our number one asset--our children. As the writer James Agee \nsaid, ``In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, \nand of no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is \nborn again.'' Mr. President, on behalf of America's children, I am very \npleased that the Lieberman amendment has been accepted by both sides \nand is part of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5479-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, Secretary of Agriculture Glickman recently \nannounced reforms for the Federal milk marketing order system. These \nreforms were authorized by the 1996 farm bill in an effort to modernize \nand streamline an out-dated and arcane structure for pricing the \nnation's milk. As was the case with other commodities, the farm bill \nintended that Federal dairy policy be more modern and market-oriented \nto reflect innovations in the milk industry and to position the United \nStates to become a major trader in world markets. In announcing the \nreforms, Secretary Glickman said, ``These reforms will help make sure \nthat America's dairy farmers receive a fair price and that American \nconsumers continue to enjoy an abundant, affordable supply of milk. Our \nchanges will also simplify the wholesale milk pricing system, making it \nmore market-oriented and more equitable.'' The changes are positive\n\n[[Page S5480]]\n\nsteps toward accomplishing the goals stated by the secretary. The new \nstructure is more market-oriented, more beneficial to consumers and \nmore equitable to farmers across the Nation.\n  During consideration of the 1996 farm bill, Congress could not agree \non a policy to modernize milk marketing orders. The task of designing a \nconsumer-friendly and market-oriented program was turned over to the \nDepartment of Agriculture. The Secretary was given until 1999 to design \nthis new policy. In the interim between 1996 and 1999, Congress allowed \nthe northeast region of the country to set up a dairy compact in which \nproducers could receive a higher price for their milk. Authority for \nthe compact was scheduled to end with the implementation of the new \nmilk marketing order policy.\n  On January 2, 1998, as Secretary Glickman prepared to consider \nchanges to federal dairy policy, I wrote to him suggesting several ways \nto make dairy policy more consumer friendly and market oriented. \nIncluded in my recommendations was an overhaul of Class I differentials \nwhich set the prices that farmers receive for fluid milk. Shortly \nthereafter, USDA released its proposed rule for milk marketing order \nreform. The proposed rule contained seven different options for pricing \nstructures and noted Secretary Glickman's preference for the more \nmarket-oriented ``Option 1B'' for pricing Class I milk. On February 25, \n1998, I again wrote to Secretary Glickman in support of his commitment \nto a more market-oriented approach and made recommendations for other \nchanges that modernize federal dairy policy.\n  The contents of the final rule were highly controversial. No one \ninterested in dairy policy--producers, processors or consumers--was \nsatisfied. Contradictory bills to amend portions of the final rule were \nintroduced in both chambers of Congress. If I had written the final \nrule, I would have made some changes also.\n  However, we should reflect on the entire rule and the process that \nled to its promulgation. Because of the complexity of, and \ncontroversies surrounding, dairy policy, Congress, in the 1996 farm \nbill, gave USDA the responsibility to draw upon its expertise, consult \nwith the public and design a thoughtful milk marketing reform policy. \nUSDA spent three years formulating the reforms contained in the final \nrule. During this process, the department received more than 8,000 \ncomments from interested parties. The final rule, though not perfect, \nis more equitable to all the nation's dairy farmers and pro-consumer. \nIt is a good first step toward a policy that places the nation's dairy \nindustry in a position to better meet the challenges of the global \nmarkets of the new century.\n  When we begin deliberations on the next farm bill, we will have an \nopportunity to review and develop additional market-oriented reforms \nfor dairy policy. But, I am convinced that the Congress cannot improve \nupon the department's good-faith, balanced effort either in committee \nor on the Senate floor. If dairy farmers approve the new policy in \nreferenda in their order areas, we should allow the final rule to be \nimplemented on October 1, as scheduled, without intervening legislation \nand I will work toward that end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5480-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5480]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PARTICIPATION IN CLINICAL TRIALS--A BASIC HEALTH CARE RIGHT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a recent article in the New York Times \ndemonstrates the importance of clinical trials in treating cancer and \nthe serious problems that patients and researchers are now facing \nbecause of the lack of adequate enrollment in these trials.\n  Clinical trials are the primary means of testing new therapies for \nserious diseases. In fact, these trials may be the only available \ntreatment for patients whose conditions have failed to respond to \nconventional therapies.\n  The survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists discussed \nin the article found that less than five percent of cancer patients in \nthe country are enrolled in clinical trials--although 20 percent are \neligible to participate and would often receive better quality care if \nthey did. As the article points out, ``Patients who participate receive \nat least state-of-the-art treatment and often get to take advantage of \notherwise unavailable approaches.''\n  Several barriers exist to enrolling patients in clinical trials. But \na critical element is the increasing reluctance of HMOs and other \nmanaged care plans to allow their enrollees to participate in such \ntrials or to pay the routine hospitals costs of their participation is \na critical element. Until recently, health insurance routinely paid for \nthe doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials. But \nmanaged care is reducing that commitment. Today, managed care plans \noften will not permit their patients to enroll in clinical trials, and \nthey will not pay for their participation when they choose to do so on \ntheir own.\n  The American Association of Health Plans--the HMO trade association--\nhas recognized that plans should encourage patients to participate in \nclinical trials, where medically appropriate. But, too often, there is \nlittle or no participation.\n  The decision to enter a clinical trial should be made by the treating \nphysician and the patient. Yet the survey showed that only about half \nof eligible patients are even told such trials are available.\n  S. 6, the Patients' Bill of Rights, and its companion bill, HR 358, \nrequire health insurance plans to allow their enrollees to participate \nin quality clinical trials sponsored by the NIH, the Department of \nDefense, and the Veterans Administration. The lack of access \nhighlighted by the article clearly demonstrates the need for passage of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Without the protections in that bill, \npatients will not be guaranteed the right to participate in these life-\nsaving trials. Virtually every major cancer group in the nation has \nendorsed the Patients' Bill of Rights, and highlighted the clinical \ntrials provision as a major reason for enactment.\n  Patients are dying and cures of the future are being delayed. \nPatients deserve this opportunity for life. The rights guaranteed in \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights are essential for patients with cancer, \ncongestive heart failure, lupus, Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's \nDisease, diabetes, and many other deadly illnesses. Every day we delay \nmore patients suffer. Congress has an obligation to act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article from the New York Times may \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 16, 1999]\n\n     Few Take Part in Cancer Tests, Slowing Research, Survey Finds\n\n       Atlanta, May 15 (AP).--Fewer than 5 percent of cancer \n     patients in the nation take part in experiments to test new \n     treatments, a figure at least four times lower than ideal if \n     the most pressing cancer questions are to be answered \n     quickly, according to a survey released today.\n       ``We need clinical trials to know what works and what \n     doesn't,'' said Dr. Allen Lichter, president of the American \n     Society of Clinical Oncology.\n       Cancer experts almost universally endorse the need for \n     patients to participate in formal studies, but data on how \n     many do so have been scarce. So the oncology society, the \n     nation's largest group of cancer practitioners, commissioned \n     a survey of about 7,000 of its members and released the \n     results at its annual meeting here.\n       The survey found that about 40,000 Americans--3 percent to \n     5 percent of those found to have cancer each year--are \n     enrolled in studies of the disease. Far more patients could \n     take part in the experiments, which doctors call clinical \n     trials, the study found.\n       The survey estimated that about 20 percent of cancer \n     patients would be eligible to participate in the studies \n     taking place of their kinds of conditions.\n       Dr. Ezekiel Emmanuel of the National Institutes of Health, \n     the study's primary author, said doctors should try to enroll \n     the entire 20 percent.\n       The experiments typically test new medicines or \n     combinations of drugs to see whether they work better than \n     standard approaches. Patients who participate receive at \n     least state-of-the-art treatment and often get to take \n     advantage of otherwise unavailable approaches.\n       Only about half of eligible patients are told the studies \n     are available. And only 20 percent of cancer specialists have \n     time set aside to do this kind of cancer research.\n       The survey found that a doctor's cost of enrolling and \n     keeping a single patient in a clinical trial averages $2,000.\n       The National Cancer Institute, the single largest sponsor \n     of these studies, pays doctors $750 a patient for this work, \n     while pharmaceutical companies' average payment is about \n     $2,500.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5481-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5481]]\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5481-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOTICE ON CONTINUATION OF EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO BURMA--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 29\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts relative to \n     Social Security; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                           Senate Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States, as part of its \n     efforts to address the financial crisis confronting the \n     Social Security System, is considering a proposal mandating \n     Social Security coverage for public employees, including \n     public employees in Massachusetts who presently do not \n     participate in the Social Security system; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its cities \n     and towns provided retirement benefits to employees prior to \n     the creation of Social Security and, after being explicitly \n     precluded from participation in the Social Security System, \n     adopted a retirement structure providing adequate retirement \n     and survivor benefits to employees including vital benefits \n     for those permanently disabled in the line of duty; and\n       Whereas, in the early 1980's the Commonwealth of \n     Massachusetts and its cities and towns were confronted by a \n     similar financial crisis in retirement funding which, through \n     the adoption of aggressive funding and investment policies \n     following major statutory reforms, has been averted resulting \n     in the secure financing of retirement benefits; and\n       Whereas, conservative estimates indicate that such public \n     employee mandated Social Security coverage would impose \n     billions of dollars in added costs on public employers in the \n     Commonwealth of Massachusetts thereby diverting public \n     resources from education, public safety, public works, health \n     care and child care without having a serious impact on the \n     fiscal condition of the Social Security System; and\n       Whereas, it has been determined that nationally such \n     mandatory Social Security coverage would provide a short term \n     fiscal solution that ultimately would extend the Social \n     Security trust fund solvency by only two years; and\n       Whereas, the mandating of Social Security coverage for non-\n     federal public employees may raise significant legal issues; \n     now therefore be it\n       Resolved, that the Massachusetts Senate hereby urges the \n     Congress of the United States to reject any proposal to \n     reform Social Security that includes mandatory Social \n     Security coverage for public employees; and be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     by the clerk of the Senate to the President of the United \n     States, the presiding officers of both Houses of Congress and \n     the entire congressional delegation from the Commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-120. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Hawaii relative to Social Security; to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                    House Concurrent Resolution 203\n\n       Whereas, an administrative fee to process the state \n     supplement for Supplemental Security Income was implemented \n     by section 5102 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997; and\n       Whereas, the administrative fee to process the state \n     supplement for Supplemental Security Income increases \n     annually, and in fiscal year 2003 will increase to coincide \n     with the Consumer Price Index; and\n       Whereas, there is no increase in the services provided by \n     the Social Security Administration; and\n       Whereas, therefore, in fiscal year 1999, Hawaii is paying \n     $7.60 to issue a supplement of $4.90; and\n       Whereas, Hawaii must continue to pay the administrative fee \n     to avoid jeopardizing Medicaid reimbursements; and\n       Whereas, the contracting of the state supplement for \n     Supplemental Security Income to a private vendor will \n     decrease eligibility for Aged, Blind, and Disabled \n     individuals because the Social Security Administration will \n     allow the State to use only the Supplemental Security Income \n     Federal Benefit Rate as the standard of assistance for all \n     individuals regardless of living arrangement; now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Twentieth \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 1999, \n     the Senate concurring, That this body urges the United States \n     Congress, the President of the United States, and the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to support United \n     States Senator Daniel K. Akaka, United States Senator Daniel \n     K. Inouye, United States Representative Neil Abercrombie, and \n     United States Representative Patsy T. Mink's federal \n     legislation to amend the Social Security Act in the following \n     manner:\n       (1) To allow Hawaii to not issue a state supplement for \n     Supplemental Security Income;\n       (2) To limit the cost of the administrative fees to process \n     the state supplement for Supplemental Security Income by \n     determining a maximum fee;\n       (3) To prohibit the Social Security Administration from \n     increasing the amount of administrative fees to process the \n     state supplement for Supplemental Security Income without any \n     increase in services; and\n       (4) To allow Hawaii to contract the processing of state \n     supplements for Supplemental Security Income to a private \n     vendor without being penalized by decreasing the standard of \n     assistance to the Federal Benefit Rate only; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Concurrent \n     Resolution be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States, the \n     Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human \n     Services, and the members of Hawaii's congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-121.

Clinton, President of the United \n     States; the President of the United States Senate; the \n     Speaker of the House of Representative of the United States \n     and to each Member of the Maine Congressional Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5483-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. McCAIN, from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, without amendment:\n       H.R. 1034.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a special rule for long existing home health agencies with \npartial fiscal year 1994 cost reports in calculating the per \nbeneficiary limits under the interim payment system for such agencies; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         medicare home health technical corrections legislation\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would make a technical correction to a provision of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 that is causing great unfairness to long-established \nhome health agencies and their patients. It would provide for a special \nrule for long-existing home health agencies that have been classified \nas ``new'' home health agencies for purposes of the Interim Payment \nSystem (IPS) simply because they happened to change the ending date of \ntheir fiscal year, and, as a consequence, do not have a full 12-month \ncost reporting period in federal fiscal year 1994.\n  Under the complicated formula for the Medicare Interim Payment System \nfor home health agencies, Medicare determines a limit for most \nestablished agencies using a formula that recognizes the agency's \nhistorical costs and blends them, in a proportion of 75 percent to 25 \npercent, with regional norms. For new home health agencies without a \nhistoric record of cost reports, the per-beneficiary limit is set at \nthe national median.\n  In defining the difference between new and existing agencies, the \nAdministration focused on fiscal year 1994 and established a general \nrule that the national median per-beneficiary limit would apply to \n``new providers and providers without a 12-month reporting period \nending in fiscal year 1994.'' Congress did, however, specifically \nexclude from the ``new'' category any home health agency that had \nchanged its name or corporate structure.\n  Nevertheless, one of the home health agencies in my State --Hancock \nCounty HomeCare--has been classified as a ``new'' home health agency, \neven though it has been serving the people of rural Down East Maine for \nmore than 60 years. I am sure that there are other long-standing home \nhealth agencies across the country that have found themselves in a \nsimilar situation as a consequence of this provision.\n  Hancock County HomeCare is a division of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital, \na charitable, tax-exempt hospital. Hancock County HomeCare emerged as a \nresult of a merger of the hospital with the Four Town Nursing Service \nand Bar Harbor Public Health Nursing, both non-profit home health \nagencies that have provided uninterrupted service to residents of \nHancock County, Maine for more than 60 years. The unified agency, which \nprovides skilled home nursing and therapies to residents of 36 towns, \nhas been part of Blue Hill Memorial Hospital since 1981.\n  Despite its 60-year history of service to the community, Hancock \nCounty HomeCare has been classified as a ``new'' agency simply because \nit happened to change the ending date of its fiscal year during 1994, \nwhen Blue Hill Memorial and its affiliate changed theirs. Solely \nbecause it changed its fiscal year from a period ending June 30 to a \nperiod ending March 31, this 60-year old agency is being treated as a \nnew agency by HCFA. Given the care taken by Congress to exclude name \nchanges and corporate structure changes from the definition of a \n``new'' agency, I simply do not believe that it was our intent to visit \nradically different treatment upon an agency that simply changed its \nfinancial reporting practices, but otherwise has a continuous history \nof operation and is fully able to provide 12 months of reliable data in \naccordance with Medicare cost reporting requirements.\n  I believe that the statute gives the Health Care Financing \nAdministration sufficient discretion to deal with this situation \nadministratively. Unfortunately, however, HCFA does not agree with that \ninterpretation and insists that further legislative action is necessary \nif Hancock County HomeCare is to be considered an ``old'' agency for \npurposes of the Interim Payment System.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today to clarify the law was \nprepared with technical assistance from HCFA. Essentially, the bill \nwould provide for a special rule for home care agencies that were in \nexistence and had an active Medicare provider number prior to fiscal \nyear 1980, but which had less than a 12-month cost reporting period in \nfiscal year 1994 because the agency changed the end date of its cost \nreporting period in that year. For these agencies, Medicare could, upon \nthe request of the agency, use the agency's partial-year cost report \nfrom fiscal year 1994 to\n\n[[Page S5485]]\n\ndetermine the agency-specific portion of the per beneficiary limit. As \na consequence, the agency could then be treated as an ``old'' agency \nfor purposes of the Interim Payment System.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is simply a technical correction to \naddress a specific problem that Congress clearly did not intend to \ncreate when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The legislation \nis narrowly drafted and, in all likelihood, will not affect more than a \nfew home health agencies, but it will make a critical difference in the \nability of those agencies to continue to serve their elderly clients.\n  Home health agencies across the country, however, are experiencing \nacute financial problems due to other problems with a critically-flawed \npayment system that effectively penalizes our most cost-efficient \nagencies. These agencies are finding it increasingly difficult to cope \nwith cash-flow problems, which inhibit their ability to deliver much-\nneeded care. As many as twenty organizations in Maine have either \nclosed or are no longer providing home care services because their \nreimbursement levels under Medicare fell so far short of their actual \noperating costs. Other agencies are laying off staff or are declining \nto accept new patients with more serious health problems. The real \nlosers in this situation are our seniors, since cuts of this magnitude \ncannot be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care.\n  Moreover, these payment problems have been exacerbated by a number of \nnew regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the \nimplementation of OASIS, sequential billing, medical review, and IPS \noverpayment recoupment. I will soon be introducing legislation to \nprovide some relief for these beleaguered home health agencies and also \nplan to hold a hearing next month in the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations to examine the combined effect that these payment \nreductions coupled with the multiple new regulatory requirements have \nhad on home health agencies' ability to meet their patients' needs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation providing a special rule for long-existing home health \nagencies with partial fiscal year 1994 cost reports be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1063\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the location of the National Museum of \nthe United States Army; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n       national museum of the united states army site act of 1999\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it is not an exaggeration to say that \nWashington, DC possesses one of the highest concentrations of museums, \nart galleries, research institutions, monuments, and memorials to be \nfound anywhere in the world. This is a city where we chronicle our \nhistory, honor our heroes, and introduce people from around the world \nto the ``American experience''.\n  Each year millions of people travel to Washington to visit the many \nattractions that are located within the capital city. Some of the most \npopular destinations for visitors are the many excellent museums and \ngalleries, located where individuals are able to gain a knowledge and \nperspective about the United States that they may not have possessed \nbefore their trip to Washington.\n  Sadly, one aspect of American history which is not told very well is \nthat of the United States Army. While many of the museums in the \nCapital area address military history in general terms, the region \nlacks a museum dedicated solely to the purpose of telling the story of \nour Army. This absence is a discredit to those interested in American \nhistory as the story of our Army is the story of our Nation, and quite \nobviously the reverse is true. It is also a discredit to the millions \nwho have served as soldiers, theirs is a story well worth telling to \nothers.\n  The United States is a Nation born of battle, as a matter of fact, \nthe Army is older than our country. The Army was formed in 1775, while \nthe United States was formed in 1776. At every critical juncture of the \nhistory of the United States, we find the brave soldiers of the Army. \nWhether it was earning our freedom from a colonial power; the mapping \nexpedition of Lewis & Clark; the westward expansion of the nation; the \nCivil War, where the Army fought to maintain the unity of the young \nnation; the World Wars where we battled to preserve global peace; the \nCold War where the Army stood vigilant against the expansionist desires \nof communist countries; in the Persian Gulf chasing a petty dictator \nand bully out of Kuwait; spearheading humanitarian relief efforts in \nany number of countries; or enforcing a fragile peace in Bosnia, the \nsoldiers of our Army were there, doing their duty. Certainly this is a \nstory worthy of chronicling through a museum, and the time has come to \nbuild such a facility.\n  What I propose is not new. Over the past two decades, many sites have \nbeen suggested and most are unsatisfactory because they have \nunrealistic development requirements, because their locations are \nunsuitable for such an esteemed building, or they lacked an appropriate \nArmy setting. Since 1983, the process of choosing a site for the Army \nMuseum has been a long and cumbersome undertaking. A site selection \ncommittee was organized and it developed a list of seventeen criteria \nwhich any candidate site is required to possess before it was to be \nselected as home to the Army Museum. Among other requirements, these \ncriteria required such things as: an area permitting movement of large \nvehicles for exhibits and tractor trailer trucks for shipments; \ncommanding an aesthetically pleasing vista; positive impact on the \nenvironment; closeness to public transportation; closeness to a \nWashington Tourmobile route; convenience to Fort Myer for support by \nthe 3d Infantry--The Old Guard; accessibility by private automobile; \nadequate parking for 150 staff and official visitors; adequate parking \nfor a portion of the 1,000,000 visitors-a-year that will not use public \ntransportation; food service for staff and visitors; an area that is \nlow in crime and is safe for staff and visitors; suitable space--at \nleast 300,000 square feet--for construction; a low water table; good \ndrainage; no history of flooding; and, suitability for subterranean \nconstruction.\n  Since 1984, more than 60 sites have been studied, yet only a handful \nhave been worthy of any serious consideration.\n  The most prominent recent site suggestions have included Carlisle, \nPennsylvania, the Washington Navy Yard, the ``Marriott property'' in \nnorthern-Virginia, and Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Three of these sites \nclearly have characteristics which are directly contrary to the \nestablished criteria for site selection. The extraordinary distance of \nCarlisle from Washington speaks for itself. The ``Marriott property'' \nwas carefully studied numerous times, and though it was the Army's \nfirst choice, it was always determined that the site was too small and \nthat the cost of the\n\n[[Page S5486]]\n\nproperty too high. The suggestion that the Army locate its museum in \nWashington's Navy Yard is also directly contrary to prerequisites for \nsite selection. The Washington Navy Yard is situated in a difficult to \nget to part of the District, on the Anacostia River, as well as on a \nprecarious 50-year flood plain. Because this area floods so often, a \n``Washington Navy Yard Army Museum''--I will repeat this awkward \nlocation--a ``Washington Navy Yard Army Museum'', might well suffer the \nembarrassment of being closed due to flooding. Furthermore, the Navy \nYard is simply too small to allow the construction of a facility that \ncan chronicle the more than 225-year history of the Army. From even \nbefore the first blueprint is drawn, architects and historians trying \nto create a museum that will be recognized as a world-class facility \nfor the study of the American Army and military history will be limited \nby the lack of space available at the Navy Yard. Secondly, the Navy \nYard is situated in a part of the District of Columbia well off the \ncircuit that visitors travel when they come to Washington. The Navy \nYard abuts a residential district with narrow streets which means it \nwill be confusing for people to drive there, streets will be congested \nwith traffic, and there will be a lack of parking for cars and tour \nbuses. Additionally, the Navy Yard has become less military in \ncharacter and more of a patchwork home to various government offices. \nTo locate the Army Museum in an old Navy yard, which sometimes may be \nunder water, would send a clear signal to visitors that choosing a home \nto their history was nothing more than an afterthought. Finally, it \nis simply not appropriate to have a museum chronicling the history of \nthe Army at a Navy facility. The Army museum belongs on an Army \ninstallation.\n\n  As an interesting footnote, the April 27, 1999 issue of the \nWashington Post carried an article about the search for a new location \nto house the headquarters for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms \nand reported that a site on New York Avenue seemed to be the first \nchoice. It mentioned that another site in the District had previously \nbeen considered as the new home of the BATF, that of the Southeast \nFederal Center, ``. . . a huge development envisioned for the Anacostia \nRiver waterfront south of Capitol Hill, next to the Washington Navy \nYard.'' Not surprisingly, the article also reported that BATF had \nresisted that option because it was considered--and I quote--``. . .too \nremote''. If the Navy Yard is too remote a site for the BATF, how is it \nany more convenient for the Army Museum or those hundreds of thousands \nof people who will visit it every year?\n  In 1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed that the site \nsearches include the Mount Vernon Corridor as a possible location for \nthe Army Museum. Fort Belvoir quickly became a very attractive \nlocation. Fort Belvoir offers a 48-acre site; it is only five minutes \nfrom Interstate 95, which is traveled by more than 300 million vehicles \neach year; it is only three minutes from the Fairfax County Parkway; it \nis served by Metro Bus; and Richmond Highway is next to the main gate \nof Fort Belvoir.\n  Beyond its ideal location, Fort Belvoir is also a winner \nhistorically. It is on a portion of General George Washington's \nproperties when he was Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army. It \nis located on the historical heritage trail of the Mount Vernon Estate, \nWoodlawn Plantation, Pohick Church, and Gunston Hall. Situating the \nArmy Museum at Fort Belvoir is a natural tie to a long established \nmilitary and historic installation that has already been approved by \nthe National Capital Planning Commission to be used for community \nactivities, which includes museums, as a part of the Fort Belvoir \nMaster Plan. The Fort Belvoir site meets all 17 criteria originally \nestablished by the Army. With the Marine Corps planning to build its \nheritage center at nearby Quantico, these two facilities would most \ncertainly complement each other.\n  Indeed, the planned Marine Corps museum is an excellent example of a \ncarefully contemplated facility that not only will capture the rich \nhistory of that service, but make the complex an attractive tourist \ndestination. The Marines' heritage complex will be 460,000 square feet \nand will include a museum, a welcome center, an IMAX theater, a \nconference center, and a hotel. Clearly, the Marine Corps has come-up \nwith a winning equation for a facility that will tell the story of that \nservice and the Army should be allowed to do the same. Placing the Army \nMuseum at the Navy Yard will not only inhibit efforts to present the \nhistory of the Army, but it will also force the establishment of a \nmuseum that is inferior and not all that it can be. Finally, co-\nlocating the Army and Marine museums in the same geographic area would \ncreate a military history ``zone'', so to speak, and greatly increase \nthe number of visitors that will take time to stop at both museums to \nlearn more about our armed services and the valuable contributions they \nhave made to the nation.\n  Mr. President, we have been trying to find a suitable site for the \nArmy Museum since 1983. While I find it hard to believe that it should \ntake 16-years to identify a suitable site, I am willing to concede that \nwe should spare no effort in making certain that we find the perfect \nplace to locate the Army Museum. I fear that citizens would hesitate \nvisiting the Navy Yard if designated as the home for the Army Museum. \nSimply put, Fort Belvoir enjoys every advantage over the Navy Yard, the \nMarriott property, Carlisle Barracks, or any other site, as a place to \nbuild the Army Museum.\n  The bill I am introducing today names Fort Belvoir as the site for \nthe Army Museum. Fort Belvoir is the best location in the Washington \narea to host the Army Museum. Army veterans want to remember and show \ntheir contribution to history in an Army setting and culture in which \nthey themselves once served. Fort Belvoir is the perfect place to do \nthis and it qualifies on every criterion established in 1983 by the \nArmy's Site Selection Committee. Fort Belvoir is Army and should host \nArmy history. Therefore, I ask that my colleagues support this bill and \nbring the 16-year search for a home for the Army Museum to a close by \nselecting a worthy home for one of this nation's greatest institutions.\n  Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams in 1817, ``A \nmorsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always \nvaluable.'' I am pleased to see that the National U.S. Army Museum is a \ntask for this Congress at the beginning of a new century, at a time \nwhen all Americans are proud of their nation's accomplishments and \nthose who made it all possible. I am absolutely concerned that all our \nveterans are honored and honored appropriately. Every year, Army \nveterans bring their families to Washington and are disappointed that \nno museum exists as a tribute to their service and sacrifice. Time is \nrunning out for many Army veterans, especially those of World War II. I \nurge my colleagues to review this important piece of legislation and \nsupport its passage. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ntext of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1064\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize negotiation for the accession of Chile \nto the North American Free Trade Agreement, to provide for Fast Track \nConsideration and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      CHILE FAST TRACK ACT OF 1999\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, nearly five years ago, a bipartisan \nmajority of this body ratified the North American Free Trade Agreement. \nSince then the promises of new jobs, increased exports, lower tariffs \nand a cleaner environment have all come true. In other words, Mr. \nPresident, NAFTA has succeeded despite the predictions of some that \nAmerica could not compete in today's global economy.\n  With the success of NAFTA as a backdrop, it is now time to move \nforward and expand the free trade zone to other countries in our \nhemisphere. To help accomplish that important goal, I am introducing \nlegislation today which will authorize and enable the President to move \nforward with negotiations on a free trade agreement with Chile.\n  Chile, Mr. President, is surely worthy of membership in NAFTA. In \nfact, Chile already signed a free trade agreement with Canada in 1996. \nToday, the Chilean economy is growing at a healthy annual rate of more \nthan 7 percent. Chile is noted for its concern for preserving the \nenvironment and has put in place environmental protections that are \nlaudable. Chile's fiscal house is in order as evidenced by a balanced \nbudget, strong currency, strong foreign reserves and continued inflows \nof foreign capital, including significant direct investment.\n  Chile has already embraced the ideals of free trade. Last January, \nthe Chilean tariff on goods from countries with which Chile does not \nyet have a free trade agreement fell from 11 percent to 10 percent. \nThat tariff is scheduled to continue to fall gradually to 6 percent in \n2003. While some goods are still assessed at a higher rate, the United \nStates does a brisk export business to Chile, sending approximately \n$4.5 billion in American goods to that South American nation. That \nrepresents 25 percent of Chile's imports. That $4.5 billion in exports \nrepresents thousands of American jobs across the nation. Furthermore, \nthe United States currently runs a trade surplus of nearly $3 billion \nper year.\n  Our firm belief in the importance of democracy continues to drive our \nforeign policy. After seventeen years of dictatorship, Chile returned \nto the family of democratic nations following the 1988 plebiscite. \nToday, the President and the legislature are both popularly elected and \nthe Chilean armed forces effectively carry out their responsibilities \nas spelled out in Chile's Constitution. American investment and trade \ncan play a critical role in building on Chile's political and economic \nsuccesses.\n  It is unrealistic to think that the President will be able to \nnegotiate a free trade agreement without fast track authority. Nor \nshould we ask Chilean authorities to conduct negotiations under such \ncircumstances. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will provide \nhim with a limited fast track authority which will apply only to this \nspecific treaty. I believe that fast track is key to enabling the \nPresident to negotiate the most advantageous trade agreements, and \nshould therefore be re-authorized. At this point, however, there are \nstumbling blocks we must surmount before generic fast track can be re-\nauthorized. Those stumbling blocks should not be allowed to stand in \nthe way of free trade with Chile.\n  Naysayers claim that free trade prompts American business to move \noverseas and costs American workers their jobs. They will tell you that \nAmerica, the nation with the largest and strongest economy, the best \nworkers and the greatest track record of innovation cannot compete with \nother nations.\n  Mr. President, the past five and a half years since we ratified NAFTA \nhave proven them wrong. Today, tariffs are down and exports are up. The \nenvironment in North America is cleaner. Most importantly, NAFTA has \ncreated 600,000 new American jobs all across the nation.\n  The successes of NAFTA are an indication of the potential broader \nfree trade agreements hold for our economy. Furthermore, trade and \neconomic relationships foster American influence and support our \nforeign policy. In other words, Mr. President, this bill represents new \nAmerican jobs in every state in the nation, a stronger American economy \nand greater American influence in our own Hemisphere. Mr. President, I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      BY Mr. ROBERTS (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Grams, Mr. Hagel, \n        and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1066. A bill to amend the National Agricultural Research, \nExtension, and Teaching Policy Act to 1977 to encourage the use of and \nresearch into agricultural best practices to improve the environment, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n        CARBON CYCLE AND AGRICUTURAL BEST PRACTICES RESEARCH ACT\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President I rise today to introduce an important \ncomponent to further the scientific understanding of the earth's role \nas it relates to the environment, specifically the carbon cycle. What \nsparked my interest in introducing a carbon cycle research bill was a \n1998 finding by academic and federal researchers that the North \nAmerican continent from 1988 to 1992 absorbed an equivalent amount of \nthe carbon dioxide emitted from fossil fuel emissions during the same \ntime. Scientists know it happened, but cannot pinpoint the mechanisms \nof the process. Although you cannot watch carbon dioxide move into \nsoil, you can see soil with high levels of carbon like river bottomland \nthat has rich dark soil. Naturally, the question arises of how \nagriculture supplements this natural process.\n  By introducing this bill, it is my intention to follow through on the \nadvice of climate scientists that there is a need for more research \nbecause the carbon cycle issue is complex. The bill makes sure that \nUSDA is researching voluntary agricultural best practices such as \nconservation tillage, buffer strips, the Conservation Reserve Program, \nand new technology like precision sprayers that have multiple \nenvironmental benefits.\n  These voluntary agricultural best practices increase soil carbon \nlevels also tend to reduce soil erosion, reduce fuel costs for \nproducers, improve soil fertility, and increase production. It's a win \nwin win. Nonetheless, there are agencies and individuals with agendas \nthat believe agriculture is a source of greenhouse gas emissions and do \nnot care about the multitude of benefits accruing from production \nagriculture. Therefore, we must arm agriculture with sound science on \nthe carbon cycle.\n  This bill is intended to give producers and policymakers better \nunderstanding of the link between the carbon cycle and voluntary best \npractices. It authorizes USDA to conduct basic research on the \nmechanics of carbon being stored in soil and applied research to fine \ntune voluntary agricultural practices to increase the storage of carbon \nin soils. Furthermore, research will be helpful in finding out if \nagriculture can be a tool to solve the challenge of climate change.\n  I also want to make clear that this is a research bill. It has \nnothing to do with trading carbon credits or setting up a scheme for \nearly action rewards if the Protocol becomes effective. The whole point \nof this bill is that there needs to be an understanding of the science \nand examining methods to meet the challenge of climate change without \nan international treaty. This bill compliments other legislation, such \nas Mr. Murkowski's bill, that calls for increased energy efficiency \nresearch.\n  The bill taps into USDA's broad research capabilities as it relates \nto production techniques and soil databases, but I have also \nincorporated state-of-the-art research tools including satellite-based \ntechnology. Satellite based\n\n[[Page S5488]]\n\nremote sensing is becoming more useful as an agricultural production \ncomponent. Right now, satellites measure the greening up of wheat \nduring spring months, making more precise estimates of wheat harvests. \nIn discussions with remote sensing leaders at the University of Kansas, \nremote sensing has a role in providing the ``big picture'' as it \nrelates to what agriculture is doing as it relates to the carbon cycle, \nsuch as mapping vegetation and estimating the amount of carbon it can \nstore in soil.\n  Because of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \ninitial research that shows the North American Continent is a net \ncarbon sink, I have included bill language to use air monitors to study \nthe regional interaction of carbon dioxide. For instance, measure the \nmovement of air from Denver to Kansas City. If the carbon dioxide level \nis lower in Kansas City than Denver, Kansas agriculture and land is \nabsorbing carbon. With this data, scientists can start looking at \nspecific ag practices.\n  It is my hope that the Senate can enact this legislation to be \nproactive in meeting the climate challenge, encouraging voluntary \nagricultural best practices and technology that have multiple benefits. \nThis is a strategy that is based on commonsense, not suggestions made \nby the International Panel on Climate Change that would halt production \nagriculture as we know it. Producers can use technology to feed a \ntroubled and hungry world, plus absorb carbon dioxide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the legislation was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1066\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Cycle and \n     Agricultural Best Practices Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) agricultural producers in the United States--\n       (A) have, in good faith, participated in mandatory and \n     voluntary conservation programs, the successes of which are \n     unseen by the general public, to preserve natural resources; \n     and\n       (B) have a personal stake in ensuring that the air, water, \n     and soil of the United States are productive since \n     agricultural productivity directly affects--\n       (i) the economic success of agricultural producers; and\n       (ii) the production of food and fiber for developing and \n     developed nations;\n       (2) in addition to providing food and fiber, agriculture \n     serves an environmental role by providing benefits to air, \n     soil, and water through agricultural best practices;\n       (3) those conservation programs and Federal land provide \n     the United States with an enormous potential to increase the \n     quantity of carbon stored in agricultural land and \n     commodities through the carbon cycle;\n       (4) according to the Climate Modeling and Diagnostics \n     Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, North American soils, crops, rangelands, and \n     forests absorbed an equivalent quantity of carbon dioxide \n     emitted from fossil fuel combustion as part of the natural \n     carbon cycle from 1988 through 1992;\n       (5) the estimated quantity of carbon stored in world soils \n     is more than twice the carbon in living vegetation or in the \n     atmosphere;\n       (6) agricultural best practices can increase the quantity \n     of carbon stored in farm soils, crops, and rangeland;\n       (7) although there is a tremendous quantity of carbon \n     stored in soil that supports agricultural operations in the \n     United States, the quantity of carbon stored in soil may be \n     increased by using a strategy that would benefit the \n     environment without implementing a United Nations-sponsored \n     climate change protocol or treaty;\n       (8) Federal research is needed to identify--\n       (A) the agricultural best practices that supplement the \n     natural carbon cycle; and\n       (B) Federal conservation programs that can be altered to \n     increase the environmental benefits provided by the natural \n     carbon cycle;\n       (9) increasing soil organic carbon is widely recognized as \n     a means of increasing agricultural production and meeting the \n     growing domestic and international food consumption needs \n     with a positive environmental benefit;\n       (10) agricultural best practices include the more efficient \n     use of agriculture inputs and equipment; and\n       (11) tax credits should be offered in order to facilitate \n     the widespread use of more efficient agriculture inputs and \n     equipment and to increase environmental benefits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to promote the adoption of children with special \nneeds; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE ADOPTION EQUALITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAdoption Equality Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator Chafee for \nhis leadership on behalf of vulnerable children, including our \nbipartisan work on this legislation. He joins me today as an original \nco-sponsor of this legislation as do Senators DeWine, Collins, Levin, \nLandrieu, Moynihan, Breaux, Kerrey, Dorgan, Conrad, Inouye, Durbin and \nTorricelli. Work on this legislation is based on the bipartisan work of \nthe Senate coalition that supported the 1997 Adoption and Safe Families \nAct.\n  A unique bipartisan coalition formed in 1997 worked hard to forge \nconsensus on the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (ASFA). This \nlaw, for the first time ever, establishes that a child's health and \nsafety must be paramount when any decisions are made regarding children \nin the abuse and neglect system. While this law was the most sweeping \nand comprehensive piece of child welfare legislation passed in over a \ndecade, more work needs to be done to truly achieve the goals promoted \nin the Act of safety, stability and permanence for all abused and \nneglected children. Senator Chafee and I and all of the other co-\nsponsors I have named committed ourselves to continuing that work and \nthat is why we are here today.\n  Throughout the process of developing the Adoption Act we heard about \nthe challenging circumstances facing children described as having \n``special needs''. These include children who are\n\n[[Page S5490]]\n\nthe most difficult to place into permanent homes, often due to their \nage, disability or status as part of a group of siblings needing to be \nplaced together. I spent time learning about the special needs children \nin my own state of West Virginia. Prior to the passage of ASFA, there \nwere 870 children, most with special needs, awaiting adoption in West \nVirginia. Today, I am proud to report that this number has been reduced \nto 621. The dedication of our state adoption staff, when combined with \nthe incentives and focus on permanence provided in ASFA have \nsuccessfully effected the placement of nearly a third of the waiting \nchildren.\n  One of the most significant provisions of ASFA was the assurance of \nongoing health care coverage for all children with special needs who \nmove from foster care to adoption. The Adoption Equality Act is an \nessential second step in this ongoing process. This important \nlegislation will promote and increase adoptions by making all children \nwith special needs eligible for Federal adoption subsidy. The bill is \ndesigned to ``level the playing field'' by ensuring that all children \nwith special needs, and the loving families who adopt them, have the \nsupport they need to grow and develop.\n  Current law provides for the payment of federal adoption subsidies to \nfamilies who adopt only those special needs children whose biological \nfamily would have been qualified for welfare benefits under the old \n1996 AFDC standards. Federal adoption subsidy payments provide \nessential income support to help families finance the daily costs of \nraising these special children (food, clothing) and also special \nservices (equipment, therapy, tutoring, etc.). Federal adoption \nsubsidies are a vital link in securing adoptive homes for special needs \nchildren who by definition would not be adopted without support.\n  Under current law, a child's eligibility for these important benefits \nis dependent on the income of his or her biological parents even though \nthese parents' legal rights to the child have been terminated, and \nthese are the parents who either abused or neglected the child. This \nis, simply, wrong. The Adoption Equality Act will eliminate this \nanomaly in Federal law by making all special needs children eligible \nfor Federal adoption subsidies.\n  First, the bill removes the requirement that an income eligibility \ndetermination be made in regard to the child's biological parents, whom \nthe child is leaving, thereby allowing Federal adoption subsidy to be \npaid to all families who adopt children who meet the definition of \nspecial needs.\n  Second, the bill gives States flexibility in determining their own \ncriteria, which may, but need not, include judicial determination, to \nthe effect that continuation in the home would be contrary to the \nsafety or welfare of the child, as well as their own definition of \nwhich of the children in their state are children with special needs.\n  Third, the bill requires that states re-invest the monies they save \nas a result of this bill back into their state child abuse and neglect \nprograms.\n  When we talk about how to help abused and neglected children in this \ncountry, many complex questions are raised about what constitutes best \npolicy, and how Federal tax dollars should be spent. Yet, at the heart \nof it all are the children who desperately want a family to call their \nown, and the families who want to adopt them. The lack of adequate \nfinancial resources to support these adoptions is often the only \nbarrier that stands between an abused child and a safe, loving and \npermanent home. With the numbers of abused and neglected children \nrising dramatically--in West Virginia alone child abuse reports have \ndoubled--from 13,000 in 1986 to over 26,000 in 1996--we need to remove \nevery barrier in our efforts to make a difference. A West Virginia \nfamily recently told me:\n\n       I knew we had enough love to give a child with special \n     needs--even siblings. But could we afford it? More children \n     means more of everything. This obstacle was removed through \n     the adoption subsidy program and we now have four children in \n     our lives. Our lives have truly changed. Special needs for us \n     was a very special way to adopt a waiting child.\n\n  Federal adoption subsidies are designed to encourage adoption of \nchildren with special needs--those children who have the hardest time \nfinding permanent, adoptive families. It is an absurd policy to \ndiscriminate against thousands of children with special needs based \nupon the income of their biological (and often abusive) parents. It is \ntime to create a Federal policy that levels the playing field and gives \nall children with special needs an equal and fair chance at being \nadopted.\n  I am confident that the Adoption Equality Act will do just that, and \nat the same time, with the re-investment requirement, states should \nhave the incentive to make additional improvements in their child \nwelfare systems. These will be valuable steps in our efforts to be more \nable to effectively address the needs of our Nation's most vulnerable \nchildren. I urge my colleagues join us in co-sponsoring and passing \nthis bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a brief fact \nsheet be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1067\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Federal adoption \n     subsidy payments provide essential income support to help \n     families finance the daily costs of raising these special \n     children (food, clothing) and also special services \n     (equipment, therapy, tutoring, etc.). Federal adoption \n     subsidies are a vital link in securing adoptive homes for \n     special needs children who by definition would not be adopted \n     without support.\n       Under current law, a child's eligibility for these \n     important benefits is dependent on the income of his or her \n     biological parents even though these parents' legal rights to \n     the child have been terminated, and these are the parents who \n     either abused or neglected the child.\n       Current law also allows for the payment of federal adoption \n     subsidies to families who adopt a ``special needs'' child who \n     meets all the requirements of title XVI with respect to \n     eligibility for supplemental security income benefits (SSI), \n     again, linking a child's eligibility for subsidy to the \n     income and assets of the biological parents as well as to the \n     child's disability.\n       Current law defines a child with special needs, as a child \n     who has a specific factor or condition (such as ethnic \n     background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling \n     group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions \n     or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which \n     it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed \n     with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance \n     under this section and medical assistance under title XIX, \n     and that except where it would be against the best interests \n     of the child because of such factors as the existence of \n     significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents \n     while in the care of such parents as a foster child, a \n     reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place \n     the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing \n     adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance \n     under title XIX.\n       Under current law, the amount of payments to be made are \n     determined through an agreement between the adoptive parents \n     and the State or local agency. This agreement takes into \n     account both the special needs of the child and the \n     circumstances of the adopting parents. It may be periodically \n     adjusted, and can continue to be paid until the child reaches \n     the age of 18 (or 21 if the child has a physical or mental \n     handicap which warrants that the payments continue). The \n     amount of payment may never exceed the amount that would be \n     paid as a foster care maintenance payment if the same child \n     had remained in foster care.\n\n\n                        Explanation of provision\n\n       This bill makes all special needs children eligible for \n     Federal adoption subsidies by ``delinking'' a child's \n     eligibility from the archaic AFDC guidelines, or other \n     income-eligibility determinations that would be based upon \n     the income of the biological parents, whom the child is \n     leaving.\n       First, the bill removes the requirement that an income \n     eligibility determination be made in regard to the child's \n     biological parents, thereby allowing Federal adoption subsidy \n     to be paid to all families who adopt children who meet the \n     definition of special needs.\n       The bill does NOT change the definition of special needs as \n     described above. Nor does this bill change the method by \n     which the payment amount is determined.\n       Second, the bill gives States flexibility in determining \n     their own criteria, which may, but need not, include judicial \n     determination, to the effect that continuation in the home \n     would be contrary to the safety or welfare of the child.\n       Third, the bill allows for Federal adoption subsidy to be \n     paid to families who adopt special needs children who meet \n     the medical/disability requirements, without requiring that \n     they, or their biological parents, meet the income standards, \n     of title XVI with respect to supplemental security income \n     benefits.\n       Fourth, the bill requires that states re-invest the monies \n     they save as a result of this bill back into their state \n     child abuse and neglect programs.\n\n\n                           Reason for Change\n\n       Federal adoption subsidies are designed to encourage \n     adoption of children with special needs--those children who \n     have the hardest time finding permanent, adoptive families. \n     It is an absurd policy to discriminate against thousands of \n     children with special needs based upon the income of their \n     biological (and often abusive) parents. It is time to create \n     a Federal policy that levels the playing field and gives all \n     children with special needs an equal and fair chance at being \n     adopted.\n       The proposed changes will do just that. They are designed \n     to remove a significant barrier to the adoption of these \n     children by making all special needs children eligible for \n     Federal adoption subsidies, regardless of income of the \n     biological (and often abusive) parents whom they are leaving.\n       At the same time, with the re-investment requirement, \n     states should have the incentive to make additional \n     improvements in their child welfare systems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Wellstone, \n        Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Johnson, Ms. Landrieu, and \n        Mr. Levin):\n  S. 1068. A bill to provide for health, education, and welfare of \nchildren under 6 years of age; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                early childhood development act of 1999\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr President, in the aftermath of the tragic school \nshootings in Littleton, and in this debate here in the Senate about \njuvenile justice, we've heard a great deal about efforts to keep guns \nout of the hands of violent students, we've heard about efforts to try \njuvenile offenders as adults, about stiffer sentences, about so many \nanswers to the problem of kids who have run out of second and third \nchances--kids who are violent, kids who are committing crimes, children \nwho are a danger to themselves and a danger to those around him. Mr. \nPresident, I was a prosecutor in Massachusetts before I entered elected \noffice. I've seen these violent teenagers and young people come to \ncourt, and Mr. President let me tell you there is nothing more tragic \nthan seeing these children who--in too many cases--have a jail cell in \ntheir future not far down the road, children who have done what is, at \ntimes, irreparable harm to their communities.\n  And Mr. President, I keep asking myself, why is it we only start to \ncare about these kids at that point--after the violence, after the \narrest, after the damage has been done, when it may be too late--when \nwe could have started intervening in our kids' lives early on, before \nit was too late. Mr. President, we can't say that we're having a real \ndebate about juvenile justice if we're not talking about early \nchildhood development efforts.\n  The truth is that early intervention can have a powerful effect on \nreducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education \nexpenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can reduce later \ndestructive behavior such as dropping out of school, drug use, and \ncriminal acts like the ones we have seen in Littleton and Jonesboro.\n  A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool found that at-\nrisk toddlers who received pre-schooling and a weekly home visit \nreduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic \nlaw breakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University Family \nDevelopment Study showed that providing quality early-childhood \nprograms to families until children reached age five reduces the \nchildren's risk of delinquency ten years later by 90 percent. It's no \nwonder that\n\n[[Page S5492]]\n\na recent survey of police chiefs found that nine out of ten said that \n``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more'' in \nthese early intervention programs.\n  Let me tell you about the Early Childhood Initiative (ECI) in \nAllegheny County, Pennsylvania--an innovative program which helps low-\nincome children from birth to age five become successful, productive \nadults by enrolling them in high quality, neighborhood-based early care \nand education programs ranging from Head Start, center-based child \ncare, home-based child care, and school readiness programs. ECI draws \non everything that's right about Allegheny County--the strengths of its \ncommunities--neighborhood decision-making, parent involvement, and \nquality measurement. Parents and community groups decide if they want \nto participate and they come together and develop a proposal tailored \nfor the community. Regular review programs ensure quality programming \nand cost-effectiveness. We're talking about local control getting \nresults locally: 19,000 pre-school aged children from low-income \nfamilies, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any child care or \neducation program. By the year 2000, through funding supplied by ECI, \napproximately 75% of these under-served pre-schoolers will be reached. \nEarly evaluations show that enrolled children are achieving at rates \nequivalent to their middle income peers. And as we know, without this \nleveling of the playing field, low-income children are at a greater \nrisk of encountering the juvenile justice system. That's a real \ndifference.\n  These kinds of programs are successful because children's experiences \nduring their early years of life lay the foundation for their future \ndevelopment. But in too many places in this country our failure to \nprovide young children what they need during these crucial early years \nhas long-term consequences and costs for America.\n  Recent Scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing \nchildren's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development \nwill result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our \nnation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the \nphysical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating \nenvironment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain \ncontains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are \nstars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons \ndevelops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched \ndevelop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age.\n  Mr. President, reversing these problems later in life is far more \ndifficult and costly. We know that--if it wasn't so much harder, we \nwouldn't be having this difficult debate in the Senate. Well I think \nit's time we talked about giving our kids the right start in their \nlives they need to be healthy, to be successful, to mature in a way \nthat doesn't lead to at-risk and disruptive behavior and violence down \nthe road.\n  We should stop and consider what's really at stake here. Poverty \nseriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, \nIQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also \nare at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. \nOf the 12 million children under the age of three in the United States \ntoday, three million--25 percent--live in poverty. Three out of five \nmothers with children under three work, but one study found that 40 \npercent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants \nprovided care of such poor quality as to actually jeopardize children's \nhealth, safety, or development. In more than half of the states, one \nout of every four children between 19 months and three years of age is \nnot fully immunized against common childhood diseases. Children who are \nnot immunized are more likely to contract preventable diseases, which \ncan cause long-term harm. Children younger than three make up 27 \npercent of the one million children who are determined to be abused or \nneglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and \nneglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than five and 45 percent were \nyounger than one.\n  Literally the future of millions of young people is at stake here. \nLiterally, that's what we're talking about. But is it reflected in the \ninvestments we make here in the Senate? I would, respectfully, say no--\nnot nearly enough Mr. President.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, our government expenditure patterns are \ninverse to the most important early development period for human \nbeings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce \nlater remedial and social costs, currently our nation spends no more \nthan $35 billion over five years on federal programs for at-risk or \ndelinquent youth and child welfare programs.\n  That is a course we need to change, Mr. President. We need to start \ntalking in a serious and a thoughtful way--through a bipartisan \napproach--about making a difference in the lives of our children before \nthey're put at risk. We need to accept the truth that we can do a lot \nmore to help our kids grow up healthy with promising futures in an \nearly childhood development center, in a classroom, and in a doctor's \noffice than we can in a courtroom or in a jail cell.\n  Mr. President, these questions need to be a part of this juvenile \njustice debate, but they're not being included to the extent to which \nthey should. My colleague Kit Bond and I are introducing our Early \nChildhood Development Act to move us forward in a bipartisan way \ntowards that discussion--and towards actions we can take to provide \nmeaningful intervention in the lives of all of our children. Kit Bond \nand I are appreciative of the deep support we've found for this \nlegislation, evident in the co-sponsorship of the Kerry-Bond bill by \nSenator Hollings, Senator Johnson, Senator Landrieu, Senator Levin, \nSenator Moynihan, Senator Wellstone, and my colleague from New Jersey, \nSenator Bob Torricelli. We are looking forward to working with all of \nyou, from both sides of the aisle, to make that debate on the Kerry-\nBond bill a productive one, a debate that leads to the kind of actions \nwe know can make the difference in addressing violence ten years before \nit starts, in getting all our children off to the right start towards \nfull and productive lives.\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Early \nChildhood Development Act of 1999'' with my friend and colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  Through this legislation, we are seeking to support families with the \nyoungest children to find the early childhood education and quality \nchild care programs that can help those families and parents provide \nthe supportive, stimulating environment we all know their children \nneed.\n  Recent research shows that the first few years of life are an \nabsolutely crucial developmental period for each child with a \nsignificant bearing on future prospects. During this time, infant brain \ndevelopment occurs more rapidly than previously thought, and the \nsensations and experiences of this time go a long way toward shaping \nthat baby's mind in a way that has long-lasting effects on all aspects \nof the child's life.\n  And parents and family are really the key to this development. Early, \npositive interaction with parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and \nother adults plays a critical role.\n  Here's what's going on during these amazing early years that in so \nmany ways are crucial to each child. At birth, a baby's brain contains \n100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in \nthe Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops \nover time. Most things happening in the surrounding world--such as a \nmother's caress, a father's voice, even playing with a brother or \nsister--helps this wiring pattern expand and connect. A baby with a \nstimulating environment will make these connections at a tremendous \nrate. However, infants and children who play very little or are rarely \ntouched or stimulated develop brains that can be 20 to 30 percent \nsmaller than normal for their age.\n  Really we shouldn't be surprised that parents have known \ninstinctively for generations some of these basic truths that science \nis just now figuring out. Most parents just know that babies need to be \nhugged, caressed, and spoken to.\n  Of course, the types of interaction that can most enhance a child's \ndevelopment change as the baby's body and mind grow. The types of \nbehavior that are so instinctual for the youngest babies may not be \nquite so obvious for\n\n[[Page S5493]]\n\ntwo- and three-year-olds. Raising a child is perhaps the most important \nthing any of us will do, but it is also one of the most complicated.\n  And parents today also face a variety of stresses and problems that \nwere unheard of a generation ago. In many families, both parents work. \nWhether by choice or by necessity, many parents may not be able to read \nmountains of books and articles about parenting and child development \nto keep perfectly up-to-date on what types of experiences are most \nappropriate for their child at his or her particular stage of \ndevelopment. They also must try to find good child care and good \nenvironments where their children can be stimulated and educated while \nthey work. Simply put, most parents can probably use a little help.\n  Many communities across the country have developed successful early \nchildhood development programs to meet these needs. Most of the \nprograms work with parents to help them understand their child's \ndevelopment and to discuss ways to help further develop the little \nbaby's potential. Others simply provide basic child care and an \nexciting learning environment for children of parents who both have to \nwork.\n  In a report released in 1998, the prestigious RAND Corporation \nreviewed early childhood programs like these and found that they \nprovide higher-risk children with both short- and long-run benefits. \nThese benefits include enhanced development of both the mind and the \nchild's ability to interact with others, they include improvement in \neducational outcomes, and they include a long-term increase in self-\nsufficiency through finding jobs and staying off government programs.\n  Of course, it's no mystery to many people from Missouri that this \ntype of program can be successful. In Missouri, we are both proud and \nlucky to be the home of Parents as Teachers. This tremendous initiative \nis an early childhood parent education program that has been designed \nto empower all parents to giver their young child the best possible \nstart in life. Expanding Parents as Teachers to a statewide program was \nperhaps my proudest accomplishment when I was Missouri's Governor.\n  With additional resources, these programs could be expanded and \nenhanced to improve the opportunities for many more infants and young \nchildren. And we have found that all children can benefit from these \nprograms. Economically successful, two-income families can benefit from \nearly childhood programs just as much as a single-parent family with a \nmother seeking work opportunities.\n  The legislation that Senator Kerry and I are introducing will support \nfamilies by building on local initiatives like Parents as Teachers that \nhave already been proven successful in working with families as they \nraise their infants and toddlers. The bill will help improve and expand \nthese successful programs, of which there are numerous other examples, \nsuch as programs sponsored by the United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, as \nwell as state initiatives such as ``Success by Six'' in Massachusetts \nand Vermont and the ``Early Childhood Initiative'' in Pennsylvania.\n  The bill will provide federal funds to states to begin or expand \nlocal initiatives to provide early childhood education, parent \neducation, and family support. The bill will also expand quality child \ncare programs for families, especially infant care. Best of all, we \npropose to do this with no federal mandates, and few federal \nguidelines.\n  Many of our society's problems, such as the high school dropout rate, \ndrug and tobacco use, and juvenile crime can be traced in part to \ninadequate child care and early childhood development opportunities. \nIncreasingly, research is showing us that a child's social and \nintellectual development as well as there likelihood to become involved \nin these types of difficulties is deeply rooted in the early \ninteraction and nurturing a child receives in his or her early years.\n  Ultimately, it is important to remember that the likelihood of a \nchild growing up in a healthy, nurturing environment is the primary \nresponsibility of his or her parents and family. Government cannot and \nshould not become a substitute for parents and families, but we can \nhelp them become stronger by equipping them with the resources to meet \nthe everyday challenges of parenting.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1069. A bill to provide economic security and safety for battered \nwomen, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           battered women's economic security and safety act\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I am joined by Senator Murray \nand Senator Schumer in introducing the Battered Women's Economic \nSecurity Act. Battered women face tremendous economic barriers when \nthey leave their abusive relationships and set out to make a new life \nfor themselves and their children. Our bill addresses the numerous and \ncritical issues that victims of domestic violence face as they try to \nescape the violence in their lives.\n  I know that Senator Murray joins me in applauding Senator Biden's \nefforts in crafting legislation to reauthorize the programs in the \nViolence Against Women Act. As I and many of my colleagues have heard \nfrom folks back home, these programs have provided invaluable and life \nsaving resources to battered women and their families. I am proud to be \nan original co-sponsor of the bipartisan bill that Senator Biden has \ndeveloped to build on the success of VAWA I and expand those programs.\n  As a result of VAWA I, we now have an infrastructure in place that \nhelps the community respond to this violence. VAWA provides the \nresources to enable local law enforcement and the courts prosecute \nthose who batter women. And many other programs are now in place to \nhelp women leave their abusers.\n  But, when a woman does take the initial step to leave her abuser and \nseek help, she is beginning a journey that is filled with obstacles, \nlargest of which are economic. All to often battered women stay with \ntheir abuser because of the economic support he provides for her and \nher children. Now that we have begun to build an infrastructure that \nprovides for the initial immediate needs of shelter and legal services, \nwe need to look at the bigger picture. We must provide economic \nsupports that allow battered women to provide for themselves and their \nchildren, and keep them safe after they leave temporary shelters. That \nis the reason Senator Murray and I are introducing the Battered Women's \nEconomic Security Act.\n  The Battered Women's Economic Security Act addresses the economic \nobstacles women who are victims of domestic violence face when trying \nto leave their abuser. For example, finding affordable and safe housing \nis critical for all battered women and their children, but particularly \nfor low-income women. A 1998 report funded by the Ford Foundation found \nthat of all homeless women and children, 50 percent of them are fleeing \ndomestic violence. Let me say that again, half of all homeless women \nand children leave their home because the violence there threatens \ntheir lives.\n  Not only are over half of homeless women fleeing violence, but too \nmany of them do not find shelter that they need. A report from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors found that homeless shelters are finding an \nincreasing need for women and children. Of that growing need, 1 out of \nevery 3 families that shows up at a homeless shelter is turned away, \nand ends up on the street for the night.\n  It is simply unacceptable for us to allow women and children, who are \nfleeing violence, to be turned out into the streets. When are we as a \nsociety going to stand up and say no more? Without safe shelter, women \nand their children will continue to stay in violent relationships \nbecause at least they have a roof over their heads. Such a situation is \nshameful in such a prosperous country as our own, and in such a booming \neconomy as this one.\n  Our bill makes sure that money goes directly to shelters for victims \nof domestic violence so that the people who are directly involved with \nhelping battered women can help them find new housing. We also made \nsure that our bill provided resources to find that new housing by \nboosting the McKinney Homeless Act to provide funding for battered \nwomen and their children.\n  Anyone who has known someone fleeing a violent relationship or has \ntalked\n\n[[Page S5494]]\n\nto advocates knows that safe shelter and housing are the first and \nimmediate needs. But women cannot stay in shelters or transitional \nhousing indefinitely. Women also need to find work to keep them on that \npath to independence and safety. Our bill protects women in the \nworkplace so that they can keep their job and continue to deal with the \nmultitude of issues that arise when a woman flees a violent \nrelationship.\n  All too often, domestic violence follows women to work. According to \nrecent studies, between 24 and 30 percent of women surveyed had lost \ntheir job, due at least in part, to domestic violence. Many victims \nlose their jobs because of their batterer's disruptive behavior. Many \nmiss work because they are beaten. Others miss work because their \nabusers force them to stay home.\n  Many companies are poorly educated about the impact of domestic \nviolence on women at work. Employers may fail to grant sufficient time \noff to attend civil or criminal legal proceedings or for safety \nplanning. Some battered women find themselves penalized by their \nabuser's actions when employers dismiss or otherwise sanction employees \nonce they learn they are in an abusive relationship One study found \nthat 96% of the women who were working while involved in an abusive \nrelationship had problems at work. Problems run the gamut from being \nlate to missing work to having difficulty performing their job. More \nthan 50 percent of these women reported being reprimanded at work for \nsuch problems and more than a \\1/3\\ of them said they had lost their \njobs as a result.\n  Our bill allows women to use the Family and Medical Leave Act to take \ntime off to deal with the problems arising from leaving a violent \nrelationship. Women need to deal with the court and legal system when \nthey file for protective orders. Many times women need counseling for \nthemselves and their children to support them as they establish a life \nseparate from their batterers. Allowing women to use the FMLA to take \nthis necessary time off will help women become more productive workers \nand give then the financial independence they need to begin a new, \nviolence free life.\n  Not only do we need to provide women with the flexibility that they \nneed, but need to ensure that their rights are protected should they \nunfairly lose their job. This bill prohibits discrimination against an \nemployee based on her status or experience as a victim of domestic \nviolence. It recognizes that we need not only policies that prohibit \ndiscrimination, but teeth to give those policies some bite. Our bill \nwould give women the legal means to challenge any discrimination they \nmay have faced as a result of being a victim of domestic violence.\n  As many of you know, we are still struggling to get all sectors of \nsociety to understand that domestic violence affects all aspects of a \nbattered woman's life. Too many times women who have applied for health \ninsurance are denied or charge exorbitant rates when insurance \ncompanies find out that they are victims of domestic violence. This is \noutrageous! Insurance discrimination penalizes victims of domestic \nviolence for the actions of their abusers. Our bill makes sure that \nthis form of discrimination will not be allowed.\n  VAWA I took the first step in dedicating federal resources to \naddressing the domestic violence crisis, but its focus is law \nenforcement and emergency response. We need to go to the next level to \ntruly end violence against women. We need to address their economic \nneeds and problems. I believe our legislation meets this test and will \neliminate many of the economic barriers that trap women and children in \nviolent homes and relationships.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nBattered Women's Economic Security and Safety Act of 1999--Legislative \n                                Summary\n\n\n                 TITLE I.--Domestic Violence Prevention\n\n       Subtitle A.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenator Wellstone to introduce the Battered Women's Economic Security \nAct. This has been a seven year effort and one that I will continue to \npursue. I want to thank Senator Wellstone for his efforts on this \nimportant legislation. I also need to recognize the leadership of\n\n[[Page S5495]]\n\nSenator Biden regarding the Violence Against Women Act. Without his \nwork on this historic legislation since 1994, we could not be here \ntoday talking about the economic needs of victims of domestic violence.\n  In 1994, we enacted the landmark Violence Against Women Act. For the \nfirst time, Congress said violence against women was a national \ndisgrace and a public health threat. We had to act. This was no longer \njust a family matter or a family dispute, this was and is a serious \nthreat against women and a serious threat to the community. We have had \npolice officers in Washington state killed responding to domestic \nviolence calls. We have seen too many women in the emergency room and \ntoo many families devastated by violence.\n  VAWA set in motion a national response to this crisis. We are now in \nthe process of reauthorizing and strengthening VAWA. This is my major \npriority. Reauthorization of VAWA cements the foundation we need to \nbuild the structure that will ultimately end domestic violence and \nabuse.\n  The Battered Women's Economic Security Act takes the next logical \nstep. As a result of the work that I have done concerning family \nviolence, I have come to understand that the real long-term solution is \nto tear down the economic barriers that trap women in violent homes and \nrelationships.\n  Our legislation addresses many of the economic barriers that I know \nforce a cycle of violence. I have met with many of the advocates in the \nstate of Washington and heard from them first hand, about how these \nbarriers make long term security for women and their children \ndifficult. From housing to child care to job protection to welfare \nwaivers, our legislation attempts to deal with the long term economic \nproblems.\n  Women should not have to be forced to choose between job security and \nviolence. Each year one million individuals become victims of violent \ncrimes while working on duty. Men are more likely to be attacked at \nwork by a stranger, women are more likely to be attacked by someone \nthey know. One-sixth of all workplace homicides of women are committed \nby a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend or ex-boyfriend. Boyfriends and \nhusbands, both current and former, commit more than 13,000 acts of \nviolence against women in the workplace every year. This does not \ninclude harassment or the threat of violence. Clearly, women face a \nserious threat in the work place and yet if they leave to avoid harm, \nthey are denied workers compensation. Perhaps even more offensive is \nthe fact that some states require victims of domestic violence to seek \nemployment in order to receive TANF benefits. To have any economic \nsafety net some women are forced to jeopardize their own safety.\n  This is not just an issue that effects victims of domestic violence. \nWe all suffer the economic consequences of violence. it has been \nestimated that work place violence resulted in $4.2 billion in lost \nproductivity and legal expenses for American businesses. From what I \nhave heard from victims and advocates, this is a very conservative \nestimate. The health care costs are also equally staggering. Both the \nAmerican Medical Association (AMA) and the Surgeon General have labeled \nviolence against women a public health threat. Violence is the number \none reason women ages 19 to 35 end up in the emergency room. One out of \nevery three women can expect to be the victim of violence at some point \nin her life.\n  Our legislation would also prohibit discriminating against victims of \ndomestic violence in all lines of insurance. If a woman seeks treatment \nin an Emergency Room and reports this as domestic violence, she should \nnot be denied disability or life insurance. If an estranged husband \nburns the house to the ground the woman should not be denied \ncompensation simply because it was an act of domestic violence. To say \nthat victims of domestic violence engage in high risk behavior similar \nto sky diving or race care driving is simply outrageous. It is the \nultimate example of blaming the victim.\n  Our legislation is not the final solution, but it begins the process \nof addressing long term economic needs. I am hopeful that once we have \nsecured reauthorization of VAWA we can begin to focus on these economic \nproblems. Without VAWA we have no foundation.\n  I will be working with Paul and other Members of the Senate towards \nenactment of key provisions of the bill. I am also committed to \ncontinuing my work with Senator Biden in an effort to enact Violence \nAgainst Women Reauthorization during this session.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to review the Battered Women's Economic \nSecurity Act. I encourage all of you to talk to your advocates and your \npolice, ask them what issues keep women trapped in a violent home or \nrelationship. Ask them what needs to be done to provide long term \nsolutions. I know that after careful review and consideration, you will \nreach the same conclusions. There are economic barriers that must be \ntorn down. I hope that many of you will join in cosponsoring this \nlegislation and work with me to enact this comprehensive solution to \nending the cycle of violence that too many women and children face \nevery day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Voinovich, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Lott, \n        Mr. Nickles, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Mack, Mr. Coverdell, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Gregg, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Helms, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Chafee, and \n        Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 1070. A bill to require the Secretary of Labor to wait for \ncompletion of a National Academy of Sciences study before promulgating \na standard, regulation or guideline or ergonomics; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           sensible ergonomics needs scientific evidence act\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Small Business to introduce the Sensible Ergonomics Needs \nScientific Evidence Act of SENSE Act. This bill calls on the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to do the sensible \nthing--wait for sound science before imposing new ergonomics \nregulations on small businesses. If enacted, the SENSE Act would \nrequire OSHA to wait for the results of a study by the National Academy \nof Sciences (NAS) before issuing proposed or final regulations, \nstandards or guidelines on ergonomics. As a native of Missouri, the \n``Show Me State,'' waiting for the NAS study makes good sense to me.\n  In introducing the SENSE Act, I am pleased to be joined by numerous \ncolleagues from all across the country--including Senators Enzi, \nJeffords, Burns, Voinovich, Snowe, Ashcroft, McConnell, Lott, Nickles, \nHutchinson, Mack, Coverdell, Collins, Shelby, Kyl, Fitzgerald, Abraham, \nGregg, Hutchison, Helms, Bunning, Crapo, Bennett, DeWine, Hagel, \nSessions, and Chafee. These Senators, like me, agree with their small \nbusiness constituents that it makes good sense for OSHA to wait for the \nresults of the NAS study before proposing additional regulatory \nrequirements for small businesses.\n  Just last year, Congress and the President agreed to spend $890,000 \nfor NAS to undertake a thorough, objective, and de novo review of the \nscientific literature to examine the cause-and-effect relationship \nbetween repetitive tasks in the workplace and musculoskeletal \ndisorders. The study is intended to achieve a scientific understanding \nof the conditions and causes of musculoskeletal disorders. The NAS has \nselected a panel of experts to conduct the study. The panel will \nexamine the scientific data on the multiple factors and influences that \ncontribute to musculoskeletal disorders and answer seven questions \nprovided by Representatives Bonilla and Livingston. The NAS will \ncomplete its study by January 2001. As intended by Congress and the \nPresident, the NAS study will assist OSHA and the Congress in \ndetermining whether sound science supports a comprehensive ergonomics \nregulation as envisioned by OSHA.\n  In theory, an ergonomics regulation would attempt to reduce \nmusculoskeletal disorders, such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, muscle aches \nand back pain, which, in some instances, have been attributed to on-\nthe-job activities. However, the medical community is divided sharply \non whether scientific\n\n[[Page S5496]]\n\nevidence has established a true cause-and-effect relationship between \nsuch problems and workplace duties. We need to understand the \nrelationship between work and these injuries before moving forward.\n  Regrettably, rather than waiting for NAS' findings, OSHA now plans to \npublish a proposed rule by September of 1999. In fact, OSHA officials \nhave suggested that a final rule could be issued by the end of 2000--\njust a few months before NAS will complete its study. This simply \ndoesn't make sense. The NAS study should identify scientific and \nmedical studies that are based on sound science and provide solid \nscientific evidence regarding the causation of ergonomics injuries. Our \nintent is simply to ensure that the requirements of any ergonomics \nprogram proposed by OSHA are based on sound science and are effective \nto improve workplace safety and health. It only makes sense for OSHA to \nwait for the scientific and medical information needed to know whether \nit is headed down the right path.\n  Waiting for the NAS study won't stop the progress being made as \nergonomic principles are applied to the workplace. And, progress is \nbeing made. According to recent data from the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, the number of injuries and illnesses involving repeated \ntrauma, strains, sprains, tears, and carpal tunnel syndrome are all on \nthe decline. Employers are actively implementing measures to address \nergonomic risk factors. The SENSE Act is in no way intended to \ndiscourage employers from continuing to implement voluntary measures \nwhere appropriate and effective. Similarly, the SENSE Act does not \nprevent OSHA from continuing to work on ergonomics. In fact, I would \nencourage OSHA to use the time prior to the completion of the NAS study \nto research ergonomics further, identify successful prevention \nstrategies, and provide technical assistance. For those who would argue \nthat waiting for the NAS study will result in more employees being \ninjury, OSHA can exercise its enforcement authority under the General \nDuty Clause, Section 5(a)(1) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, \nto ensure a safe workplace and address any significant ergonomic \nhazards. My bill doesn't change that authority provided under current \nlaw.\n  Simply put, the SENSE Act requires OSHA to wait for NAS to complete \nits study and submit the findings in a report to Congress. Congress \nwould then have 30 days to review the final report before OSHA issues \nproposed or final regulations, standards or guidelines. From where I \nstand, it only makes sense for Congress and OSHA to have the benefit of \nthe NAS study before OSHA proposes to require employers to implement a \ncomprehensive program addressing musculoskeletal disorders.\n  Tomorrow in the other body, the compansion bill to the SENSE Act is \nscheduled for mark up. H.R. 987, known as the ``Workplace Preservation \nAct,'' was introduced by Representantive Roy Blunt from Missouri on \nMarch 4. Representative Blunt is doing an excellent job shepherding his \nbill through the other body. In fact, his efforts have produced a \nbipartisan list of 138 cosponsors. I expect the Senate to show similar \nsupport for our Nation's small businesses.\n  I urge my collagues in the Senate to take a good look at the SENSE \nAct and join us in supporting legislation to ensure that the federal \ngovernment does not propose an ergonomics regulation for small \nbusinesses until Congress can assess the findings of the NAS study.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Sensible Ergonomics Needs Scientific \nEvidence (SENSE) Act be printed at this point in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 1070\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Sensible Ergonomics Needs \n     Scientific Evidence Act'' or the ``SENSE Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Department of Labor, through the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration (referred to in this Act as \n     ``OSHA''), has announced that it plans to propose regulations \n     during 1999 to regulate ``ergonomics'' in the workplace. A \n     draft of OSHA's ergonomics regulation became available in \n     February 19, 1999.\n       (2) In October, 1998, Congress and the President agreed \n     that the National Academy of Sciences shall conduct a \n     comprehensive study of the medical and scientific evidence \n     regarding musculoskeletal disorders. The study is intended to \n     evaluate the basic questions about diagnosis and causes of \n     such disorders. Given the uncertainty and dispute about these \n     basic questions, and Congress' intention that they be \n     addressed in a comprehensive study by the National Academy of \n     Sciences, it is premature for OSHA to propose a regulation on \n     ergonomics as being necessary or appropriate to improve \n     workers' health and safety until such study is completed.\n       (3) An August, 1998, workshop on ``work related \n     musculoskeletal injuries'' held by the National Academy of \n     Sciences reviewed existing research on musculoskeletal \n     disorders. It showed that there is insufficient evidence to \n     assess the level of risk to workers from repetitive motions.\n       (4) A July, 1997, report by the National Institute for \n     Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reviewing \n     epidemiological studies that have been conducted of ``work \n     related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper \n     extremity, and low back'' showed that there is insufficient \n     evidence to assess the level of risk to workers from \n     repetitive motions. Such evidence would be necessary to write \n     an efficient and effective regulation.\n\n     SEC. 3. DELAY OF STANDARD, REGULATION OR GUIDELINE.\n\n       The Secretary of Labor, acting through the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Administration, may not propose or issue in \n     final form any standard, regulation, or guideline on \n     ergonomics until--\n       (1) the National Academy of Sciences--\n       (A) completes a peer-reviewed scientific study, as mandated \n     by Public Law 105-277, of the available evidence examining a \n     cause and effect relationship between repetitive tasks in the \n     workplace and musculoskeletal disorders or repetitive stress \n     injuries; and\n       (B) submits to Congress a report setting forth the findings \n     resulting from such study; and\n       (2) the expiration of the 30-day period beginning on the \n     date on which the final report under paragraph (1)(B) is \n     submitted to Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 1071. A bill to designate the Idaho National Engineering and \nEnvironmental Laboratory as the Center of Excellence for Environmental \nStewardship of the Department of Energy land, and establish the Natural \nResources Institute within the Center; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n\n      environmental stewardship and natural resources act of 1999\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nEnvironmental Stewardship and Natural Resources Act which I am \nintroducing today with Senator Craig as cosponsor.\n  The nuclear defense capability of the United States has protected our \nform of government and ensured our freedoms since its inception during \nWorld War II. In order to sustain and develop our nuclear deterrence, a \nvast industrial complex was established. This complex of facilities was \nbuilt under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission and its \nsuccessor agency, the Department of Energy. Uranium mines, factories, \nlaboratories, and reactors were located throughout the country to \nprovide nuclear and conventional components for weapons. These \nfacilities were mostly located on large tracts of land, which also \nincluded surrounding buffer areas for security.\n  With the end of the cold war, and the mutual reduction of the United \nStates and Russian nuclear arsenals, many of our nuclear facilities are \nclosing, changing or reducing their missions. Land management at these \nfacilities, throughout their production lives was limited to \naccomplishing their missions and providing isolation and security. \nProtection of the ecosystems and natural resources, on which our \nnuclear arsenal was built, did not rate high priority in the agency's \nplanning. Any environmental benefits or natural resources protection on \nthese facilities was truly incidental to their isolation.\n  In addition to lack of natural resource planning, there exists a \ncontamination legacy which has resulted in the largest and most \nexpensive cleanup program in the federal government. Regardless of the \neffectiveness and efficiency of the cleanup program, some levels of \ncontaminants will remain, and will need to be monitored and managed. \nLong term stewardship is the process of managing and protecting the \nnatural resources that are unaffected by contamination, and also the \ncontinual monitoring and stabilization of contaminants that remain in \nplace following mediation. Even after a\n\n[[Page S5497]]\n\nfacility is cleaned up and closed, no matter how effective the \nremediation effort, the federal government is still liable for any \nsubsequent action that may be necessary to insure that no harm will \ncome to humans or the environment.\n  The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, INEEL, \nhas a long history with the Atomic Energy Commission and the Department \nof Energy. Originally known as the National Reactor Testing Station, \nthis site constructed, tested, and operated 52 reactors for various \ndefense and civilian purposes since the early 1950's. All but a handful \nof these reactors have been decontaminated and dismantled. In addition \nto this nuclear mission, the INEEL has developed expertise and \nexperience in the modeling the movement of contaminants in the \nenvironment; and research and development of technologies necessary for \nthe detection, monitoring, stabilization, and mediation of \ncontamination. I propose, with this bill, to establsh the INEEL as the \nDepartment of Energy Center of Excellence for the development of \ntechnologies, techniques, and methodologies for the implementation of \nan effective Long Term Stewardship program throughout the nuclear \nweapons production complex.\n  I also propose the establishment of a Natural Resource Institute at \nthe INEEL. This institute will bring together scientists, scholars, and \nothers in the field of natural resources management, to study complex \nissues that affect natural resources policy. The institute will also \nwork on specific natural resource and environmental issues and \nproblems, by utilizing the resources of the INEEL, northwest \nuniversities, states, and various federal agencies. The INEEL is a \nnational laboratory, not is just a laboratory for the Department of \nEnergy. The expertise, experience, and resources of this site must be \nmade available to all. The natural Resource Institute will be the \nconduit for bringing expertise to the INEEL and for making information, \ndata, and good science available for the solution of natural resource \nissues throughout the inland northwest.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ASHCROFT (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Grassley, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1073. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974 to ensure that United \nStates industry is consulted with respect to all aspects of the WTO \ndispute settlement process; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            world trade organization enforcement act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, developing trade policy that will \nincrease Americans' competitiveness in the 21st century must be a \npriority of this Congress and of the administration. That is why I rise \ntoday, joined by Senators Daniel Inouye, Chuck Grassley, Conrad Burns, \nPat Roberts, Chuck Hagel, and Mike Enzi, to introduce the World Trade \nOrganization Enforcement Act of 1999. It is a bill that will increase \ntransparency and give the public more input into the dispute settlement \nprocess of the WTO. It is analogous to a ``Sunshine Law'' for the WTO.\n  The United States plays a major role in leading the world and shaping \nits economy and must continue to do so. We must be leaders, not simply \nparticipants. Our leadership as a country will be effective only if our \ntrade policy is clearly defined and is based on the vital interests of \nthe American people, because if Americans do not accept our leadership \non trade policy, neither will the rest of the world.\n  Our success of more than 200 years has been because American is a \nnation dedicated to We the People. We are a nation whose greatness \nflows not from government, but from the creativity and ingenuity of the \nAmerican people. Our service providers, manufacturers, retailers, \nfarmers and ranchers, and investors are top notch compared with their \ncompetitors, and it is time for us in public service to lay aside the \nvalues and priorities of Washington, D.C., and promote the values and \npriorities of the American people.\n  As I have traveled around Missouri, one thing is clear: citizens want \nAmerica to be defined today as she was 100-plus years ago. We have been \nknown as a land of ascending opportunity, that every generation in \nAmerica has more opportunity than the previous generation. This is a \ndefinition of America that we must maintain--``the best is yet to \ncome.''\n  Already, U.S. companies are first-class in their production, \nprocessing, and marketing at home and abroad--always responding to the \nchallenges of our competitive free-market system. While the United \nStates can produce more goods and provide more services than any other \ncountry, we account for only five percent of the world's consuming \npopulation. That leaves 95 percent of the world's consumers outside of \nour borders--this is an astounding statistic when we put it in terms of \ncreating opportunities.\n  For example, nearly 40 percent of all U.S. agricultural production is \nexported, but in September of last year, American farmers and ranchers \nfaced the first monthly trade deficit of U.S. farm and food products \nsince the United States began tracking trade data in 1941. Our farmers, \nor any other sector, simply will not succeed if they face descending \nopportunity. With manufacturing productivity increasing and with the \nconsuming capacity of the world largely outside of our borders, our \ncompanies need equally increasing access to foreign demand. The \nprosperity of the next generation of Americans is tied to our current \ncompetitiveness in global markets.\n  We must develop policies that will shape opportunities for the 21st \ncentury--opening new markets, ensuring that our trading partners live \nup to their commitments, and to the greatest extent possible avoiding \nsanctions that hurt only our market opportunities abroad.\n  I still believe we must make a concerted effort to pass fast track \ntrade negotiating authority. Because fast track has languished, U.S. \nbusinesses are increasingly being put at a competitive disadvantage. \nWhile Canada has already concluded a free trade agreement with Chile, \nand Mexico is expanding its free trade arrangement with Chile, the \nUnited States lags behind. Our companies clearly are being put at a \ncompetitive disadvantage in our own hemisphere. America must lead, not \nfollow--in our back yard and around the world.\n  As we approach the next round of negotiations in the WTO, fast track \nis crucial to U.S. businesses. Clearly, trade negotiations designed to \nreduce or eliminate barriers and trade distorting practices have \nbenefited our companies and our economy, and we need to continue our \nleadership role in multiple trade fora.\n  However, support for fast track and new negotiations is tied in the \npublic mind to the benefit they receive from existing trade agreements. \nIt is of utmost importance that the United States closely monitor and \nvigorously enforce our trade agreements. The private sector must be \nable to rely on U.S. agreements to be productive and long-lasting.\n  Opening foreign markets looms before us as a brick barricade. With \nthe same will and authority of President Reagan before the Berlin Wall \nwhen he said--``Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall''--we must face \nhead-on the barricades before our exporters. It's not an easy task, but \nthen again, neither was dismantling the Evil Empire. As John Wayne said \nin ``The Big Trail'': ``No great trail is ever blazed without hardship. \nYou've got to fight. That's life.''\n  Just last week, the Europeans stood on their massive wall of \nprotectionism built across the trail of free trade and simply rejected \nU.S. beef, even in the face of having lost the WTO case. We've got a \ntrail to blaze--the Europeans cannot be allowed to make a mockery of \nthe competitive spirit of our cattle ranchers. In this case, results, \nnot words, count the most.\n  Failing to implement agreements already negotiated creates an \nenvironment of descending opportunity. It is imperative, therefore, \nthat the Administration follow through with enforcing the decisions the \nU.S. has won in the WTO. What good is winning a case if we are unable \nto enforce the judgment?\n  It is clear that the most contentious issues ever to be brought \nbefore the WTO--whether it is negotiating new agreements or suing the \ndispute settlement process to enforce existing ones--have been about \nthe agricultural policies of the United States and the European Union.\n  One of the significant changes in the dispute settlement process in \n1994 was that panels would be set up and panel\n\n[[Page S5498]]\n\ndecisions would be adopted but for a consensus against doing so. Also, \nstrict time lines were built into the process. Soon thereafter, the \nU.S. took two agriculture cases against the EU through the new WTO \ndispute process--the banana case and the beef case (which had already \nbeen before the GATT panel). The new dispute settlement changes in the \nWTO worked, and the United States won these two agriculture cases \nwithout the EU having the ability to block unilaterally the cases from \nmoving forward.\n  For every triumph, however, the United States has suffered multiple \ndefeats. Our most recent triumphs were getting the EU to accept a WTO \ndispute settlement process that is quick and binding, and winning \nagriculture cases against the EU in that settlement process. However, \nthe EU is now denying U.S. farmers and ranchers the benefits of the WTO \ncases we won by stalling endlessly in the implementation of those \ndecisions.\n  If the EU, or any other country, is allowed to use delaying tactics, \nthere could be detrimental effects on these agriculture cases and on \nfuture cases regardless of the sector litigated. Also, the public \nsupport for the WTO system and its ability to benefit U.S. interests \nwill be undermined.\n  It is essential that the administration make the EU beef ban a top \npriority. The United States has won this case against the EU numerous \ntimes, and we are clearly within our rights to benefit from the cases \nwe litigate and win.\n  We must take the position that if the EU insists on ``paying'' for \nits protectionism, the EU should ``pay'' at the highest levels \nallowable and on products that will hurt it the most. While U.S. \nranchers can never be compensated fully for the EU's protectionist \npolicies, the value of concessions withdrawn from the EU must at least \nequal the value of the beef producers current damage.\n  Beef producers in Missouri will not benefit if the level of \nretaliation is not such that will induce the EU to change its \nprotectionist policies. A strong response to the EU's treatment of U.S. \nagricultural products is long overdue. We must have reciprocity in our \ncross-Atlantic agricultural trade. If U.S. meat is not welcome in the \nEU, then EU meat should not be accepted in the United States.\n  The EU's repeated, damaging actions against America's cattlemen must \nnot go unaswered--that is why I have called on the Administration to \nretaliate with authority and that is why I am introducing the WTO \nEnforcement Act.\n  The WTO Enforcement Act has two major objectives: ensure that the \nU.S. government affords adequate transparency and public participation \nin the U.S. decision-making process, and begin multilateral \nnegotiations with a view toward incorporating more transparency and \nconsultation in the multilateral context of the WTO dispute settlement \nprocess.\n  If the farm groups and U.S. companies were to increase their public \ncomment in the implementation and post-implementation stages of the WTO \ndispute settlement process, this will heighten the pressure on the \nforeign country to comply with the Panel decisions. Currently, while \nthe USTR, Congress, and industry groups consult during the \nimplementation stages of Panel decisions, making the comment and \nreporting requirements more established and anticipated will increase \naccountability. The WTO system needs to be given a chance to work, but \nthe best way to do so is to increase pressure on those countries that \nwould try to circumvent the implementation of panels. This is \nimperative not only for agriculture and our relations with the EU, it \ncould affect all sectors that are litigated under the WTO dispute \nsettlement process.\n  The proposed modifications to U.S. domestic rules regarding dispute \nsettlement will prove more effective if the losing party to a WTO \ndispute provides to the winning party its plan to comply with the WTO \ndecision and if the winning party is given meaningfully opportunity to \ncomment on the plan prior to its implementation.\n  The WTO is currently in the midst of a review of the organization's \ndispute settlement procedures. Therefore, under the WTO Enforcement \nAct, the United States must request reforms that would oblige member \ngovernment's to submit a proposed remedy well in advance of the \ndeadline to comply to the decision and as well as consult with the \nother parties to the proceeding on the proposal.\n  If the WTO Enforcement Act is passed, the U.S. public would be able \nto obtain more information about the foreign government's plans for \ncompliance with WTO panel decisions and would be afforded a more formal \nopportunity to comment on how the process is working. If we negotiate \ntrade agreements for American citizens wishing to do business in \nforeign markets, they have every right to voice their support for or \nobjections to the way foreign governments or the U.S. government is \nmaking those agreements beneficial.\n  It is time for us to enact policies that reflect our support for U.S. \ncompanies' efforts to reach their competitive potential internationally \nand policies that create ascending opportunity for Americans for the \n21st century so that we can say, with confidence, ``the best is yet to \ncome.''\n\n

PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n                                 CHINA\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Smith \nof New Hampshire, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Brownback) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 103\n\n        Whereas the United States was founded on the democratic \n     principle that all men and women are created equal and \n     entitled to the exercise of their basic human rights;\n       Whereas freedom of expression and assembly are fundamental \n     human rights that belong to all people and are recognized as \n     such under the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights and \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;\n       Whereas the death of the former General Secretary of the \n     Communist Party of the People's Republic of China, Hu \n     Yaobang, on April 15, 1989, gave rise to peaceful protests \n     throughout China calling for the establishment of a dialogue \n     with government and party leaders on democratic reforms, \n     including freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and the \n     elimination of corruption by government officials;\n       Whereas after that date thousands of prodemocracy \n     demonstrators continued to protest peacefully in and around \n     Tiananmen Square in Beijing until June 3 and 4, 1989, when \n     Chinese authorities ordered the People's Liberation Army and \n     other security forces to use lethal force to disperse \n     demonstrators in Beijing, especially around Tiananmen Square;\n       Whereas nonofficial sources, a Chinese Red Cross report \n     from June 7, 1989, and the State Department Country Reports \n     on Human Rights Practices for 1989, gave various estimates of \n     the numbers of people killed and wounded in 1989 by the \n     People's Liberation Army soldiers and other security forces, \n     but agreed that hundreds, if not thousands, were killed and \n     thousands more were wounded;\n       Whereas 20,000 people nationwide suspected of taking part \n     in the democracy movement were arrested and sentenced without \n     trial to prison or reeducation through labor, and many were \n     reportedly tortured;\n       Whereas human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, \n     Human Rights in China, and Amnesty International have \n     documented that hundreds of those arrested remain in prison;\n       Whereas the Government of the People's Republic of China \n     continues to suppress dissent by imprisoning prodemocracy \n     activists, journalists, labor union leaders, religious \n     believers, and other individuals in China and Tibet who seek \n     to express their political or religious views in a peaceful \n     manner; and\n       Whereas June 4, 1999, is the tenth anniversary of the date \n     of the Tiananmen Square massacre: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) expresses sympathy to the families of those killed as a \n     result of their participation in the democracy protests of \n     1989 in the People's Republic of China, as well as to the \n     families of those who have been killed and to those who have \n     suffered for their efforts to keep that struggle alive during \n     the past decade;\n       (2) commends all citizens of the People's Republic of China \n     who are peacefully advocating for democracy and human rights; \n     and\n       (3) condemns the ongoing and egregious human rights abuses \n     by the Government of the People's Republic of China and calls \n     on that Government to--\n       (A) reevaluate the official verdict on the June 4, 1989, \n     Tiananmen prodemocracy activities and order relevant \n     procuratorial organs to open formal investigations on the \n     June fourth event with the goal of bringing those responsible \n     to justice;\n       (B) establish a June Fourth Investigation Committee, the \n     proceedings and findings of which should be accessible to the \n     public, to make a just and independent inquiry into all \n     matters related to June 4, 1989;\n       (C) release all prisoners of conscience, including those \n     still in prison as a result of their participation in the \n     peaceful prodemocracy protests of May and June 1989, provide \n     just compensation to the families of those killed in those \n     protests, and allow those exiled on account of their \n     activities in 1989 to return and live in freedom in the \n     People's Republic of China;\n\n[[Page S5501]]\n\n       (D) put an immediate end to harassment, detention, and \n     imprisonment of Chinese citizens exercising their legitimate \n     rights to the freedom of expression, freedom of association, \n     and freedom of religion; and\n       (E) demonstrate its willingness to respect the rights of \n     all Chinese citizens by proceeding quickly to ratify and \n     implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political \n     Rights which it signed on October 5, 1998.\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, today I, along with Senators \nWellstone, Feingold, Bob Smith, Bunning, Collins, Kyl, Sessions, \nGrassley, Abraham, Snowe, and Jeffords, am submitting a resolution \ncommemorating the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Ten \nyears ago, the Chinese Communist government unleashed lethal force on \npeaceful demonstrators in Beijing. For ten years, demonstrators from \nTiananmen have been suffering in prison.\n  The resolution that I am submitting today simply calls on the \ngovernment of the People's Republic of China to make amends. To \nreevaluate the verdict of Tiananmen Square. To release the prisoners. \nTo stop harassing Chinese citizens seeking freedom. It says that if \nthey are serious about being a respected member of the international \ncommunity, then they will implement and ratify the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights. They will respect universal \nstandards and they will respect their own citizens.\n  At the moment, there is a great deal of tension between the U.S. and \nChina. Chinese espionage of sensitive technology, allegations of \nillegal campaign donations, competing security interests in the Asia-\nPacific region, and disagreements over Kosovo are just a few problems--\nproblems that illuminate the adversarial behavior of the Chinese \nCommunist government.\n  Most recently, there has been a great deal of Chinese furor over the \nmistaken bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. I do not take \nlightly this egregious error and this tragic loss of life. But as \nregrettable as this mistake was, the Chinese government has been using \nthis event as a catch-all refutation of the United States. It was no \naccident that the human rights dialogue and the ongoing arms talks were \nother casualties of the embassy bombing--the two areas where the \nChinese government refuses to be responsible. It was no accident that \nthe Chinese government bused demonstrators from universities to the \nU.S. embassy where they pelted rocks at American property, breaking \nwindows, keeping Ambassador Sasser and his staff hostage at the \nembassy. It was no accident that the Chinese government used propaganda \nto inflame the emotions of the Chinese people.\n  But Mr. President, there is no moral equivalency in the accidental \nbombing of the embassy and the Tiananmen Square massacre. I the midst \nof the high stack of issues surrounding U.S.-China relations, I hope \nthat human rights does not tumble to the bottom. The well-being of the \nChinese people, the ability to express themselves, is fundamental to \nany future relationship between the U.S. and China. That is why I am \nsubmitting this resolution.\n  Mr. President, the Beijing protests began in April 1989 as a call for \nthe government to explain itself--to explain its dismissal of an \nofficial who had been sympathetic to students demanding political \nreform in 1986. The demonstrators, students and workers, asked that the \ngovernment take action against corruption. They asked for freedom for \nthe independent press. They asked for democratic reforms. These \nstudents from Beijing University and 40 other universities, these \nBeijing residents protested in and around Tiananmen Square. They held \nhunger strikes. They defied martial law. They were met with brutal \nrepression.\n  On May 30, after almost a month of student demonstrations in support \nof increased democratization in the Peoples Republic of China, the \nprotest leaders erected a symbol of their growing movement--a symbol to \nbe a ``powerful cementing force to strengthen our resolve'' and to \n``declare to the world that the great awakening of the Chinese people \nto democratic ideas has reached a new stage.'' The symbol these \nstudents chose was the Goddess of Democracy--a thirty-seven foot high \nmonument of foam and plaster with a striking resemblance to the Statute \nof Liberty. This symbol of democracy gave those thousands of onlookers \na hope for a future free of communism.\n  But on June 3, 1989, police officers attacked students with tear gas, \nrubber bullets, and electric truncheons. People's Liberation Army (PLA) \nofficers armed with AK-47s opened fire on the innocent people who would \ndare stand in their way. But that was not enough for the government. \nThey sent convoys of tanks to Tiananmen Square to absolutely crush the \ndemonstrators. Their armored vehicles rammed the Goddess of Democracy, \nknocking it down, flattening it beneath their steel treads. They killed \na symbol of democracy and massacred their own people. On June 4, the \nPLA and security forces killed 1,500 and wounded 10,000. By June 7, the \nChinese Red Cross reported 2,600 people aspiring to democracy dead, In \nthe end, the Chinese government killed and wounded thousands of \ndemonstrators. They imprisoned thousands more for their participation.\n  But the nightmare did not end there. For the hundreds that remain in \nprison, for their families, each passing day is a living horror. This \nten year terror must stop. The resolution that we are introducing today \nsimply calls on the government of the People's Republic of China to do \nwhat is right--to do what is consistent with their constitution and \ninternational standards. It is a message to those fighting for \ndemocracy--we will not forget the massacre of pro-democracy \ndemonstrators by police and PLA forces on June 3 and 4. We will not \nforget the suffering of those who saw their friends die for freedom. We \nwill not forget that with each passing day, hundreds of prisoners still \nlanguish in prison simply because they desire freedom in China.\n  Mr. President, I believe that it is time to move to a post-Tiananmen \nera. But this cannot happen without the release of Tiananmen Square \nprisoners. And it will not happen until we shed the scales of the \nClinton Administrations' blind China policy and open our eyes.\n  Let me suggest four tenets for an open-eye China policy. First, we \nmust re-engage our allies. Our relationship with China has come at the \nexpense of our relationships with Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. We \nneed to rebuild a realistic picture of security in the Asia-Pacific and \nrecognize China's aggressive military aims in the region--aims that \nwill only be reached at the expense of our allies.\n  Second, we must protect our sensitive technology. Recent \ninvestigations show that we need increased security at our national \nlabs and other facilities, common sense background checks, controls on \ntechnology transfers, and a Justice Department that does not hinder its \nown FBI's investigations. While espionage may be a fact of life, we can \nstill take comprehensive measures to minimize foreign spying. Serious \ntheft of nuclear and technological secrets have already increased \nChina's military prowess.\n  Third, we must engage the people of China, rather than the Communist \nregime. We need sustained engagement, not just one time, highly \npublicized political visits. I therefore advocate increased funding for \nRadio Free Asia, the Voice of America, democracy building programs, and \nrule of law initiatives.\n  Finally, businesses must do their part and aggressively advocate \nhuman rights. The door for China's entry to the WTO is still open, but \na WTO deal is not just a deal between the U.S. and China. It is also a \ndeal between the U.S. government and American businesses. A WTO deal \nmust include an understanding that American businesses in China must \nnot be complicit with slave labor or other human rights violations. \nInstead, American businesses must be advocates for human rights, to the \nBeijing government and to the people. The simple fact is that China \ndesperately wants American trade and American business. U.S. companies \nmust use this leverage to advance more than profits.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join with me in \nsupporting this bipartisan resolution--to recognize this regime for \nwhat it truly is and to never forget the tragedy that occurred ten \nyears ago on June 3 and June 4, 1989.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original co-\nsponsor of S. Res. 103, which marks the tenth anniversary of the \nTiananmen Square massacre of June 4, 1989, in China.\n\n[[Page S5502]]\n\n  The resolution conveys the sense of the Senate that the United States \nexpresses its sympathy for those killed at Tiananmen Square and \ncommends the Chinese citizens who have continued over the last decade \nto peacefully advocate greater democracy and respect for human rights \nin China. This resolution further calls on the authorities in China to \nreevaluate the events of June 1989, establish a commission to \ninvestigate what happened, release those still being held in connection \nwith the democratic rally, and cease current harassment and detention \nof those still seeking democratic reform. This resolution makes a \nsimple, clear request, one that the Senate has made many times before--\nfree the Tiananmen Square democratic protesters and accept the \nlegitimacy of the voices that still cry out for peaceful democratic \nreform in China.\n  Mr. President, first I would like this opportunity to express my deep \nregret at the unfortunate, and unintentional, bombing of the Chinese \nEmbassy in Belgrade. Regardless of my continuing concerns with some of \nChina's practices, I certainly feel great sorrow that innocent \ncivilians were hurt under these circumstances.\n  Nevertheless, we can not, we will not, let this tragic accident, nor \nthe impact it may have on our relations with China, silence our voices \non the subject of democracy and human rights in China, or cause us to \noverlook the continuing ramifications of the events in Tiananmen Square \nten years ago. China's human rights practices remain abhorrent, and we \nwill not allow recent events to dampen our continued vigilance and \nwillingness to condemn such practices. It is noteworthy that the \ndemonstrations in China in reaction to the bombing are perhaps the \nlargest since the Tiananmen Square protests. It is ironic that public \nprotest is OK when it serves the government's interest, and not OK when \nit threatens the government's hold on power. This is an unacceptable \ndouble standard, and I believe we would be derelict in our duties if we \ndid not keep our attention focused on the lack of freedom in China.\n  As we all know, this April, under considerable pressure from the \nCongress, the United States sponsored a resolution at the United \nNations Commission on Human Rights to condemn China's ongoing abuses of \nhuman rights. As in past years, China's leaders aggressively lobbied \nagainst efforts at the Commission earlier and more actively than the \ncountries that supported the resolution. Once again, Beijing's vigorous \nefforts have resulted in a ``no action'' motion at the Commission. \nWhile I commend the Administration's actions this year, I question \nwhether our late and halfhearted support for condemnation of China \ndoomed that resolution to failure. We must not allow China to believe \nthat its human rights practices are acceptable. We must remember that \nif was only under the pressure of previous Geneva resolutions that \nChina signed in 1997 the UN Covenant of Social Economic and Cultural \nRights and in October 1998 the International Covenant on Civil and \nPolitical Rights. We should also not overlook the fact that neither of \nthese important international documents has yet been ratified or \nimplemented.\n  Mr. President, while recent attention has been drawn to the Embassy \nbombing, repeated allegations of espionage and of efforts to influence \nour elections, and the negotiations for China's entrance to the WTO, \nthese current concerns should not obscure our views of the ongoing \nhuman rights abuses that abound throughout China and Tibet. According \nto Amnesty International, the human rights situation in China shows no \nfundamental change, despite the recent promises from the government of \nChina. At least 2,000 people remain in prison for counter-revolutionary \ncrimes that are no longer even on the books in China. At least 200 \nindividuals detained or arrested for Tiananmen Square activities a \ndecade ago are also still in prison. By China's own statistics, there \nare nearly a quarter of a million Chinese people imprisoned under the \n``re-education through labor'' system. This situation demonstrates that \nChina has yet to learn the lesson of Tiananmen Square--that the \naspiration of the Chinese people for human rights and democratic reform \nwill not disappear with time or repression.\n  On this, the tenth anniversary of the traumatic Tiananmen Square \nmassacre, we must remember the brave Chinese citizens who stood before \nthe tanks and gave their lives to express their hopes for freedom. They \nbreathed their last on the bloody pavement of Tiananmen, hoping that \ntheir sacrifice would help bring democratic reform and respect for \nhuman rights to their fellow countrymen. We must continue to honor \nthose who made such dramatic sacrifices for their beliefs. In this \nmomentous year in which China marks not only the tenth anniversary of \nTiananmen Square, but also the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of \nthe People's Republic of China, we must not choose silence on this \nissue. Only by repeating our demands for change, can we appropriately \nhonor those who were willing to sacrifice all to achieve a better life \nfor the people of China.\n  Mr. President, I strongly commend my friends, the Senator from \nArkansas (Mr. Hutchinson) and the Senator from Minnesota (Mr. \nWellstone) for their leadership on this important, longstanding \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5502-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n           committee on commerce, science, and transportation\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, it may be human nature to \noverlook the\n\n[[Page S5503]]\n\nhardships of previous generations. We don't think about suffering we \ndon't have to endure. This is the way it should be. And this is the \nhope of America's innovators, who work to ease misfortune for our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  One of those innovators is a 101-year-old woman from Sioux City, \nIowa. Louise Humphrey was a leading light in the battle against polio, \none of the most terrifying illnesses of our century. Because of her \nwork, and the work of others devoted to finding a cure, polio is \nvirtually non-existent in our country.\n  It's hard for anyone who didn't live through the 1940s and 1950s to \nunderstand fully the fear of polio. The disease was highly contagious \nand sometimes fatal. It attacked the lungs and the limbs. It \nimmobilized its victims, made them struggle for breath and often forced \nthem to breathe through mechanical iron lungs. Parents wouldn't allow \ntheir children to go swimming, or to drink out of public fountains, for \nfear of contagion. Those children fortunate enough to escape the \nillness saw their classmates return to school in leg braces and watched \nnews reels of people in iron lungs.\n  At the height of the epidemic, during the late 1940s and early 1950s, \npolio struck between 20,000 to 50,000 Americans each year. In one \nyear--1952--58,000 people caught the disease. Most of them were \nchildren.\n  Mrs. Humphrey of Sioux City became interested in polio before the \nheight of the epidemic. In the 1930s, according to the Sioux City \nJournal, she saw firsthand the ravaging effects of polio after meeting \na man who had been disabled by the disease. She and her husband, the \nlate Dr. J. Hubert Humphrey, a Sioux City dentist, became leaders in \nthe fight against polio. They headed the Woodbury County chapter of the \nNational Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. Mrs. Humphrey was elected \nstate chairman of the woman's division of the foundation.\n  The Humphreys raised thousands of dollars for equipment and therapy \nto battle the disease. They enlisted entertainers and circus performers \nin the cause, hosting these individuals at fund-raising parties. Their \nguests included Bob Hope, clown Emmett Kelly and a ham sandwich-eating \nelephant.\n  Their work contributed to a climate in which Jonas Salk developed the \nfirst polio vaccine. His vaccine, and another developed by Dr. Albert \nSabin, soon became widely available. Polio is virtually non-existent in \nour country, although it remains a Third World threat.\n  Mrs. Humphrey has said she has no secret for living such a long life. \nShe advises people to ``just be happy and be well.'' She has never had \nan ache or pain. What she did have in abundance was empathy, kindness, \ngenerosity and devotion. Because of her contributions, millions of \nAmerican children will live without a debilitating disease.\n  On June 3, Mrs. Humphrey will turn 102. In advance of her birthday, \nduring Older Americans Month, I want to thank Mrs. Humphrey for helping \nto make our country strong. Mrs. Humphrey, with her clear vision and \ncompassionate concern for America's children, perfectly illustrates the \ntheme of Older Americans Month: ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: \nToward a Society for All Ages.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5503-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JOE TAUB\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \na great friend, Joe Taub, in celebration of his 70th birthday on May \n19th. Joe is a tremendously hard worker and a world-class \nphilanthropist, and I'm proud to say he's been my friend for almost 50 \nyears.\n  Joe came from humble beginnings in Paterson, NJ to join me in \nfounding Automatic Data Processing in 1949. Today, the company employs \nover 30,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. Even after leaving ADP in \n1971, Joe continued to lead an active business life, starting his own \ncompany and becoming owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. \nAlong the way, Joe donated his time to several charities and with his \nwife, Arlene, established the Taub-Gorelick Laboratory at Memorial \nSloan Kettering Cancer Center to aid breast cancer victims.\n  Joe has always worked to improve the world around him. To help keep \ninner city kids off the streets, he financed several scholarships and \nstarted the Taub-Doby Basketball League. And he contributed to the \nredevelopment of Paterson by giving the city a museum documenting its \nhistory.\n  Mr. President, Joe isn't remarkable just for his business \nachievements and philanthropy. He's also been a loving, devoted husband \nfor 45 years and has done a wonderful job as a father and grandfather.\n  I would like to extend my heartfelt best wishes to a long-time friend \nand former business partner in honor of his 70th birthday. Joe, on \nbehalf of myself and all those whose lives you have touched, we wish \nyou the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5503-2", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING SAMUEL STROUM\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I submit the following letter to be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1999.\n     Mr. Kerry Killinger,\n     Honorary Chair, North West Industry Partnership, Seattle, WA.\n       Dear Mr. Killinger: tonight, you are gathered to recognize \n     the outstanding accomplishments of Samuel Stroum. Nothing \n     could give me more pleasure than to congratulate my friend, \n     Sam Stroum, the 1999 recipient of the Donnall Thomas Medal of \n     Achievement award. Dr. Thomas was a man of great vision, \n     integrity, determination, and he possessed a strong \n     commitment to helping his fellow citizens. Because Sam \n     personifies these same characteristics, it is only fitting \n     that he should be the recipient of this award.\n       For half a century, Sam has been an established leader in \n     our state. Sam has continued to give back to his community in \n     immeasurable and invaluable ways. He has set the tone, led by \n     example, and has propelled his peers to do better. Tonight as \n     Sam is being lauded for his many accomplishments and \n     contributions, I suspect that there as many untold stories \n     where Sam has quietly made a difference.\n       In the past decade, our state has experienced tremendous \n     developments in the high-tech industry. From the very \n     beginning, Sam could see the future of that industry and knew \n     how it would benefit Washington. He encouraged its \n     development and became actively involved in expanding the \n     software business in Washington, creating more jobs and \n     spurring unprecedented economic growth.\n       More importantly, Samuel understands that there is more to \n     life than business. There is art, community cohesion, and the \n     need and desire to continue one's education. Sam has rescued \n     community centers from financial disaster, expanded art \n     galleries, and raised funds for hundreds of organizations.\n       Sam is an invaluable asset to our community for his vision, \n     leadership, and compassion for those in need. I am convinced \n     that Washington state is far better because of him.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Slade Gorton,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5503-3", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5503-S5504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO THE RIGHT REVEREND MARION BOWMAN\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a solemn \ntribute to an educator and clergyman whose life spanned most of this \ngreat century: the Right Reverend Marion Bowman of Florida.\n  Father Marion Bowman passed away last week, and was buried on Friday, \nMay 14, 1999, at the St. Leo Abbey Cemetery. As coach, teacher and \npresident, Father Bowman was a guiding force at St. Leo College in St. \nLeo, FL. He is survived by a large and loving family, and a legion of \nalumni and friends of St. Leo College.\n  Born on June 30, 1905, in Lebanon, KY, he made his first profession \nof vows twenty years later, and was ordained as a priest in 1931. His \nassociation with St. Leo began as a young man; he graduated from St. \nLeo College Prep School in 1923.\n  Father Bowman served as the third abbot of St. Leo Abbey, from 1954-\n69. On April 27, 1970, Father Bowman was elected president of St. Leo \nCollege and served on the institution's Board of Trustees as well.\n  A versatile man, Father Bowman taught math, physics and chemistry at \nthe prep school, and for four years was St. Leo's sole coach, heading \nthe football, baseball, basketball and track teams. He also served as \nathletic director, and played a key role in converting St. Leo from a \nprep school to a college.\n  In 1971, St. Leo College bestowed an honorary Doctor of Humanities \ndegree on Father Bowman.\n\n[[Page S5504]]\n\n  Mr. President, as we approach a new millennium and look back on the \nall-but-completed Twentieth Century, we are reminded of the importance \nof the dedicated people who impart knowledge, teach values, coach \nathletes and manage our schools. Father Marion Bowman--teacher, cleric \nand friend of St. Leo College--did all those things and many more, and \nwe salute his dedication and his multiple contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/05/18/senate-section/article/S5504-1", "month": "05", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPLOYMENT OF A NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. HATCH.
