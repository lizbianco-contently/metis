Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk for Senator \nDodd, who is in transit, cosponsored by Senator Reid of Nevada and \nSenator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Dodd, for \n     himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Reed, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2857:\n       Strike section 101 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, Senator Dodd has worked on this issue for \nmany years. He will be here shortly.\n  I am very happy we are finally getting the opportunity to have a \nserious debate about some of the educational\n\n[[Page S900]]\n\nproblems we face in America today. It doesn't matter which of the 50 \nStates you go to, there are problems dealing with education. I would be \nvery happy if, rather than debating alternatives to public education, \nwe started debating how to improve public education. More than 90 \npercent of the children in America go to public schools. We should be \nfocused on how best to educate that 90-plus percent of children in \nAmerica today.\n  The Federal Government provides 6 percent of the total education \nspending--roughly $38 billion. That $38 billion, by the way, is just 2 \npercent of the total Federal Government's budget. So we spend in \nAmerica, the greatest nation in the world, the only superpower, 2 \npercent of our budget to educate our kids. Most Americans do not \nrealize how little the Federal Government contributes to education.\n  I repeat that figure. The Federal Government spends about 2 percent \nof its budget on education. Within these tight budget constraints, we \nmust focus on what works. I hope we will start talking about what works \nand about some of the things that maybe don't work as well and some new \nthings we need to do in the area of education. I hope we can spend some \ntime talking about and providing money for recruiting and training \nhigh-quality teachers, principals, and administrators. I hope we can \nspend some time talking about creating smaller classes and smaller \nlearning communities in large schools. We have had experiences around \nthe country from which we know that smaller schools work better than \nlarger schools.\n  Deborah Meyer is an expert in this field. She was a school \nadministrator in New York--a large school that is not doing well. She \ndecided, because they were doing so poorly in all areas, that they had \nto do something radically different. She spoke to her superiors. They \nagreed to break the school up into four separate schools, with teachers \nwho would report to separate administrators--four distinct schools. \nWithin a very short period of time, all test scores skyrocketed. \nEverything about those schools improved. Having four schools instead of \none school made it easier to teach the kids. The kids felt like they \nwere part of the community.\n  We need to talk about how we can create smaller schools and smaller \nclasses generally.\n  We all agree that we need to spend some time and provide resources so \nwe can have schools, teachers and administrators more accountable. We \nhave to ensure that children learn in modern, safe classrooms and \nrepair schools in urgent need of renovation.\n  When I was growing up in Southern Nevada, the place we all looked to \nwith great admiration was Boulder City, NV. It was the town that was \nformed as a result of Boulder Dam, now Hoover Dam. It was a wonderful \ncommunity. In southern Nevada, it was one of the few places that had \ngrass. It was a company town. They did not allow gambling. The only \nkind of alcohol that was allowed to be served was 3.2-percent beer. It \nwas really a unique town in Nevada. Kids did very well on all their \ntests. Their athletic teams were tremendous, even though it was a small \nschool.\n\n  A while ago, I was asked to visit that school. They wanted to show me \nhow that school had deteriorated physically--the plan, which had been \nthe admiration of all Nevada, had gone downhill. The gymnasium was \nrundown. The track where the kids would participate in athletics was in \nvery bad shape. In some places they did not even have hot water. They \ncould not bring in computers because the wiring was so bad.\n  A lot of schools are that way. There have been some improvements made \nto Boulder City High School, but it is still an old, old facility. It \nis a perfect example of a school that needs renovation. You may ask why \nisn't it renovated. Well, the Clark County school district, which is \nthe seventh or eighth largest school district in America, is growing \nvery rapidly; it is the fastest growing school district in all of \nAmerica, with approximately 220,000 kids. In 1 year, to try to meet the \ndemands of the children of Clark County, they dedicated 18 new \nschools--in one school district. They have to build an elementary \nschool every month to keep up with the growth in Clark County. They \nneed to have the resources to be able to renovate schools. They have \nbeen too busy building new schools.\n  That is why it is important that we do something to help local school \ndistricts renovate and build new schools. Of course, we need to expand \naccess to technology. One way of doing that is to have modern schools. \nWe have to ensure universal access to high-quality preschool programs \nand make college more affordable.\n  I have talked about Nevada; there is probably no better State than \nNevada to see the struggles with which our public schools in this \ncountry are dealing. Today, they are having a Governor's conference in \nWashington. Governors from around the United States are gathered here. \nIn the Nevada papers today, they are reporting a conversation with \nGovernor Guinn, newly elected from Nevada. He was formerly the \nsuperintendent of schools of Clark County when it was a relatively \nsmall school district. He is saying that one of the problems they are \nhaving in Nevada is the Federal Government is not helping enough, that \nthey are running $75 million to $80 million short just in the Clark \nCounty school district every year in the ability to take care of \nspecial ed students.\n  Well, that is what this amendment is all about. This amendment would \nprovide all or part of that $75 million for the Clark County school \ndistrict, so the Federal Government would, in effect, meet the \nobligation that it has. When it came to be that, instead of having \nseparate school districts, setting a different standard for children \nwho are handicapped, the Federal Government set standards. Now all \nschool districts have to meet the same standards. Prior to that time, \ndifferent school districts would have different standards for \nhandicapped children. The agreement, or reasoning, or idea was that it \nwould cost about 40 cents for each dollar extra to educate a \nhandicapped child. But the Federal Government hasn't met that \nobligation. Now it has even dropped in recent years. Instead of 40 \ncents, it is 6 cents. This amendment is an effort to raise that, to \ntake money and provide it to the handicapped children--those in need of \nhelp, the special needs children.\n  Clark County, as I have indicated, is exploding in population. In \njust 10 years, Clark County school district enrollment has more than \ndoubled. We can pick any school to show the growth, but let's take the \nschool called Silverado, a high school in Las Vegas. The school now has \nabout 3,800 students, which is 42, 45 percent over capacity. It is \nexpected to grow. Next year, they think Silverado will have over 4,000 \nstudents in it. For children at Silverado, it is not only a difficult \nlearning environment, but just to go to a restroom is a real problem. \nThey have the same number of restrooms that they would have for 40 \npercent less children. This problem at Silverado is true throughout the \nClark County school district. I am sorry to report that it is this way \naround many parts of the country. We have the need for new schools in \nClark County, some need renovations. Around many parts of the country, \nthe need is as bad for renovating schools as for building new ones.\n\n  In Clark County, we are struggling to find qualified teachers. Last \nyear, we had to hire almost 2,000 new schoolteachers in 1 year. That is \na real job. Our university system can't produce nearly enough teachers \nto meet the demands--almost 2,000 new teachers in one school district. \nWe need help in recruiting and training highly qualified teachers.\n  Nevada is a State--I am not happy to report--which has the highest \ndropout rate of any State in the country. But there is no State in the \nUnion that should feel smug about dropout rates. In America today, \n3,000 children drop out of school every day. These are children who are \ngoing to wind up being less than they could be. They certainly won't be \nas educated as they should be, or as productive economically as they \nshould be; they won't be able to provide for a family the way they \ncould. So high school dropouts is a problem. About 500,000 children \ndrop out of school in America every year. We need to do something about \nthat. That is a major problem that we need to address. I think and hope \nthat this amendment would relate directly to that and provide school \ndistricts with money for\n\n[[Page S901]]\n\nthose with special needs so they can use their money for other things \nsuch as renovating schools, doing something as it relates to making \nsure they have high quality teachers.\n  If we can come up with something that would keep some of those \nchildren in school--I am sure there is nothing we can do to keep all \n500,000 of them in school every year, but if we can reduce the number \nof dropouts by 100 a day, 200 a day, 500 a day, so at the end of the \nyear, instead of having 500,000 students dropping out of school, we \nwould have 400,000, or 300,000. The fact is that we have to do \nsomething about this problem.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, and I offered amendments \nin the past two Congresses. The year before last we offered an \namendment that passed the Senate and was killed in the House last year, \nI am sorry to report, on a strictly partisan vote. Our amendment \ndealing with dropouts was defeated. It was strictly a party-line vote.\n  What would our amendment have done? It would have created, within the \nDepartment of Education, a dropout czar, someone whose job it would be \nto focus only on high school dropouts in this country. There are \nprograms around the country that work quite well. Many of them are very \nsmall, but we need somebody to help each school district, to be \navailable, not to force the will of the Federal Government on local \nschool districts, but to be available with resources to see if they can \ndo something to help kids stay in school. If the school district wanted \nhelp, they could come to the dropout czar in the Department of \nEducation and get help.\n  I hope we can look at that during this debate to see what we can do \nto keep kids in school. As I said, the underlying amendment that we are \ndebating now certainly would allow us to take some of that money now \nbeing used for special education and use it for programs such as high \nschool dropouts.\n  The Federal Government has no intention of taking away the ability of \nlocal school districts to make their decisions, but what we need to be \nis a resource, to be a resource to help public education in America \ntoday. School districts all over America are begging for our help. They \nrecognize there is not a movement in Washington to take over local \nschool districts.\n  We have to recognize that schools should be controlled at the local \nlevel. Resources should be provided by the Federal Government, and, in \nmy opinion, far more resources than 2 percent of the Federal budget. \nWhy? Because we need to recognize that schools all over America are \nstruggling. They are struggling because they cannot meet the high \ninterest payments on the bonds they had to let to borrow money to build \nthese schools. We recognize that around the country they are having \ntrouble passing bond issues to provide for new schools and for \nrenovating new schools.\n  We know there is a shortage of teachers. We have to do a better job \nof making sure teachers, who are educated at teachers colleges and \nother university systems around the country, are well qualified and \nmeet certain minimum standards. We have to focus on this to make sure \nwe have high-quality teachers and good administrators.\n  We have to recognize that smaller classes are important. We have to \nrecognize on a Federal level we have a national problem across this \ncountry with school construction. We have to have a national program to \nhelp local school districts.\n  We have recognized for years that something has to be done about \naccountability. Goals 2000 is a step in that direction. We have to move \non to that.\n  We have to make sure that children are allowed to go to school in \nsafer schools--schools where the roofs don't leak. We have to make sure \nthat children have access to computer equipment. That is a standard. \nWhen I was going to school, you had to have teeter-totters and swings. \nNow you need to have computers. Expanding activities in technology is \nvitally important. We have to make sure there is universal access to \nhigh-quality preschool programs.\n  I see on the floor today my friend, the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts, who more than any other person in America has made sure \nthat we have a continuing dialog on preschool programs. Head Start \nprograms and other programs are the brainchild of the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  We have to continue making sure we have high-quality preschool \nprograms, which have been long established. The better preschool \nprograms we have, the better students we have coming to school.\n  The way the family situation has developed, both parents are working. \nBecause of the need they have, it is more important than ever that \nthere be good, high-quality preschool programs.\n  The amendment now before us will allow that because it will free up \nmoney that simply isn't available to local school districts. I hope the \namendment offered by Senator Dodd will receive bipartisan support. The \n$1.2 billion set forth in this bill will be used to go directly to \nschool districts. That is what this amendment does. Again, I hope it \nwill receive bipartisan support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see Senator Kennedy from \nMassachusetts. I wish to respond for a moment or two to the comments of \nSenator Reid. Then I think in the comity of events it would come to the \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  Senator Reid's statements dealt with a panoply of issues related to \neducation but not necessarily to the amendment he just submitted for \nSenator Dodd. In a word, the amendment offered by Senator Dodd \nbasically removes the education savings accounts provision. It would \nmake that moot.\n  It is premised on the statement we have all heard many times that \nspecial education which was passed in the mid-1970s was supposed to \nhave been funded in part by the Federal Government, in part by the \nState governments, and in part by the local governments. But the \nFederal Government never fulfilled its promise.\n  Interestingly enough, the Democrats were in the majority until 5 \nyears ago. For the entire time they were there when it became law and \nwas the agreement, they consistently ignored it.\n  Since a Republican majority has come to the Senate, under the \nleadership of a number of Members on our side--but particularly I will \nmention today Senator Gregg of New Hampshire--there has been a \nconsistent attempt on our side to fund this special education funding. \nI will give you an example.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the President--that is their view--requested \n$2.6 billion for this need that the Senator from Nevada has been \ndescribing, but we increased that to $3.1 billion or almost a new $1 \nbillion to put into special education. In the next year, the President \noffered a budget of $3.2 billion, but we passed, at the prodding of the \nSenator from New Hampshire, $3.8 billion or $700 million more.\n  In fiscal 1999, the President asked for $3.8 billion, but we answered \nwith $4.3 billion, another half billion dollars for special education. \nIn the fiscal year 2000 budget, the President asked for $4.3 billion, \nbut we made it $4.9 billion.\n  The point is that on our side we have consistently been trying to \nimprove this account for special education. That was ignored for almost \n35 years on the other side.\n  I have to be a little suspicious of an amendment that suddenly wraps \nitself around the interest of special education when they couldn't do \nit for some 35 years previously. It actually took a new majority to \nstart fulfilling their pledge for special education.\n  As I said, the effect of the amendment would be to make moot the \neducation savings accounts. This issue came up last week in a \ndiscussion between myself and Senator Wellstone of Minnesota. This $1.2 \nbillion or $1.3 billion that we are talking about being invested in \neducation savings accounts will produce $12 billion in savings and \ninvestments in education. It is a classic situation. If we take the \n$1.3 billion and commit it to that which is recommended by Senator \nDodd, it will be worth $1.3 billion, and we will forfeit the value of \nthe savings buildup that can go to do all the things about which the \nSenator from Nevada talked. It allows a family to purchase computers. \nIt allows families to hire tutors. It allows families to aid and abet \nand assist their children who need or have special\n\n[[Page S902]]\n\neducation requirements. The effect of this amendment would be to \nforfeit and give up the accumulation of $12 billion in new resources \nand new assets.\n  That seems to me to be pretty shortsighted. Why would we forfeit one \nof the largest infusions of resources--I might add one of the smartest \ninfusions of resources--coming from the families themselves? We are not \nhaving to raise taxes to do it. No State, nor Governor, nor local \nschool district is having to do it. People are doing it on their own. \nThey are producing smart, intelligent dollars because those dollars \nwill be invested precisely on the need of the students.\n  At the appropriate time, of course, I will urge our colleagues on a \nbipartisan basis to defeat this amendment because the effect of it is \ndesigned to make moot the education savings accounts. That is the \nultimate goal of this amendment.\n\n  As I said, when you look at the history of the failure to deal with \nspecial education, I think the Senator from New Hampshire referred to \nthis effort as somewhat hollow in that year after year, no attention \nwas paid to the special accounts. Suddenly, we will use it as a weapon \nagainst an education savings account, which would choke out, as I said, \n$12 billion in new resources. I am all for and will support in next \nyear's budget additional funding for IDEA but not at the expense of \nforfeiting a voluntarily accumulated $12 billion that will come to the \naid of public, private, and home schooling education all across the \ncountry.\n  I might add, the legislation we are debating deals with school \nconstruction. It does it in the appropriate way because it allows the \ndecisionmaking to occur at the local area. The Senator from Nevada goes \nto great extent to suggest their plans will not interrupt or in any way \nconstrain local school decisions. But the fact of the matter is, in the \nlast 30 years quite the opposite has occurred. Most of our Federal \nprograms have led to enormous constraints and mandates on local school \ndistricts. The education savings account goes in a completely different \ndirection. It empowers parents and students and employers. It has no \nmandates.\n  So I remind everybody the legislation deals with education savings \naccounts empowering parents to help their children. It empowers \nemployers to have programs of continuing education. It helps students \nwho are in State-prepaid tuition plans so those resources are not lost \nto the tax collector. It contributes to allowing more flexibility so \nlocal school districts can be involved in school construction--this \nidea coming from Senator Graham of Florida, from the other side of the \naisle.\n  With that, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Certainly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, though we certainly disagree on \napproach, I commend him for his interest in education. One thing I \nfound interesting in the analysis of my colleague's bill is the \nsuggestion that most of the benefits for education will go to the \nwealthiest people in this country.\n  Will the Senator comment on that and tell me whether he believes, as \nI do, that though we want every family to have an opportunity, if we \nare going to have limited resources applied for incentives in \neducation, we should look to working families and middle-income \nfamilies--and lower income families, for that matter, who otherwise may \nnot ever be able to send their kids off to college--as our highest \npriority, as opposed to the approach of the Senator, which apparently \ntakes the wealthiest families as the highest priority.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am pleased the Senator asked the question. I do not \nknow where he is getting the data. Let me respond in this way. The \nmeans test is identical to the one both the President and the Congress \nused for the higher education IRA. There is no difference. We all \ncelebrated that IRA account. You can save up to $500 a year for your \ncollege education. All this says is it should be larger, $2,000, and it \nshould be available for K-12. But there is no difference in the means \ntesting.\n  The data I have seen over and over suggested over 70 percent of all \nthese savings, or the use of the savings accounts, would go to families \nearning $75,000 or less. So if there is a pox on this means test, then \nthere is the same one on an account which we have all been applauding \nfor the last 2 or 3 years.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. My argument or observation was we want all families to \nconsider higher education and educational opportunities, regardless of \nwhat they are earning. I will just concede for the sake of this debate \nthat the Senator from Georgia is correct, and the $500 IRA that was \nproposed by the administration, supported by all of us, probably does \nbenefit those who can save. Generally, those are people in higher \nincome categories.\n  My question to the Senator from Georgia is, if he is proposing a new \nprogram in addition to this, would it not be better now to focus on \nthose who were not served by that $500 IRA and really focus on those \nfamilies who may not have the benefit of it if we are going to expand \nour investment in education?\n  The Treasury Department estimates that under the Senator's bill, the \nwealthiest 20 percent, the upper one-fifth of families in America, will \nreceive nearly 70 percent of the benefits. Wouldn't it be more fair, \nsince the initial IRA, as my colleague noted, really helps those \nfamilies, that additional money spent should go to working families and \nthose who maybe have been overlooked by both the administration and the \nSenate to this point? Why do we want to continue this path of \nsubsidizing families who are the wealthiest in our country?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Maybe it is just a disagreement between the two of us \nabout what constitutes wealth. I do not consider families, middle-\nincome, earning $75,000 or less, as wealthy people. Maybe the Senator \nfrom Illinois or some other analysis does, but I do not. I think this \nis the backbone of the country. They are the people who bear the \nlargest burden of the Tax Code. They are having a hard time. Their \nincome tax is at the highest level since World War II. It is so high \nnow that with the disposable income available to them, to do the things \nwe expect them to do about raising their families, they cannot do any \nmore.\n\n  So we may just have a disagreement over who is considered wealthy.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator, my guess is when we are talking \nabout the upper 20 percent of America, we are not talking about those \nof 75,000 or less; we are probably talking about $75,000 annual income \nor more.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I said that 30 percent of these accounts, as was the \ncase with the account we have already passed, would inure to their \nbenefit, which is not bad.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Less than a third?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Yes. So two-thirds plus of this, in my judgment--we \ncan disagree--is going exactly where we want it to go.\n  If I might add one other point, unlike the IRA we have already \npassed, and unlike any other IRA, this account allows sponsors. We do \nnot know the data on that. It is a benefit to even the lower income. It \nallows parents, families, unions, benevolent associations, and \nemployers to help open these accounts. From what I have seen of people \ntrying to utilize new tools and resources, it is the struggling \nfamilies who are most likely to use these accounts.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will make one final comment and then I will yield the \nfloor because I see the Senator from Massachusetts waiting. I do not \ndisagree with the Senator from Georgia in his intent on helping \nfamilies pay for education. That, too, is a concern of my colleague, \nSenator Schumer from New York, who supports the President's plan of \ndeductibility of college expenses on your tax returns. I think that is \nan excellent way of increasing opportunity in education.\n  I do believe, if we are going to take our money and our surplus and \ninvest it in education, we should look to those who, frankly, need the \nmost help. I think it would be the working families. I am afraid the \nSenator's approach, according to the Treasury Department analysis, \ngives 70 percent of the benefits to families in the upper 20 percent of \nAmerica. It tips the scales heavily to the wealthiest families. I agree \nwith the Senator's comments, and I hope his\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nbill will reflect we should direct more help to working families \nstruggling to put their kids through college. I am afraid, as I see it, \nhis bill does not do that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be very quick, and then I will yield so the \nSenator from Massachusetts will have his time.\n  Let me say, there is apparently some disagreement about the flow of \nthe funds. Joint Tax states 70 percent of all benefits goes to families \nof $75,000 or less. Again, I repeat the means test is no different than \nthe one that was established by the President and the Congress on the \nprevious smaller savings accounts that we have implemented and, as I \nsaid, applauded.\n  I do appreciate the question from the Senator from Illinois and his \ninterest, which I think is probably shared by all of us one way or the \nother, in making a very positive education environment for all in the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nyielding. I, like others, have differences with the Senator, but I \nadmire his persistence in this idea and his strong commitment to this \nproposal. Many of us welcome the opportunity to debate issues on \neducation policy at this point in the session. We have been in session \nfor a number of weeks, and we have dealt with the issues of the \nMarianas, bankruptcy, and one or two judges. As we come into the first \nof March, we are very slow and reluctant in addressing concerns of \nfamilies. This is one of the issues of education.\n  There always seems to be some interruption. All of us are looking \nforward to visiting with our Governors. I am looking forward to \nvisiting with mine. Nonetheless, sometime we ought to be about the \nNation's business, and the Nation's business is the whole role of how \nthe Federal, State, and local governments are going to provide \nassistance to make sure we have the best educational system.\n  We have a responsibility in the area of health care to ensure a full \nPatients' Bill of Rights so families know the information they get from \nthe doctor is the doctor's recommendation and not an insurance agent's \nrecommendation who is more interested in the bottom line.\n  We have a responsibility to debate and act on the question of \nprescription drugs. There is not a group of seniors in my State of \nMassachusetts who do not place prescription drugs as their foremost \nconcern, and it is a legitimate concern.\n  We ought to be about the business of addressing those issues. These \nare some things on the minds of people.\n  We have started this debate on education policy, and we will be \nfollowing up tomorrow in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  The American people ought to understand that we provide very little \nout of the Federal budget to education. As my friend and colleague from \nNevada has pointed out, it is about 2 percent. Most American families \nsay: Out of $1.7 trillion, we ought to be providing more than 2 \npercent.\n  Most would want us to do it, most believe we should do it, but we \nhave not done it. It has been resisted. I imagine we will see further \nresistance in the Senate debate, finding there are other priorities.\n  As we know, 7 to 7.5 cents of every Federal dollar goes to the local \ncommunities. We are talking about scarce resources. We have to \nunderstand we either appropriate the money or we provide tax breaks or \ntax incentives. It all basically comes from the budget.\n  What we are talking about today is $1.2 billion over the next 5 years \nand how it will be used. The Dodd amendment says there are public \npolicy issues related to education that have a higher priority. He will \ninsist the Senate vote to decide whether we are going to provide the \n$1.2 billion to assist local communities to offset the additional costs \nthat are necessary for needy children, or whether the $1.2 billion will \ngo to 7 percent of families with children in private schools.\n  Half the money in the Coverdell proposal, which is represented by one \nof these little figures on this chart, will go to benefit one of these \nfigures and the other half will go to benefit those who go to private \nschools. That is not something we have admitted or stated. That is even \naccording to Mr. Coverdell, as he said on February 23:\n\n       The division of the money is 50-50.\n\n  At the start of this debate, we have to ask: Where do we want the \nlimited resources to go? Do we want to strengthen the public school \nsystems, or do we want to divert scarce resources to the private \nschools? Private schools play an enormously important role in our \nsociety, but we are talking about scarce resources.\n\n  What does the Dodd amendment do? It says if we have $1.2 billion, we \nought to use that $1.2 billion to help all the families in communities \nacross the country who are burdened, in one sense, but also given an \nopportunity in another sense, to provide some decent education for \nchildren who have special needs. That opportunity developed in the \n1970s as a result of Supreme Court cases decisions that said the \nguarantee by the States of educating their children also applies to \nspecial-needs children.\n  Our friend, Governor Weicker of the State of Connecticut, introduced \nlegislation to help offset those additional needs for those schools. \nOver time, we have been trying to increase funding for special-needs \nchildren.\n  I take my hat off to our good friend from the State of New Hampshire, \nMr. Gregg, who insists we put this as the first priority for all \nGovernment funding. Many of us believe we should increase funding for \nspecial-needs children. Senator Dodd's amendment, which is so \ncompelling, says: Look, if we have $1.2 billion, let's take that $1.2 \nbillion and help all the communities across the country that are \nproviding assistance to special-needs children. That is more important \nthan taking half of that money and giving it to the private school \nstudents. I think a pretty good case can be made for that.\n  Senator Dodd has offered an amendment in the past to do exactly that. \nOn April 23, 1998, he offered that amendment, and it failed by a narrow \nmargin. He was able to marshal almost half of the Senate. We are very \nhopeful the Dodd amendment will be successful today.\n  I offered a similar amendment in March of 1999 at the time the Senate \nwas considering the $792 billion tax break bill. The tax break bill--\nremember that?\n  We listened to many of our colleagues talking about the importance of \nhaving special education and funding special education. I offered an \namendment that said: All right, let's adopt what would have been part \nof the tax break bill to fund special education needs for the next 10 \nyears. Do you know what that would have meant in terms of a reduction \nin the tax break bill? It would have reduced the total tax break for \nfortunate individuals and corporations by only a fifth. Four-fifths \nwould have still gone through the Senate.\n  That was a pretty good opportunity to say: If we are really serious \nabout trying to do something for special-needs children, let's go ahead \nand take the opportunity with real money--not authorizations, not on \nappropriations that may be rejected or vetoed because they have other \nkinds of proposals; no gimmicks--let's do something that is actually \ngoing to go to the President of the United States, something that is \ngoing to go on through and at least be considered. Not a single vote--\nnot one vote, not five votes, not four votes, not three votes, not two \nvotes--not a single one came from that side of the aisle.\n  You can imagine why many of us, when we hear these statements on the \nother side about the importance of special education and special needs, \nwhy we take that with a good deal of doubt.\n  The fact of the matter is, many of these proposals that we will have \nan opportunity to debate later on have some important impact on special \neducation. In smaller classes, teachers can help identify those \nchildren with some special needs and can be separated out to be given \nthe extra help and assistance they need, instead of the children being \nthrown into the situation where it makes it much more complicated and \nexpensive.\n  Early involvement, through the expansion of the Head Start Program, \nmost importantly, can get some help and assistance to those students; \nand, secondly, save a good deal of resources in funding.\n\n[[Page S904]]\n\n  We do not believe you ought to place one group of children against \nanother, but some do. Those of us who have been in support of the \nPresident's program, Vice President Gore's excellent program, with an \nemphasis on early intervention, do not believe in pitting one child \nagainst another.\n  We will have the opportunity to follow Senator Dodd's leadership and \nsay: Let's just take this funding--half of the money goes to about 10 \npercent of the children, and half of it goes to 90 percent of the \nchildren--let's say: We find that this is sufficiently important that \nwe are going to provide the funds for all of the special needs.\n  I do not want to take much time of the Senate, but I do want to \nreview a little bit about education policy in recent times because I \nbelieve this is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. We \nought to understand whether this is just a policy difference between us \nor whether this is something that is much more basic and fundamental.\n  I have here statistics going back for the last 6 years under \nRepublican leadership, showing where the Republican leadership has been \non the issue of cuts in education funding.\n  In the 1995 House rescissions bill, we have $1.7 billion enacted. It \nhad been appropriated, and the President signed it. The new leadership \nsaid: We are going to go right back there under rescissions and take \n$1.7 billion. That was done just after the election.\n\n  In 1996, House Appropriations cut $3.9 billion below the previous \nyear. In 1997, it was $3.1 billion below the President; in 1998, it was \n$200 million below the President; in 1999, $2 billion below the \nPresident; for the fiscal year 2000 House bill, $2.8 billion below the \nPresident.\n  You cannot say: Well, you can do anything with figures around here. \nThat is a pretty consistent record of where the Republican leadership \nhas been over the last 6 or 7 years on the priorities of education.\n  Those of us who believe in investing in children, who believe we need \na partnership at the Federal, State, and local level, are not saying \nthat money, in and of itself, is going to provide all the answers. But \nwhat we are saying is: Investing in resources is a pretty clear \nindication of a nation's priorities and a pretty clear indication of \nwhat is believed to be important.\n  Where you had 3 or 4 years ago the cutting of billions and billions \nof dollars, and abolishing the Department of Education, now we come out \nwith $1.2 billion--some $300 million a year--as their first priority in \nthe areas of education.\n  I have some difficulty in believing that is really what the American \npeople want. I think the American people want us to say: Let's get the \nbest ideas among Democrats and Republicans to get the best trained \nteachers and put them in every classroom in America. And let's find out \nhow to make sure that teacher is going to stay there. Let's find out \nhow we are going to be able to cut back on the size of larger schools \nso we can get students into smaller classes, which has been \ndemonstrated to show a higher degree of academic performance.\n  Let's talk about afterschool programs and how they are being tied to \nperformance in universities and how they are being tied to the private \nsector, where there are job opportunities with help and assistance from \ntutorials.\n  Let's talk about programs such as the one I saw just yesterday in my \nhome city of Boston. Intel, one of the great American companies, is \ndoing workshops to try to provide help and assistance to inner-city \nkids. They are going to open up programs around the country. Let's talk \nabout what they are doing. If those programs are so good, we ought to \nbe able to replicate them. Let's talk about how we are going to provide \ngreater opportunities for kids to continue on into higher education.\n  It seems to me the American people want this debate and want it out \nhere on the floor of the Senate. But, oh, no, we have this particular \nproposal.\n  That is why I think it is so important that we have the opportunity \nto vote on the Dodd proposal. What we are basically saying is: All \nright, $1.2 billion; let's put this in the areas of special needs. \nLet's go ahead and help them. That is an important area. Let's go on \nand provide that kind of help and assistance.\n  Senator Dodd knows so well, as others, that before we had the IDEA, \nwe had about 5.5 million children locked in closets who never went to \nschool.\n  Now we find that children who are going to complete high school, 57 \npercent of the disabled youth are competitively employed within 5 years \nafter leaving high school, compared to an employment rate of 25 percent \nfor disabled adults who have never benefited from IDEA. When we invest \nin these children, we get results. The Dodd amendment is what is going \nto get results for some of the neediest causes for families in this \ncountry.\n  In my own State of Massachusetts, there are small towns where \nfamilies have these kinds of challenges with regard to a particular \nindividual. The schools have to provide those services. It provides a \nvery significant increased burden on the taxes of those local \ncommunities. Let's say, look, wherever they are, if they are in \nGeorgia, if they are in Illinois, if they are in Massachusetts, they \nare going to get some help and assistance from this particular program.\n  There is a priority. That has a higher priority than just providing \nthis kind of money that is going to be scattered the way it has been \nindicated. That is the essence.\n  I see the good Senator from Connecticut, our leader on this fight \ntime and again. We commend him for staking out, in the first real order \nof business, the first real order of debate, the importance and \nsignificance of this amendment and helping to provide for families who \nhave special needs children.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his presentation \nthis morning and his leadership throughout his career in the Senate on \nissues of education. There is no Senator on the floor who can hold a \ncandle to Senator Kennedy when it comes to issues of education. He not \nonly understands them in a better way than most of us, but he is more \narticulate, forceful, and committed than any Member of the Senate. It \nis a pleasure to join him in this debate this morning.\n  I think he has very convincingly laid out the case of the difference \nbetween the two parties. Our Republican friends on the opposite side of \nthe aisle have a different view of education than Democrats do. There \nhave been those on the Republican side who have called for abolishing \nthe Department of Education in Washington. There have been those, as \nwell, who have suggested that if the Federal Government has a role, it \nshould be in supporting private schools with the so-called voucher \nsystem.\n  There have been those who have opposed suggestions from the President \nand others that if the Federal Government is to have a role, albeit a \nsmall role, it should be focused on things that are so important for \nevery school district across America, whether it is modernizing our \nschool buildings so the kids who presently are enrolled have an \nopportunity and access to the best technology to prepare them for the \nfuture, whether it means teacher training so the teachers we respect so \nmuch today can continue to develop their skills, so the children coming \nin the classroom really are, in many cases, taught by teachers who \nunderstand the new technology as well or better than the children.\n  There is a standing joke in my office that if you can't understand \nhow the computer works, look for a teenager. I think most of us \nunderstand that young people because they have been raised in this \nculture and have no fear of this machinery, many times eclipse the \nskills and talents of even the teachers in the classroom.\n  Democrats believe on focusing some money on teacher training. A \nbetter trained teacher is going to do a better job in the classroom. Of \ncourse, the reduction of class size is part of this as well. I have \nseen school districts in my home State of Illinois and the city of \nChicago, in a more Republican area in general, Du Page County, a \nwealthier area, where teachers tell me, with a smaller class size they \ncan pick out the kids who need special help and make sure they keep up \nwith the class. They can also identify the gifted kids and give them \nbetter and tougher assignments so they can improve, too. These\n\n[[Page S905]]\n\nare the issues on which Democrats have said time and again we should \nfocus.\n  Our colleague, Senator Dodd from Connecticut, has joined us. I am \nhappy he is here because he has a very critical amendment. Where \nSenator Coverdell's bill suggests we will focus half of the assistance \nin this new program on private schools where only 10 percent of our \nkids attend school and where he has said the vast majority of the \nresources in his bill will go to the wealthiest families in our \ncountry, those in the upper 20 percent, Senator Dodd comes in with a \nmuch more practical and grounded alternative.\n  I will leave it to the Senator to explain it in detail, the idea that \nwe would provide school districts across America, rich and poor, \nwherever they are located, assistance in helping to educate kids with \nspecial needs. Meet with any school board member, any school \nsuperintendent, or many teachers for that matter, and ask them about \nthe challenges of today. They will tell you that kids with special \nneeds, disabled kids, need special attention so they can develop their \nhighest potential. It costs money to do it. It takes extra resources. \nWe have made the commitment in theory. What Senator Dodd suggests is we \nshould put our money where our commitment is and say to these school \ndistricts that we will help you with these kids. We believe it is worth \nthe investment.\n  At this point I see Senator Dodd is on the floor and prepared to \ndiscuss his amendment. I am happy to yield to my colleague from the \nState of Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. Let me \nalso thank our good friend, the Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid, for \nintroducing the amendment on my behalf. Unfortunately, I was delayed \nthis morning due to a problem with my flight. I apologize for not \ngetting here earlier and I am grateful to my colleague for stepping in \nto help.\n  I see my good friend from Georgia is here. We have gone around on \nthis issue in the past. I have great respect and admiration for him. We \ndisagree on this issue, so I am sure we will have a good healthy debate \nabout it.\n  In fact, we may not disagree about it at all. What I am trying to do \nwith this amendment, I presume my friend from Georgia and others would \nalso support. Let me briefly outline the amendment for my colleagues. \nWhile we only have a few minutes this morning, we will resume debate \nthis afternoon.\n  It is somewhat ironic, in a way, that we will be meeting in about 22 \nminutes with the national Governors. We will gather together and have a \njoint meeting. I commend the leadership for arranging that.\n  Due to this meeting, I think it is worthy of note that the Governors \nare headed up by Mike Leavitt, Governor from Utah; Governor Mike \nHuckabee, vice chair on Human Resources from Arkansas; Governor Jim \nHunt from North Carolina, who is the chair of the Committee on Human \nResources; and Governor Tom Carper of Delaware, who is co-chair with \nMike Leavitt of the National Governors' Association.\n  This letter is dated a year ago, but it was about a year ago that we \nengaged in a similar debate. At that time, a letter was sent to our \ncolleague, Pete Domenici, chairman of the Committee on the Budget. The \nletter specifically addresses the issue my amendment proposes to \ncorrect or to at least offer to provide some support for special \neducation funding. The letter says:\n\n       As you prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal \n     year, the nation's Governors urge Congress to live up to \n     agreements already made to meet current funding commitments \n     to states before funding new initiatives or tax cuts in the \n     federal budget.\n       The federal government committed to fully fund--defined as \n     40 percent of the costs--the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) when the law, formerly known as the \n     Education of the Handicapped Act, was passed in 1975. \n     Currently, the federal government's contribution amounts to \n     only 11 percent, and states are funding the balance to assist \n     school districts in providing special education and related \n     services. Although we strongly support providing the \n     necessary services and support to help all students succeed, \n     the costs associated with implementing IDEA are placing an \n     increased burden on states.\n       We are currently reallocating existing state funds from \n     other programs or committing new funds to ensure that \n     students with disabilities are provided a ``free and \n     appropriate public education.'' In some cases, we are taking \n     funds from existing education programs to pay for the costs \n     of educating our students with disabilities because we \n     believe that all students deserve an equal opportunity to \n     learn. Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its \n     original commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B \n     services as authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be \n     achieved.\n\n  Mr. President, I also have a letter, dated February 23, 2000, from \nthe National School Boards Association opposing the underlying bill, \nthe Affordable Education Act, and supporting my amendment. \nSpecifically, I quote from the letter:\n\n       NSBA believes that a greater benefit for children and \n     taxpayers alike will occur if this money is spent meeting the \n     unmet federal commitment in special education. Throughout the \n     country, taxpayers are indirectly paying higher school and \n     property taxes in their districts to compensate for the \n     federal funding shortfall in the education of children with \n     disabilities. Rather than create a tax benefit for a select \n     few, applying these funds to special education would benefit \n     more taxpayers and public schools.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters from the Governors, as well \nas the National School Boards Association, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                    March 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Pete V. Domenici,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: As you prepare the budget resolution for \n     the coming fiscal year, the nation's Governors urge Congress \n     to live up to agreements already made to meet current funding \n     commitments to states before funding new initiatives or tax \n     cuts in the federal budget.\n       The Federal Government committed to fully fund--defined as \n     40 percent of other costs--the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA) when the law, formerly known as \n     Education of the Handicapped Act, was passed in 1975. \n     Currently, The Federal Government's contribution amounts to \n     only 11 percent, and states are funding the balance to assist \n     school districts in providing special education and related \n     services. Although we strongly support providing the \n     necessary services and support to help all students succeed, \n     the costs associated with implementing IDEA are placing an \n     increased burden on states.\n       We are currently reallocating existing state funds from \n     other programs or committing new funds to ensure that \n     students with disabilities are provided a ``free and \n     appropriate public education.'' In some cases, we are taking \n     funds from existing education programs to pay for the costs \n     of educating our students with disabilities because we \n     believe that all students deserve an equal opportunity to \n     learn. Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its \n     original commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B \n     services as authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be \n     achieved.\n       This is such a high priority for Governors, that at the \n     recent National Governors' Association Winter Meeting, it was \n     a topic of discussion with the President as well as the \n     subject of an adopted, revised policy attached. Many thanks \n     for your consideration of this request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Thomas R. Carper.\n     Gov. Michael O. Leavitt.\n     Gov. James B. Hunt, Jr.,\n       Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n     Gov. Mike Huckabee,\n       Vice Chair, Committee on Human Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           National School Boards Association,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 23, 2000.\n\n     Re Oppose S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act\n\n     Member,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nation's 95,000 local boards \n     members, the National School Boards Association (NSBA) urges \n     you to oppose S. 1134, the Affordable Education Act.\n       NSBA is opposed to this legislation that would expand \n     education savings accounts to allow tax-free expenditures for \n     K-12 public, private, and religious school tuition. NSBA \n     believes that limited public funds could be better invested \n     in priority areas of K-12 education. Specifically, Congress \n     should focus scarce tax dollars on the federal government's \n     current obligations to our nation's public schools.\n       The Joint Tax Committee estimated that K-12 education \n     savings accounts come with a price tag of well over $2 \n     billion over ten years. In addition to the expense of this \n     program, education savings accounts would disproportionately \n     be used by affluent families and provide very little benefits \n     to lower and middle income families. NSBA believes that a \n     greater benefit for children and taxpayers alike will occur \n     if this money is spent meeting the unmet federal commitment \n     in special education. Throughout the country, taxpayers are \n     indirectly paying higher school and property taxes in their \n     districts to compensate for the federal funding shortfall in\n\n[[Page S906]]\n\n     the education of children with disabilities. Rather then \n     create a tax benefit for a select few, applying these funds \n     to special education would benefit more taxpayers and public \n     schools.\n       Providing additional funds for students with disabilities \n     will enable Congress to take a small step forward in \n     eliminating the unfunded mandate on local school districts. \n     This, in turn, will free up funds at the local level to help \n     increase student achievement for all students.\n       NSBA urges you to oppose the education savings accounts \n     legislation. If you have questions, please contact Dan \n     Fuller, director of federal programs, at 703-838-6763.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael A. Resnick,\n                                     Associate Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me again make the point I made last week and will make \nagain this afternoon. There are parts of this bill the Senator from \nGeorgia is offering with which I have no disagreement. However, it \nseems to me that we are talking about relatively scarce resources. \nWhile we are in a surplus--and we all applaud this fact--we all know we \ndon't have all the money we would like to spend in educational areas. \nBut to have a tax break of a $1.2 billion over 5 years, the cumulative \nbenefit, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, would amount to \n$20.50--$20.50 on average.\n  My amendment would provide a benefit that would go back to our \ncommunities where we know from our mayors and county executives how \ndifficult it is for local taxpayers to support the costs of special \nneeds education. In some cases, the cost of a special needs child can \nbe $50,000 or more per year. Now, on average, it is a lot lower, but \nthere are cases that are not that rare, in fact where the costs are \nvery high, that is borne by the local property taxpayers, or the State \ntaxpayers.\n  We made a commitment--the Federal Government--and said: we think you \nought to provide an education for all children in this country. We \nthink it is important to educate children with disabilities. I will \ntell you what we will do, communities and States. If you will support \nthis effort and put up 60 percent of the money, we will put up 40 \npercent of the money.\n  Despite the fact we made that commitment more than a quarter century \nago, we have only gotten up to 12.7 percent. Now, $1.2 billion doesn't \nget you to 40 percent, but it gets you a lot closer. That is real tax \nrelief, what the Governors are asking us to do, what the national \nschool boards are asking us to do, and what our mayors and county \nexecutives have asked us to do.\n  I can't think of a better way to allocate $1.2 billion if we are \ngoing to do it at this juncture, do what the Governors asked us to do \nand what the mayors asked us to do--that is, be the partner we promised \nto be on special education.\n  My mayors in Connecticut tell me it is the most important issue to \nthem. I asked them what we can do to help them out. They say: Help us \nin this area. You made the promise, so why don't you do it?\n  Instead, what we do too often is pit people against each other in \nlocal communities, where a family, unfortunately, has been hit with a \nchild born with a significant disability and, all of a sudden, the cost \nof educating that child is high, and there are people who resent that \nfact locally. It creates tensions in our towns and cities. I don't \nthink that ought to be the case. So with scarce resources, why not \npitch in, why not meet the commitments we have made.\n  This may take a supermajority vote. I suspect there is going to be a \npoint of order raised against this amendment that will require 60 \nvotes. I have listened to my colleagues over and over, going back some \n7, 8, 10 years ago when I first offered this amendment in the Budget \nCommittee. I lost the amendment on a tie vote. To the credit of the \nmajority leader, Trent Lott, he supported me, as did several other \nRepublicans. However, I lost some Democratic votes on the Budget \nCommittee. Almost every year since then, I have offered some variation \nof this amendment. We have come close some years, not so close in \nothers. But all of us know when we go back to our States, this is an \nissue our constituents and their representatives at the local level \ncare about, and they want the Federal Government to live up to the \ncommitments we made so many years ago.\n  It is important to children with special needs. Again, I am preaching \nto the choir, I suspect, because all of my colleagues care about \neducation. But if we are going to have the best educated population \nthis country has ever produced--and I think we need to do that if we \nare going to succeed in the 21st century--then we have to make \nintelligent investments of taxpayer money when it comes to achieving \nthat goal.\n  We have children with special education needs. This is an opportunity \nnow for us to not provide a $20.50 average tax break, but to get money \nback to these communities that will allow them to provide the kind of \neducational opportunity for children with special needs who can be \nproductive, contributing members of our society. But if children with \ndisabilities don't get the educational tools they need, they too often \nface insurmountable obstacles.\n  Again, it is not that what the Senator from Georgia has proposed is \nnecessarily a terrible idea; I am not suggesting that. I suggest if you \nhave limited resources, and we have clear choices--I think most \nAmericans when confronted with the choice of getting a $20.50 tax break \nover 5 years, or seeing this money go to defray local property taxes or \nState taxes, to live up to the commitment on special education, I \nbelieve most Americans would choose the latter; they would see this as \na better investment of their tax money by reducing those costs.\n  So I also want to add, if I could at this point, a list of what it \ncosts each State, the charts that will spell out in each State the \nspecial education costs. They are very high. These are very high costs \nin terms of what we are contributing. To give you an idea, in the State \nof California, in special education costs, we come up with 5 percent of \nthe money, the State comes up with 71 percent, and the local government \ncomes up with 24 percent. Going on down this list of various States, to \ngive you some sense of it. In the top State I can find, Indiana, we do \n17 percent, the State does 63, and the local does 20. Most of them are \nin the single-digit area where it is 4, 5, 6, 9 percent coming from the \nFederal Government.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this list of education \nexpenditures reported by selective States on special education be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        TABLE I-2--SPECIAL EDUCATION EXPENDITURES AS REPORTED BY SELECTED STATES\n                                       [19th annual report to Congress: Section I--The costs of special education]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                              Average State-     Percentage of support by source\n                                           Total special       Associated    defined special ---------------------------------------\n                 State                       education          special         education                                             Confidence in data\n                                           expenditures*       education     expenditure per    Federal       State        Local\n                                                            student count**      student\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCalifornia............................

Mr. President, it is unfortunate, in a sense, to begin this \ndialog with such a piece of legislation that my friend from Georgia has \noffered, which I think is not well conceived in terms of the impact it \ncould have, if we chose to dedicate it to special education.\n  While education may be the issue foremost in the minds of the \nAmerican public, I highly doubt that the public has this legislation \nbefore us this morning in mind when they think of ways the Federal \nGovernment could be helping to improve our schools in this country.\n  Education savings accounts, as proposed in this legislation, \nrepresent, in my view, bad education policy, bad tax policy, and a \nwaste of valuable Federal resources that could be so helpful if \ndirected to public schools and special education needs. In fact, the \nlegislation offered by our friend and colleague from Georgia offers \nvery little to public schools.\n  Remember, there were 55 million kids in this country getting up and \ngoing to school a couple of hours ago. They went off to elementary and \nsecondary schools this morning across the country; 5 million went to a \nprivate or parochial school; 50 million went to a public school. Even \nif we try to take every kid out of a public school and put them in a \nprivate school, they would not fit. The overwhelming majority of kids \nwho went to school this morning went to a public school. Certainly, \nwhile we bear a responsibility to try to improve the quality of \neducation for all children, we certainly have a unique and special \nresponsibility to see to it that public education gets our undivided \nattention--at least the majority of our attention on this issue, not at \nthe exclusion of the others.\n  Certainly, we have a very high degree of responsibility to see that \nthese children are going to get the quality education they deserve. \nAccording to the Joint Tax Committee, not a partisan committee, the \naverage benefit per child in public school would be approximately \n$20.50 over 5 years. I ask the question: How is the family of a public \nschool student going to improve their child's education environment \nwith an average benefit of $5 a year? I believe, however, that we can \nsalvage the bill before us and make a real contribution to the work of \nteachers, parents, and our communities.\n  My amendment simply does the following: It takes the $1.2 billion in \nthis proposal and sends it down instead to local schools to help meet \nthe costs of special education. This straightforward proposal offers an \nalternative to the underlying legislation, which will make a real \ndifference, in my view, in education and in our schools.\n  Upon the enactment of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act \nin 1975, the Federal Government committed to our State and local \ngovernments around this country--to all 50 States--that it would \ncontribute--we would, the Federal Government would, the Congress \nwould--40 percent of the funds needed to provide special education \nservices. That was 25 years ago we made that commitment.\n  Presently, the Federal contribution for special education is 12.7 \npercent of their special education costs. And that varies from State to \nState. The Federal contribution to special education has never risen \nabove 13 percent. The Federal Government, today, would need to boost \nits IDEA funding an estimated $15.8 billion to live up to its original \ncommitment to our Nation's special needs children in our districts and \nStates across the country.\n  The amendment I offer this morning would redirect the $1.2 billion \nover 5 years spent by the Coverdell initiative to IDEA. These funds \nwould directly aid State and local school districts in providing the \ncritically important special education services children with \ndisabilities deserve.\n  I often hear from school and town officials in my State of \nConnecticut--as I am sure the Presiding Officer does in Idaho, and my \ncolleague from Georgia does as well--about the high costs associated \nwith providing special education services. Our local school districts \nare struggling to meet the needs of their students with disabilities \nwhich at times can be overwhelming to smaller rural communities. In \nConnecticut, the State spends more than $700 million annually, or 18 \npercent of the State's overall education budget, to fund special \neducation programs. In Torrington, CT, special education costs recently \nincreased from $635,000 to $1.3 million over a two year period. \nTorrington is a relatively small, midsized, urban community in my \nState. It is not Hartford, Bridgeport, New Haven, or Stamford. \nTorrington is a small town. $1.3 million in that small town's budget \ngoes to provide special education services. However, for my part, I \nbelieve the issue is not that special education services may cost too \nmuch. They are clearly a good investment, in my view, over the long \nterm. Rather, the issue is that the Federal Government contributes too \nlittle.\n\n  Congress passed the IDEA legislation. I believe Congress should \nfulfill its commitment to our Nation's special needs children and our \ncommunities by increasing its share, as we committed to do, of special \neducation costs before we enact legislation proposals such as the one \nbefore us that do nothing, in my view, to improve the quality of our \npublic schools.\n  Over the last few years, this body has greatly strengthened the \nfederal commitment to children with disabilities. Since fiscal year \n1998, Congress has increased special education funding by 25 percent. \nHowever, that money is spread thinly across 50 States.\n  Despite the Federal Government's recent increases in its support for \nspecial education services, the cost of providing these services has \nrisen dramatically in recent years. Our recent increases in funding are \nnot keeping pace with increased costs. Today, providing special \neducation services to a child with a disability costs about 2.3 times \nthat of regular education. Special education spending grew 19 percent \nof all school spending in 1996 across the country.\n  Thus, changes in enrollment in special education programs in recent \nyears is also a key factor behind increases in costs for special \neducation\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nprograms. In the last 5 years alone, schools' special education \nenrollment has increased by 12.6 percent. Today, 1 out of every 10 \nstudents in public schools receives special education services under \nthe IDEA legislation.\n  In my own State of Connecticut, approximately 14 percent of all \nstudents are enrolled in special education programs. Our State and \nlocal school districts need our help. The amendment I am offering today \nmoves us in the right direction.\n  According to a 1996 Gallup poll, 47 percent of those surveyed said \nAmerica is spending too little of its education budget on students with \nspecial needs. Only 5 percent of those surveyed reported that too much \nis being spent on special needs children. The amendment I offer Senator \nCoverdell's legislation would address this public concern.\n  By increasing the Federal contribution to States for special \neducation services, I believe we will greatly aid State and local \nschool districts by allowing them to reduce the disproportionate share \nof special education services they have had to carry for far too long. \nWhen school districts are forced to increase the amount of funds for \nspecial education, they are often forced to raise taxes or reduce \nfunding for nonspecial education programs. These school districts need \nour help. More importantly, though, children with disabilities need our \nhelp more.\n  Demonstrating the importance of special education funding to our \nStates, the National Governors' Association--again, I refer to the \nletter behind me to the Senate Budget Committee chairman--asks Congress \nto fulfill its commitment to special education funding before ``funding \nnew tax initiatives or tax cuts'' such as being proposed by the \nCoverdell proposal.\n  Additionally, the National School Boards Association letter dated \nFebruary 23 to all Senators says, ``Rather than create a tax benefit \nfor a select few, applying these funds to special education would \nbenefit more taxpayers and public schools'' across the country.\n\n  We often like to talk in this body about what the public wants and \nwhat they need. Yet here we have the National School Boards \nAssociation, those who every day have to make the tough choices \ndeciding how to operate our schools across the Nation, asking us not to \nenact tax relief that would only benefit a select few and telling us \nwhat our children really need--better qualified teachers, smaller class \nsizes, and more funds for special education.\n  Today, I hope as we come back later in the afternoon to this \namendment that our colleagues will rally behind us. We could accomplish \na great deal. It would be a major first step in coming together in a \nbipartisan way to do something about which all of us have talked to our \nStates about for many years, and that is to be a better partner when it \ncomes to educating children with special needs. We have not been the \nfull partner we promised to be. The costs are going up, and the local \ntaxpayer is being saddled with that burden.\n  We have an obligation and I think a responsibility. We can live up \nthis obligation this afternoon by voting for this amendment and saying \nthat the $1.2 billion in this proposal we will given back to our States \nto give to these children, to these mayors, to the county executives, \nand to our Governors to see to it that these children and our \ncommunities will have an opportunity to meet those responsibilities.\n  I see that the hour for us to recess is about at hand. I will not \ndelay the proceedings of the Senate any longer except to note that I \nwill come back this afternoon to talk about this further and invite my \ncolleagues to come forward on both sides of the aisle to engage in this \ndiscussion. We haven't had many votes this year. We haven't had much of \nan opportunity in this Congress to express what we think the priorities \nof the American public are and how we can fulfill them. But we all know \neducation is right at the top of American's priorities, indicating that \nthe American public wants this Congress, their Government, to pay \nattention to the needs of the educational responsibilities in our \ncountry. I think we have a chance to do that today with this amendment.\n  Presently, we only contribute 7 cents out of every dollar to \neducation. Ninety-three cents comes from local and State taxes. Seven \ncents comes from Washington DC. But here we have a chance, with our 7 \ncents, if you will, to do something meaningful for our States and \nmeaningful for these families and children with special education \nneeds.\n  My sincere hope is that when the opportunity arises for us to answer \nthe rollcall on how we stand on this issue, this body will vote \noverwhelmingly in support of this amendment and do something very \nmeaningful today with a message we can give our Governors as they go \nback to their States, and say, Congress is a partner when it comes to \nspecial education needs.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, while the other side is preparing \nfurther remarks about their amendment, I want to make it very clear \nthat the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut would, one, \nmake moot the principal core of this legislation, the education savings \naccount. It just wipes it out. No. 2, I wish to make the point that he \nis making moot an issue that has received extensive bipartisan support \nin the Senate.\n\n  The principal coauthor of the education savings accounts is Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey. When this\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\nwas last voted on before the Senate, it received 59, 60 votes--again, a \nvery bipartisan expression in support of the education savings \naccounts. I want to make it clear that this amendment would have the \neffect of destroying a core bipartisan component.\n  The second point I wish to make is that the Senator from Connecticut \nargues the money used to create this educational IRA should be used to \nenhance the funding of special education. Special education, he \nrightfully points out, is important and represents an unfunded mandate \nof some 25 years.\n  I find it interesting that for 25 years the other side of the aisle \nfound it acceptable to ignore the Federal responsibilities for special \neducation, and now with a new majority, we on our side of the aisle \nhave doubled funding for IDEA. We have an attempt to empower parents \nand local communities to deal with educational requirements for \nchildren, and we now find this amendment and the great need on the \nother side of the aisle to deal with IDEA. There is an incongruity of \nletting it sit there for so many years without paying attention to it \nand now all of a sudden it is important.\n  Mr. DODD. Would my colleague yield on that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will in a moment.\n  No. 3, let me say to the Senator from Connecticut, first of all, I \nagree with the attempts to fund special education for all the reasons \nthe Senator enumerates. But I do not find them mutually exclusive. I do \nnot think we have to take this bipartisan education savings account \nlegislation and throw it in the trash heap to do this.\n  We have increased funding over the President's proposals for special \neducation 5 years in a row. I think we will do so again. I think this \nCongress will respond to the goals the Senator has enumerated and to \nthe letter the Senator has showed us from the Governors who, indeed, \nthink this pledge that was made a long time ago and ignored for an \nawfully long time should be fulfilled. So we agree on that premise. But \nI do not think you have to make this moot in order to do it.\n  The last thing I would say--and it is the Senator's amendment, so I \nwant him to be able to conclude his debate--is that we disagree on the \nnature of the policy. The Senator's side of the aisle, those who do not \nsupport it--not those who do--somewhat attempts to minimize the \nsignificance of it.\n  I take some issue with that because we are all down here playing the \nlaudatory band for the fact we passed an IRA for higher education that \nhad parameters identical to the means test that applies here, but its \nvalue is only one-fourth what the value of this proposal is. I do not \nthink you can make this an insignificant advantage to people on the one \nhand but say this education savings account was a great accomplishment \non the other.\n  Frankly, I think the education savings account that we passed for \n$500 per year for higher education is a good thing. I supported it. I \nproposed it. But this is four times the value of that.\n  In conclusion, I think anything that causes American citizens to save \nis a good thing. That piece gets left out of this debate. We are going \nto forgive $1.2 or $3 billion over 5 years. Actually, I say to the \nSenator, for 10 years it is about $2.4 billion. As a result of that, \nAmericans are going to save $12 billion. All of it is going to go to \neducation--half of it to public education and half of it to private \neducation. And 70 percent of the families are going to be in public \neducation; 30 percent of the families are going to be in private \neducation. This is going to do good things. It is going to help \nfamilies who do have special education problems. I think that is good \npolicy.\n\n  I think simultaneously we are going to address the goal of the \nSenator and many of us who share that goal of trying to accelerate \nfunding for IDEA. But as I said, I do not think it has to come at the \nexpense of this idea. Senator Wellstone and I got into a debate after \nthe Senator spoke the other day, and I said: There are not many Federal \nexpenditures that provide incentives to people to create large sums of \nresources that come to education. If you take this $1.2 billion, as you \nsuggest, and move it to IDEA, it is not bad that we have done it for \nIDEA, but you will leave $12 billion on the table. It just evaporates. \nI do not think there is any need to do that.\n  I think having those resources in 14 million families, for 20 million \nchildren, is of enormous good and will help those families do things \nthat are very meaningful for their children.\n  I have gone through this rather briefly, but it is the essence of my \ndisagreement--not with the idea of funding IDEA or special ed but that \nyou make them mutually exclusive.\n  With that, I yield the floor so the Senator may continue explaining \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of points my \nfriend and colleague from Georgia has raised.\n  First of all, going back over the history of IDEA and where the \nsupport has been and not been over the years, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that this chart, dating from 1980 through the year 2000--over \n20 years--be made a part of the Record. It indicates the years and what \nthe various Presidents have requested, what was actually appropriated--\nthe distinction between what Presidents offered and what Congress \nagreed to.\n  From 1981 through 1992, without exception, the Presidential request \nwas lower than what Congress actually appropriated. Then in 1993, 1994, \n1995, and 1996 Congress actually appropriated a little less than what \nthe Clinton administration requested. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000--my \ncolleague is correct--the last 4 years, is where you actually have the \nCongress doing better than the Presidential request.\n  But over the 20 years, through the Reagan and Bush administrations, \nit was Congress that raised the amount. Most of those years in the \nSenate--not all, but certainly all those years in the House--the \nCongress was in the hands, if you will, of the Democrats. So there is a \nstrong background of this.\n  As I mentioned today, in the Budget Committee I offered--and I am \ncertainly not arguing on behalf of my party; in fact, I lost votes of \nmy party in the Budget Committee. I think I pointed out earlier I had \nthe support of Trent Lott, who was a member of the Budget Committee at \nthe time. But when I was on the Budget Committee a number of years ago \nI tried to put into the budget function category a number, over a \nperiod of years--I did not care what amount of years the Congress \nwanted to accept; 5 years, 10 years, 15 years--with the goal in mind we \nwould reach the 40-percent commitment we committed to in 1975. That is, \nthat the Federal Government would be a much better partner in \nsupporting our local communities with special education costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent this chart that goes from 1980, actually, \nthrough the year 2000, indicating Presidential requests and what \nCongress appropriated, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                           SPECIAL EDUCATION GRANTS TO STATES\n                                                        [Budget authority in billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         Pres. req. vs.    President's     Appropriation\n                                 Year                                     President's    Appropriation   appropriation       proposed         annual\n                                                                            request                        difference        increase        increase\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1980..................................................................  ..............          874.50  ...............  ...............  ..............\n1981..................................................................          691.50          874.50          183.00          (183.00)  ..............\n1982..................................................................          649.09          931.01          281.92          (225.41)           56.51\n1983..................................................................          771.70        1,017.90          246.21          (159.31)           86.89\n1984..................................................................          998.18        1,068.88           70.70           (19.72)           50.98\n1985..................................................................        1,068.88        1,135.15           66.27   ...............           66.27\n1986..................................................................        1,135.15        1,163.28           28.14   ...............           28.14\n1987..................................................................        1,135.15        1,338.00          202.86           (28.14)          174.72\n1988..................................................................        1,259.38        1,431.74          172.36           (78.62)           93.74\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\n \n1989..................................................................        1,474.24        1,475.45            1.21            42.50            43.71\n1990..................................................................        1,525.61        1,542.61           17.00            50.17            67.16\n1991..................................................................        1,615.13        1,854.19          239.06            72.52           311.58\n1992..................................................................        1,976.10        1,976.10  ...............          121.91           121.91\n1993..................................................................        2,073.30        2,052.73          (20.57)           97.21            76.63\n1994..................................................................        2,163.71        2,149.69          (14.02)          110.98            96.96\n1995..................................................................        2,353.03        2,322.92          (30.12)          203.35           173.23\n1996..................................................................        2,772.46        2,323.84         (448.62)          449.55             0.92\n1997..................................................................        2,603.25        3,109.40          506.15           279.41           785.56\n1998..................................................................        3,248.75        3,801.00          552.25           139.36           691.61\n1999..................................................................        4,020.70        4,310.70          290.00           219.70           509.70\n2000..................................................................        4,314.00  ..............  ...............  ...............  ..............\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Numbers in parentheses are negative.\n\n  Mr. DODD. For those who may be interested, there is a strong record \nof the Congress through all of the 1980s, up until 1992 actually, doing \na better job in terms of what we put into special ed than the \nadministration, which did a bit better from 1992 up through 1996; and \nthen the Congress has done better than the President in the last 4 \nyears in these areas.\n  Secondly, with regard to the point raised, again, I said earlier, \nthere are parts of the bill offered by my friend from Georgia with \nwhich I agree. I am not offering this amendment as a substitute to his \nbill. It is only dealing with one part of it. There are parts of this \nbill of which I am very much supportive. It is like anything else, you \nhave to make choices. Would we like to do everything? Maybe some people \nwould like to do everything. But we can't do everything. We have all \npainfully learned that.\n  We finally have ourselves in a situation where we now have surpluses. \nWe are moving in the right direction. The interest rates and the \neconomy reflect the fact that we are showing much more fiscal \ndiscipline than has been the case in the past.\n  I am suggesting that given the choice between a $1.2 billion tax \nproposal, a new program that may or may not produce, even if we take \nthe best estimates, the results that its proponents suggest--that is, \n$1.2 billion taken off the table--based on the evidence that has been \nsubmitted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the benefit for people \nwhose children go to public schools is very limited. They say $20.50 \nover 5 years. Those are not my numbers. Those aren't out of the \nDemocratic National Committee or some Democratic think tank. It is the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee that analyzes what \nthe tax implications are. We use it all the time.\n  They are saying to us: If you are the parents of public school \neducation children, which is where 50 million kids went to school this \nmorning--of the 55 million kids who went to school, 50 million of them \nwent to public schools, elementary and secondary, 5 million went to \nprivate and parochial schools--for the parents of those 50 million \nkids, the average benefits of all of this over 5 years is $20.50.\n  I pose the question, Which is the better choice? If you think you \ncould do everything, then you ought to vote, I guess, against my \namendment and hope at some later date you get a chance to vote for it. \nWe will do everything.\n  I don't think we can do everything. So I am merely posing an \nalternative that I think would be more meaningful to our mayors, county \nexecutives, Governors. In fact, this morning, at the combination \nmeeting of the Governors and the Senators, it was Governor Angus King, \nindependent Governor of Maine, who stood up and said: If you want to do \nsomething about education--and, by the way, I never met him before; I \nstill haven't met him. I don't know the man. But he stood up and said: \nIf you guys in the Senate really want to do something about education, \nwhy don't you do something about special education and our costs? He \ngot a standing ovation, applause from everybody in the room.\n  The Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, and Governor Tom Carper of \nDelaware said: This is the priority. Whom can I call? Whom can I get \nahold of for you to vote for your amendment, to support your amendment \nthis afternoon? Not because they disagree with what their friend and \ncolleague, as he is mine, is proposing here, but because they think \nthis is a better choice, with limited resources, to go to Oklahoma, \nConnecticut, Florida, to Georgia, to get back to our communities. It \ndoesn't solve the special education problem. We would have to \nappropriate $15 billion to get to the 40 percent obligation.\n  I don't want to create the illusion that I am solving that problem. \nWe are just getting closer to it. We are at 12.7. We were at 7 percent. \nThen we started to inch up a little bit in terms of getting better. Now \nwe are close to 13 percent, a far cry from 40, the $1.2 billion, and I \ndon't have the number what it gets you to. I think probably another \ncouple points, 2 or 3 percentage points, maybe 4 in terms of what that \n$1.2 billion spread out over 50 States would do. But at least it is tax \nrelief.\n\n  My friend says we do it for higher education. There is no property \ntax that supports higher education. There are State revenues that do \nit, but on a local basis that is not where it comes from. In the case \nof public elementary and secondary education, for the most part it is \nfree. There are costs associated with educating a child. I know that. \nBut I know very few public higher educational institutions that are \nfree. Most of them are pretty expensive today. Some have a limited \namount of cost, but for most of them, it is pretty expensive.\n  Of course, you don't have to go to college. We would like everybody \nto. The law requires you go to elementary school and requires that you \ngo to high school or at least stay in school until you are 16. For most \nStates, I think that is true. But there is no requirement you go beyond \nthat. So there is a distinction between what our obligations are to \nelementary and secondary education and what we try to achieve in higher \neducation--obviously, a huge distinction in cost.\n  Although I have disagreements with the underlying proposal offered by \nmy friend from Georgia, I believe we are trying to be all places at the \nsame time and, as a result of that, not doing much in any.\n  My fundamental point is not so much to say this is not a good idea he \nhas proposed but to say this is a better one. I don't know of a mayor \nin my State who hasn't asked me to do something about this issue for \nthe last 10 years. When I go back, as I know all of our colleagues do, \nwhen I go back to them and say: What do you want me to work on this \nyear?--I think all of us do that probably in our December-February \nperiods; we go back and talk to the local officials who are close to \nour constituents in our States. I don't know of a year when this \nspecial education issue hasn't been in the top five of the items about \nwhich they say: Look, this is a tremendous cost to us. You mandated it, \nbasically, at the Federal level in 1975. We don't disagree with you. We \nthink we ought to provide educational opportunity for children with \nspecial needs in this country so they will maximize their potential. \nBut you promised us, Mr. Senator, you were going to come up with 40 \npercent of the cost of this. You told us we have to do it. We agree \nwith you. Now you are only up to 12 or 13 percent.\n  Frankly, in a lot of States, it is around 5 percent, 9 percent. I \ndon't have every State here because not every State gives us all the \nnumbers. Looking down this list, as I mentioned earlier, California has \na $3 billion higher education cost. The Federal Government comes up \nwith 5 percent of that.\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nSo 12.7 is a national number, but individual States are very different. \nIn Florida, it is 6 percent; that is the Federal participation. We are \nway short of the 40 percent.\n  I don't see Oklahoma on this, for the benefit of the Presiding \nOfficer, and I don't see Georgia. This is not a complete list of all 50 \nStates.\n  As I mentioned earlier, some States are 13 percent; South Dakota is. \nIndiana is 17 percent; that is how much the Federal Government \ncontributes to that price tag for special education. But an awful lot \nof States are at 5, 8, 7, and 4 percent--Nevada. Montana is at 14 \npercent; Missouri, 10 percent. It varies from State to State as to how \nmuch the Federal dollars are getting back.\n\n  My point is this: If you can't do everything, you have to make \nchoices. What is the better choice: A new program that may or may not \nhave the benefits its authors suggest, or to do something that every \njurisdiction in this country, every taxpayer at the local level would \nappreciate and would dramatically, in some cases, reduce the cost of \ntheir financial obligations?\n  I suggest the better choice is the amendment that is pending. It \nwould take that $1.2 billion and send it back to Oklahoma, Connecticut, \nGeorgia, Florida, California and say: This is a downpayment on that \nlong-term commitment. We haven't reached it yet. We are doing better, \nbut we are not there yet.\n  I mentioned earlier, California has a $3.72 billion price tag on \nspecial ed. Florida has a $1.47 billion price tag on special ed. My \nState of Connecticut is $627 million. I have one small community, \nTorrington, CT, that has over $1 million in special education costs \nbecause we required it. In 1975, we said: We will educate all kids, \nincluding those with disabilities in this country. We want everybody to \nhave at least the potential or the opportunity to maximize their \npotential. I don't know of a single person who wants us to retreat on \nthat commitment.\n  The point of my amendment is, don't retreat on it, but also don't \nrenege. Don't renege on the contract. The contract was to our States \nand our communities and our counties. Your Federal Government will be a \nfar better partner, and we will help you reduce that financial burden \nwe imposed upon you in 1975 and have never gotten close to paying. The \n$1.2 billion gets us closer.\n  What my friend from Georgia has offered is maybe a great idea--\nmaybe--although I have some disagreements, but I know what this does. I \nknow $1.2 billion going back to the 50 States of this country will \ncategorically and unequivocally provide relief for people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I commend my friend because life in the Senate is \nabout choices. I think what the Senator from Connecticut has done for \nthis debate, in my opinion, is to have given us a very clear choice of \nhow we want to proceed. We have known for, let's say, the last 20 years \nthat there is not an endless cookie jar; we are going to have to make \nthe tough choice.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting is this: We have a \nprogram that is vital to perhaps the children in this country who need \nmore help than almost any other group, children who have special ed \nneeds. We have not met our commitment; we haven't fulfilled our \npromise. So I would appreciate it if the Senator from Connecticut can \ntell me if I am right in sort of summing up where he is coming from. He \nhas taken the floor and has not said everything in the pending bill is \nbad, not at all. I know personally he agrees strongly with a couple of \nthings.\n  Mr. DODD. What I have offered is an amendment to the Coverdell \nproposal, not a substitute. So I only address this particular issue. \nThere are a number of other provisions in the bill that I think are \nadmirable.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Those provisions would still stand. What the Senator is \nbasically saying is that the billion-plus would go to people who \nessentially, for the most part, send their kids to private schools, K \nthrough 12, and rather than give them this tax writeoff, if you will, \nwe should use the money to fulfill our commitment for special \neducation. That is the bottom line.\n  I want to ask my friend two questions. I don't know if he spoke about \nthe meeting with the Governors today, but if he has not, I think it \nwould be an important point, since he spoke to many of us about this \ntoday--what the message of the Governors is vis-a-vis this special ed \nand what it would mean. He has already said what it means to my State \nto get more funding for special ed. We are in the hole now by several \nbillion dollars. So this amendment is very important.\n  The second question, perhaps, is a more philosophical one but one to \nwhich I would be interested in hearing an answer. I think if we are \nhonest with ourselves, we know the people who could afford to set aside \n$2,000 a year in our society each and every year are the ones who are \nliving or earning more than, shall we say, most middle-class people \nbecause we know the figures. If we are honest with ourselves, to set \naside $2,000--and that is after-tax money--in an account where, by the \nway, you don't get any real tax benefit, except the buildup is not \ntaxed, so it comes out to roughly a few dollars a year--who are we \nreally helping? Are we helping 95 percent of public school kids? Are we \ndoing one thing or are we giving a nice, sweet tax benefit to people \nwho already can set aside the money? I think there are two questions. \nOne, if my friend can talk about the Governors and how they feel on \nthis issue of reimbursing the States for special ed; and, two, \nphilosophically, what is going to help more families?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from California that I \ndid mention the Governors. The Governor of Maine stood up and made the \npoint that this was the top priority, and I think it was one of the few \nmoments when there was widespread applause in the room by colleagues, \nboth Republicans and Democrats; there were a lot of nodding heads.\n  Obviously, Governors have a long shopping list for us. If they could \ndo one thing in the area of education, this was the issue. Tom Daschle \nraised it: ``Ironically, the next vote we are likely to have is on the \nissue you think is your top priority.''\n\n  I talked with Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania afterwards, a \nRepublican, and Democratic Governor Tom Carper of Delaware. Both said \nthey are going to try to call members of the respective caucuses to \nurge them to vote for this amendment. They felt this would make a \ndifference immediately for them. So I thank them. I thank the National \nGovernors' Association. I don't have it with me, but I will get it. I \nhave a year-old letter signed by Michael Leavitt, Governor Mike \nHuckabee of Arkansas, Tom Carper and Jim Hunt. It is a March 9, 1999, \nletter to Pete Domenici. I have blown it up. In part, it says:\n\n       Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its original \n     commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B services as \n     authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be achieved.\n\n  In the first paragraph, it says:\n\n       As you prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal \n     year, the nation's Governors urge Congress to live up to \n     agreements already made to be meet current funding \n     commitments to States before funding new initiatives or tax \n     cuts in the Federal budget.\n\n  So 50 State Governors say if you want to pick a priority, this is it. \nSo, again, this isn't, as my friend from Georgia said--again, some may \nthink you can do everything and probably will vote that way. If you \ncan't--and hopefully you can do everything--then you have to make \nchoices about where you should do some things.\n  I am glad the Senator from California raised the issue about the \nbuildup. I think that is important. The buildup is important. Under \nhigher education--and I drew a distinction; I think there are \nsignificant distinctions between the choice of going on to higher \neducation and the requirement that you go to grade school and high \nschool, at least until the age of 16--the fact that public education, \nwhere 50 million kids go to school every day is free, whereas higher \neducation is not free, whether it is public or private, and that you \ndon't have a property tax supporting higher education as you do \nelementary and public education.\n  When people are planning for college--not that they do it as early as \nthey would like--they start putting that money away early, in some \ncases when the child is born, with full knowledge that a 4-year college \neducation could end up costing $100,000 at many\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\ninstitutions in this country. So you end up with a buildup of $500 to \n$1,000 a year, and that is where it has value. You are not talking \nabout a buildup in that regard, about kids who are young and starting \nout, I presume. What you are talking about is investing in, as I \nunderstand it, some tax-free withdrawals from this account for things \nlike tuition fees, academic tutoring, books, room, board, supplies, \nequipment, and so forth. So it is going to public and private \neducation.\n  If you make $150,000 a year on joint returns, this is a pretty good \nbenefit. If you are making $30,000 or $40,000, or less, it is not much \nat all. The Joint Committee on Taxation said this only had a marginal \nbenefit to people. Also, the accounting practices; can you imagine the \nnightmare? You are going to be taxed if you buy some things and not \ntaxed if you buy others.\n  What about if it is sporting equipment to go to school; is that part \nof the education? What about the band outfit you may wear; is that \neducation or not? I don't know. Maybe others feel certain they know \nwhat it is. I can see a nightmare of accounting procedures to try to \ndetermine what is truly an educational benefit and what is not quite an \neducational benefit.\n\n  I will finish, and then I will yield to my colleague to respond. Of \ncourse, when you start getting into this whole point, as I said, \nbenefits to public school children and their parents, at least based on \nthe assessments we have, are marginal at best; $5 of tax relief a year, \neach year, for 5 years--or 4\\1/2\\ or 5 years--as opposed to doing \nsomething that lowers your property tax by sending the dollars back to \nreduce the cost of special education and local community--I promise you \nthat is more than $5 a year; it is significantly more for people.\n  Again, it is the choice I think we make. We all say we love to listen \nto our Governors. The Governors are in town. They met with the Senators \nabout 3 hours ago. The Governors have said, virtually unanimously: If \nyou want to do something to help us right away, here is the issue. They \nspecifically said: Do this before you start off on new initiatives that \nmay not benefit even the people you think you are going to benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I said earlier, it \ndoesn't substitute the entire bill. It merely offers a substitute to \nthe particular provisions on payment. The other parts of the bill \nremain. I think this is a much wiser choice to make. I say that with \nall due respect to my colleague from Georgia, with whom I work jointly \non so many issues. I know he is anxious to respond. I think the Senator \nfrom Florida wants to be heard as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as I understand it, the sequence of \namendments is such that there will be a Republican amendment after the \namendment by Senator Dodd, and then there will be a Democratic \namendment by Senator Robb, and then another Republican amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I might offer the transition teaching \namendment immediately after the Republican amendment, which will follow \nSenator Robb's amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will withhold on that \nrequest, I know leadership has worked out a scheduling sequence. I \ndon't want to object, but I would have to object right now without them \ngetting involved. Why not make the comments and then come back?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I could offer this amendment with the \nunderstanding that if there is someone who needs to go ahead of me I \nwould yield at that time. I was on the floor this morning and now this \nafternoon for purposes of trying to get in the queue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if the Senator will proceed and let me \ninquire, we will come back. I promise the Senator that I will take care \nof that right now.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't have any remarks to make on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquires, who is yielding time?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield time off my time to my friend from \nFlorida. I will inquire, if the Senator wants to go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on our time, I see the Senator from \nCalifornia is still present. I don't know if the issue of who benefits \nand who doesn't was thoroughly covered. I don't know that this will \nmake a difference in the Senator's vote, but I think it is important \nthat her question be answered.\n  First of all, the means test--and it is means tested as to who can \nparticipate in this, and I probably wouldn't have done it that way, but \nthat is the politics of the day--is identical to the college account we \nhave set, which means 70 percent of the benefits flow to people making \n$75,000 or less. It is the middle income and below who are the primary \nbeneficiaries of the account.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I say to my friend I understand that \ncompletely. But that was for the analysis on the $500.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is the analysis on this account.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding on the $2,000 is there are fewer people \nin that category who could participate; and therefore, it would not \nbenefit the middle class.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The data I quoted is the data on the analysis of this \naccount.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then we have some disagreement. But we will check our \nchart.\n  I wanted to say on the issue of why this is different than the \ncollege account--I think Senator Dodd very eloquently made the point--\nour side of the aisle has been pushing for a long time to help parents \nsend their children to college, whether it is through Pell grants, \nloans, or education saving accounts for college. I remember way back \nduring the days I was in the House I was supporting these education \nIRAs, but the point is that it is quite different now.\n  To go to a public college in California costs $5,000, $6,000, or \n$7,000 a year. Fortunately, we have free public schools. What we are \nlooking at here is quite a different situation.\n  We know on the face of it that 95 percent of our children go to \npublic schools. I know the Senator says this is going to help the \npublic schools, but our research indicates this is disproportionate. We \nare talking about a couple of dollars in benefits. It comes down to a \nchoice.\n\n  If I had a menu of things, I am sure I would rank money higher on the \nmenu of things, but it doesn't compare my money to the substitute, or \nto the amendment which keeps a lot of good in the Senator's bill. But \nit just says ``revenue lost'' instead of being dissipated in the $7 per \nfamily over a period of time--a year--and maybe adds up to $7. It would \nbe much better to go to our States and help with special education, \nwhereas Senator Dodd says it means it is going to result in lower \nproperty taxes because our local school districts will benefit.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is the time of the Senator from Georgia. Sure.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No one can certify that this is going to affect \nproperty taxes whatsoever. In fact, the doubling of IDEA, if you can \nfind a jurisdiction that took this and lowered the property tax--I \nthink you should listen--isn't what happened. I don't mean that we \nought not to be fulfilling this obligation, but I have seen no example \nof the property tax being affected one way or the other as we fulfill \nthis obligation.\n  I think what happens is, as we fulfill the Federal obligation, which \nis rather remarkable--here we are 25 years later and still haven't done \nit--it theoretically frees up local school districts to do other things \nthat are important in education. I find it interesting.\n  The other point I was going to make to the Senator from California \nand to the Senator from Connecticut is they essentially inferred--and I \ncan understand why--that the education savings account is different in \na sense from the higher education and K through 12 because I think in \nthe debate we have focused on K through 12. But there are extensive \nfamilies benefitting from that. They ought to have the opportunity--the \n``choice''--to use those funds if they so desire. But these accounts \nare a college account, too.\n  We have taken the President's proposal and the congressional proposal\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nand made it four times more powerful. It can be used for college. It \ncan be used for the disabled and for dependent students following \ncollege.\n  My assumption is--we have to make some estimates--that many of these \nfamilies will not use this in K through 12. Some will. But a large \nnumber of them will use the buildup where essentially it is broadening \nthe scope of what people can do as they try to meet the very costs \nabout which the Senator from California talks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask my friend a question on this point because this \nis a good debate.\n  What the Senator is essentially saying is somebody can open up one of \nthese Coverdell plans.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. They do not call them Coverdell plans. It sounds like \na wonderful idea.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Doesn't it sound great? I will give the Senator that. It \nis his idea. Come up with a Coverdell account, and they start it, say, \nwhen the child is first born. Then the child is 5. If this is for real, \nthey start using it, but if it isn't for real, they will hold it. Who \ngets the tax benefit? Because they can afford to, they have another \naccount for $2,000 for college. Now we are saying this is a family now \nsetting aside $4,000 every year. I ask my friend.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, because the Senator said there could be an addition \nto----\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The college account.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No. What I am saying is that we broaden it from $500 \nto $2,000. So an account can be opened for up to $2,000, whereas now it \nis limited to $500, A; and, B, if they chose, they could use a \nwithdrawal somewhere through kindergarten through high school if that \nwas important to them for whatever circumstance. They don't have to \nhold it for college.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't understand. I am saying to my friend that it is a \nsecond bureaucracy, if you will--a new account that can be used for \ncollege in addition to the account we are looking at for college that \nwe already have. I think it is getting confusing. I think if we want to \nlet people set aside funds and get a tax break for college, this is \ncrucial.\n  I think at this point to expand this idea to get to K through 12, as \nSenator Dodd pointed out, if this is on the level and people start \nspending it when the child is 5, they essentially have 5 years to save, \nwhereas what we are suggesting is that people can do much better. They \ncan take that money and use it, say, long term for 18 years, have more \nof a buildup and have more of a fund.\n  What I am fearful of, if we start with all of these, is that only the \nwealthiest people will be able to do it. They will do it for both. \nAgain, we start rewarding the people in our society--God bless them, \nand I have nothing but respect for people who manage to make it. We are \nrewarding them and we are not doing a thing to help the average person.\n  That gets me back to where Senator Dodd started with his amendment. \nIf this is not going to do much for most of our kids--it is confusing, \nI agree. I started wondering--if they can get a band outfit, if that is \nworkable, yes. I argue that is part of the school. Or a uniform? But, \nwait a minute, that is giving a benefit to one child. What about the \nkid who doesn't make the band? Then the IRS is going to have to confab \nand figure whether this is a discriminatory benefit. I think we are \nopening up a can of worms a little bit. I think Senator Dodd offers us \na cleaner way to spend this $1.2 billion, which is to ease the burden \non the local districts.\n\n  I daresay it is only common sense. Our school boards have a certain \namount of money. If they cannot meet their budgets, they are going to \nhave to raise your taxes. Maybe this is going to help them. I assume it \nis going to help them. In California, we have a lid on our property \ntax, so this is a huge benefit for us because there is just so much we \ncan raise in property taxes.\n  Since we have a finite amount of money, I think the Senator from \nConnecticut is offering us a chance to step back and say let's not \ncreate a new program, which now I understand you could roll into a \ncollege account, which really gets me confused, and keep it simple and \nuse this money for special ed.\n  I thank my friend for being so generous in yielding to me. I thank my \nfriend from Connecticut for, I think in many ways, bringing us back to \nwhat we have to do, and that is to make these hard choices. He is \nsaying: Listen to what the Governors are saying. Let's take care of \nthis problem first.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to respond to the Senator from California \nby calling into play an individual for whom I know she has enormous \nrespect, and that is the Vice President of the United States. He says:\n\n       Our current education IRA's simply do not meet the needs of \n     the information age. They are limited to $500 a year.\n\n  He is right.\n\n       And it must be used by an age of 30. In a fast moving, fast \n     changing economy, the right skills will often cost more than \n     $500 a year and learning must last a lifetime.\n\n  Then Vice President Gore goes on to say:\n\n       Here is my idea. We need to create a new 401(j) account \n     like the 401(k) plans that help you save for retirement. But \n     this account will allow employers and employees to contribute \n     up to $2,500 a year. . .\n\n  So he is $500 over what I am saying.\n\n     . . . in order to pay for college or job training expenses.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Is this for elementary and secondary education?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. He says for college. We are for college. This account \napplies for college.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then scratch the other part of it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Why should we do that? This is a classic example: \nLet's tell them what is important to them. You think it is important it \nonly be for college. I think it ought to be up to the family to decide \nwhere and when they have a special need. Maybe they have a student who \nis in junior high school who suffers a very serious injury and they \nneed assistance or they have a child who they discover has dyslexia. \nYou do not deal with dyslexia when you are in college. You deal with it \nin the younger years. There are many problems associated with that.\n  So let's let them decide. I think the majority of them will utilize \nthese funds at college. But there will be occasions where families have \nrequirements that occur before that. I can think of no reason why we \nshould arbitrarily decide: I am sorry, that is a decision we have made \nfor you.\n\n  Mr. DODD. If I can respond to my friend?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have no idea how they are dealing with the division \nof time. We are doing so well.\n  Mr. DODD. This much I promise: If you run out of time, I will give \nyou time. We know we have to finish at 4. I don't know if we will have \na tremendous number of Senators coming over here. We will accommodate \neverybody wishing to be heard.\n  What I have offered as a substitute, with all respect, has more \nvalue. Again, I think Governors, mayors, and local taxpayers will tell \nyou right now the cost of special education is a dominant, significant \nissue we ought to try to take care of. I have not suggested, except \nperipherally, that there are underlying problems with the Coverdell \napproach. But I made the case, if you cannot do everything, of the two \nchoices, which is a better one? I think the special ed is a better one. \nI say that. I realize there is a difference of opinion.\n  But let me respond, if I can, to the issue, just freestanding, of the \nCoverdell proposal and why I have difficulty with that as it stands. \nThere are 55 million children who got up this morning, from Maine to \nCalifornia, who went off to an elementary or secondary school in this \ncountry--55 million. Fifty million of them walked into a public \nschool--50 million; 5 million walked into a private school or a \nparochial school. The question is, this bill as it stands is designed \nto predominantly provide a tax break for those who want to send their \nkids to private and parochial schools, and it is being cloaked that \nsomehow this is great for education. You do not build a new classroom, \nyou don't pay a teacher more, you don't reduce the size of the class, \nyou don't wire the school with it, none of that stuff. This is all on \nan individual basis, where the bulk of it, 90 percent of it, goes to \nthose who are in the income category who can afford to send their kids \nto private schools. We have 50 million kids and their parents who are \nlooking to see whether or not\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nwe are going to take some of their tax money and improve the quality of \neducation.\n  They do not have the choice. They do not have the choice to say I \nthink I will send my kid to some private boarding school in Connecticut \nor Georgia or some other place. They do not have that kind of money to \ndo that. Their kids have to go to public school. That is the choice \nthey have. They want to know whether or not their Senators are going to \ndo anything about improving the quality of the educational institution \nto which they have to send their kids.\n  That is a big difference. You have limited money. You are going to \ntake $1.2 billion of this, the bulk of which is going to go to those in \nthe upper income category, and for those parents who do not have that \nchoice, they get zilch out of this thing. My point is that is a bad \nidea, in my view, with limited resources. But aside from that, I think \ngetting the money back to our communities, providing some real relief \non special education is what is necessary.\n  I have great respect--I am a product of parochial and private \neducation. My parents could afford to do it. They sent me to those \nschools. That was a choice they made. I respect them for it. But they \nnever thought they ought to get a tax break for doing so. They \nunderstood that. They also understood there is a fundamental commitment \nand relationship between this institution and setting the agenda to \naccomplish the national purpose in education, a fundamental \nresponsibility to public education.\n  The public has no other choices. I know people are upset with the \nquality of some of our public education institutions. I wish the \nnewspapers and media covered good schools as well because there are an \nawful lot of good schools out there doing a terrific job providing a \nwonderful educational opportunity in the inner-city and rural America. \nBut our obligation is to see to it that fundamentally we work on the \nquality of those institutions that are not doing quite as well.\n  My view is this distracts, it is a distraction from the real business \nof supporting quality public schooling in this country. Aside from tax \npolicy, which I think is questionable as well, and different choices we \ncould make with it, there is an underlying problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorial in the Washington Post in its \nmorning edition, its lead editorial today, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, February 29, 2000]\n\n                       School Choice for the Rich\n\n       The Senate is to take up today a proposal to use the tax \n     code to provide public funds to private schools through the \n     back door. Most Democrats, led by the president, are rightly \n     resisting; the proposal is bad tax and educational policy \n     alike.\n       The bill whose principal sponsors are Sens. Paul Coverdell \n     (R-Ga.) and Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), would allow \n     households with annual incomes of as much as $150,000 to set \n     aside $2,000 a year per child in educational savings \n     accounts, the earnings on which would be tax-free. Parents \n     can already save this way for college; this would let them do \n     so to help pay elementary and high school expenses as well.\n       Unlike some other pending tax cut proposals, the cost would \n     be relatively modest, in part because not that many families \n     could afford to take advantage of the measure. Almost all the \n     benefit would accrue to those with well above average incomes \n     and children in private--including sectarian--schools. The \n     revenue forgone would represent an indirect subsidy to such \n     schools.\n       The president has vetoed similar legislation in the past, \n     and the Office of Management and Budget has indicated he is \n     prepared to do so again. We hope he's spared the need. Some \n     Senate Democrats think the veto threat lets them off the \n     hook. Rather than be the heavies who block an education bill \n     and tax cut, if given the chance to debate some education \n     proposals of their own they'll let the measure pass, secure \n     in the knowledge the president will block it for them down \n     the road. But that's too stagy a way to legislate. If \n     Congress wants to spend money on education, it should be on \n     needier children; if it wants to promote school choice, the \n     debate should center on helping parents who do not, by virtue \n     of their income, have any such choice now. Lawmakers should \n     kill this while they've got the chance.\n\n  Mr. DODD. It is entitled, ``School Choice for the Rich.''\n\n       The Senate is to take up today a proposal to use the tax \n     code to provide public funds to private schools through the \n     back door.\n\n  Fifty million kids and their parents are asking the question: What \nare you doing about my kids' school? I understand 5 million kids whose \nparents would like us to do something about tax relief for them if they \ngo to private schools, but I think we have a higher obligation to the \nparents of those 50 million who have no choice. Those who made the \nchoice of going to private school made that choice. I respect it, but \nthe parents who send their kids to public schools are not, \nunfortunately, in the same category.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I want to say to my friend, \nhis education was very good. I went to public schools from kindergarten \nall the way through college. Even in college it only cost, in those \ndays, $12 a semester in the State of New York university system. What \nan amazing thing.\n  We had several people wind up going to Congress from that public \neducation system. So in my heart I understand when my friend from \nConnecticut says we have an obligation to the 50 million children who \nwalk into those public schools every day--5 million go to the parochial \nschool, 55 million in all--but we have an obligation in the public \nschool arena.\n  It gets down to yet another choice. The Senator from Connecticut has \ngiven us a choice between a tax break that is predominantly going to go \nto the wealthiest, that is going to be very minimal, and special \neducation. That is the choice he has laid out.\n  My friend also will win my vote, frankly, if he took that $1.2 \nbillion and put it into school construction or put it into more \nafterschool slots or early education, early childhood development, \npreschool, and child care in which my friend has been so involved. We \nare looking to bring home a very important choice.\n  The Governors said: Here is the choice, Senators; before you take \ncare of any other new programs and new bureaucracies, take care of \nspecial ed. My friend from Connecticut is listening to them and doing \nthat, and he is further saying that before we do any of these \nnewfangled accounts, which will be interpreted and reinterpreted by IRS \nagents up and down the line and may be very confusing, let's take care \nof our public schools.\n  What I am saying is, not only will I support the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut, but I will also support amendments to come \nthat will take this money and put it into lower class sizes, to do some \nnew construction, to train our teachers better, to get technology in \nthe schools, to make sure we have room for every child who wants \nafterschool care which we know is the best crimefighting program \naround.\n  I thank my friend for coming today. His voice on this issue is very \nimportant, but I think on this one, with his interest in education and \nhis views of concern about it and his success in it, I hope the Senate \nwill listen to the Senator from Connecticut and do first things first: \nTake care of our public school kids--that is 95 percent of our kids K \nthrough 12--before we set up some newfangled ideas on which there is \neven debate over the facts as to who it helps.\n  The Senator has a paper that says to me it is only going to help the \nvery wealthy. Senator Coverdell says it helps if one makes $75,000. \nCommon sense tells me if we start setting aside $2,000 a year, it \n``ain't'' going to be my working-class people who are going to do that, \nI can tell you right now. They tell me they can barely make ends meet. \nI know what this is about.\n  I thank my friend for bringing more clarity to the debate. I will be \nsupporting him.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wish to clarify a point, if I can \nhave the attention of the Senator from Connecticut, because I know how \nthese things happen. We have been in touch with Governor Ridge. He does \nsupport education savings accounts and would not support an amendment \nthat made that point moot. I know the Senator was at a meeting--he \ncertainly supports the funding of IDEA. I did want to make it clear \nthat he does support the education savings account, so we can clarify \nthat one point.\n  Mr. DODD. I attended the Governors' meeting earlier today, and \nGovernor\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nRidge said he would be glad to help out and try to convince people to \nvote for the amendment. I say to the Senator, with all due respect, I \nam also quite confident Vice President Gore does not support the \nCoverdell legislation, if there is any doubt about that at all.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I yield 15 \nminutes to my defiant, dedicated, committed cosponsor from the other \nside of the aisle--I admire his courage on this issue--Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for not only \nyielding me this time but more than that, for, through these last few \nyears, framing this debate and tirelessly bringing this issue forward. \nThis is not the first time, it is not the second time, it may not be \nthe third time Senator Coverdell and I have come to the Senate floor \nfor A+ savings accounts and, most assuredly, it will not be the last. \nThis is going to happen.\n  More than simply telling the Senate of the inevitability of these \nsavings accounts, I want us all to recognize what a positive \ncontribution we are making to American education.\n  I rise in opposition to Senator Dodd's amendment. Indeed, on another \nday, another opportunity, I not only would vote for it, I would fight \nfor it, as I would with Senator Robb's amendment dealing with the \nbuilding of new schools, and Senator Murray's amendment adding new \nteachers and reducing class size.\n  The problems of American education are not such that they require a \nsingle idea or one change. This is not a system with which we need to \ntinker. We have compound problems. The one Senator Dodd raises is among \nthe most important. We gave an obligation to local schools without the \nresources to pay for special education. Senator Robb's amendment and \nSenator Murray's amendment are important in building schools that are \ncrumbling around us in some communities and adding new teachers. They \nare good ideas, they are important ideas, but so is this.\n  For as long as I can remember, the formula for funding American \nschools has been quite simple: We raise your taxes, and we spend your \ndollars. That will continue to dominate American education. It is the \nright formula. We are adding something new, though not a novel idea. \nIndeed, ironically the source of this idea is President Clinton. In \nestablishing higher education savings accounts of $500, he laid the \nfoundation for what we debate today because what was a good idea for \nhigher education at $500 is a great idea for secondary schools at \n$2,000. Same idea, same formula with the same end.\n  This is using private money. It is using a family's own resources. By \nour estimation, after 5 years, $12 billion in private money will be \nused to educate children K through 12. That cannot be a bad thing. Yet \nthe critics argue it is a diversion of money from the public schools. \nNot one dime of money that is now going to a public school goes \nanywhere else but to that same school on that same basis. This is new \nmoney, private money, a net increase of $12 billion.\n  People argue that maybe it is all new money, but it goes to a \nprivileged few. The Congressional Budget Office argues that 70 percent \nof this money will be spent by families who earn less than $70,000. \nDoes this solve the educational problems of a family in poverty who may \nhave no money? Maybe not. Probably not. I challenge any Member of this \nSenate to come to this floor and tell me one educational idea that \nsolves the educational problems of every family in every regard forever \nwith one bill. This one does not either, but it does help many working \nfamilies, working poor, middle-class families.\n  The family who earns $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, even $70,000 a year \nbut wants to give their child some extra advantage in education, they \nwant to establish a private savings account. Why should the Federal \nGovernment be charging taxes on the interest on that account? Every \nMember of this Senate knows that education is the great test of whether \nor not we preserve our quality of life, our national security, our way \nof life.\n  The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage \nevery parent in America to save every dollar they can muster to educate \ntheir child. Taxing that money is the last thing we should be doing. \nThat is the essence of this bill: Eliminate Federal taxes on money \nsaved for education. That cannot be a bad idea. Yet it is argued that \nmaybe it is private money and there is no diversion. Maybe Senators are \nright about that. Maybe it does go to middle-class and working-class \nfamilies. Maybe Senators are right about that. It is argued that it is \nnot for a privileged few but it all does go to private schools and we \nhave a public and private school problem. Well, wrong again.\n  CBO estimates that 70 percent of this money actually will go to \npublic school students. Public school students are over 90 percent of \nthe students in America. If we are going to help everybody, by \ndefinition, most of that money will go to public school students. That \nis what the research has found because this money is not just available \nfor private school tuition. This money is available to hire public \nschool teachers after public school is out in the afternoon to help \nstudents in math and science--something desperately needed by many of \nour families--for afterschool transportation, for afterschool \nactivities of band or athletics or clubs, to buy a home computer, to \nbuy books or, if you do not use money for any of these things, to roll \nit into your college account after the 12th grade when the student is \ngoing into college.\n  Is some of this money going for private school tuition? Yes, a \nminority of it, 30 percent of it. Some does go to private school \ntuition. I am not here to apologize for that. If, in one piece of \nlegislation, we can add $12 billion to the national expenditure for \nschools, help public school students with 70 percent of this money--for \ncomputers and books and tutors--I do not rise on this floor to \napologize that some of this will go to private schools, yeshivas, or \nparochial schools for tuition.\n  In many of our cities, the Catholic school is the only alternative \navailable to many families who want something better for their child. \nTuition can be $800, $700, $1,200--out of reach for many families. Who \nis going to these schools? What is this ``idle rich'' we hear about who \nwill benefit from this bill? Ninety percent of the students in Camden \nand Newark and Jersey City going to parochial schools are Protestants; \n80 percent of them are African American. This is not a religious \nopportunity. It is a competitive school, a chance for a parent to give \nsomething else to their child.\n  We do not ask the Federal Government to pay for it--not a dime, no \npublic money. Personally, I do not believe in it. I think it is \nunconstitutional. I do not think public money can or should go directly \nto pay for tuitions in religious institutions. That is my belief. That \nis why I am for this bill because this bill does not do that--no public \nmoney. A family takes their own money, earned off the sweat of their \nown brow, puts it in a private account, and uses that money, which has \nnot been taxed because of this legislation, and pays tuition. That \ncannot be a bad thing.\n  Opposition to this legislation has many aspects. In my judgment, \nclearly, one of them is that we do not recognize the true depths of the \nproblem of American education. Getting more teachers, building more \nschools, higher standards for public schools are all part of that, but \nthat is not enough. This is a fight that must be fought on every front \nsimultaneously.\n\n  Second, I think many people simply do not recognize the state we \nwould be in if we did not have private schools. We are losing a \nCatholic school in America every week with another school closing its \ndoors. If we lose the parochial education system in America, it will \ncost $16 billion immediately to replace the system. The system must \nsurvive within constitutional bounds. That is what Senator Coverdell \nand I are attempting to do with this legislation.\n  Third, I think there is a partisan issue. With all respect to my \nfriend, Senator Coverdell and his colleagues, in my personal judgment, \nthe leadership in America on education for the last generation has been \nborne by the Democratic Party. We created the programs for grants, for \ntuition assistance, for aid to secondary schools that built libraries, \nbuilt schools, and opened opportunities. It is one of the reasons why I \nam a Democrat. Now we\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nhave a little competition; frankly, not a lot.\n  The ideas are still overwhelmingly from the Democratic Party. But \nthis idea cannot be bad simply because some Republicans are for it. \nThat is the only argument I have heard against it. If there is going to \nbe a competition between the Democratic and Republican Parties for \nleadership on education, that is good for America. If we are going to \ncompete to convince the American people that each of us has the best \nformula for improving our schools, that is good for every child in \nAmerica.\n  To the Republican Party, I say: Welcome to the fight. We have been \nwaiting for you for a long time. But I am glad you are here.\n  This concept of A+ savings accounts has no parentage on a partisan \nbasis. It is borne of Bill Clinton's concept for funding higher \neducation. It has been adjusted by Senator Coverdell, imaginatively, \ncreatively, and effectively, to deal with the problems of grade schools \nand high schools, to help public and private schools with millions of \nAmerican families.\n  I have been for this concept since I came to the Senate. It is a \nreflection of my own belief that the American standard of living is not \nsustainable if we do not dramatically improve the quality of \ninstruction and the performance of our students in this generation. It \nis not difficult to comprehend, if the United States goes another \ndecade being 16th of the leading 18 industrial nations in the quality \nof math and science instruction, if 40 percent of 4th graders \neffectively cannot read to national standards, if a third of our \nstudents in the 8th grade cannot meet basic science requirements, this \nNation will not continue to maintain our standard of living or even our \ncurrent level of national security.\n  Education is the great divider in the world, between the insecure and \nthe poor and the wanting and those who exercise leadership and live \nbehind secure borders with rising standards of living. That is our \ntest. I can think of no more important issue for this Senate to debate.\n  I genuinely hope that not only will this A+ savings account \nlegislation pass the Senate--and I have no doubt it will pass the \nSenate--I genuinely hope we will pass it on a bipartisan basis. But in \na challenge to Republican leadership, as well, the argument that \nSenator Dodd makes today for funding special education, and the \nargument that Senator Murray and Senator Robb will make on class size \nand school construction, are arguments that not only must be heard, it \nis legislation that must be adopted.\n  Pass this legislation today and then let us return and complete the \ndebate and meet our obligation to America's schoolchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 18 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Georgia has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. There are only two of us here, so I suspect we can manage \nthis in some way if one or the other of us ends up a little short of \ntime.\n  First of all, my friend from New Jersey has raised, as he always \ndoes, some compelling arguments. He is a very persuasive debater. I \nagree with him on a couple points. I think, first of all, maybe I \nshould have said this at the outset of the debate, that I adhere to the \nadmonition that Thomas Jefferson gave almost 200 years ago: Any nation \nthat expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never \npossibly can be.\n  As important as education was to the development of the 19th century, \nit certainly is just as important now a few days into the 21st century. \nNo issue will be more important for the development and continued \nsuccess of our own country than to have a very successful educational \nsystem in our Nation. So I agree Senator Torricelli on that point.\n  My point is, I do not think we can do everything. That is my point. I \nwould like to do a lot of things, but my concern is we have $1.2 \nbillion in this program. If I have $1.2 billion for special ed, it does \nnot even remotely get close to the 40 percent we promised our States we \nwould give them for special education. We need $15.8 billion to get to \n40 percent level.\n  I have to think, if we are going to do something about the quality of \npublic education--my friend from New Jersey has raised class size, \nsalaries for teachers, luring teachers into rural or urban areas where \nthey are needed, afterschool programs that are critical, early \nchildhood education, Head Start--there are a variety of things that all \nof us would say are absolutely essential if you are going to improve \nthe quality of our public educational system. Why does this idea, why \ndoes the idea of providing some tax incentives for people have any real \nappeal? It is because people are concerned about the quality of public \neducation in too many places.\n  If they felt there were good public schools, then they wouldn't be \nasking for the kind of suggestion that is being proposed in this bill. \nTheir desire for that is rooted in the notion, somehow, that our public \neducation is not doing very well in many places.\n  So what is our choice here? We take limited resources. We take a \ndollar, and we decide we will divide it up. And so instead of focusing \non what needs to be done with the 7 cents we provide in education out \nof every dollar from the Federal level, instead of saying let's see \nwhat we can do to improve the structures themselves, the buildings, how \nwe can wire schools so they are able to connect with the technologies \nof the 21st century, my concern is that we are taking $1.2 billion in \neffect off the table for a proposal that has marginal benefit.\n  I say again to my friends, the authors of this legislation, people \nmaking $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 a year, if they have two or \nthree kids, they can't put aside $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in \nthese accounts. It doesn't work out that way. It is hard enough to make \nends meet. The idea that they are going to put $2,000 per child in an \nIRA account is not realistic for them. They could put something in \nthere, but the idea that they are going to get this tax benefit because \npeople will maximize, that doesn't add up in my view.\n  I do think there is a clear distinction between higher education and \nelementary and secondary education. Again, schools at the elementary \nand secondary level that are private or parochial select who they want. \nYou may think you have the choice, but ultimately it is theirs whether \nyou go or not. A public school doesn't have that luxury. If you are a \nchild who lives in a community and you show up at the door, they have \nto take you in whether they like you or not.\n  You show up at a private school, and the private school can say: You \nare not a nice family, nice people. I am sorry. We are not going to \nselect you.\n  So there is a distinction in a sense. Our public schools must take \neverybody. The 50 million kids this morning who showed up at their \ndoors have to be educated. We know too many children are not getting \nthe quality of education they deserve. They are going to school in \nbuildings that are falling down. They have textbooks and equipment that \nis antiquated. They have teachers who are not necessarily the best. \nFurther, the salaries are significantly different from community to \ncommunity in too many States. Maybe we can go around and set up private \nschools all over the place and say to the 50 million children presently \nattending public schools: We have a structure you can move into. You \ncan't do that. Fifty million are not going to fit in the places where 5 \nmillion students presently are.\n  It seems to me we are not left with many choices. We have to improve \npublic education. We have no other choice but to do that. We have no \nalternative. We must do that. With limited resources, is it not wiser \nto take these scarce resources and put them into special education \naccounts that would lower the property taxes; or at least allow our \nschool boards at the local level to decide they will take the money \nthat goes to pay for that special needs child for fixing up that \nschool, for afterschool programs; or lower the taxes and allow parents \nthen to have more money in their pocket to do some of the things my \nfriends from Georgia and New Jersey would like to give them the option \nof doing. Then they could do whatever they want with it.\n\n  That seems to provide a greater benefit to all people, not just the \nones who\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\nare selected to go to a private or parochial school, but all students. \nThat is a better choice, if there are indeed limited resources.\n  I say to my good friend from New Jersey, I know he made an appeal to \nour Republican friends to support the Robb amendment and the Murray \namendment. But just as he asserts that this amendment is going to be \nrejected and this underlying bill passed, I am fairly confident the \nRobb and the Murray and other offered amendments are going to be \ndefeated when it comes time to do something on school construction and \nafterschool programs and the like.\n  Part of the argument will be, we can't afford to do everything. They \nare right. You can't do everything. So my choice is--I presume I may be \nin the minority on this--my choice is to take the $1.2 billion, give it \nback to the States, give it back to the localities. Give it back to \nthem so they can reduce their costs on special education. One out of \nevery 10 children in this country is a special needs child in our \npublic school system--1 out of every 10. In my State, 14 percent of all \nstudents receive special education services.\n  These problems are growing. The cost is growing. In some of my \ncommunities in Connecticut, the cost of providing special education is \nmore than $50,000 per year. Eighty-two percent of that cost is being \nborne by the local property taxpayer. We promised that community and \nthat family we would pick up 40 percent of that $50,000.\n  I say to my good friends, the authors of this proposal before us, you \ncannot tell me with certainty what is going to happen if this \nlegislation is passed. This is a new proposal.\n  With higher education, you have a choice. Higher education doesn't \nhave a property tax base to support it. Higher education costs, at a \nminimum $5, $6, $7 thousand per year in my State. However, the public \nschools at the elementary and secondary level are free in Connecticut, \nas they are across the country.\n  So here it seems to me, with limited resources, are the choices we \nhave to make, painful as they are, where all the ideas have some merit. \nI shared earlier today the letter I received 2 days ago from the \nNational School Boards Association begging for us to offer this \namendment. These are not Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, \nliberals. These are people at every school board across the country who \nare saying: Please do something about this. Please do something about \nthis.\n  I am offering my colleagues this afternoon a chance to do that when \nwe vote on this amendment.\n  I have already noted the letter from the National School Boards \nAssociation, dated February 23:\n\n       Rather than create a tax benefit for a select few, applying \n     these funds to special education would benefit more taxpayers \n     and public schools.\n\n  That is not from a think tank. That is from the National School \nBoards Association letter of 3 days ago. That is the choice they would \nlike us to make. These are the people who wrestle with education \nissues, not once in a while on the floor of the Senate, but every \nsingle day in every community across this country. They have said, this \nis our choice.\n  The question is, are we on their side, or are we on the side of an \nalternative form of education which, frankly, has some value in some \npeople's minds, but 50 million kids don't have the choice. This is \nwhere they have to go to school, and we have to address those problems. \nWe can run, but we can't hide. Either we do it, or it gets worse each \nyear. The costs continue to go up.\n  If you can't do everything, I think this amendment offers a better \nidea. The National School Boards thinks it is a better idea. The \nNational Governors' Association, Republicans and Democrats, unanimously \nthink it is a good idea. I hope this afternoon my colleagues will agree \nwith them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe, indeed, this debate is \nhelpful in narrowing some of these issues. As I think I have attested, \nI also believe Senator Dodd has a good idea, an idea that should be \nadopted. It simply is not an alternative to this idea.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues where Senator Dodd and I have common \nagreement and where we have differences. Senator Dodd has made the \npoint that most families could not afford to put the $2,000 in a \nsavings account to pay for their public or private school education. I \nagree. It is critical to this concept that this $2,000 savings account \ndoes not rest solely on the shoulders of the mother or the father. I \nremember--I am not so young I cannot recall--a time when in an American \ncommunity, the education of a child was generally an involvement of the \nlarger community. It wasn't just a single mother or the father. These \naccounts are an opportunity to re-ignite that sense of involvement. We \nallow the extended family--grandparents, aunts, uncles, churches, labor \nunions, corporations--to put money into these accounts.\n\n  Senator Dodd is right that few families will be able to put $2,000 in \nthese accounts per year. But a lot of labor unions can go to their \nemployers and say: We would like a little raise next year and we want \nmoney in the savings account. A lot of churches will be able to go to \nthe parishioners and say: Thanks for giving to the church. We would \nlike to help Johnny or Jane with their education savings accounts. A \nlot of parents can go to grandparents and say: At Christmas, instead of \nthat toy, would you put $100 into the education savings accounts?\n  This is under the concept that educating a child is everybody's \nbusiness. Even then, can we get $2,000 a year? Maybe not. But if upon \nthe birth of a child we can get $500 or $700 and compound it, with tax-\nfree interest, year in and year out, by the time that child is going to \nthe eighth or ninth grade and needs a tutor after school because he or \nshe doesn't understand the math assignment, they can afford it. By the \ntime they are in the sixth grade and they can't afford to buy a \ncomputer, with this they could afford one. By the time they go to \ncollege, if they have spent none of this money and for 18 years they \nhave been saving $200, $500, or $700, at compound interest, it would be \nsignificant. Does it pay for a Harvard education? No, but it gets them \ninto the community college or a State school or it pays for part of the \neducation. It helps. It is valuable.\n  More than just dollars is involved; it creates the concept of the \ncommunity being involved, having the vehicle of these accounts. It is \nno coincidence that when Senator Coverdell and I offered these \naccounts, the House sponsor was not some conservative Republican from \nthe Deep South, with all due respect to my Southern colleagues from the \nRepublican Party; it was Floyd Flake, a minister, African American, \nfrom Queens, NY, who has had the philosophy of the government that: I \nwill take care of my own community; just get out of my way--if I may \nparaphrase him. He has a charter school; he started it himself. He \nwould like people to be able to have these accounts to pay for some of \nthe extra costs.\n  That goes to the second point Senator Dodd made. We agreed on the \nfirst--everybody doesn't have $2,000. We disagree on the second. \nSenator Dodd said public school is free. It was when Senator Dodd and I \nwent to school. It isn't anymore. How many parents tonight face their \nchildren who come home and say: I would like to be part of the band or \nthe Latin Club or the French Club and it costs $500. Can I do that, \nmom?\n  What we built in the fifties and sixties in this extraordinary public \neducation, funding all these tremendous activities, we have eroded. I \nrepresent communities in New Jersey where you can't get a bus home \nafter school if you don't pay for it. You can't join the football team. \nSome of the books are so old, parents have to buy them themselves. \nThese education savings accounts go to the heart of that problem. \nPublic school is not free. Sixty percent of the African American \nstudents in our public schools don't have access to a computer. It is \nthe new divide in American education. That includes 70 percent of \nHispanic students and millions of other students from all backgrounds.\n  Why? What is so wrong if we allow a parent to take their own hard-\nearned money and put it in their own account? All we ask the Federal \nGovernment to do--my God, the minimum we can ask anybody to do--is not \ntax them on the interest. Let them keep the interest so a parent can \nbuy their child something, so they can maximize. I visit public\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\nschools throughout New Jersey where children are struggling with math, \nscience, and areas that were never approached when I was in high \nschool. They struggle. It is hard. If you ask them the one thing they \ncan get more out of public school, they will tell you: I wish there was \nsomebody after school to help me with my work--a tutor.\n  Instead, our public school teachers, who are underpaid and \noverworked, leave school at 3:30 or 4 o'clock and take second jobs \nselling clothing, painting houses--anything to support their own \nfamilies. How about an education savings account, where at the end of \nthe day the public school teacher can work for some extra dollars doing \nwhat they do best--teaching, tutoring, helping public school students \nlearn the math and science with which they struggle.\n  No, public school is not free. And $2,000 is a lot for most families. \nWe could be wrong. Senator Coverdell and I could be wrong. We could \noffer this chance to every labor union, church, and grandparent in \nAmerica to help with their kids' education by putting money in every \nbirthday, holiday, or Christmas, and maybe nobody will answer. But I \ndon't believe that. That is not the kind of people we are. That is not \nthe kind of communities I represent. I think people will answer. I \nthink Floyd Flake is right. Every Member of the Senate talks about \nfaith-based answers to problems, working hand in hand with the \nGovernment. Well, let's see. I bet the grandparents, aunts and uncles, \nlabor unions, churches, and synagogues will come forward and use these \naccounts as a vehicle. But mostly, I don't want to fail because we \ndidn't ask. This is an invitation to America to get back in your public \nor private school, get involved and solve the problem.\n  I believe these are worthwhile. Senator Dodd may be right that this \ninstitution doesn't have the will or the resources to answer this \nproblem and the special education problem and the school construction \nproblem. If this country doesn't have the will or resources to deal \nwith those problems, we are headed for real trouble. I believe we have \nthe will, and I certainly believe we have the resources--not \nexpenditures, not a dime of it, but investments, every single dollar in \nevery investment for building a school or hiring a teacher. I will \nfight every day for every one of those things.\n  Today is the Coverdell-Torricelli legislation for private savings \naccounts to fund public and private schools. I am proud to be part of \nit. I yield to Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am most appreciative of the extended effort on the \npart of the Senator from New Jersey, who brings a very powerful \nperspective to this debate.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is correct that we are constantly \nconfronted with choices. I think this is a bad example, though, or \nchoice of that kind of trade. What I mean is, first of all, I believe \nIDEA will receive added benefits this year. It has received nearly $3 \nbillion in the last 4 years over and above the President's request. So \nthere is a body here that agrees with those Governors and with you that \nthis is a high priority.\n  The problem with the Senator's amendment is when it moves against the \nsavings accounts, it blows away $12 billion. There are choices. You \ncould say, well, we will spend $1.2 billion here instead of $1.2 \nbillion over there. But by the nature of this legislation, this savings \naccount involves 14 million families--20 million of those 55 million \nyou are talking about--3 million or 4 million of them are in private \nschools, but 11 million of these children are in public schools that \nwill benefit from these accounts.\n  The Senator's amendment takes that resource, which comes forward as a \nvoluntary action on the part of families and communities, churches, \nsynagogues, labor unions, and employers and shuts it down. That is not \na good trade. Trading $1.2 billion and losing $12 billion is not a good \ntrade. There may be a place where your choice is appropriate, but I \ndon't believe it is where you blow away all that benefit, which this \ndoes.\n  It has been characterized that private schools are the chief \nbeneficiary, and that is not the case. Several on the floor have \ncharacterized parochial schools as a ``haven for the wealthy.'' Listen, \nthe children attending parochial schools today are within 10 percent of \nthe same children attending public schools, and they are from families \nearning $40,000 or $50,000.\n  These are not a bunch of wealthy folks. The demographics in the New \nYork school system are virtually identical between the public system \nand the parochial system. So it is not like somebody who happens to be \nin a parochial school and drives up to school in a long, black \nlimousine and a guy in knickers gets out. These are minorities. They \nare Hispanic. They are African Americans. They are average folks. I \ndon't know why they are there. The public systems ought to be mighty \nglad it is there because it works both ways. The Senator is right. That \nsystem couldn't accept the public system, and it never will. \nConversely, close it down and you make new problems for the public \nsystem because those people are paying property taxes even though their \nchildren are in the parochial system.\n  The point I am trying to make is that the public system will be a \nmajor benefactor. It is not a minor player. The choice the Senator is \nasking us to make is not $1.2 billion here or $1.2 billion there. It is \n$1.2 billion here or no $12 billion. Of that $12 billion, $6 billion is \ngoing to go into public schools over the next 10 years and $6 billion \nis going to go into private, or home, or whatever. Those are major \ndollars.\n  When the Senator from California and others talk about the benefit, \nthey don't mention the principal. That is the point. That is how you \nget up to the $12 billion. The Senator is right. It is not a lot of \nrelief that the Federal Government is giving. What is amazing to me is \nhow little it takes to cause these families to do so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bunning be added \nas a cosponsor to the Collins amendment No. 2854.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague from Georgia needs another \nminute or two to make concluding remarks, I will be happy to yield my \ntime, or if the Senator from New Jersey would care to be heard.\n  My colleagues conveniently use numbers which, obviously, sound \nbeneficial to their argument. The fact is, according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee, which analyzed this proposal, if you are the family of a \nchild in a public school, the tax benefit to you over 5 years is \n$20.50. That is the tax benefit to a family whose child is in a public \nschool. Is it worth taking that much off the table in the name of \neducation and providing tax relief which is so nominal it is hardly \nworth mentioning?\n\n       You can make a case. You have heard it over the years. \n     Businesses say: If you will give me this tax break, it will \n     leverage this much more in private capital. The fact is, you \n     still have to have a tax break. It is revenue lost.\n\n  We have come a long way in the last 7 or 8 years. We have a surplus \nfor the first time in the last few years. We are actually on track to \neliminating the national debt. The idea that we can just take $1.2 \nbillion off the table is a flawed idea. Even if you accept the point of \nmy colleagues and leverage private dollars, it may generate some of \nthis activity they are talking about, but the fact is, it is $1.2 \nbillion. It is rolling the dice, in effect.\n  I have suggested that there is $1.2 billion that could be used to \ndefray the cost of special education. I know that amount would ease the \nburden on our school districts. As my colleagues well know, you take \n$1.2 billion and put it in this program, then you will come and say: \nLet's do something on special education. What about school \nconstruction? What about teacher salaries and smaller class sizes? \nThose are things we know we need to improve the quality of public \neducation in this country. Those dollars become harder and harder to \ncome by as we take more and more dollars off the table.\n  Unless you accept the notion we are going to accept everybody's idea \non how to improve the quality of public education--which we are not and \nwe have limited resources--the people who pay the taxes in this country \nthat come into the general revenue of the Treasury know full well we \ncan't spend their money on everything. Parents of 50 million kids have \nsaid to us: Improve the quality of public education and reduce the cost \nof special education. One\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\ncertain way of doing that is by freeing up dollars at the local level, \nor reducing taxes for that local property taxpayer. I guarantee you \nthat benefit is more than $20.50. If you are a parent of a public \nschool child, and you get the kind of special education relief I \noffered, there is more tax relief for that taxpayer and that community \nthan the $20.50 you are going to get if the Coverdell legislation is \nadopted.\n  I respect my colleagues from Georgia and New Jersey, but I come back \nto the point I made a moment ago. People who have children in public \nschools recognize that we have no choice but to try to make this system \nbetter. We have to do it or we are going to pay an awful price later \nthis century. We are not going to have the kind of well-educated, \nproductive citizens that we need.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will recognize that the idea of reducing \nthe cost of special education is something we can do something about \ntoday. In a few minutes we will have a chance to vote on this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Reed, Harkin, \nDorgan, Reid of Nevada, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time do we have between us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute 40 seconds to my colleague \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I graciously accept it. I will make a \nmotion in 1 minute 40 seconds calling for a point of order against the \namendment. The Senator from Connecticut knows that.\n  I guess it is all in the eyes of the beholder. An insignificant \nnumber of people will be beneficiaries. That insignificant number is 14 \nmillion families and 20 million children, and an individual family can \nexpect only $20 worth of interest-free benefits.\n  But the point is, that, nevertheless, no matter what it is, if it is \na quarter, it causes them to save $12 billion, whatever it is. It is \n$12 billion of new money flowing into both public and private \neducation. That is not insignificant. Everett Dirksen said, ``A billion \nhere and a billion there, and before long it is real money.'' Twelve \nbillion dollars is real money. It would be controlled by America's \nfamilies to help them with the very special and unique needs that their \nchildren have through these education savings accounts.\n  The pending amendment, No. 2857, offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, increases mandatory spending by $1.2 billion, \nand, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to exceed the \ncommittee's section 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant portions of the \nBudget Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Dodd amendment No. 2857. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) \nand the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nby the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Maine. What \nwe would like to have on this side--we understand it will be \ninterspersed with Republican amendments, but the order of Senators \noffering amendments would be Robb, Bingaman, Graham, and Wellstone. The \nreason I make that announcement is so that Democratic Senators aren't \ngoing to be over here wondering when they can offer their amendments. \nThese are the next four to be offered on our side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there will be a unanimous consent \npropounded after the vote on the Collins amendment, but for everybody's \npurposes, it is anticipated that there would be a vote on Collins \nshortly, maybe 30, 35 minutes. Then we would take up the Robb amendment \nbut not vote on that until tomorrow morning around 10. I think that is \nthe general agreement we have reached, to at least let everybody \nunderstand what we are dealing with.\n  I yield the floor so we may proceed with the Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThurmond be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe pending amendment which I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator \nKyl, Senator Coverdell, Senator Hatch, Senator Abraham, and Senator \nBunning. I know the hour is late and I understand if I speak very \nshortly I will get more votes, so I will be very brief in describing my \namendment.\n  We have worked together to craft an amendment to help our public \nschool teachers when they either pursue professional development at \ntheir own expense or purchase supplies for their classroom. Our \namendment has two major provisions.\n  First, it will allow teachers to deduct their professional \ndevelopment expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing \n2-percent floor that is in our Tax Code. Second, it will grant teachers \na tax credit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and other equipment \nthey purchase for their students. As Senator Kyl has noted, a study by \nthe National Education Association indicates the average schoolteacher \nspends more than $400 a year on supplies and other materials for the \nclassroom.\n  Our amendment would reward teachers for undertaking these activities \nthat are designed to make them better teachers or to provide better \nsupplies for their students. It is an example of a way that we can say \nthank you to teachers who do so much for our children.\n  While our amendment provides financial relief for our dedicated \nteachers, its real beneficiaries are our Nation's students. Other than \ninvolved parents, which we all know to be the most important component, \na well-qualified and dedicated teacher is the single most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \nrepeatedly demonstrated the\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nclose relationship between qualified teachers and successful students.\n  Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional \ndevelopment is to maintaining and expanding their levels of competence. \nWhen I meet with teachers from Maine, they always tell me of their need \nfor more professional development and the scarcity of financial support \nfor this very worthy pursuit. The willingness of Maine's teachers to \nreach deep into their own pockets to fund their own professional \ndevelopment impresses me deeply. For example, an English teacher in \nBangor, who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee, told me \nof spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then \ncame back and shared that information with all of the English teachers \nin her department. She is not alone. She is typical of teachers who are \nwilling to pay for their own professional development as well as to \npurchase supplies and materials to enhance their teaching.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education they need to improve their schools and to serve \ntheir students better. I greatly admire those teachers who reach into \ntheir own pockets to buy supplies, paints, books, all sorts of \nmaterials that are lacking in their classroom. We should reward those \nteachers. Let us change the Tax Code to recognize and reward their \nsacrifice and to encourage more teachers to take the courses they need \nor to help supplement the supplies in their classroom. I hope those \nchanges in our Tax Code will encourage more teachers to undertake the \nformal course work in the subject matter they teach, or to complete \ngraduate degrees in either a subject matter or in education, or to \nattend conferences to give them more ideas for innovative approaches to \npresenting the course work they teach in perhaps a more challenging \nmanner.\n  This amendment will reimburse teachers for just a small part of what \nthey invest in our children's future. This money will be money well \nspent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most \nimportant assets for our country's future; that is, a well-educated \npopulation. We need to ensure that our public schools have the very \nbest teachers possible in order to bring out the very best in our \nstudents. Adopting this amendment is the first step toward that goal. \nIt will help us in a small way recognize the many sacrifices our \nteachers make each and every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Maine, and I thank her for her \nleadership in bringing this issue before the Senate at this time.\n  Mr. President, no debate on tax incentives for education would be \ncomplete without a discussion of teachers and how they are taxed as \nprofessionals. In my view, the current law treatment is seriously \ndeficient in this area.\n  First, let me review the technical points. Like any other \nprofessional, elementary and secondary school teachers incur a number \nof expenses in order to keep themselves current in their fields of \nknowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and other \nperiodicals. In addition, many teachers invest in their own development \nby taking courses to improve their knowledge or skills. Under current \nlaw, these expenses are deductible, as miscellaneous itemized \ndeductions. However, there are two practical limitations that \neffectively make these expenses non-deductible for most teachers.\n  The first limitation is that the total amount of a taxpayer's \ndeductible miscellaneous expenses must exceed 2 percent of adjusted \ngross income before they begin to be deductible. The second hurdle is \nthat the amount in excess of the 2 percent floor, if any, combined with \nall other deductions the taxpayer has, must exceed the standard \ndeduction before any of them are deductible.\n  Let's consider just how difficult these limitations can be, Mr. \nPresident. I will use the example of a fifth-year high school science \nteacher in Utah who I will call Robin Stewart. Robin is single and \nmakes $35,000 per year. She incurred $840 of expenses last year for \nscience periodicals and for a course she took over the summer to \nincrease her knowledge of chemistry.\n  Under current law, Robin's $840 expenditures are deductible, subject \nto the limitations I mentioned. The first limitation says that her \nexpenses must exceed 2 percent of her income before they are \ndeductible. Two percent of $35,000 is $700. Thus, only $140 of her $840 \nis deductible--that portion which exceeds $700.\n  As a single taxpayer, Robin's standard deduction for 2000 is $4,400. \nHer total itemized deductions, including the $140 miscellaneous \ndeduction, fall short of this threshold. Therefore, not even the $140 \nis deductible for Robin. What the first limitation did not block, the \nsecond one did.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this is the case for most of the school \nteachers in our nation. In 1997, the last year for which the Internal \nRevenue Service has statistics, only 29.9 percent of taxpayers were \nable to itemize their deductions. So even in the rare case where the 2 \npercent limitation does allow a significant deduction, chances are very \ngood that it will not help the teacher because he or she cannot \nitemize.\n  The amendment before us is a good step in the right direction. It \nwould remove the first limitation--the 2 percent floor on miscellaneous \nitemized deductions. Ideally, I would like to see the second limitation \nremoved as well and make these kinds of expenses deductible by teachers \nregardless of whether or not they itemize. I hope that my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee will take a close look at the idea of an above-\nthe-line deduction for teachers.\n  Mr. President, the second part of the amendment before us is also \nvery important. It recognizes that many of our dedicated teachers incur \npersonal expenses for materials for their classrooms. Under current \nlaw, these types of expenses are, once again, deductible, but only to \nthe extent they exceed 2 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross \nincome.\n  Many Americans may be unaware that many teachers subsidize their \nschools out of their own pockets. It is not unusual for teachers to \nhave to pay for copying extra worksheets or articles, purchasing art \nsupplies, or providing tablets and pencils to some students who are \nwithout. Many teachers buy library books, educational games, and \npuzzles for their classes with their own money.\n  Rather than treating these expenses the same as teacher development \nexpenses, and exempting them from the 2 percent floor, this amendment \ngoes one step further and grants a tax credit of up to $100 per \ntaxpayer for materials the teacher supplies for his or her class. This \nmeans the teacher receives a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax \nliability.\n  Some people may argue that teachers don't have to do this--why should \nthey get a special tax credit?\n  The fact is that those teachers who love teaching and care about \ntheir students have been subsidizing their classrooms for years. They \ndo it because our public schools frequently nickel-and-dime the \nclassroom in order to concentrate resources on required big ticket \nitems.\n  And, Mr. President, there is one key difference between school \nteachers and other professionals that, in my mind, justifies this tax \nchange. Teachers--unlike lawyers, accountants, physicians, or others \nwho may take the existing deduction--are engaged in non-profit public \nservice.\n  This amendment gives proper recognition to the personal sacrifice \nthat many of our teachers make, year after year, toward improving the \neducation of our children.\n  As in the other part of this amendment, Mr. President, this provision \nis not perfect. I would like to see this credit also extended to those \nparents in Utah and throughout the country who choose to teach their \nchildren at home. Their expenditures, which likely far exceed $100, \nalso deserve the tax credit, and I hope the Finance Committee can look \nfor ways in other legislation to extend such a credit to parents to \nteach at home.\n  But, the Collins-Kyl-Coverdell-Hatch amendment is a good step toward \nrecognizing the dedication of our elementary and secondary school \nteachers and in helping them to meet the costs of their profession.\n  We say that we want our public school teachers to be the best.\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\n  We say we want our children and grandchildren taught by teachers who \nare competent and up-to-date not only in the subject matter they are \nteaching, but in the pedagogy of teaching it.\n  We say we want teachers who know how to exploit fully new learning \ntechnologies, including the Internet.\n  We say we want teachers who can recognize the signs of struggling or \ntroubled students.\n  We say we want teachers who can inspire our kids.\n  We say we want teachers who are willing to go the extra mile.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, offered by Senator Collins, is not \nunlike an amendment I introduced myself. This amendment, like my own, \nis designed to get our tax policy in sync with our goals for education.\n  This amendment will provide modest tax relief for teachers who, for \ntoo long, have been footing the bill for improving the quality of \nteaching by themselves. It is time we helped out.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I compliment my colleagues for the good work they are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Hatch for the great way \nin which he explained this amendment which Senators Coverdell, Collins, \nHatch, and myself have cosponsored.\n  He points out that we have goals for excellence in teaching, and this \nis a way to help foster those goals. We ask our teachers to do a great \ndeal. This is one small step we can take to help those who are most \nwilling to help their students.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for an excellent statement.\n  I also thank Senator Collins for the kind remarks she made last \nevening. It has been a pleasure to work with her. She is a real leader \nin education. To be able to join my amendment with her amendment as one \napproach which provides some relief to the teachers who are willing to \ntake that extra step to help their students is certainly an honor for \nme.\n  To recapitulate for our colleagues because I think we are going to be \nvoting soon, I leave it to Senator Collins to close the debate unless \nthere is anyone else who would like to speak to it. The old saying of \ntaking an apple to the teacher at school has caused us to stop and \nthink a little bit. It is fine to take an apple to the teacher, but \nthere is a way we can be a little bit more helpful to those teachers \nwho go the extra mile. There may not be a direct relationship between \nexcellence in teaching and providing some assistance to those teachers \nwho will go out of their way to take extra supplies to their students, \nbut I suspect there, in fact, is a connection because these are the \nmost dedicated of all--those teachers who realize their local schools \nhave not been able to provide quite enough in instructional materials \nfor their kids, and out of their own family budget they are willing to \nmake a contribution for their students' education. As I pointed out \nlast night, the NEA estimates, according to a study, that each teacher \nannually spends $408 out of his or her pocket to help kids in school by \ntaking these instructional materials to them.\n  These two amendments, in a small way but an important way, recognize \nthat dedication and that contribution. In the case of my half of the \namendment, it provides dollar for dollar in relief and $100 in the case \nof Senator Collins' amendment. It relieves 2 percent of the burden for \nitemizing it, which Senator Hatch just spoke about.\n  Is this going to solve all of our woes in education? No. But is it an \nimportant recognition of the job teachers do, particularly those \nteachers who are willing to go the extra mile? We think it is. To the \ndegree they are willing to supplement what their schools provide for \nstudents, and it comes out of their own pockets, we think we should at \nleast cause them no harm in that process.\n  That is why we provide these two elements of tax relief basically to \nencourage them to continue to work with their students in this way.\n  I conclude again by thanking Senator Coverdell for his leadership, \nSenator Collins, and Senator Hatch. I hope my colleagues will give this \namendment their overwhelming support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to join in support of this \namendment. I think it is a brilliant idea and something that is \noverdue.\n  I think Senator Hatch has commented quite clearly why the present \nstate of the law is ineffective to assist teachers who are working \nsteadily and giving of themselves sacrificially for their classrooms \nand why the current tax law benefits them not very much, or almost none \nat all. I taught one year. I recall that we had expensive readers paid \nfor by the government. I tried to get the disadvantaged children in the \nclassroom to read those readers. They hated it. But there are a bunch \nof books there on the walls--Daniel Boone, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and \nthose kinds of books. I noticed that if I could get them to read those \nbooks, they liked it. Some of them read 30, 40, 50, or 60 books. When I \nwent to the used bookstores, or places such as that, I would pick up \nbooks on my own and bring them back to the classroom because there was \na lot of satisfaction in seeing those children actually enjoying \nreading a story.\n  I think sometimes we need to review the quality of the material we \nare asking our children to read. It may be scientifically sound, but \nmost of it is boring. They don't like it; it is work to them. If you \ncan make reading a pleasure, I think it helps.\n  My personal experience with that indicates to me we ought to \nencourage teachers to not hesitate. A teacher may bring them to \nWashington, and they may see prints of historical events or artwork \nthey want to buy right then. The school board isn't going to be \navailable to approve that. They know it will fit right within their \nclassroom and the course they will be studying.\n  They invest their own money in that. I think that ought to be \nencouraged.\n  My wife taught for a number of years in public schools. She was \ncontinually buying things for her bulletin board to share with the \nelementary classes and to help her teach the lessons she had for that \nclass.\n  There is no way some bureaucrat in Washington or even some school \nboard member or principal is going to be available at the right time to \napprove that expenditure for a teacher.\n  We do not appreciate our teachers enough. If you haven't been in a \nclassroom to know how hard it is, how frustrating it can be, and how \nburdensome the regulations are, adding the fact that the days are long \nand children may not be so well disposed to behave on a given day, you \ncan't know what it is to be a teacher.\n  One of the most frustrating aspects is the little things teachers \nneed that they cannot get unless they pay for them out of their own \npocket. They do that continuously. But it is a source of irritation to \nthem. They sense we are not supporting them fully in their mission.\n  I think this is a great amendment, I say to Senator Collins and \nSenator Kyl. I think it is right on point. I could not be more pleased \nwith it. I would like to be added as a cosponsor to it. I think it will \nhelp us in the classroom. The most important point in the education \nprocess is what occurs in a classroom, that magic moment when a teacher \nand child can come together and learning occurs. This will help enhance \nthat. I am pleased to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank all my colleagues for their excellent statements \non this amendment. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Abraham, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nAffordable Education Act, which addresses an important issue facing \nAmerican families today--the education of their children. It is my \nlong-held belief that we need to make a college education more \naffordable, and this legislation will do that by providing tax \nincentives to families who save for their children's future education \nneeds.\n  While I strongly support this legislative package, I want to focus on \na provision which I have championed for the past six years. Section 102 \nof the bill makes savings in qualified state tuition plans tax free. \nThis provision would reward savings and allow students and families who \nare participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from \nfederal income tax when the funds are used for qualified education \npurposes. This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states \nhave provided in helping families save for college. Nationwide, 44 \nsavings plans will be established in 2000, serving over one million \nsavers who have contributed over $7 billion in education savings. In my \nstate of Kentucky, over 3,000 families have established accounts, which \namount to $9.3 million in savings.\n  This legislation will reward long-term saving by making savings for \neducation tax-free. It is important that we not forget that compounded \ninterest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with, or \neven ahead of, tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. \nBy borrowing, students bear added interest costs that add thousands to \nthe total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by \nreducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars \nin student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target \nlow-income families, go much further.\n  Anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher \neducation. Throughout the 1990s, education costs have continually \noutstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have not become the \ngreatest obstacle students face in attending college. In fact, the \nastronomical increase in college costs has been well documented. \nAccording to a study conducted by the College Board, over the ten-year \nperiod ending in 1999-00, tuition and fees at both pubic and private \nfour-year colleges have increased on average more than 110 percent over \ninflation since 1980-81, with costs at public colleges rising 51 \npercent compared to the 34 percent for private four-year colleges. \nWhile average, inflation-adjusted tuition has more than doubled, median \nfamily income has risen only 22 percent since 1981. To compound this \nproblem, room and board charges are between 3.6 and 4.8 percent higher \nthis year than last year.\n  Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come \nto rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of \nall college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. The \nCollege Board estimates that most of the growth in financial aid has \nbeen in the form of student borrowing. In 1998-99, $64.1 billion in \nfinancial aid was available to students and their families from \nfederal, state, and institutional sources. However, despite the fact \nthat student aid has increased in value, it has not increased enough to \nkeep pace with the rise in tuition.\n  Many Kentuckians are drawn to tuition savings plans because they \noffer a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average \nmonthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52--clearly this benefits \nmiddle-class savers. By exempting all interest earnings\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\nfrom federal taxes, this legislation rewards parents who are serious \nabout their children's future and who are committed over the long-term \nto the education of their children.\n  I would like to share an article written by Jane Bryant Quinn, a \nnationally syndicated financial columnist. In this article, Ms. Quinn \ndiscusses the unique tax benefit and the stable investment provided by \nthe existing plans. Ms. Quinn noted that these plans are ``a great way \nfor parents or grandparents to build a college fund.'' Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. I encourage all of my colleagues to read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, despite the Administration's objection \nto expanding the favorable tax treatment of these state plans, I am \npleased that Congress has achieved real reform over the past several \nyears.\n  In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to \nfamilies investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that \nclarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the \nparticipants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax \nuncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-\nsponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their \nchildren's education.\n  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide increased \nflexibility to families saving for their children's college education. \nThe most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified \neducation costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount \nfamilies could save tax-free.\n  As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more \nstate plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for \ntheir residents. It is projected that there will be 44 states with \ntuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real \nopportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to \nAmerican families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a \nquality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this \nlegislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. \nThis will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily \nburden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.\n  In addition to making savings in qualified State and private college \ntuition plans completely tax-free, this legislation makes a number of \nother changes that are essential to helping families afford a quality \neducation. Specifically, this legislation increases the contributions \nfor K-12 education savings accounts to help families meet the expenses \nof a primary education. This legislation creates incentives for \nemployer-provided educational assistance so that individuals can \ncontinue their education while working. This legislation also changes \nthe rules for interest deductions so that qualified education loans are \nmore affordable for students. Additionally, this legislation revises \nthe National Health Corps Scholarships Exclusion, increases the \narbitrage rebate exception on tax-exempt bonds, provides for private \nactivity bonds for qualified education facilities, and allows the \nFederal Home Loan Bank to guarantee school construction bonds. These \nimportant reforms are critical to helping families save for the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year \nto reward those who save in order to provide a college education for \ntheir children.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2000]\n\n                   Section 529 College Savings Plans \n                               Rate an A\n\n                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)\n\n       If you haven't yet heard about state Section 529 savings \n     plans, listen up. They're a great way for parents or \n     grandparents to build a college fund.\n       These plans drip with income-tax and estate-tax breaks and \n     offer a potential for gain that older college plans can't \n     touch. Many top plans are open to residents of any state.\n       Until recently, 529s were marketed by the states themselves \n     or by two no-load mutual-fund groups--Fidelity and TIAA-\n     CREF--that some states have hired to manage their money.\n       Brokers and financial planners who work for commissions \n     weren't paid to sell 529s, so they steered your college money \n     somewhere else.\n       But now, two big brokerage firms are also in the game, \n     selling state 529 plans to a national clientele. Merrill \n     Lynch hitched up with Maine's NextGen program. Salomon Smith \n     Barney has Colorado's Scholars Choice plan and will soon \n     offer West Virginia's plan.\n       This creates an army of brokers prepared to tout this new \n     form of investing to the public. Commercial sales should help \n     get more people talking about 529s.\n       State 529 plans (the name refers to a section of the IRS \n     Code) were authorized by Congress in 1996. You can invest \n     lump sums or make regular monthly contributions. The plans \n     come in two forms:\n       A prepaid tuition plan. The conservative choice. These \n     plans guarantee that the money you save today will match the \n     growth in tuition inflation at state-run colleges. Currently, \n     that's an effective 3.4 percent return. You can also use the \n     money for tuition at out-of-state schools.\n       A college savings plan. Here, you contribute to an \n     investment pool that has the potential of rising faster than \n     the college inflation rate (although there's no guarantee). \n     You can use the money at any accredited school, for any \n     qualified education expense.\n       Savings plans are currently offered by 23 states, and nine \n     more are starting up this year. If your state doesn't have a \n     savings plan, or has one with unattractive features, you can \n     join one in another state.\n       A few states keep your money in bonds, but most provide a \n     mix of stocks and bonds. A typical 529 account leans heavily \n     toward stocks when the child is young, then moves \n     automatically toward safer bonds and money-market funds as \n     college draws near.\n       Some states give you a choice of accounts. Maine, for \n     example, offers four accounts--one of which is 100 percent \n     invested in stocks.\n       Under 529 rules, you can't switch your money from one \n     account to another within the plan. To diversify, you'd \n     contribute to more than one account, says Maine's treasurer, \n     Dale McCormick.\n       Here's the beauty of 529 plans. All the earnings accumulate \n     tax-deferred. When you take out the money for higher \n     education, it's taxed in your child's bracket, not yours.\n       Some states let you deduct your contribution on your state \n     tax return. Other states let your earnings pass tax-free.\n       The value of the plan is not included in your taxable \n     estate. But you still control the money, says certified \n     public accountant and 529 expert Joseph Hurley of Bonadio & \n     Co. in Pittsford, N.Y.\n       You can change the plan's beneficiary from one family \n     member to another (including an adult seeking further \n     education). You can even drop the plan and take your money \n     back.\n       If you spend 529 money on something other than higher \n     education, that withdrawal will be taxed in your bracket. \n     You'll also pay a penalty--typically 10 percent of earnings \n     (sometimes more).\n       ``A 10 percent penalty on earnings isn't bad,'' Hurley \n     says. ``If your account yielded 10 percent, you'd still net 9 \n     percent, pretax.''\n       Surprisingly, 529 savings plans detract little or nothing \n     from your child's potential financial-aid award. The money is \n     treated as belonging to the donor, not the student.\n       Hurley gives top marks to the plans in the following \n     states: Arkansas (1-877-422-6553), Colorado (1-800-478-5651), \n     Maine (1-877-563-9843), Missouri (1-888-414-6678), New \n     Hampshire (1-800-544-1722), Utah (1-800-418-2551) and \n     Virginia (888-567-0540). For his opinion of all the state \n     plans, visit savingforcollege.com.\n       The new edition of Hurley's book, ``The Best Way to Save \n     for College,'' is due at the end of this month ($25.95 \n     including shipping; order from savingforcollege.com or call \n     1-800-487-7624). It contains plan comparisons plus tax tips \n     that financial salespeople aren't likely to know.\n       For extended information on all the state plans, call the \n     National Association of State Treasurers at 1-877-277-6496 or \n     visit its Web site (www.collegesavings.org).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I stand before you today to support S. \n1134, the Affordable Education Act. I have been a long time supporter \nof the Education Savings Account. I believe that ESA's can be a very \neffective tool in helping parents have an impact on their child's \neducation. The key to a child's education is parent involvement. As \nwell intentioned as we may be here in Washington, no amount of money or \nregulation can accomplish what a child's parents can. I have worked and \nwill continue to work to help provide parents the opportunity to have \nan increasing say in their child's education. I believe this bill will \nhelp to accomplish just that.\n  The changes this bill will make to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nwill provide flexibility and choice to parents. Parents who earn less \nthan $95,000 a year can pay up to $2,000 a year per child into a tax \nexempt Education Savings Account. This is an increase of 400% from the \ncurrent limit. Under current law, money that is payed into ESA's is \nonly available to pay for higher education. This bill will make\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\nmoney payed into an ESA available for parents during the K-12 years of \neducation. This legislation gives parents the flexibility to use their \nmoney on anything from college tuition to books or computers if these \nsupplies are utilized in their child's education.\n  If parents would like to send their child to a private school this \nmoney will be available. Some will say that Education Savings Accounts \nwill just benefit the rich. I strongly disagree. This bill would move \nall parents who want to send their child to a private school $2,000 \ncloser to that goal. If parents want to keep their child in public \nschool they have their ESA available to pay for any additional fees or \nsupplies that would help educate their child.\n  Education is a crucial issue. In January and February I held 63 town \nmeetings in the state of Colorado where parents spoke with me first \nhand about their concerns with the education system. I receive many \nletters from parents sharing similar sentiments every week. They tell \nme they are having a difficult time paying extra fees to allow their \nchild to participate in extra curricular activities. Education Savings \nAccounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for activities \nthat help build character for students. They tell me that they are \nhaving to pay for school books that they cannot afford. Education \nSavings Accounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for the \nbooks that their child needs. They tell me that college is becoming too \nexpensive. Education Savings Accounts help parents set aside money to \npay for their child's college tuition so that they can graduate without \nworrying about having to pay off loans.\n  This bill also addresses other needs in the area of education. Local \ncommunities that pass tax-exempt bonds must pay the government the \narbitrage, or interest, that accrues on those bonds. The Affordable \nEducation Act increases the ceiling of eligibility for retaining bond \narbitrage from $10 million to $15 million. This provides more money for \nschool construction. Relief for graduate students is also included in \nthis bill. The sixty month limit on loan interest tax deduction for \ngraduate students is eliminated. This helps students who are unable to \npay off their loans in five years. Employers are also allowed to \nprovide up to $5,250 a year in tax exempt income to an employee \nattending college or graduate school for tuition assistance. Education \nSavings Accounts can be extended past the age of 18 for special \neducation students who may not start college at the age of 18 like \ntraditional students.\n  This bill will also provide a positive impact in other important \nareas. It provides tax relief which is very important to me and my \nconstituents by reducing taxable income for families with children. I \nbelieve it can also reduce juvenile crime by allowing parents to pay \nfor after school care for their child. This would allow children to be \ninvolved in activities during the time of day in which children are at \nthe greatest risk of misbehaving, the time between the end of the \nschool day and the end of the work day when many children are \nunsupervised.\n  We have an opportunity today to begin to work towards important \nreform of our education system. We have passed provisions similar to \nthis bill in the past only to see the President veto them. I hope we \ncan overcome this ``one-size-fits-all'' attitude towards education and \npass the Affordable Education Act. Lets put the control back in the \nhands of parents instead of bureaucrats. I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Affordable Education Act is an \nimportant step toward returning to parents and communities the \nresources and responsibility to provide for their children's education, \nand expanding educational opportunities for millions of Americans of \nall ages.\n  As an original cosponsor of S. 14, the ``Education Savings Account \nand School Excellence Act'', portions of which are contained in this \nbill, I am strongly committed to strengthening and expanding education \nsavings accounts for American families. Families should be encouraged \nand given incentives to save more of their money for their children's \ncollege education, but also to set aside money to meet the unique needs \nof the children throughout their school years.\n  The Affordable Education Act expands the existing tax-preferred \nEducation Savings Accounts, which allow families to save for college \nexpenses, to include elementary and secondary educational costs. The \nbill also allows corporations and other entities, in addition to \nindividuals, to contribute to a child's ESA.\n  Under this bill, money saved in ESAs could be withdrawn tax-free to \npay for a child's educational expenses from kindergarten through high \nschool, not just college. Expanded ESA's could be used to hire a tutor \nfor a child who is struggling with math, or foreign language lessons to \nhelp a child become bilingual or multilingual. ESA savings could be \nused to purchase a home computer or give a child with dyslexia access \nto a special education teacher. Expanded ESA's will help parents \naddress their children's unique needs and concerns, and encourage their \nparticular abilities. Expanded ESA's can help ensure each child is \nprepared to succeed in higher education or employment.\n  This bill also contains several important initiatives to provide \ngreater access to higher education. It supports employer initiatives \noffering educational assistance to their employees by extending the tax \nexclusion for employer-paid undergraduate tuition and expanding the tax \nexclusion to also cover graduate-level courses. The bill helps make \ncollege more affordable by allowing private institutions to establish \nqualified pre-paid college tuition plans and allows certain tax-free \nwithdrawals from qualified State tuition plans.\n  Unfortunately, expansion of ESA's and the other provisions noted \nabove are only temporary in the bill before the Senate. Because these \nprograms are important tools for families struggling to pay for the \nchildren's college and other educational expenses, I believe these \ninitiatives should be made permanent.\n  Another important aspect of the bill is the new tax exclusion of \ncertain amounts received from the National Health Corps and Armed \nForces Health Professions Scholarship programs. Those who receive these \nscholarships will go on to provide medical and dental services in our \nnation's under-served areas as well as in military service.\n  The bill also authorizes the tax-exempt financing rules for school \nconstruction. Local communities can determine how to best use their \neducational resources--whether hiring new teachers, providing \nadditional classroom services, or constructing new schools. This bill \ngives communities a financial break if they choose to use some of their \nresources for new school construction, making it possible to accomplish \nmore with limited resources.\n  Finally, I note with approval that the bill contains several \nprovisions to close existing tax loopholes for special interests in \norder to balance the costs of these important education initiatives. I \nwould encourage the Senate to consider adding several more of these \ninequitable tax loopholes to the bill in order to make permanent the \nexpanded ESA's and other important education incentives in this bill.\n  Again, I reiterate my strong support for this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. More important, I urge the President to \nconsider the importance of this legislation for expanding the \neducational opportunities of all Americans, and I urge him to sign this \nbill when it reaches his desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIdaho is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Crapo pertaining to the introduction of S. 2118, \nS. 2119, S. 2120, S. 2121, and S. 2122 are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nbetween now and 4 p.m. be consumed in an equally divided fashion for \ndebate on the pending Dodd amendment, and at 4 p.m. the Senate vote in \nrelation to the Dodd amendment. I further ask consent that following \nthe vote, the Senate resume consideration of the Collins amendment No. \n2854.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the disposition of the two above-described amendments, \nSenator Robb be recognized to call up an amendment regarding school \nconstruction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, Members of \nthe Senate should note that the next vote will occur at 4 p.m., and a \nsecond vote regarding the Collins amendment will occur shortly \nthereafter.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2857\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, while the other side is preparing \nfurther remarks about their amendment, I want to make it very clear \nthat the amendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut would, one, \nmake moot the principal core of this legislation, the education savings \naccount. It just wipes it out. No. 2, I wish to make the point that he \nis making moot an issue that has received extensive bipartisan support \nin the Senate.\n\n  The principal coauthor of the education savings accounts is Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey. When this\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\nwas last voted on before the Senate, it received 59, 60 votes--again, a \nvery bipartisan expression in support of the education savings \naccounts. I want to make it clear that this amendment would have the \neffect of destroying a core bipartisan component.\n  The second point I wish to make is that the Senator from Connecticut \nargues the money used to create this educational IRA should be used to \nenhance the funding of special education. Special education, he \nrightfully points out, is important and represents an unfunded mandate \nof some 25 years.\n  I find it interesting that for 25 years the other side of the aisle \nfound it acceptable to ignore the Federal responsibilities for special \neducation, and now with a new majority, we on our side of the aisle \nhave doubled funding for IDEA. We have an attempt to empower parents \nand local communities to deal with educational requirements for \nchildren, and we now find this amendment and the great need on the \nother side of the aisle to deal with IDEA. There is an incongruity of \nletting it sit there for so many years without paying attention to it \nand now all of a sudden it is important.\n  Mr. DODD. Would my colleague yield on that?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will in a moment.\n  No. 3, let me say to the Senator from Connecticut, first of all, I \nagree with the attempts to fund special education for all the reasons \nthe Senator enumerates. But I do not find them mutually exclusive. I do \nnot think we have to take this bipartisan education savings account \nlegislation and throw it in the trash heap to do this.\n  We have increased funding over the President's proposals for special \neducation 5 years in a row. I think we will do so again. I think this \nCongress will respond to the goals the Senator has enumerated and to \nthe letter the Senator has showed us from the Governors who, indeed, \nthink this pledge that was made a long time ago and ignored for an \nawfully long time should be fulfilled. So we agree on that premise. But \nI do not think you have to make this moot in order to do it.\n  The last thing I would say--and it is the Senator's amendment, so I \nwant him to be able to conclude his debate--is that we disagree on the \nnature of the policy. The Senator's side of the aisle, those who do not \nsupport it--not those who do--somewhat attempts to minimize the \nsignificance of it.\n  I take some issue with that because we are all down here playing the \nlaudatory band for the fact we passed an IRA for higher education that \nhad parameters identical to the means test that applies here, but its \nvalue is only one-fourth what the value of this proposal is. I do not \nthink you can make this an insignificant advantage to people on the one \nhand but say this education savings account was a great accomplishment \non the other.\n  Frankly, I think the education savings account that we passed for \n$500 per year for higher education is a good thing. I supported it. I \nproposed it. But this is four times the value of that.\n  In conclusion, I think anything that causes American citizens to save \nis a good thing. That piece gets left out of this debate. We are going \nto forgive $1.2 or $3 billion over 5 years. Actually, I say to the \nSenator, for 10 years it is about $2.4 billion. As a result of that, \nAmericans are going to save $12 billion. All of it is going to go to \neducation--half of it to public education and half of it to private \neducation. And 70 percent of the families are going to be in public \neducation; 30 percent of the families are going to be in private \neducation. This is going to do good things. It is going to help \nfamilies who do have special education problems. I think that is good \npolicy.\n\n  I think simultaneously we are going to address the goal of the \nSenator and many of us who share that goal of trying to accelerate \nfunding for IDEA. But as I said, I do not think it has to come at the \nexpense of this idea. Senator Wellstone and I got into a debate after \nthe Senator spoke the other day, and I said: There are not many Federal \nexpenditures that provide incentives to people to create large sums of \nresources that come to education. If you take this $1.2 billion, as you \nsuggest, and move it to IDEA, it is not bad that we have done it for \nIDEA, but you will leave $12 billion on the table. It just evaporates. \nI do not think there is any need to do that.\n  I think having those resources in 14 million families, for 20 million \nchildren, is of enormous good and will help those families do things \nthat are very meaningful for their children.\n  I have gone through this rather briefly, but it is the essence of my \ndisagreement--not with the idea of funding IDEA or special ed but that \nyou make them mutually exclusive.\n  With that, I yield the floor so the Senator may continue explaining \nhis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of points my \nfriend and colleague from Georgia has raised.\n  First of all, going back over the history of IDEA and where the \nsupport has been and not been over the years, I will ask unanimous \nconsent that this chart, dating from 1980 through the year 2000--over \n20 years--be made a part of the Record. It indicates the years and what \nthe various Presidents have requested, what was actually appropriated--\nthe distinction between what Presidents offered and what Congress \nagreed to.\n  From 1981 through 1992, without exception, the Presidential request \nwas lower than what Congress actually appropriated. Then in 1993, 1994, \n1995, and 1996 Congress actually appropriated a little less than what \nthe Clinton administration requested. In 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000--my \ncolleague is correct--the last 4 years, is where you actually have the \nCongress doing better than the Presidential request.\n  But over the 20 years, through the Reagan and Bush administrations, \nit was Congress that raised the amount. Most of those years in the \nSenate--not all, but certainly all those years in the House--the \nCongress was in the hands, if you will, of the Democrats. So there is a \nstrong background of this.\n  As I mentioned today, in the Budget Committee I offered--and I am \ncertainly not arguing on behalf of my party; in fact, I lost votes of \nmy party in the Budget Committee. I think I pointed out earlier I had \nthe support of Trent Lott, who was a member of the Budget Committee at \nthe time. But when I was on the Budget Committee a number of years ago \nI tried to put into the budget function category a number, over a \nperiod of years--I did not care what amount of years the Congress \nwanted to accept; 5 years, 10 years, 15 years--with the goal in mind we \nwould reach the 40-percent commitment we committed to in 1975. That is, \nthat the Federal Government would be a much better partner in \nsupporting our local communities with special education costs.\n  I ask unanimous consent this chart that goes from 1980, actually, \nthrough the year 2000, indicating Presidential requests and what \nCongress appropriated, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                           SPECIAL EDUCATION GRANTS TO STATES\n                                                        [Budget authority in billions of dollars]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                         Pres. req. vs.    President's     Appropriation\n                                 Year                                     President's    Appropriation   appropriation       proposed         annual\n                                                                            request                        difference        increase        increase\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1980..................................................................  ..............          874.50  ...............  ...............  ..............\n1981..................................................................          691.50          874.50          183.00          (183.00)  ..............\n1982..................................................................          649.09          931.01          281.92          (225.41)           56.51\n1983..................................................................          771.70        1,017.90          246.21          (159.31)           86.89\n1984..................................................................          998.18        1,068.88           70.70           (19.72)           50.98\n1985..................................................................        1,068.88        1,135.15           66.27   ...............           66.27\n1986..................................................................        1,135.15        1,163.28           28.14   ...............           28.14\n1987..................................................................        1,135.15        1,338.00          202.86           (28.14)          174.72\n1988..................................................................        1,259.38        1,431.74          172.36           (78.62)           93.74\n\n[[Page S910]]\n\n \n1989..................................................................        1,474.24        1,475.45            1.21            42.50            43.71\n1990..................................................................        1,525.61        1,542.61           17.00            50.17            67.16\n1991..................................................................        1,615.13        1,854.19          239.06            72.52           311.58\n1992..................................................................        1,976.10        1,976.10  ...............          121.91           121.91\n1993..................................................................        2,073.30        2,052.73          (20.57)           97.21            76.63\n1994..................................................................        2,163.71        2,149.69          (14.02)          110.98            96.96\n1995..................................................................        2,353.03        2,322.92          (30.12)          203.35           173.23\n1996..................................................................        2,772.46        2,323.84         (448.62)          449.55             0.92\n1997..................................................................        2,603.25        3,109.40          506.15           279.41           785.56\n1998..................................................................        3,248.75        3,801.00          552.25           139.36           691.61\n1999..................................................................        4,020.70        4,310.70          290.00           219.70           509.70\n2000..................................................................        4,314.00  ..............  ...............  ...............  ..............\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Numbers in parentheses are negative.\n\n  Mr. DODD. For those who may be interested, there is a strong record \nof the Congress through all of the 1980s, up until 1992 actually, doing \na better job in terms of what we put into special ed than the \nadministration, which did a bit better from 1992 up through 1996; and \nthen the Congress has done better than the President in the last 4 \nyears in these areas.\n  Secondly, with regard to the point raised, again, I said earlier, \nthere are parts of the bill offered by my friend from Georgia with \nwhich I agree. I am not offering this amendment as a substitute to his \nbill. It is only dealing with one part of it. There are parts of this \nbill of which I am very much supportive. It is like anything else, you \nhave to make choices. Would we like to do everything? Maybe some people \nwould like to do everything. But we can't do everything. We have all \npainfully learned that.\n  We finally have ourselves in a situation where we now have surpluses. \nWe are moving in the right direction. The interest rates and the \neconomy reflect the fact that we are showing much more fiscal \ndiscipline than has been the case in the past.\n  I am suggesting that given the choice between a $1.2 billion tax \nproposal, a new program that may or may not produce, even if we take \nthe best estimates, the results that its proponents suggest--that is, \n$1.2 billion taken off the table--based on the evidence that has been \nsubmitted by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the benefit for people \nwhose children go to public schools is very limited. They say $20.50 \nover 5 years. Those are not my numbers. Those aren't out of the \nDemocratic National Committee or some Democratic think tank. It is the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee that analyzes what \nthe tax implications are. We use it all the time.\n  They are saying to us: If you are the parents of public school \neducation children, which is where 50 million kids went to school this \nmorning--of the 55 million kids who went to school, 50 million of them \nwent to public schools, elementary and secondary, 5 million went to \nprivate and parochial schools--for the parents of those 50 million \nkids, the average benefits of all of this over 5 years is $20.50.\n  I pose the question, Which is the better choice? If you think you \ncould do everything, then you ought to vote, I guess, against my \namendment and hope at some later date you get a chance to vote for it. \nWe will do everything.\n  I don't think we can do everything. So I am merely posing an \nalternative that I think would be more meaningful to our mayors, county \nexecutives, Governors. In fact, this morning, at the combination \nmeeting of the Governors and the Senators, it was Governor Angus King, \nindependent Governor of Maine, who stood up and said: If you want to do \nsomething about education--and, by the way, I never met him before; I \nstill haven't met him. I don't know the man. But he stood up and said: \nIf you guys in the Senate really want to do something about education, \nwhy don't you do something about special education and our costs? He \ngot a standing ovation, applause from everybody in the room.\n  The Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, and Governor Tom Carper of \nDelaware said: This is the priority. Whom can I call? Whom can I get \nahold of for you to vote for your amendment, to support your amendment \nthis afternoon? Not because they disagree with what their friend and \ncolleague, as he is mine, is proposing here, but because they think \nthis is a better choice, with limited resources, to go to Oklahoma, \nConnecticut, Florida, to Georgia, to get back to our communities. It \ndoesn't solve the special education problem. We would have to \nappropriate $15 billion to get to the 40 percent obligation.\n  I don't want to create the illusion that I am solving that problem. \nWe are just getting closer to it. We are at 12.7. We were at 7 percent. \nThen we started to inch up a little bit in terms of getting better. Now \nwe are close to 13 percent, a far cry from 40, the $1.2 billion, and I \ndon't have the number what it gets you to. I think probably another \ncouple points, 2 or 3 percentage points, maybe 4 in terms of what that \n$1.2 billion spread out over 50 States would do. But at least it is tax \nrelief.\n\n  My friend says we do it for higher education. There is no property \ntax that supports higher education. There are State revenues that do \nit, but on a local basis that is not where it comes from. In the case \nof public elementary and secondary education, for the most part it is \nfree. There are costs associated with educating a child. I know that. \nBut I know very few public higher educational institutions that are \nfree. Most of them are pretty expensive today. Some have a limited \namount of cost, but for most of them, it is pretty expensive.\n  Of course, you don't have to go to college. We would like everybody \nto. The law requires you go to elementary school and requires that you \ngo to high school or at least stay in school until you are 16. For most \nStates, I think that is true. But there is no requirement you go beyond \nthat. So there is a distinction between what our obligations are to \nelementary and secondary education and what we try to achieve in higher \neducation--obviously, a huge distinction in cost.\n  Although I have disagreements with the underlying proposal offered by \nmy friend from Georgia, I believe we are trying to be all places at the \nsame time and, as a result of that, not doing much in any.\n  My fundamental point is not so much to say this is not a good idea he \nhas proposed but to say this is a better one. I don't know of a mayor \nin my State who hasn't asked me to do something about this issue for \nthe last 10 years. When I go back, as I know all of our colleagues do, \nwhen I go back to them and say: What do you want me to work on this \nyear?--I think all of us do that probably in our December-February \nperiods; we go back and talk to the local officials who are close to \nour constituents in our States. I don't know of a year when this \nspecial education issue hasn't been in the top five of the items about \nwhich they say: Look, this is a tremendous cost to us. You mandated it, \nbasically, at the Federal level in 1975. We don't disagree with you. We \nthink we ought to provide educational opportunity for children with \nspecial needs in this country so they will maximize their potential. \nBut you promised us, Mr. Senator, you were going to come up with 40 \npercent of the cost of this. You told us we have to do it. We agree \nwith you. Now you are only up to 12 or 13 percent.\n  Frankly, in a lot of States, it is around 5 percent, 9 percent. I \ndon't have every State here because not every State gives us all the \nnumbers. Looking down this list, as I mentioned earlier, California has \na $3 billion higher education cost. The Federal Government comes up \nwith 5 percent of that.\n\n[[Page S911]]\n\nSo 12.7 is a national number, but individual States are very different. \nIn Florida, it is 6 percent; that is the Federal participation. We are \nway short of the 40 percent.\n  I don't see Oklahoma on this, for the benefit of the Presiding \nOfficer, and I don't see Georgia. This is not a complete list of all 50 \nStates.\n  As I mentioned earlier, some States are 13 percent; South Dakota is. \nIndiana is 17 percent; that is how much the Federal Government \ncontributes to that price tag for special education. But an awful lot \nof States are at 5, 8, 7, and 4 percent--Nevada. Montana is at 14 \npercent; Missouri, 10 percent. It varies from State to State as to how \nmuch the Federal dollars are getting back.\n\n  My point is this: If you can't do everything, you have to make \nchoices. What is the better choice: A new program that may or may not \nhave the benefits its authors suggest, or to do something that every \njurisdiction in this country, every taxpayer at the local level would \nappreciate and would dramatically, in some cases, reduce the cost of \ntheir financial obligations?\n  I suggest the better choice is the amendment that is pending. It \nwould take that $1.2 billion and send it back to Oklahoma, Connecticut, \nGeorgia, Florida, California and say: This is a downpayment on that \nlong-term commitment. We haven't reached it yet. We are doing better, \nbut we are not there yet.\n  I mentioned earlier, California has a $3.72 billion price tag on \nspecial ed. Florida has a $1.47 billion price tag on special ed. My \nState of Connecticut is $627 million. I have one small community, \nTorrington, CT, that has over $1 million in special education costs \nbecause we required it. In 1975, we said: We will educate all kids, \nincluding those with disabilities in this country. We want everybody to \nhave at least the potential or the opportunity to maximize their \npotential. I don't know of a single person who wants us to retreat on \nthat commitment.\n  The point of my amendment is, don't retreat on it, but also don't \nrenege. Don't renege on the contract. The contract was to our States \nand our communities and our counties. Your Federal Government will be a \nfar better partner, and we will help you reduce that financial burden \nwe imposed upon you in 1975 and have never gotten close to paying. The \n$1.2 billion gets us closer.\n  What my friend from Georgia has offered is maybe a great idea--\nmaybe--although I have some disagreements, but I know what this does. I \nknow $1.2 billion going back to the 50 States of this country will \ncategorically and unequivocally provide relief for people.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. First, I commend my friend because life in the Senate is \nabout choices. I think what the Senator from Connecticut has done for \nthis debate, in my opinion, is to have given us a very clear choice of \nhow we want to proceed. We have known for, let's say, the last 20 years \nthat there is not an endless cookie jar; we are going to have to make \nthe tough choice.\n  What the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting is this: We have a \nprogram that is vital to perhaps the children in this country who need \nmore help than almost any other group, children who have special ed \nneeds. We have not met our commitment; we haven't fulfilled our \npromise. So I would appreciate it if the Senator from Connecticut can \ntell me if I am right in sort of summing up where he is coming from. He \nhas taken the floor and has not said everything in the pending bill is \nbad, not at all. I know personally he agrees strongly with a couple of \nthings.\n  Mr. DODD. What I have offered is an amendment to the Coverdell \nproposal, not a substitute. So I only address this particular issue. \nThere are a number of other provisions in the bill that I think are \nadmirable.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Those provisions would still stand. What the Senator is \nbasically saying is that the billion-plus would go to people who \nessentially, for the most part, send their kids to private schools, K \nthrough 12, and rather than give them this tax writeoff, if you will, \nwe should use the money to fulfill our commitment for special \neducation. That is the bottom line.\n  I want to ask my friend two questions. I don't know if he spoke about \nthe meeting with the Governors today, but if he has not, I think it \nwould be an important point, since he spoke to many of us about this \ntoday--what the message of the Governors is vis-a-vis this special ed \nand what it would mean. He has already said what it means to my State \nto get more funding for special ed. We are in the hole now by several \nbillion dollars. So this amendment is very important.\n  The second question, perhaps, is a more philosophical one but one to \nwhich I would be interested in hearing an answer. I think if we are \nhonest with ourselves, we know the people who could afford to set aside \n$2,000 a year in our society each and every year are the ones who are \nliving or earning more than, shall we say, most middle-class people \nbecause we know the figures. If we are honest with ourselves, to set \naside $2,000--and that is after-tax money--in an account where, by the \nway, you don't get any real tax benefit, except the buildup is not \ntaxed, so it comes out to roughly a few dollars a year--who are we \nreally helping? Are we helping 95 percent of public school kids? Are we \ndoing one thing or are we giving a nice, sweet tax benefit to people \nwho already can set aside the money? I think there are two questions. \nOne, if my friend can talk about the Governors and how they feel on \nthis issue of reimbursing the States for special ed; and, two, \nphilosophically, what is going to help more families?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I say to my friend from California that I \ndid mention the Governors. The Governor of Maine stood up and made the \npoint that this was the top priority, and I think it was one of the few \nmoments when there was widespread applause in the room by colleagues, \nboth Republicans and Democrats; there were a lot of nodding heads.\n  Obviously, Governors have a long shopping list for us. If they could \ndo one thing in the area of education, this was the issue. Tom Daschle \nraised it: ``Ironically, the next vote we are likely to have is on the \nissue you think is your top priority.''\n\n  I talked with Governor Ridge of Pennsylvania afterwards, a \nRepublican, and Democratic Governor Tom Carper of Delaware. Both said \nthey are going to try to call members of the respective caucuses to \nurge them to vote for this amendment. They felt this would make a \ndifference immediately for them. So I thank them. I thank the National \nGovernors' Association. I don't have it with me, but I will get it. I \nhave a year-old letter signed by Michael Leavitt, Governor Mike \nHuckabee of Arkansas, Tom Carper and Jim Hunt. It is a March 9, 1999, \nletter to Pete Domenici. I have blown it up. In part, it says:\n\n       Therefore, Governors urge Congress to honor its original \n     commitment and fully fund 40 percent of Part B services as \n     authorized by IDEA so the goals of the act can be achieved.\n\n  In the first paragraph, it says:\n\n       As you prepare the budget resolution for the coming fiscal \n     year, the nation's Governors urge Congress to live up to \n     agreements already made to be meet current funding \n     commitments to States before funding new initiatives or tax \n     cuts in the Federal budget.\n\n  So 50 State Governors say if you want to pick a priority, this is it. \nSo, again, this isn't, as my friend from Georgia said--again, some may \nthink you can do everything and probably will vote that way. If you \ncan't--and hopefully you can do everything--then you have to make \nchoices about where you should do some things.\n  I am glad the Senator from California raised the issue about the \nbuildup. I think that is important. The buildup is important. Under \nhigher education--and I drew a distinction; I think there are \nsignificant distinctions between the choice of going on to higher \neducation and the requirement that you go to grade school and high \nschool, at least until the age of 16--the fact that public education, \nwhere 50 million kids go to school every day is free, whereas higher \neducation is not free, whether it is public or private, and that you \ndon't have a property tax supporting higher education as you do \nelementary and public education.\n  When people are planning for college--not that they do it as early as \nthey would like--they start putting that money away early, in some \ncases when the child is born, with full knowledge that a 4-year college \neducation could end up costing $100,000 at many\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\ninstitutions in this country. So you end up with a buildup of $500 to \n$1,000 a year, and that is where it has value. You are not talking \nabout a buildup in that regard, about kids who are young and starting \nout, I presume. What you are talking about is investing in, as I \nunderstand it, some tax-free withdrawals from this account for things \nlike tuition fees, academic tutoring, books, room, board, supplies, \nequipment, and so forth. So it is going to public and private \neducation.\n  If you make $150,000 a year on joint returns, this is a pretty good \nbenefit. If you are making $30,000 or $40,000, or less, it is not much \nat all. The Joint Committee on Taxation said this only had a marginal \nbenefit to people. Also, the accounting practices; can you imagine the \nnightmare? You are going to be taxed if you buy some things and not \ntaxed if you buy others.\n  What about if it is sporting equipment to go to school; is that part \nof the education? What about the band outfit you may wear; is that \neducation or not? I don't know. Maybe others feel certain they know \nwhat it is. I can see a nightmare of accounting procedures to try to \ndetermine what is truly an educational benefit and what is not quite an \neducational benefit.\n\n  I will finish, and then I will yield to my colleague to respond. Of \ncourse, when you start getting into this whole point, as I said, \nbenefits to public school children and their parents, at least based on \nthe assessments we have, are marginal at best; $5 of tax relief a year, \neach year, for 5 years--or 4\\1/2\\ or 5 years--as opposed to doing \nsomething that lowers your property tax by sending the dollars back to \nreduce the cost of special education and local community--I promise you \nthat is more than $5 a year; it is significantly more for people.\n  Again, it is the choice I think we make. We all say we love to listen \nto our Governors. The Governors are in town. They met with the Senators \nabout 3 hours ago. The Governors have said, virtually unanimously: If \nyou want to do something to help us right away, here is the issue. They \nspecifically said: Do this before you start off on new initiatives that \nmay not benefit even the people you think you are going to benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. As I said earlier, it \ndoesn't substitute the entire bill. It merely offers a substitute to \nthe particular provisions on payment. The other parts of the bill \nremain. I think this is a much wiser choice to make. I say that with \nall due respect to my colleague from Georgia, with whom I work jointly \non so many issues. I know he is anxious to respond. I think the Senator \nfrom Florida wants to be heard as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, as I understand it, the sequence of \namendments is such that there will be a Republican amendment after the \namendment by Senator Dodd, and then there will be a Democratic \namendment by Senator Robb, and then another Republican amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I might offer the transition teaching \namendment immediately after the Republican amendment, which will follow \nSenator Robb's amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will withhold on that \nrequest, I know leadership has worked out a scheduling sequence. I \ndon't want to object, but I would have to object right now without them \ngetting involved. Why not make the comments and then come back?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I could offer this amendment with the \nunderstanding that if there is someone who needs to go ahead of me I \nwould yield at that time. I was on the floor this morning and now this \nafternoon for purposes of trying to get in the queue.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if the Senator will proceed and let me \ninquire, we will come back. I promise the Senator that I will take care \nof that right now.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I don't have any remarks to make on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquires, who is yielding time?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield time off my time to my friend from \nFlorida. I will inquire, if the Senator wants to go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, on our time, I see the Senator from \nCalifornia is still present. I don't know if the issue of who benefits \nand who doesn't was thoroughly covered. I don't know that this will \nmake a difference in the Senator's vote, but I think it is important \nthat her question be answered.\n  First of all, the means test--and it is means tested as to who can \nparticipate in this, and I probably wouldn't have done it that way, but \nthat is the politics of the day--is identical to the college account we \nhave set, which means 70 percent of the benefits flow to people making \n$75,000 or less. It is the middle income and below who are the primary \nbeneficiaries of the account.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, may I say to my friend I understand that \ncompletely. But that was for the analysis on the $500.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. That is the analysis on this account.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My understanding on the $2,000 is there are fewer people \nin that category who could participate; and therefore, it would not \nbenefit the middle class.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The data I quoted is the data on the analysis of this \naccount.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then we have some disagreement. But we will check our \nchart.\n  I wanted to say on the issue of why this is different than the \ncollege account--I think Senator Dodd very eloquently made the point--\nour side of the aisle has been pushing for a long time to help parents \nsend their children to college, whether it is through Pell grants, \nloans, or education saving accounts for college. I remember way back \nduring the days I was in the House I was supporting these education \nIRAs, but the point is that it is quite different now.\n  To go to a public college in California costs $5,000, $6,000, or \n$7,000 a year. Fortunately, we have free public schools. What we are \nlooking at here is quite a different situation.\n  We know on the face of it that 95 percent of our children go to \npublic schools. I know the Senator says this is going to help the \npublic schools, but our research indicates this is disproportionate. We \nare talking about a couple of dollars in benefits. It comes down to a \nchoice.\n\n  If I had a menu of things, I am sure I would rank money higher on the \nmenu of things, but it doesn't compare my money to the substitute, or \nto the amendment which keeps a lot of good in the Senator's bill. But \nit just says ``revenue lost'' instead of being dissipated in the $7 per \nfamily over a period of time--a year--and maybe adds up to $7. It would \nbe much better to go to our States and help with special education, \nwhereas Senator Dodd says it means it is going to result in lower \nproperty taxes because our local school districts will benefit.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is the time of the Senator from Georgia. Sure.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No one can certify that this is going to affect \nproperty taxes whatsoever. In fact, the doubling of IDEA, if you can \nfind a jurisdiction that took this and lowered the property tax--I \nthink you should listen--isn't what happened. I don't mean that we \nought not to be fulfilling this obligation, but I have seen no example \nof the property tax being affected one way or the other as we fulfill \nthis obligation.\n  I think what happens is, as we fulfill the Federal obligation, which \nis rather remarkable--here we are 25 years later and still haven't done \nit--it theoretically frees up local school districts to do other things \nthat are important in education. I find it interesting.\n  The other point I was going to make to the Senator from California \nand to the Senator from Connecticut is they essentially inferred--and I \ncan understand why--that the education savings account is different in \na sense from the higher education and K through 12 because I think in \nthe debate we have focused on K through 12. But there are extensive \nfamilies benefitting from that. They ought to have the opportunity--the \n``choice''--to use those funds if they so desire. But these accounts \nare a college account, too.\n  We have taken the President's proposal and the congressional proposal\n\n[[Page S913]]\n\nand made it four times more powerful. It can be used for college. It \ncan be used for the disabled and for dependent students following \ncollege.\n  My assumption is--we have to make some estimates--that many of these \nfamilies will not use this in K through 12. Some will. But a large \nnumber of them will use the buildup where essentially it is broadening \nthe scope of what people can do as they try to meet the very costs \nabout which the Senator from California talks.\n  Mrs. BOXER. May I ask my friend a question on this point because this \nis a good debate.\n  What the Senator is essentially saying is somebody can open up one of \nthese Coverdell plans.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. They do not call them Coverdell plans. It sounds like \na wonderful idea.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Doesn't it sound great? I will give the Senator that. It \nis his idea. Come up with a Coverdell account, and they start it, say, \nwhen the child is first born. Then the child is 5. If this is for real, \nthey start using it, but if it isn't for real, they will hold it. Who \ngets the tax benefit? Because they can afford to, they have another \naccount for $2,000 for college. Now we are saying this is a family now \nsetting aside $4,000 every year. I ask my friend.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes, because the Senator said there could be an addition \nto----\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The college account.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. No. What I am saying is that we broaden it from $500 \nto $2,000. So an account can be opened for up to $2,000, whereas now it \nis limited to $500, A; and, B, if they chose, they could use a \nwithdrawal somewhere through kindergarten through high school if that \nwas important to them for whatever circumstance. They don't have to \nhold it for college.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I don't understand. I am saying to my friend that it is a \nsecond bureaucracy, if you will--a new account that can be used for \ncollege in addition to the account we are looking at for college that \nwe already have. I think it is getting confusing. I think if we want to \nlet people set aside funds and get a tax break for college, this is \ncrucial.\n  I think at this point to expand this idea to get to K through 12, as \nSenator Dodd pointed out, if this is on the level and people start \nspending it when the child is 5, they essentially have 5 years to save, \nwhereas what we are suggesting is that people can do much better. They \ncan take that money and use it, say, long term for 18 years, have more \nof a buildup and have more of a fund.\n  What I am fearful of, if we start with all of these, is that only the \nwealthiest people will be able to do it. They will do it for both. \nAgain, we start rewarding the people in our society--God bless them, \nand I have nothing but respect for people who manage to make it. We are \nrewarding them and we are not doing a thing to help the average person.\n  That gets me back to where Senator Dodd started with his amendment. \nIf this is not going to do much for most of our kids--it is confusing, \nI agree. I started wondering--if they can get a band outfit, if that is \nworkable, yes. I argue that is part of the school. Or a uniform? But, \nwait a minute, that is giving a benefit to one child. What about the \nkid who doesn't make the band? Then the IRS is going to have to confab \nand figure whether this is a discriminatory benefit. I think we are \nopening up a can of worms a little bit. I think Senator Dodd offers us \na cleaner way to spend this $1.2 billion, which is to ease the burden \non the local districts.\n\n  I daresay it is only common sense. Our school boards have a certain \namount of money. If they cannot meet their budgets, they are going to \nhave to raise your taxes. Maybe this is going to help them. I assume it \nis going to help them. In California, we have a lid on our property \ntax, so this is a huge benefit for us because there is just so much we \ncan raise in property taxes.\n  Since we have a finite amount of money, I think the Senator from \nConnecticut is offering us a chance to step back and say let's not \ncreate a new program, which now I understand you could roll into a \ncollege account, which really gets me confused, and keep it simple and \nuse this money for special ed.\n  I thank my friend for being so generous in yielding to me. I thank my \nfriend from Connecticut for, I think in many ways, bringing us back to \nwhat we have to do, and that is to make these hard choices. He is \nsaying: Listen to what the Governors are saying. Let's take care of \nthis problem first.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I would like to respond to the Senator from California \nby calling into play an individual for whom I know she has enormous \nrespect, and that is the Vice President of the United States. He says:\n\n       Our current education IRA's simply do not meet the needs of \n     the information age. They are limited to $500 a year.\n\n  He is right.\n\n       And it must be used by an age of 30. In a fast moving, fast \n     changing economy, the right skills will often cost more than \n     $500 a year and learning must last a lifetime.\n\n  Then Vice President Gore goes on to say:\n\n       Here is my idea. We need to create a new 401(j) account \n     like the 401(k) plans that help you save for retirement. But \n     this account will allow employers and employees to contribute \n     up to $2,500 a year. . .\n\n  So he is $500 over what I am saying.\n\n     . . . in order to pay for college or job training expenses.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Is this for elementary and secondary education?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. He says for college. We are for college. This account \napplies for college.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Then scratch the other part of it.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Why should we do that? This is a classic example: \nLet's tell them what is important to them. You think it is important it \nonly be for college. I think it ought to be up to the family to decide \nwhere and when they have a special need. Maybe they have a student who \nis in junior high school who suffers a very serious injury and they \nneed assistance or they have a child who they discover has dyslexia. \nYou do not deal with dyslexia when you are in college. You deal with it \nin the younger years. There are many problems associated with that.\n  So let's let them decide. I think the majority of them will utilize \nthese funds at college. But there will be occasions where families have \nrequirements that occur before that. I can think of no reason why we \nshould arbitrarily decide: I am sorry, that is a decision we have made \nfor you.\n\n  Mr. DODD. If I can respond to my friend?\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I have no idea how they are dealing with the division \nof time. We are doing so well.\n  Mr. DODD. This much I promise: If you run out of time, I will give \nyou time. We know we have to finish at 4. I don't know if we will have \na tremendous number of Senators coming over here. We will accommodate \neverybody wishing to be heard.\n  What I have offered as a substitute, with all respect, has more \nvalue. Again, I think Governors, mayors, and local taxpayers will tell \nyou right now the cost of special education is a dominant, significant \nissue we ought to try to take care of. I have not suggested, except \nperipherally, that there are underlying problems with the Coverdell \napproach. But I made the case, if you cannot do everything, of the two \nchoices, which is a better one? I think the special ed is a better one. \nI say that. I realize there is a difference of opinion.\n  But let me respond, if I can, to the issue, just freestanding, of the \nCoverdell proposal and why I have difficulty with that as it stands. \nThere are 55 million children who got up this morning, from Maine to \nCalifornia, who went off to an elementary or secondary school in this \ncountry--55 million. Fifty million of them walked into a public \nschool--50 million; 5 million walked into a private school or a \nparochial school. The question is, this bill as it stands is designed \nto predominantly provide a tax break for those who want to send their \nkids to private and parochial schools, and it is being cloaked that \nsomehow this is great for education. You do not build a new classroom, \nyou don't pay a teacher more, you don't reduce the size of the class, \nyou don't wire the school with it, none of that stuff. This is all on \nan individual basis, where the bulk of it, 90 percent of it, goes to \nthose who are in the income category who can afford to send their kids \nto private schools. We have 50 million kids and their parents who are \nlooking to see whether or not\n\n[[Page S914]]\n\nwe are going to take some of their tax money and improve the quality of \neducation.\n  They do not have the choice. They do not have the choice to say I \nthink I will send my kid to some private boarding school in Connecticut \nor Georgia or some other place. They do not have that kind of money to \ndo that. Their kids have to go to public school. That is the choice \nthey have. They want to know whether or not their Senators are going to \ndo anything about improving the quality of the educational institution \nto which they have to send their kids.\n  That is a big difference. You have limited money. You are going to \ntake $1.2 billion of this, the bulk of which is going to go to those in \nthe upper income category, and for those parents who do not have that \nchoice, they get zilch out of this thing. My point is that is a bad \nidea, in my view, with limited resources. But aside from that, I think \ngetting the money back to our communities, providing some real relief \non special education is what is necessary.\n  I have great respect--I am a product of parochial and private \neducation. My parents could afford to do it. They sent me to those \nschools. That was a choice they made. I respect them for it. But they \nnever thought they ought to get a tax break for doing so. They \nunderstood that. They also understood there is a fundamental commitment \nand relationship between this institution and setting the agenda to \naccomplish the national purpose in education, a fundamental \nresponsibility to public education.\n  The public has no other choices. I know people are upset with the \nquality of some of our public education institutions. I wish the \nnewspapers and media covered good schools as well because there are an \nawful lot of good schools out there doing a terrific job providing a \nwonderful educational opportunity in the inner-city and rural America. \nBut our obligation is to see to it that fundamentally we work on the \nquality of those institutions that are not doing quite as well.\n  My view is this distracts, it is a distraction from the real business \nof supporting quality public schooling in this country. Aside from tax \npolicy, which I think is questionable as well, and different choices we \ncould make with it, there is an underlying problem.\n  I ask unanimous consent the editorial in the Washington Post in its \nmorning edition, its lead editorial today, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, February 29, 2000]\n\n                       School Choice for the Rich\n\n       The Senate is to take up today a proposal to use the tax \n     code to provide public funds to private schools through the \n     back door. Most Democrats, led by the president, are rightly \n     resisting; the proposal is bad tax and educational policy \n     alike.\n       The bill whose principal sponsors are Sens. Paul Coverdell \n     (R-Ga.) and Robert Torricelli (D-N.J.), would allow \n     households with annual incomes of as much as $150,000 to set \n     aside $2,000 a year per child in educational savings \n     accounts, the earnings on which would be tax-free. Parents \n     can already save this way for college; this would let them do \n     so to help pay elementary and high school expenses as well.\n       Unlike some other pending tax cut proposals, the cost would \n     be relatively modest, in part because not that many families \n     could afford to take advantage of the measure. Almost all the \n     benefit would accrue to those with well above average incomes \n     and children in private--including sectarian--schools. The \n     revenue forgone would represent an indirect subsidy to such \n     schools.\n       The president has vetoed similar legislation in the past, \n     and the Office of Management and Budget has indicated he is \n     prepared to do so again. We hope he's spared the need. Some \n     Senate Democrats think the veto threat lets them off the \n     hook. Rather than be the heavies who block an education bill \n     and tax cut, if given the chance to debate some education \n     proposals of their own they'll let the measure pass, secure \n     in the knowledge the president will block it for them down \n     the road. But that's too stagy a way to legislate. If \n     Congress wants to spend money on education, it should be on \n     needier children; if it wants to promote school choice, the \n     debate should center on helping parents who do not, by virtue \n     of their income, have any such choice now. Lawmakers should \n     kill this while they've got the chance.\n\n  Mr. DODD. It is entitled, ``School Choice for the Rich.''\n\n       The Senate is to take up today a proposal to use the tax \n     code to provide public funds to private schools through the \n     back door.\n\n  Fifty million kids and their parents are asking the question: What \nare you doing about my kids' school? I understand 5 million kids whose \nparents would like us to do something about tax relief for them if they \ngo to private schools, but I think we have a higher obligation to the \nparents of those 50 million who have no choice. Those who made the \nchoice of going to private school made that choice. I respect it, but \nthe parents who send their kids to public schools are not, \nunfortunately, in the same category.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If the Senator will yield, I want to say to my friend, \nhis education was very good. I went to public schools from kindergarten \nall the way through college. Even in college it only cost, in those \ndays, $12 a semester in the State of New York university system. What \nan amazing thing.\n  We had several people wind up going to Congress from that public \neducation system. So in my heart I understand when my friend from \nConnecticut says we have an obligation to the 50 million children who \nwalk into those public schools every day--5 million go to the parochial \nschool, 55 million in all--but we have an obligation in the public \nschool arena.\n  It gets down to yet another choice. The Senator from Connecticut has \ngiven us a choice between a tax break that is predominantly going to go \nto the wealthiest, that is going to be very minimal, and special \neducation. That is the choice he has laid out.\n  My friend also will win my vote, frankly, if he took that $1.2 \nbillion and put it into school construction or put it into more \nafterschool slots or early education, early childhood development, \npreschool, and child care in which my friend has been so involved. We \nare looking to bring home a very important choice.\n  The Governors said: Here is the choice, Senators; before you take \ncare of any other new programs and new bureaucracies, take care of \nspecial ed. My friend from Connecticut is listening to them and doing \nthat, and he is further saying that before we do any of these \nnewfangled accounts, which will be interpreted and reinterpreted by IRS \nagents up and down the line and may be very confusing, let's take care \nof our public schools.\n  What I am saying is, not only will I support the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut, but I will also support amendments to come \nthat will take this money and put it into lower class sizes, to do some \nnew construction, to train our teachers better, to get technology in \nthe schools, to make sure we have room for every child who wants \nafterschool care which we know is the best crimefighting program \naround.\n  I thank my friend for coming today. His voice on this issue is very \nimportant, but I think on this one, with his interest in education and \nhis views of concern about it and his success in it, I hope the Senate \nwill listen to the Senator from Connecticut and do first things first: \nTake care of our public school kids--that is 95 percent of our kids K \nthrough 12--before we set up some newfangled ideas on which there is \neven debate over the facts as to who it helps.\n  The Senator has a paper that says to me it is only going to help the \nvery wealthy. Senator Coverdell says it helps if one makes $75,000. \nCommon sense tells me if we start setting aside $2,000 a year, it \n``ain't'' going to be my working-class people who are going to do that, \nI can tell you right now. They tell me they can barely make ends meet. \nI know what this is about.\n  I thank my friend for bringing more clarity to the debate. I will be \nsupporting him.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I wish to clarify a point, if I can \nhave the attention of the Senator from Connecticut, because I know how \nthese things happen. We have been in touch with Governor Ridge. He does \nsupport education savings accounts and would not support an amendment \nthat made that point moot. I know the Senator was at a meeting--he \ncertainly supports the funding of IDEA. I did want to make it clear \nthat he does support the education savings account, so we can clarify \nthat one point.\n  Mr. DODD. I attended the Governors' meeting earlier today, and \nGovernor\n\n[[Page S915]]\n\nRidge said he would be glad to help out and try to convince people to \nvote for the amendment. I say to the Senator, with all due respect, I \nam also quite confident Vice President Gore does not support the \nCoverdell legislation, if there is any doubt about that at all.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. I yield 15 \nminutes to my defiant, dedicated, committed cosponsor from the other \nside of the aisle--I admire his courage on this issue--Senator \nTorricelli of New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for not only \nyielding me this time but more than that, for, through these last few \nyears, framing this debate and tirelessly bringing this issue forward. \nThis is not the first time, it is not the second time, it may not be \nthe third time Senator Coverdell and I have come to the Senate floor \nfor A+ savings accounts and, most assuredly, it will not be the last. \nThis is going to happen.\n  More than simply telling the Senate of the inevitability of these \nsavings accounts, I want us all to recognize what a positive \ncontribution we are making to American education.\n  I rise in opposition to Senator Dodd's amendment. Indeed, on another \nday, another opportunity, I not only would vote for it, I would fight \nfor it, as I would with Senator Robb's amendment dealing with the \nbuilding of new schools, and Senator Murray's amendment adding new \nteachers and reducing class size.\n  The problems of American education are not such that they require a \nsingle idea or one change. This is not a system with which we need to \ntinker. We have compound problems. The one Senator Dodd raises is among \nthe most important. We gave an obligation to local schools without the \nresources to pay for special education. Senator Robb's amendment and \nSenator Murray's amendment are important in building schools that are \ncrumbling around us in some communities and adding new teachers. They \nare good ideas, they are important ideas, but so is this.\n  For as long as I can remember, the formula for funding American \nschools has been quite simple: We raise your taxes, and we spend your \ndollars. That will continue to dominate American education. It is the \nright formula. We are adding something new, though not a novel idea. \nIndeed, ironically the source of this idea is President Clinton. In \nestablishing higher education savings accounts of $500, he laid the \nfoundation for what we debate today because what was a good idea for \nhigher education at $500 is a great idea for secondary schools at \n$2,000. Same idea, same formula with the same end.\n  This is using private money. It is using a family's own resources. By \nour estimation, after 5 years, $12 billion in private money will be \nused to educate children K through 12. That cannot be a bad thing. Yet \nthe critics argue it is a diversion of money from the public schools. \nNot one dime of money that is now going to a public school goes \nanywhere else but to that same school on that same basis. This is new \nmoney, private money, a net increase of $12 billion.\n  People argue that maybe it is all new money, but it goes to a \nprivileged few. The Congressional Budget Office argues that 70 percent \nof this money will be spent by families who earn less than $70,000. \nDoes this solve the educational problems of a family in poverty who may \nhave no money? Maybe not. Probably not. I challenge any Member of this \nSenate to come to this floor and tell me one educational idea that \nsolves the educational problems of every family in every regard forever \nwith one bill. This one does not either, but it does help many working \nfamilies, working poor, middle-class families.\n  The family who earns $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, even $70,000 a year \nbut wants to give their child some extra advantage in education, they \nwant to establish a private savings account. Why should the Federal \nGovernment be charging taxes on the interest on that account? Every \nMember of this Senate knows that education is the great test of whether \nor not we preserve our quality of life, our national security, our way \nof life.\n  The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage \nevery parent in America to save every dollar they can muster to educate \ntheir child. Taxing that money is the last thing we should be doing. \nThat is the essence of this bill: Eliminate Federal taxes on money \nsaved for education. That cannot be a bad idea. Yet it is argued that \nmaybe it is private money and there is no diversion. Maybe Senators are \nright about that. Maybe it does go to middle-class and working-class \nfamilies. Maybe Senators are right about that. It is argued that it is \nnot for a privileged few but it all does go to private schools and we \nhave a public and private school problem. Well, wrong again.\n  CBO estimates that 70 percent of this money actually will go to \npublic school students. Public school students are over 90 percent of \nthe students in America. If we are going to help everybody, by \ndefinition, most of that money will go to public school students. That \nis what the research has found because this money is not just available \nfor private school tuition. This money is available to hire public \nschool teachers after public school is out in the afternoon to help \nstudents in math and science--something desperately needed by many of \nour families--for afterschool transportation, for afterschool \nactivities of band or athletics or clubs, to buy a home computer, to \nbuy books or, if you do not use money for any of these things, to roll \nit into your college account after the 12th grade when the student is \ngoing into college.\n  Is some of this money going for private school tuition? Yes, a \nminority of it, 30 percent of it. Some does go to private school \ntuition. I am not here to apologize for that. If, in one piece of \nlegislation, we can add $12 billion to the national expenditure for \nschools, help public school students with 70 percent of this money--for \ncomputers and books and tutors--I do not rise on this floor to \napologize that some of this will go to private schools, yeshivas, or \nparochial schools for tuition.\n  In many of our cities, the Catholic school is the only alternative \navailable to many families who want something better for their child. \nTuition can be $800, $700, $1,200--out of reach for many families. Who \nis going to these schools? What is this ``idle rich'' we hear about who \nwill benefit from this bill? Ninety percent of the students in Camden \nand Newark and Jersey City going to parochial schools are Protestants; \n80 percent of them are African American. This is not a religious \nopportunity. It is a competitive school, a chance for a parent to give \nsomething else to their child.\n  We do not ask the Federal Government to pay for it--not a dime, no \npublic money. Personally, I do not believe in it. I think it is \nunconstitutional. I do not think public money can or should go directly \nto pay for tuitions in religious institutions. That is my belief. That \nis why I am for this bill because this bill does not do that--no public \nmoney. A family takes their own money, earned off the sweat of their \nown brow, puts it in a private account, and uses that money, which has \nnot been taxed because of this legislation, and pays tuition. That \ncannot be a bad thing.\n  Opposition to this legislation has many aspects. In my judgment, \nclearly, one of them is that we do not recognize the true depths of the \nproblem of American education. Getting more teachers, building more \nschools, higher standards for public schools are all part of that, but \nthat is not enough. This is a fight that must be fought on every front \nsimultaneously.\n\n  Second, I think many people simply do not recognize the state we \nwould be in if we did not have private schools. We are losing a \nCatholic school in America every week with another school closing its \ndoors. If we lose the parochial education system in America, it will \ncost $16 billion immediately to replace the system. The system must \nsurvive within constitutional bounds. That is what Senator Coverdell \nand I are attempting to do with this legislation.\n  Third, I think there is a partisan issue. With all respect to my \nfriend, Senator Coverdell and his colleagues, in my personal judgment, \nthe leadership in America on education for the last generation has been \nborne by the Democratic Party. We created the programs for grants, for \ntuition assistance, for aid to secondary schools that built libraries, \nbuilt schools, and opened opportunities. It is one of the reasons why I \nam a Democrat. Now we\n\n[[Page S916]]\n\nhave a little competition; frankly, not a lot.\n  The ideas are still overwhelmingly from the Democratic Party. But \nthis idea cannot be bad simply because some Republicans are for it. \nThat is the only argument I have heard against it. If there is going to \nbe a competition between the Democratic and Republican Parties for \nleadership on education, that is good for America. If we are going to \ncompete to convince the American people that each of us has the best \nformula for improving our schools, that is good for every child in \nAmerica.\n  To the Republican Party, I say: Welcome to the fight. We have been \nwaiting for you for a long time. But I am glad you are here.\n  This concept of A+ savings accounts has no parentage on a partisan \nbasis. It is borne of Bill Clinton's concept for funding higher \neducation. It has been adjusted by Senator Coverdell, imaginatively, \ncreatively, and effectively, to deal with the problems of grade schools \nand high schools, to help public and private schools with millions of \nAmerican families.\n  I have been for this concept since I came to the Senate. It is a \nreflection of my own belief that the American standard of living is not \nsustainable if we do not dramatically improve the quality of \ninstruction and the performance of our students in this generation. It \nis not difficult to comprehend, if the United States goes another \ndecade being 16th of the leading 18 industrial nations in the quality \nof math and science instruction, if 40 percent of 4th graders \neffectively cannot read to national standards, if a third of our \nstudents in the 8th grade cannot meet basic science requirements, this \nNation will not continue to maintain our standard of living or even our \ncurrent level of national security.\n  Education is the great divider in the world, between the insecure and \nthe poor and the wanting and those who exercise leadership and live \nbehind secure borders with rising standards of living. That is our \ntest. I can think of no more important issue for this Senate to debate.\n  I genuinely hope that not only will this A+ savings account \nlegislation pass the Senate--and I have no doubt it will pass the \nSenate--I genuinely hope we will pass it on a bipartisan basis. But in \na challenge to Republican leadership, as well, the argument that \nSenator Dodd makes today for funding special education, and the \nargument that Senator Murray and Senator Robb will make on class size \nand school construction, are arguments that not only must be heard, it \nis legislation that must be adopted.\n  Pass this legislation today and then let us return and complete the \ndebate and meet our obligation to America's schoolchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. How much time remains on the amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 18 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Georgia has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DODD. There are only two of us here, so I suspect we can manage \nthis in some way if one or the other of us ends up a little short of \ntime.\n  First of all, my friend from New Jersey has raised, as he always \ndoes, some compelling arguments. He is a very persuasive debater. I \nagree with him on a couple points. I think, first of all, maybe I \nshould have said this at the outset of the debate, that I adhere to the \nadmonition that Thomas Jefferson gave almost 200 years ago: Any nation \nthat expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never \npossibly can be.\n  As important as education was to the development of the 19th century, \nit certainly is just as important now a few days into the 21st century. \nNo issue will be more important for the development and continued \nsuccess of our own country than to have a very successful educational \nsystem in our Nation. So I agree Senator Torricelli on that point.\n  My point is, I do not think we can do everything. That is my point. I \nwould like to do a lot of things, but my concern is we have $1.2 \nbillion in this program. If I have $1.2 billion for special ed, it does \nnot even remotely get close to the 40 percent we promised our States we \nwould give them for special education. We need $15.8 billion to get to \n40 percent level.\n  I have to think, if we are going to do something about the quality of \npublic education--my friend from New Jersey has raised class size, \nsalaries for teachers, luring teachers into rural or urban areas where \nthey are needed, afterschool programs that are critical, early \nchildhood education, Head Start--there are a variety of things that all \nof us would say are absolutely essential if you are going to improve \nthe quality of our public educational system. Why does this idea, why \ndoes the idea of providing some tax incentives for people have any real \nappeal? It is because people are concerned about the quality of public \neducation in too many places.\n  If they felt there were good public schools, then they wouldn't be \nasking for the kind of suggestion that is being proposed in this bill. \nTheir desire for that is rooted in the notion, somehow, that our public \neducation is not doing very well in many places.\n  So what is our choice here? We take limited resources. We take a \ndollar, and we decide we will divide it up. And so instead of focusing \non what needs to be done with the 7 cents we provide in education out \nof every dollar from the Federal level, instead of saying let's see \nwhat we can do to improve the structures themselves, the buildings, how \nwe can wire schools so they are able to connect with the technologies \nof the 21st century, my concern is that we are taking $1.2 billion in \neffect off the table for a proposal that has marginal benefit.\n  I say again to my friends, the authors of this legislation, people \nmaking $25,000, $30,000, $35,000, $40,000 a year, if they have two or \nthree kids, they can't put aside $4,000, $5,000, $6,000, $7,000 in \nthese accounts. It doesn't work out that way. It is hard enough to make \nends meet. The idea that they are going to put $2,000 per child in an \nIRA account is not realistic for them. They could put something in \nthere, but the idea that they are going to get this tax benefit because \npeople will maximize, that doesn't add up in my view.\n  I do think there is a clear distinction between higher education and \nelementary and secondary education. Again, schools at the elementary \nand secondary level that are private or parochial select who they want. \nYou may think you have the choice, but ultimately it is theirs whether \nyou go or not. A public school doesn't have that luxury. If you are a \nchild who lives in a community and you show up at the door, they have \nto take you in whether they like you or not.\n  You show up at a private school, and the private school can say: You \nare not a nice family, nice people. I am sorry. We are not going to \nselect you.\n  So there is a distinction in a sense. Our public schools must take \neverybody. The 50 million kids this morning who showed up at their \ndoors have to be educated. We know too many children are not getting \nthe quality of education they deserve. They are going to school in \nbuildings that are falling down. They have textbooks and equipment that \nis antiquated. They have teachers who are not necessarily the best. \nFurther, the salaries are significantly different from community to \ncommunity in too many States. Maybe we can go around and set up private \nschools all over the place and say to the 50 million children presently \nattending public schools: We have a structure you can move into. You \ncan't do that. Fifty million are not going to fit in the places where 5 \nmillion students presently are.\n  It seems to me we are not left with many choices. We have to improve \npublic education. We have no other choice but to do that. We have no \nalternative. We must do that. With limited resources, is it not wiser \nto take these scarce resources and put them into special education \naccounts that would lower the property taxes; or at least allow our \nschool boards at the local level to decide they will take the money \nthat goes to pay for that special needs child for fixing up that \nschool, for afterschool programs; or lower the taxes and allow parents \nthen to have more money in their pocket to do some of the things my \nfriends from Georgia and New Jersey would like to give them the option \nof doing. Then they could do whatever they want with it.\n\n  That seems to provide a greater benefit to all people, not just the \nones who\n\n[[Page S917]]\n\nare selected to go to a private or parochial school, but all students. \nThat is a better choice, if there are indeed limited resources.\n  I say to my good friend from New Jersey, I know he made an appeal to \nour Republican friends to support the Robb amendment and the Murray \namendment. But just as he asserts that this amendment is going to be \nrejected and this underlying bill passed, I am fairly confident the \nRobb and the Murray and other offered amendments are going to be \ndefeated when it comes time to do something on school construction and \nafterschool programs and the like.\n  Part of the argument will be, we can't afford to do everything. They \nare right. You can't do everything. So my choice is--I presume I may be \nin the minority on this--my choice is to take the $1.2 billion, give it \nback to the States, give it back to the localities. Give it back to \nthem so they can reduce their costs on special education. One out of \nevery 10 children in this country is a special needs child in our \npublic school system--1 out of every 10. In my State, 14 percent of all \nstudents receive special education services.\n  These problems are growing. The cost is growing. In some of my \ncommunities in Connecticut, the cost of providing special education is \nmore than $50,000 per year. Eighty-two percent of that cost is being \nborne by the local property taxpayer. We promised that community and \nthat family we would pick up 40 percent of that $50,000.\n  I say to my good friends, the authors of this proposal before us, you \ncannot tell me with certainty what is going to happen if this \nlegislation is passed. This is a new proposal.\n  With higher education, you have a choice. Higher education doesn't \nhave a property tax base to support it. Higher education costs, at a \nminimum $5, $6, $7 thousand per year in my State. However, the public \nschools at the elementary and secondary level are free in Connecticut, \nas they are across the country.\n  So here it seems to me, with limited resources, are the choices we \nhave to make, painful as they are, where all the ideas have some merit. \nI shared earlier today the letter I received 2 days ago from the \nNational School Boards Association begging for us to offer this \namendment. These are not Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, \nliberals. These are people at every school board across the country who \nare saying: Please do something about this. Please do something about \nthis.\n  I am offering my colleagues this afternoon a chance to do that when \nwe vote on this amendment.\n  I have already noted the letter from the National School Boards \nAssociation, dated February 23:\n\n       Rather than create a tax benefit for a select few, applying \n     these funds to special education would benefit more taxpayers \n     and public schools.\n\n  That is not from a think tank. That is from the National School \nBoards Association letter of 3 days ago. That is the choice they would \nlike us to make. These are the people who wrestle with education \nissues, not once in a while on the floor of the Senate, but every \nsingle day in every community across this country. They have said, this \nis our choice.\n  The question is, are we on their side, or are we on the side of an \nalternative form of education which, frankly, has some value in some \npeople's minds, but 50 million kids don't have the choice. This is \nwhere they have to go to school, and we have to address those problems. \nWe can run, but we can't hide. Either we do it, or it gets worse each \nyear. The costs continue to go up.\n  If you can't do everything, I think this amendment offers a better \nidea. The National School Boards thinks it is a better idea. The \nNational Governors' Association, Republicans and Democrats, unanimously \nthink it is a good idea. I hope this afternoon my colleagues will agree \nwith them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe, indeed, this debate is \nhelpful in narrowing some of these issues. As I think I have attested, \nI also believe Senator Dodd has a good idea, an idea that should be \nadopted. It simply is not an alternative to this idea.\n  Let me suggest to my colleagues where Senator Dodd and I have common \nagreement and where we have differences. Senator Dodd has made the \npoint that most families could not afford to put the $2,000 in a \nsavings account to pay for their public or private school education. I \nagree. It is critical to this concept that this $2,000 savings account \ndoes not rest solely on the shoulders of the mother or the father. I \nremember--I am not so young I cannot recall--a time when in an American \ncommunity, the education of a child was generally an involvement of the \nlarger community. It wasn't just a single mother or the father. These \naccounts are an opportunity to re-ignite that sense of involvement. We \nallow the extended family--grandparents, aunts, uncles, churches, labor \nunions, corporations--to put money into these accounts.\n\n  Senator Dodd is right that few families will be able to put $2,000 in \nthese accounts per year. But a lot of labor unions can go to their \nemployers and say: We would like a little raise next year and we want \nmoney in the savings account. A lot of churches will be able to go to \nthe parishioners and say: Thanks for giving to the church. We would \nlike to help Johnny or Jane with their education savings accounts. A \nlot of parents can go to grandparents and say: At Christmas, instead of \nthat toy, would you put $100 into the education savings accounts?\n  This is under the concept that educating a child is everybody's \nbusiness. Even then, can we get $2,000 a year? Maybe not. But if upon \nthe birth of a child we can get $500 or $700 and compound it, with tax-\nfree interest, year in and year out, by the time that child is going to \nthe eighth or ninth grade and needs a tutor after school because he or \nshe doesn't understand the math assignment, they can afford it. By the \ntime they are in the sixth grade and they can't afford to buy a \ncomputer, with this they could afford one. By the time they go to \ncollege, if they have spent none of this money and for 18 years they \nhave been saving $200, $500, or $700, at compound interest, it would be \nsignificant. Does it pay for a Harvard education? No, but it gets them \ninto the community college or a State school or it pays for part of the \neducation. It helps. It is valuable.\n  More than just dollars is involved; it creates the concept of the \ncommunity being involved, having the vehicle of these accounts. It is \nno coincidence that when Senator Coverdell and I offered these \naccounts, the House sponsor was not some conservative Republican from \nthe Deep South, with all due respect to my Southern colleagues from the \nRepublican Party; it was Floyd Flake, a minister, African American, \nfrom Queens, NY, who has had the philosophy of the government that: I \nwill take care of my own community; just get out of my way--if I may \nparaphrase him. He has a charter school; he started it himself. He \nwould like people to be able to have these accounts to pay for some of \nthe extra costs.\n  That goes to the second point Senator Dodd made. We agreed on the \nfirst--everybody doesn't have $2,000. We disagree on the second. \nSenator Dodd said public school is free. It was when Senator Dodd and I \nwent to school. It isn't anymore. How many parents tonight face their \nchildren who come home and say: I would like to be part of the band or \nthe Latin Club or the French Club and it costs $500. Can I do that, \nmom?\n  What we built in the fifties and sixties in this extraordinary public \neducation, funding all these tremendous activities, we have eroded. I \nrepresent communities in New Jersey where you can't get a bus home \nafter school if you don't pay for it. You can't join the football team. \nSome of the books are so old, parents have to buy them themselves. \nThese education savings accounts go to the heart of that problem. \nPublic school is not free. Sixty percent of the African American \nstudents in our public schools don't have access to a computer. It is \nthe new divide in American education. That includes 70 percent of \nHispanic students and millions of other students from all backgrounds.\n  Why? What is so wrong if we allow a parent to take their own hard-\nearned money and put it in their own account? All we ask the Federal \nGovernment to do--my God, the minimum we can ask anybody to do--is not \ntax them on the interest. Let them keep the interest so a parent can \nbuy their child something, so they can maximize. I visit public\n\n[[Page S918]]\n\nschools throughout New Jersey where children are struggling with math, \nscience, and areas that were never approached when I was in high \nschool. They struggle. It is hard. If you ask them the one thing they \ncan get more out of public school, they will tell you: I wish there was \nsomebody after school to help me with my work--a tutor.\n  Instead, our public school teachers, who are underpaid and \noverworked, leave school at 3:30 or 4 o'clock and take second jobs \nselling clothing, painting houses--anything to support their own \nfamilies. How about an education savings account, where at the end of \nthe day the public school teacher can work for some extra dollars doing \nwhat they do best--teaching, tutoring, helping public school students \nlearn the math and science with which they struggle.\n  No, public school is not free. And $2,000 is a lot for most families. \nWe could be wrong. Senator Coverdell and I could be wrong. We could \noffer this chance to every labor union, church, and grandparent in \nAmerica to help with their kids' education by putting money in every \nbirthday, holiday, or Christmas, and maybe nobody will answer. But I \ndon't believe that. That is not the kind of people we are. That is not \nthe kind of communities I represent. I think people will answer. I \nthink Floyd Flake is right. Every Member of the Senate talks about \nfaith-based answers to problems, working hand in hand with the \nGovernment. Well, let's see. I bet the grandparents, aunts and uncles, \nlabor unions, churches, and synagogues will come forward and use these \naccounts as a vehicle. But mostly, I don't want to fail because we \ndidn't ask. This is an invitation to America to get back in your public \nor private school, get involved and solve the problem.\n  I believe these are worthwhile. Senator Dodd may be right that this \ninstitution doesn't have the will or the resources to answer this \nproblem and the special education problem and the school construction \nproblem. If this country doesn't have the will or resources to deal \nwith those problems, we are headed for real trouble. I believe we have \nthe will, and I certainly believe we have the resources--not \nexpenditures, not a dime of it, but investments, every single dollar in \nevery investment for building a school or hiring a teacher. I will \nfight every day for every one of those things.\n  Today is the Coverdell-Torricelli legislation for private savings \naccounts to fund public and private schools. I am proud to be part of \nit. I yield to Senator Coverdell.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I am most appreciative of the extended effort on the \npart of the Senator from New Jersey, who brings a very powerful \nperspective to this debate.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is correct that we are constantly \nconfronted with choices. I think this is a bad example, though, or \nchoice of that kind of trade. What I mean is, first of all, I believe \nIDEA will receive added benefits this year. It has received nearly $3 \nbillion in the last 4 years over and above the President's request. So \nthere is a body here that agrees with those Governors and with you that \nthis is a high priority.\n  The problem with the Senator's amendment is when it moves against the \nsavings accounts, it blows away $12 billion. There are choices. You \ncould say, well, we will spend $1.2 billion here instead of $1.2 \nbillion over there. But by the nature of this legislation, this savings \naccount involves 14 million families--20 million of those 55 million \nyou are talking about--3 million or 4 million of them are in private \nschools, but 11 million of these children are in public schools that \nwill benefit from these accounts.\n  The Senator's amendment takes that resource, which comes forward as a \nvoluntary action on the part of families and communities, churches, \nsynagogues, labor unions, and employers and shuts it down. That is not \na good trade. Trading $1.2 billion and losing $12 billion is not a good \ntrade. There may be a place where your choice is appropriate, but I \ndon't believe it is where you blow away all that benefit, which this \ndoes.\n  It has been characterized that private schools are the chief \nbeneficiary, and that is not the case. Several on the floor have \ncharacterized parochial schools as a ``haven for the wealthy.'' Listen, \nthe children attending parochial schools today are within 10 percent of \nthe same children attending public schools, and they are from families \nearning $40,000 or $50,000.\n  These are not a bunch of wealthy folks. The demographics in the New \nYork school system are virtually identical between the public system \nand the parochial system. So it is not like somebody who happens to be \nin a parochial school and drives up to school in a long, black \nlimousine and a guy in knickers gets out. These are minorities. They \nare Hispanic. They are African Americans. They are average folks. I \ndon't know why they are there. The public systems ought to be mighty \nglad it is there because it works both ways. The Senator is right. That \nsystem couldn't accept the public system, and it never will. \nConversely, close it down and you make new problems for the public \nsystem because those people are paying property taxes even though their \nchildren are in the parochial system.\n  The point I am trying to make is that the public system will be a \nmajor benefactor. It is not a minor player. The choice the Senator is \nasking us to make is not $1.2 billion here or $1.2 billion there. It is \n$1.2 billion here or no $12 billion. Of that $12 billion, $6 billion is \ngoing to go into public schools over the next 10 years and $6 billion \nis going to go into private, or home, or whatever. Those are major \ndollars.\n  When the Senator from California and others talk about the benefit, \nthey don't mention the principal. That is the point. That is how you \nget up to the $12 billion. The Senator is right. It is not a lot of \nrelief that the Federal Government is giving. What is amazing to me is \nhow little it takes to cause these families to do so much.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bunning be added \nas a cosponsor to the Collins amendment No. 2854.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague from Georgia needs another \nminute or two to make concluding remarks, I will be happy to yield my \ntime, or if the Senator from New Jersey would care to be heard.\n  My colleagues conveniently use numbers which, obviously, sound \nbeneficial to their argument. The fact is, according to the Joint Tax \nCommittee, which analyzed this proposal, if you are the family of a \nchild in a public school, the tax benefit to you over 5 years is \n$20.50. That is the tax benefit to a family whose child is in a public \nschool. Is it worth taking that much off the table in the name of \neducation and providing tax relief which is so nominal it is hardly \nworth mentioning?\n\n       You can make a case. You have heard it over the years. \n     Businesses say: If you will give me this tax break, it will \n     leverage this much more in private capital. The fact is, you \n     still have to have a tax break. It is revenue lost.\n\n  We have come a long way in the last 7 or 8 years. We have a surplus \nfor the first time in the last few years. We are actually on track to \neliminating the national debt. The idea that we can just take $1.2 \nbillion off the table is a flawed idea. Even if you accept the point of \nmy colleagues and leverage private dollars, it may generate some of \nthis activity they are talking about, but the fact is, it is $1.2 \nbillion. It is rolling the dice, in effect.\n  I have suggested that there is $1.2 billion that could be used to \ndefray the cost of special education. I know that amount would ease the \nburden on our school districts. As my colleagues well know, you take \n$1.2 billion and put it in this program, then you will come and say: \nLet's do something on special education. What about school \nconstruction? What about teacher salaries and smaller class sizes? \nThose are things we know we need to improve the quality of public \neducation in this country. Those dollars become harder and harder to \ncome by as we take more and more dollars off the table.\n  Unless you accept the notion we are going to accept everybody's idea \non how to improve the quality of public education--which we are not and \nwe have limited resources--the people who pay the taxes in this country \nthat come into the general revenue of the Treasury know full well we \ncan't spend their money on everything. Parents of 50 million kids have \nsaid to us: Improve the quality of public education and reduce the cost \nof special education. One\n\n[[Page S919]]\n\ncertain way of doing that is by freeing up dollars at the local level, \nor reducing taxes for that local property taxpayer. I guarantee you \nthat benefit is more than $20.50. If you are a parent of a public \nschool child, and you get the kind of special education relief I \noffered, there is more tax relief for that taxpayer and that community \nthan the $20.50 you are going to get if the Coverdell legislation is \nadopted.\n  I respect my colleagues from Georgia and New Jersey, but I come back \nto the point I made a moment ago. People who have children in public \nschools recognize that we have no choice but to try to make this system \nbetter. We have to do it or we are going to pay an awful price later \nthis century. We are not going to have the kind of well-educated, \nproductive citizens that we need.\n  I am hopeful my colleagues will recognize that the idea of reducing \nthe cost of special education is something we can do something about \ntoday. In a few minutes we will have a chance to vote on this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Reed, Harkin, \nDorgan, Reid of Nevada, and Kennedy be added as cosponsors of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, how much time do we have between us?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute 40 seconds to my colleague \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I graciously accept it. I will make a \nmotion in 1 minute 40 seconds calling for a point of order against the \namendment. The Senator from Connecticut knows that.\n  I guess it is all in the eyes of the beholder. An insignificant \nnumber of people will be beneficiaries. That insignificant number is 14 \nmillion families and 20 million children, and an individual family can \nexpect only $20 worth of interest-free benefits.\n  But the point is, that, nevertheless, no matter what it is, if it is \na quarter, it causes them to save $12 billion, whatever it is. It is \n$12 billion of new money flowing into both public and private \neducation. That is not insignificant. Everett Dirksen said, ``A billion \nhere and a billion there, and before long it is real money.'' Twelve \nbillion dollars is real money. It would be controlled by America's \nfamilies to help them with the very special and unique needs that their \nchildren have through these education savings accounts.\n  The pending amendment, No. 2857, offered by the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, increases mandatory spending by $1.2 billion, \nand, if adopted, would cause the underlying bill to exceed the \ncommittee's section 302(a) allocation. Therefore, I raise a point of \norder against the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to waive the relevant portions of the \nBudget Act.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Dodd amendment No. 2857. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Mr. McCain) \nand the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nby the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to the Senator from Maine. What \nwe would like to have on this side--we understand it will be \ninterspersed with Republican amendments, but the order of Senators \noffering amendments would be Robb, Bingaman, Graham, and Wellstone. The \nreason I make that announcement is so that Democratic Senators aren't \ngoing to be over here wondering when they can offer their amendments. \nThese are the next four to be offered on our side.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there will be a unanimous consent \npropounded after the vote on the Collins amendment, but for everybody's \npurposes, it is anticipated that there would be a vote on Collins \nshortly, maybe 30, 35 minutes. Then we would take up the Robb amendment \nbut not vote on that until tomorrow morning around 10. I think that is \nthe general agreement we have reached, to at least let everybody \nunderstand what we are dealing with.\n  I yield the floor so we may proceed with the Collins amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nThurmond be added as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe pending amendment which I have offered on behalf of myself, Senator \nKyl, Senator Coverdell, Senator Hatch, Senator Abraham, and Senator \nBunning. I know the hour is late and I understand if I speak very \nshortly I will get more votes, so I will be very brief in describing my \namendment.\n  We have worked together to craft an amendment to help our public \nschool teachers when they either pursue professional development at \ntheir own expense or purchase supplies for their classroom. Our \namendment has two major provisions.\n  First, it will allow teachers to deduct their professional \ndevelopment expenses without subjecting the deduction to the existing \n2-percent floor that is in our Tax Code. Second, it will grant teachers \na tax credit of up to $100 for books, supplies, and other equipment \nthey purchase for their students. As Senator Kyl has noted, a study by \nthe National Education Association indicates the average schoolteacher \nspends more than $400 a year on supplies and other materials for the \nclassroom.\n  Our amendment would reward teachers for undertaking these activities \nthat are designed to make them better teachers or to provide better \nsupplies for their students. It is an example of a way that we can say \nthank you to teachers who do so much for our children.\n  While our amendment provides financial relief for our dedicated \nteachers, its real beneficiaries are our Nation's students. Other than \ninvolved parents, which we all know to be the most important component, \na well-qualified and dedicated teacher is the single most important \nprerequisite for student success. Educational researchers have \nrepeatedly demonstrated the\n\n[[Page S920]]\n\nclose relationship between qualified teachers and successful students.\n  Moreover, teachers themselves understand how important professional \ndevelopment is to maintaining and expanding their levels of competence. \nWhen I meet with teachers from Maine, they always tell me of their need \nfor more professional development and the scarcity of financial support \nfor this very worthy pursuit. The willingness of Maine's teachers to \nreach deep into their own pockets to fund their own professional \ndevelopment impresses me deeply. For example, an English teacher in \nBangor, who serves on my Educational Policy Advisory Committee, told me \nof spending her own money to attend a curriculum conference. She then \ncame back and shared that information with all of the English teachers \nin her department. She is not alone. She is typical of teachers who are \nwilling to pay for their own professional development as well as to \npurchase supplies and materials to enhance their teaching.\n  I greatly admire the many teachers who have voluntarily financed the \nadditional education they need to improve their schools and to serve \ntheir students better. I greatly admire those teachers who reach into \ntheir own pockets to buy supplies, paints, books, all sorts of \nmaterials that are lacking in their classroom. We should reward those \nteachers. Let us change the Tax Code to recognize and reward their \nsacrifice and to encourage more teachers to take the courses they need \nor to help supplement the supplies in their classroom. I hope those \nchanges in our Tax Code will encourage more teachers to undertake the \nformal course work in the subject matter they teach, or to complete \ngraduate degrees in either a subject matter or in education, or to \nattend conferences to give them more ideas for innovative approaches to \npresenting the course work they teach in perhaps a more challenging \nmanner.\n  This amendment will reimburse teachers for just a small part of what \nthey invest in our children's future. This money will be money well \nspent. Investing in education helps us to build one of the most \nimportant assets for our country's future; that is, a well-educated \npopulation. We need to ensure that our public schools have the very \nbest teachers possible in order to bring out the very best in our \nstudents. Adopting this amendment is the first step toward that goal. \nIt will help us in a small way recognize the many sacrifices our \nteachers make each and every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by the Senator from Maine, and I thank her for her \nleadership in bringing this issue before the Senate at this time.\n  Mr. President, no debate on tax incentives for education would be \ncomplete without a discussion of teachers and how they are taxed as \nprofessionals. In my view, the current law treatment is seriously \ndeficient in this area.\n  First, let me review the technical points. Like any other \nprofessional, elementary and secondary school teachers incur a number \nof expenses in order to keep themselves current in their fields of \nknowledge. These include subscriptions to journals and other \nperiodicals. In addition, many teachers invest in their own development \nby taking courses to improve their knowledge or skills. Under current \nlaw, these expenses are deductible, as miscellaneous itemized \ndeductions. However, there are two practical limitations that \neffectively make these expenses non-deductible for most teachers.\n  The first limitation is that the total amount of a taxpayer's \ndeductible miscellaneous expenses must exceed 2 percent of adjusted \ngross income before they begin to be deductible. The second hurdle is \nthat the amount in excess of the 2 percent floor, if any, combined with \nall other deductions the taxpayer has, must exceed the standard \ndeduction before any of them are deductible.\n  Let's consider just how difficult these limitations can be, Mr. \nPresident. I will use the example of a fifth-year high school science \nteacher in Utah who I will call Robin Stewart. Robin is single and \nmakes $35,000 per year. She incurred $840 of expenses last year for \nscience periodicals and for a course she took over the summer to \nincrease her knowledge of chemistry.\n  Under current law, Robin's $840 expenditures are deductible, subject \nto the limitations I mentioned. The first limitation says that her \nexpenses must exceed 2 percent of her income before they are \ndeductible. Two percent of $35,000 is $700. Thus, only $140 of her $840 \nis deductible--that portion which exceeds $700.\n  As a single taxpayer, Robin's standard deduction for 2000 is $4,400. \nHer total itemized deductions, including the $140 miscellaneous \ndeduction, fall short of this threshold. Therefore, not even the $140 \nis deductible for Robin. What the first limitation did not block, the \nsecond one did.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, this is the case for most of the school \nteachers in our nation. In 1997, the last year for which the Internal \nRevenue Service has statistics, only 29.9 percent of taxpayers were \nable to itemize their deductions. So even in the rare case where the 2 \npercent limitation does allow a significant deduction, chances are very \ngood that it will not help the teacher because he or she cannot \nitemize.\n  The amendment before us is a good step in the right direction. It \nwould remove the first limitation--the 2 percent floor on miscellaneous \nitemized deductions. Ideally, I would like to see the second limitation \nremoved as well and make these kinds of expenses deductible by teachers \nregardless of whether or not they itemize. I hope that my colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee will take a close look at the idea of an above-\nthe-line deduction for teachers.\n  Mr. President, the second part of the amendment before us is also \nvery important. It recognizes that many of our dedicated teachers incur \npersonal expenses for materials for their classrooms. Under current \nlaw, these types of expenses are, once again, deductible, but only to \nthe extent they exceed 2 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross \nincome.\n  Many Americans may be unaware that many teachers subsidize their \nschools out of their own pockets. It is not unusual for teachers to \nhave to pay for copying extra worksheets or articles, purchasing art \nsupplies, or providing tablets and pencils to some students who are \nwithout. Many teachers buy library books, educational games, and \npuzzles for their classes with their own money.\n  Rather than treating these expenses the same as teacher development \nexpenses, and exempting them from the 2 percent floor, this amendment \ngoes one step further and grants a tax credit of up to $100 per \ntaxpayer for materials the teacher supplies for his or her class. This \nmeans the teacher receives a dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax \nliability.\n  Some people may argue that teachers don't have to do this--why should \nthey get a special tax credit?\n  The fact is that those teachers who love teaching and care about \ntheir students have been subsidizing their classrooms for years. They \ndo it because our public schools frequently nickel-and-dime the \nclassroom in order to concentrate resources on required big ticket \nitems.\n  And, Mr. President, there is one key difference between school \nteachers and other professionals that, in my mind, justifies this tax \nchange. Teachers--unlike lawyers, accountants, physicians, or others \nwho may take the existing deduction--are engaged in non-profit public \nservice.\n  This amendment gives proper recognition to the personal sacrifice \nthat many of our teachers make, year after year, toward improving the \neducation of our children.\n  As in the other part of this amendment, Mr. President, this provision \nis not perfect. I would like to see this credit also extended to those \nparents in Utah and throughout the country who choose to teach their \nchildren at home. Their expenditures, which likely far exceed $100, \nalso deserve the tax credit, and I hope the Finance Committee can look \nfor ways in other legislation to extend such a credit to parents to \nteach at home.\n  But, the Collins-Kyl-Coverdell-Hatch amendment is a good step toward \nrecognizing the dedication of our elementary and secondary school \nteachers and in helping them to meet the costs of their profession.\n  We say that we want our public school teachers to be the best.\n\n[[Page S921]]\n\n  We say we want our children and grandchildren taught by teachers who \nare competent and up-to-date not only in the subject matter they are \nteaching, but in the pedagogy of teaching it.\n  We say we want teachers who know how to exploit fully new learning \ntechnologies, including the Internet.\n  We say we want teachers who can recognize the signs of struggling or \ntroubled students.\n  We say we want teachers who can inspire our kids.\n  We say we want teachers who are willing to go the extra mile.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, offered by Senator Collins, is not \nunlike an amendment I introduced myself. This amendment, like my own, \nis designed to get our tax policy in sync with our goals for education.\n  This amendment will provide modest tax relief for teachers who, for \ntoo long, have been footing the bill for improving the quality of \nteaching by themselves. It is time we helped out.\n  I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I compliment my colleagues for the good work they are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment Senator Hatch for the great way \nin which he explained this amendment which Senators Coverdell, Collins, \nHatch, and myself have cosponsored.\n  He points out that we have goals for excellence in teaching, and this \nis a way to help foster those goals. We ask our teachers to do a great \ndeal. This is one small step we can take to help those who are most \nwilling to help their students.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for an excellent statement.\n  I also thank Senator Collins for the kind remarks she made last \nevening. It has been a pleasure to work with her. She is a real leader \nin education. To be able to join my amendment with her amendment as one \napproach which provides some relief to the teachers who are willing to \ntake that extra step to help their students is certainly an honor for \nme.\n  To recapitulate for our colleagues because I think we are going to be \nvoting soon, I leave it to Senator Collins to close the debate unless \nthere is anyone else who would like to speak to it. The old saying of \ntaking an apple to the teacher at school has caused us to stop and \nthink a little bit. It is fine to take an apple to the teacher, but \nthere is a way we can be a little bit more helpful to those teachers \nwho go the extra mile. There may not be a direct relationship between \nexcellence in teaching and providing some assistance to those teachers \nwho will go out of their way to take extra supplies to their students, \nbut I suspect there, in fact, is a connection because these are the \nmost dedicated of all--those teachers who realize their local schools \nhave not been able to provide quite enough in instructional materials \nfor their kids, and out of their own family budget they are willing to \nmake a contribution for their students' education. As I pointed out \nlast night, the NEA estimates, according to a study, that each teacher \nannually spends $408 out of his or her pocket to help kids in school by \ntaking these instructional materials to them.\n  These two amendments, in a small way but an important way, recognize \nthat dedication and that contribution. In the case of my half of the \namendment, it provides dollar for dollar in relief and $100 in the case \nof Senator Collins' amendment. It relieves 2 percent of the burden for \nitemizing it, which Senator Hatch just spoke about.\n  Is this going to solve all of our woes in education? No. But is it an \nimportant recognition of the job teachers do, particularly those \nteachers who are willing to go the extra mile? We think it is. To the \ndegree they are willing to supplement what their schools provide for \nstudents, and it comes out of their own pockets, we think we should at \nleast cause them no harm in that process.\n  That is why we provide these two elements of tax relief basically to \nencourage them to continue to work with their students in this way.\n  I conclude again by thanking Senator Coverdell for his leadership, \nSenator Collins, and Senator Hatch. I hope my colleagues will give this \namendment their overwhelming support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to join in support of this \namendment. I think it is a brilliant idea and something that is \noverdue.\n  I think Senator Hatch has commented quite clearly why the present \nstate of the law is ineffective to assist teachers who are working \nsteadily and giving of themselves sacrificially for their classrooms \nand why the current tax law benefits them not very much, or almost none \nat all. I taught one year. I recall that we had expensive readers paid \nfor by the government. I tried to get the disadvantaged children in the \nclassroom to read those readers. They hated it. But there are a bunch \nof books there on the walls--Daniel Boone, Hardy Boys, Nancy Drew, and \nthose kinds of books. I noticed that if I could get them to read those \nbooks, they liked it. Some of them read 30, 40, 50, or 60 books. When I \nwent to the used bookstores, or places such as that, I would pick up \nbooks on my own and bring them back to the classroom because there was \na lot of satisfaction in seeing those children actually enjoying \nreading a story.\n  I think sometimes we need to review the quality of the material we \nare asking our children to read. It may be scientifically sound, but \nmost of it is boring. They don't like it; it is work to them. If you \ncan make reading a pleasure, I think it helps.\n  My personal experience with that indicates to me we ought to \nencourage teachers to not hesitate. A teacher may bring them to \nWashington, and they may see prints of historical events or artwork \nthey want to buy right then. The school board isn't going to be \navailable to approve that. They know it will fit right within their \nclassroom and the course they will be studying.\n  They invest their own money in that. I think that ought to be \nencouraged.\n  My wife taught for a number of years in public schools. She was \ncontinually buying things for her bulletin board to share with the \nelementary classes and to help her teach the lessons she had for that \nclass.\n  There is no way some bureaucrat in Washington or even some school \nboard member or principal is going to be available at the right time to \napprove that expenditure for a teacher.\n  We do not appreciate our teachers enough. If you haven't been in a \nclassroom to know how hard it is, how frustrating it can be, and how \nburdensome the regulations are, adding the fact that the days are long \nand children may not be so well disposed to behave on a given day, you \ncan't know what it is to be a teacher.\n  One of the most frustrating aspects is the little things teachers \nneed that they cannot get unless they pay for them out of their own \npocket. They do that continuously. But it is a source of irritation to \nthem. They sense we are not supporting them fully in their mission.\n  I think this is a great amendment, I say to Senator Collins and \nSenator Kyl. I think it is right on point. I could not be more pleased \nwith it. I would like to be added as a cosponsor to it. I think it will \nhelp us in the classroom. The most important point in the education \nprocess is what occurs in a classroom, that magic moment when a teacher \nand child can come together and learning occurs. This will help enhance \nthat. I am pleased to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank all my colleagues for their excellent statements \non this amendment. I ask unanimous consent the Senator from Michigan, \nMr. Abraham, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, be added as \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S922]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be laid aside and Senator Robb be recognized to offer an \namendment; further, that the debate on the Robb amendment re school \nconstruction resume at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, and the time between \n9:30 and 10 be equally divided in the usual form, and following the use \nor yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to a vote on or in \nrelation to the amendment. Further, I ask there be no amendment in \norder to the amendment prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, therefore, following the Collins vote, \nthere will be no further votes tonight, and the first vote will occur \nat 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.\n  I also ask unanimous consent--and the Senator from Nevada and I both \nconsulted about this--that Senator Crapo be recognized in morning \nbusiness for up to 10 minutes immediately following the Collins vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. And following Senator Crapo, the Senator from Montana will \nbe recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I so amend the unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I believe the order of business then \nwould be for Senator Robb to offer his amendment. It is my \nunderstanding he is only going to talk about it briefly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to support the \nAffordable Education Act, which addresses an important issue facing \nAmerican families today--the education of their children. It is my \nlong-held belief that we need to make a college education more \naffordable, and this legislation will do that by providing tax \nincentives to families who save for their children's future education \nneeds.\n  While I strongly support this legislative package, I want to focus on \na provision which I have championed for the past six years. Section 102 \nof the bill makes savings in qualified state tuition plans tax free. \nThis provision would reward savings and allow students and families who \nare participating in these state-sponsored plans to be exempt from \nfederal income tax when the funds are used for qualified education \npurposes. This legislation also recognizes the leadership that states \nhave provided in helping families save for college. Nationwide, 44 \nsavings plans will be established in 2000, serving over one million \nsavers who have contributed over $7 billion in education savings. In my \nstate of Kentucky, over 3,000 families have established accounts, which \namount to $9.3 million in savings.\n  This legislation will reward long-term saving by making savings for \neducation tax-free. It is important that we not forget that compounded \ninterest cuts both ways. By saving, participants can keep pace with, or \neven ahead of, tuition increases while putting a little away at a time. \nBy borrowing, students bear added interest costs that add thousands to \nthe total cost of tuition. Savings will have a positive impact, by \nreducing the need for students to borrow tens of thousands of dollars \nin student loans. This will help make need-based grants, which target \nlow-income families, go much further.\n  Anyone with a child in college knows first-hand the expense of higher \neducation. Throughout the 1990s, education costs have continually \noutstripped the gains in income. Tuition rates have not become the \ngreatest obstacle students face in attending college. In fact, the \nastronomical increase in college costs has been well documented. \nAccording to a study conducted by the College Board, over the ten-year \nperiod ending in 1999-00, tuition and fees at both pubic and private \nfour-year colleges have increased on average more than 110 percent over \ninflation since 1980-81, with costs at public colleges rising 51 \npercent compared to the 34 percent for private four-year colleges. \nWhile average, inflation-adjusted tuition has more than doubled, median \nfamily income has risen only 22 percent since 1981. To compound this \nproblem, room and board charges are between 3.6 and 4.8 percent higher \nthis year than last year.\n  Due to the high cost of education, more and more families have come \nto rely on financial aid to meet tuition costs. In fact, a majority of \nall college students utilize some amount of financial assistance. The \nCollege Board estimates that most of the growth in financial aid has \nbeen in the form of student borrowing. In 1998-99, $64.1 billion in \nfinancial aid was available to students and their families from \nfederal, state, and institutional sources. However, despite the fact \nthat student aid has increased in value, it has not increased enough to \nkeep pace with the rise in tuition.\n  Many Kentuckians are drawn to tuition savings plans because they \noffer a low-cost, disciplined approach to savings. In fact, the average \nmonthly contribution in Kentucky is just $52--clearly this benefits \nmiddle-class savers. By exempting all interest earnings\n\n[[Page S923]]\n\nfrom federal taxes, this legislation rewards parents who are serious \nabout their children's future and who are committed over the long-term \nto the education of their children.\n  I would like to share an article written by Jane Bryant Quinn, a \nnationally syndicated financial columnist. In this article, Ms. Quinn \ndiscusses the unique tax benefit and the stable investment provided by \nthe existing plans. Ms. Quinn noted that these plans are ``a great way \nfor parents or grandparents to build a college fund.'' Mr. President, I \nask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks. I encourage all of my colleagues to read it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, despite the Administration's objection \nto expanding the favorable tax treatment of these state plans, I am \npleased that Congress has achieved real reform over the past several \nyears.\n  In 1996, Congress took the first step in providing tax relief to \nfamilies investing in these programs. In the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996, I was able to include a provision that \nclarified the tax treatment of state-sponsored savings plans and the \nparticipants' investment. This measure put an end to the tax \nuncertainty that has hampered the effectiveness of these state-\nsponsored programs and helped families who are trying to save for their \nchildren's education.\n  In 1997, the Taxpayer Relief Act made revisions to provide increased \nflexibility to families saving for their children's college education. \nThe most significant reform was to expand the definition of ``qualified \neducation costs'' to include room and board, thus doubling the amount \nfamilies could save tax-free.\n  As a result of our actions over the last several years, more and more \nstate plans have implemented tuition savings and prepaid plans for \ntheir residents. It is projected that there will be 44 states with \ntuition savings plans by the year 2000. I believe that we have a real \nopportunity to go even further toward making college affordable to \nAmerican families. It is in our best interest as a nation to maintain a \nquality and affordable education system for everyone. By passing this \nlegislation, we can help families help themselves by rewarding savings. \nThis will reduce the cost of education and will not unnecessarily \nburden future generations with thousands of dollars in loans.\n  In addition to making savings in qualified State and private college \ntuition plans completely tax-free, this legislation makes a number of \nother changes that are essential to helping families afford a quality \neducation. Specifically, this legislation increases the contributions \nfor K-12 education savings accounts to help families meet the expenses \nof a primary education. This legislation creates incentives for \nemployer-provided educational assistance so that individuals can \ncontinue their education while working. This legislation also changes \nthe rules for interest deductions so that qualified education loans are \nmore affordable for students. Additionally, this legislation revises \nthe National Health Corps Scholarships Exclusion, increases the \narbitrage rebate exception on tax-exempt bonds, provides for private \nactivity bonds for qualified education facilities, and allows the \nFederal Home Loan Bank to guarantee school construction bonds. These \nimportant reforms are critical to helping families save for the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this valuable legislation this year \nto reward those who save in order to provide a college education for \ntheir children.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 30, 2000]\n\n                   Section 529 College Savings Plans \n                               Rate an A\n\n                         (By Jane Bryant Quinn)\n\n       If you haven't yet heard about state Section 529 savings \n     plans, listen up. They're a great way for parents or \n     grandparents to build a college fund.\n       These plans drip with income-tax and estate-tax breaks and \n     offer a potential for gain that older college plans can't \n     touch. Many top plans are open to residents of any state.\n       Until recently, 529s were marketed by the states themselves \n     or by two no-load mutual-fund groups--Fidelity and TIAA-\n     CREF--that some states have hired to manage their money.\n       Brokers and financial planners who work for commissions \n     weren't paid to sell 529s, so they steered your college money \n     somewhere else.\n       But now, two big brokerage firms are also in the game, \n     selling state 529 plans to a national clientele. Merrill \n     Lynch hitched up with Maine's NextGen program. Salomon Smith \n     Barney has Colorado's Scholars Choice plan and will soon \n     offer West Virginia's plan.\n       This creates an army of brokers prepared to tout this new \n     form of investing to the public. Commercial sales should help \n     get more people talking about 529s.\n       State 529 plans (the name refers to a section of the IRS \n     Code) were authorized by Congress in 1996. You can invest \n     lump sums or make regular monthly contributions. The plans \n     come in two forms:\n       A prepaid tuition plan. The conservative choice. These \n     plans guarantee that the money you save today will match the \n     growth in tuition inflation at state-run colleges. Currently, \n     that's an effective 3.4 percent return. You can also use the \n     money for tuition at out-of-state schools.\n       A college savings plan. Here, you contribute to an \n     investment pool that has the potential of rising faster than \n     the college inflation rate (although there's no guarantee). \n     You can use the money at any accredited school, for any \n     qualified education expense.\n       Savings plans are currently offered by 23 states, and nine \n     more are starting up this year. If your state doesn't have a \n     savings plan, or has one with unattractive features, you can \n     join one in another state.\n       A few states keep your money in bonds, but most provide a \n     mix of stocks and bonds. A typical 529 account leans heavily \n     toward stocks when the child is young, then moves \n     automatically toward safer bonds and money-market funds as \n     college draws near.\n       Some states give you a choice of accounts. Maine, for \n     example, offers four accounts--one of which is 100 percent \n     invested in stocks.\n       Under 529 rules, you can't switch your money from one \n     account to another within the plan. To diversify, you'd \n     contribute to more than one account, says Maine's treasurer, \n     Dale McCormick.\n       Here's the beauty of 529 plans. All the earnings accumulate \n     tax-deferred. When you take out the money for higher \n     education, it's taxed in your child's bracket, not yours.\n       Some states let you deduct your contribution on your state \n     tax return. Other states let your earnings pass tax-free.\n       The value of the plan is not included in your taxable \n     estate. But you still control the money, says certified \n     public accountant and 529 expert Joseph Hurley of Bonadio & \n     Co. in Pittsford, N.Y.\n       You can change the plan's beneficiary from one family \n     member to another (including an adult seeking further \n     education). You can even drop the plan and take your money \n     back.\n       If you spend 529 money on something other than higher \n     education, that withdrawal will be taxed in your bracket. \n     You'll also pay a penalty--typically 10 percent of earnings \n     (sometimes more).\n       ``A 10 percent penalty on earnings isn't bad,'' Hurley \n     says. ``If your account yielded 10 percent, you'd still net 9 \n     percent, pretax.''\n       Surprisingly, 529 savings plans detract little or nothing \n     from your child's potential financial-aid award. The money is \n     treated as belonging to the donor, not the student.\n       Hurley gives top marks to the plans in the following \n     states: Arkansas (1-877-422-6553), Colorado (1-800-478-5651), \n     Maine (1-877-563-9843), Missouri (1-888-414-6678), New \n     Hampshire (1-800-544-1722), Utah (1-800-418-2551) and \n     Virginia (888-567-0540). For his opinion of all the state \n     plans, visit savingforcollege.com.\n       The new edition of Hurley's book, ``The Best Way to Save \n     for College,'' is due at the end of this month ($25.95 \n     including shipping; order from savingforcollege.com or call \n     1-800-487-7624). It contains plan comparisons plus tax tips \n     that financial salespeople aren't likely to know.\n       For extended information on all the state plans, call the \n     National Association of State Treasurers at 1-877-277-6496 or \n     visit its Web site (www.collegesavings.org).\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I stand before you today to support S. \n1134, the Affordable Education Act. I have been a long time supporter \nof the Education Savings Account. I believe that ESA's can be a very \neffective tool in helping parents have an impact on their child's \neducation. The key to a child's education is parent involvement. As \nwell intentioned as we may be here in Washington, no amount of money or \nregulation can accomplish what a child's parents can. I have worked and \nwill continue to work to help provide parents the opportunity to have \nan increasing say in their child's education. I believe this bill will \nhelp to accomplish just that.\n  The changes this bill will make to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \nwill provide flexibility and choice to parents. Parents who earn less \nthan $95,000 a year can pay up to $2,000 a year per child into a tax \nexempt Education Savings Account. This is an increase of 400% from the \ncurrent limit. Under current law, money that is payed into ESA's is \nonly available to pay for higher education. This bill will make\n\n[[Page S924]]\n\nmoney payed into an ESA available for parents during the K-12 years of \neducation. This legislation gives parents the flexibility to use their \nmoney on anything from college tuition to books or computers if these \nsupplies are utilized in their child's education.\n  If parents would like to send their child to a private school this \nmoney will be available. Some will say that Education Savings Accounts \nwill just benefit the rich. I strongly disagree. This bill would move \nall parents who want to send their child to a private school $2,000 \ncloser to that goal. If parents want to keep their child in public \nschool they have their ESA available to pay for any additional fees or \nsupplies that would help educate their child.\n  Education is a crucial issue. In January and February I held 63 town \nmeetings in the state of Colorado where parents spoke with me first \nhand about their concerns with the education system. I receive many \nletters from parents sharing similar sentiments every week. They tell \nme they are having a difficult time paying extra fees to allow their \nchild to participate in extra curricular activities. Education Savings \nAccounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for activities \nthat help build character for students. They tell me that they are \nhaving to pay for school books that they cannot afford. Education \nSavings Accounts can help those parents set aside money to pay for the \nbooks that their child needs. They tell me that college is becoming too \nexpensive. Education Savings Accounts help parents set aside money to \npay for their child's college tuition so that they can graduate without \nworrying about having to pay off loans.\n  This bill also addresses other needs in the area of education. Local \ncommunities that pass tax-exempt bonds must pay the government the \narbitrage, or interest, that accrues on those bonds. The Affordable \nEducation Act increases the ceiling of eligibility for retaining bond \narbitrage from $10 million to $15 million. This provides more money for \nschool construction. Relief for graduate students is also included in \nthis bill. The sixty month limit on loan interest tax deduction for \ngraduate students is eliminated. This helps students who are unable to \npay off their loans in five years. Employers are also allowed to \nprovide up to $5,250 a year in tax exempt income to an employee \nattending college or graduate school for tuition assistance. Education \nSavings Accounts can be extended past the age of 18 for special \neducation students who may not start college at the age of 18 like \ntraditional students.\n  This bill will also provide a positive impact in other important \nareas. It provides tax relief which is very important to me and my \nconstituents by reducing taxable income for families with children. I \nbelieve it can also reduce juvenile crime by allowing parents to pay \nfor after school care for their child. This would allow children to be \ninvolved in activities during the time of day in which children are at \nthe greatest risk of misbehaving, the time between the end of the \nschool day and the end of the work day when many children are \nunsupervised.\n  We have an opportunity today to begin to work towards important \nreform of our education system. We have passed provisions similar to \nthis bill in the past only to see the President veto them. I hope we \ncan overcome this ``one-size-fits-all'' attitude towards education and \npass the Affordable Education Act. Lets put the control back in the \nhands of parents instead of bureaucrats. I strongly urge all my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Affordable Education Act is an \nimportant step toward returning to parents and communities the \nresources and responsibility to provide for their children's education, \nand expanding educational opportunities for millions of Americans of \nall ages.\n  As an original cosponsor of S. 14, the ``Education Savings Account \nand School Excellence Act'', portions of which are contained in this \nbill, I am strongly committed to strengthening and expanding education \nsavings accounts for American families. Families should be encouraged \nand given incentives to save more of their money for their children's \ncollege education, but also to set aside money to meet the unique needs \nof the children throughout their school years.\n  The Affordable Education Act expands the existing tax-preferred \nEducation Savings Accounts, which allow families to save for college \nexpenses, to include elementary and secondary educational costs. The \nbill also allows corporations and other entities, in addition to \nindividuals, to contribute to a child's ESA.\n  Under this bill, money saved in ESAs could be withdrawn tax-free to \npay for a child's educational expenses from kindergarten through high \nschool, not just college. Expanded ESA's could be used to hire a tutor \nfor a child who is struggling with math, or foreign language lessons to \nhelp a child become bilingual or multilingual. ESA savings could be \nused to purchase a home computer or give a child with dyslexia access \nto a special education teacher. Expanded ESA's will help parents \naddress their children's unique needs and concerns, and encourage their \nparticular abilities. Expanded ESA's can help ensure each child is \nprepared to succeed in higher education or employment.\n  This bill also contains several important initiatives to provide \ngreater access to higher education. It supports employer initiatives \noffering educational assistance to their employees by extending the tax \nexclusion for employer-paid undergraduate tuition and expanding the tax \nexclusion to also cover graduate-level courses. The bill helps make \ncollege more affordable by allowing private institutions to establish \nqualified pre-paid college tuition plans and allows certain tax-free \nwithdrawals from qualified State tuition plans.\n  Unfortunately, expansion of ESA's and the other provisions noted \nabove are only temporary in the bill before the Senate. Because these \nprograms are important tools for families struggling to pay for the \nchildren's college and other educational expenses, I believe these \ninitiatives should be made permanent.\n  Another important aspect of the bill is the new tax exclusion of \ncertain amounts received from the National Health Corps and Armed \nForces Health Professions Scholarship programs. Those who receive these \nscholarships will go on to provide medical and dental services in our \nnation's under-served areas as well as in military service.\n  The bill also authorizes the tax-exempt financing rules for school \nconstruction. Local communities can determine how to best use their \neducational resources--whether hiring new teachers, providing \nadditional classroom services, or constructing new schools. This bill \ngives communities a financial break if they choose to use some of their \nresources for new school construction, making it possible to accomplish \nmore with limited resources.\n  Finally, I note with approval that the bill contains several \nprovisions to close existing tax loopholes for special interests in \norder to balance the costs of these important education initiatives. I \nwould encourage the Senate to consider adding several more of these \ninequitable tax loopholes to the bill in order to make permanent the \nexpanded ESA's and other important education incentives in this bill.\n  Again, I reiterate my strong support for this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it. More important, I urge the President to \nconsider the importance of this legislation for expanding the \neducational opportunities of all Americans, and I urge him to sign this \nbill when it reaches his desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the nightmare of violence in our nation's \nschools has grabbed our attention once more. This morning, a first-\ngrade student was shot and killed by another first-grader at a Michigan \nelementary school. Our thoughts and prayers are with the young girl's \nfamily, with the young person who pulled the trigger, and with the \ntwenty other students in the classroom. Tragically, once again, the \nnotion of schools as a safe haven was shattered by the sound of \ngunfire, and we must now begin to face the formidable challenge of \nrebuilding that serene and tranquil school environment that each and \nevery student and teacher deserves.\n  This tragedy begs some very basic questions of our society.\n  First, and perhaps most importantly, what is a first-grader doing \nwith a loaded gun? A first-grader is six years old, maybe even seven. \nThese are merely babes with sweet young faces who have barely begun \ntheir lives. They are still putting baby teeth under their pillows \nawaiting a visit from the tooth fairy. How did this child get the \nweapon? And what on Earth possessed the child to bring it to school?\n  What has gone so wrong in our nation that students feel the need to \nbring weapons to the public school classroom? Do they think they have \nto show off for their friends? Do they feel the need for power? Surely \nnot a child in the first grade. Do they think that carrying a weapon to \nschool gives them greater stature? I know that we, as a nation, have \nbeen struggling with these questions for many, many months, but it is \ntime we started to reach some conclusions.\n  In the 315 days since the tragedy at Columbine High School, the \nviolence has not stopped. We have seen the same tragic scene of \nstudents and teachers pouring out of schools in fear in Atlanta. In the \nDistrict of Columbia, since this school year began in September, 15 \npublic school students have been killed. According to police, eight of \nthe fifteen slayings were precipitated by an argument in school and \nended in gunfire on a neighborhood street. For some reason that we \ncannot seem to get our arms around, our children continue to injure and \nkill one another.\n  Why in the world are we not concentrating on this? Why is the \nJuvenile Justice bill, which passed this Senate in May with common-\nsense weapons controls, still stalled? How many children have to die \nbefore this Congress sits up and takes notice? How many lives, so full \nof potential, have to be snuffed out: 15, 30, 50, 100?\n  We need to find out why these tragedies continue to occur, and we \nneed to find ways to stop it.\n  There will be a supplemental bill coming before this Senate soon \nwhich is intended to provide close to a billion dollars in aid for \nColombia. The White House calls this funding an emergency. I think we \nhave more than enough emergencies here on our home soil that demand \nurgent attention. It is time to get our priorities straight.\n  I understand that this is not something that Congress can do on its \nown, nor is it something that a local school board can accomplish by \nitself. Putting an end to school violence will take a concerted \neffort--from lawmakers to parents to students to clergy to community \nleaders. No one can be given a pass. We all share a responsibility to \ncome together, to look past any historical differences, and to work to \nfind real solutions that will put an end to these tragedies.\n  I only pray that we can.\n  My heart goes out to the family who must be stunned at the loss of \ntheir little girl. I can only imagine their suffering. All the \npotential in one tiny, small, little innocent life has been stolen in \nthe flash of a gun. I hope that this Congress, and I hope that the \nelectronic media, the Hollywood movie stars, the movie industry, and \nthe whole Nation, will finally commit to taking the difficult steps \nthat are needed to make sure something positive can come from such an \nincredible tragedy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S925-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S925-S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            KEEP OUR PROMISE TO AMERICA'S MILITARY RETIREES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in sponsoring, S. \n2003, the Keep Our Promise to America's Military Retirees Act of 2000. \nI am sponsoring this legislation because I believe it is necessary if \nwe are to fulfill our moral obligation to those who devoted their \ncareers to safeguarding our nation's people, our homes, and our way of \nlife.\n  The brave men and women of our armed forces literally put their lives \non the line for this country. We owe them a debt we can never repay. \nBut one thing we cannot do, in my opinion, is fail to live up to our \nexplicit promise that those who made military life their career would \nreceive, in return lifetime medical care. That is a promise we have \nmade; and it is a promise we must keep.\n  There has already been a great deal of discussion on this topic in \nthe Administration and the Congress. In the 1998 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, Congress expressed its sense that many retired \nmilitary personnel reasonably believed that they had been promised \nlifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more years of service. \nRecruiters for the uniformed services, as agents of the United States \ngovernment, had used recruiting tactics promising enrollees entering \nthe Armed Forces prior to June 7, 1956, that they would be entitled to \nfully paid lifetime health care upon retirement.\n  Unfortunately, prior to 1956, a statutory health care plan did not \nexist for our military personnel. Since the establishment of CHAMPUS, \nand its successor, Tricare, we have seen the erosion of space-available \nhealth care at military treatment facilities for military retirees. \nAdditionally, military health care has become increasingly difficult to \nobtain for military retirees as the Department of Defense reduces its \nhealth care infrastructure. As a result, military retiree's health care \nsituation is woefully inadequate compared to health care afforded to \nother federal employees. Today, military retirees remain the only \nFederal Government personnel who have been prevented from using their \nemployer-provided health care at or after 65 years of age. Military \nretirees deserve to have a health care program that is at least \ncomparable with that of retirees from civilian employment in the \nFederal Government.\n  In statements before this Congress, our distinguished Secretary of \nDefense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs have reiterated the importance \nof seeing to military retirees' health needs. According to Secretary \nCohen, the loudest complaints he hears while traveling concern the \nmilitary health care system.\n  I believe General Hugh Shelton expressed the correct response to \nthese complaints when he stated, ``I think that the first thing we need \nto do is make sure that we acknowledge our commitment to the retirees \nfor their years of service and for what we basically committed to at \nthe time they were recruited into the armed forces.''\n  It is morally imperative, that we keep our promise to the brave men \nand women who devoted their careers to protecting our country.\n  But we should also keep in mind that health care is not only a top \nissue for retirees; it is also a major source of dissatisfaction for \nactive duty personnel. As such it affects readiness, recruiting and \nretention. The availability of quality, lifetime health care is a \ncritical recruiting incentive for the all volunteer Armed Forces.\n  That incentive has been undermined by the declining services provided \nto military retirees. In its self-proclaimed ``Year of Health Care,'' \nthe Department of Defense had a major opportunity to  take the lead in \nkeeping commitments to service members and start erasing the skepticism \nand distrust that years of broken health care promises have engendered \namong the retired population. Putting these initiatives in the\n\n[[Page S926]]\n\nPresident's budget would have made them much easier to enact. But, once \nagain, the Administration has chosen to pass its moral responsibilities \nto the Congress.\n\n  For too long, this Administration has ignored the needs of the brave \nmen and women who have defended our interests and our shores. This is \nunfair. What is more, in my view it is unwise to ignore the well-being \nof military retirees.\n  Well-trained, properly motivated troops have been and continue to be \nthe single most important factor in protecting our national security. \nWithout them we will not be able to achieve and maintain military \nreadiness. We will not be able, as a nation, to fight and win. Under \ncurrent conditions we cannot expect to maintain the levels of re-\nenlistment, expertise and morale we need to maintain an effective \nmilitary force.\n  Last year this Congress took it upon itself to address the critical \nissue of unconscionably low military pay. I hope and believe that this \nyear we will address the no-less critical issue of unconscionably \ninadequate health care services for military retirees.\n  This Congress and the President must take action to address the \nproblems associated with the availability of health care for military \nretirees. Keeping this nation's promise and providing adequate health \ncare for military retirees is an issue whose time has come. Every day, \nin hundreds of locations all over the world, our soldiers, sailors and \nairmen willingly serve in defense of our national interest, promoting \npeace and prosperity around the globe.\n  We have asked for the greatest sacrifice from our military retirees \nand today's men and women in uniform--to give one's life in defense of \ntheir nation. When people put themselves in harm's way for their \ncountry, they should not have to worry about their families' access to \nproper health care.\n  We must act upon the sense of this Congress that the United States \nhas incurred a moral obligation to provide health care to former \nmembers of the Armed Forces who are entitled to retired or retainer pay \n(or its equivalent); and it is, therefore, necessary to provide \nquality, affordable health to such retirees.\n  For these reasons I am happy to join with Senators Coverdell, \nJohnson, and 13 fellow Senators in co-sponsoring the bipartisan Keep \nOur Promise to America's Military Retirees Act (S. 2003). This \nlegislation is key to re-establishing the morale, confidence and trust \nof our military retirees.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S926-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, during the Civil Rights movement, Dr. \nCarter G. Woodson's idea of a Negro History Week honoring the \nachievements of African Americans was extended to the entire month of \nFebruary.\n  I rise today as a Senator from the state with the largest population \nof African Americans in the United States to speak on behalf of this \nyear's Black History Month theme ``Heritage and Horizons.'' Harlem, New \nYork was the center of a 1930's Renaissance period. It attracted \naspiring individuals from across the country and the world. It is also \nthe birthplace of renowned African Americans who have excelled in the \nareas of politics and business, arts and entertainment, athletics and \nactivism.\n  Since the expansion of the Negro History Week to Black History Month, \ncountless African Americans continue to amass accomplishments and \nshatter barriers worthy of multiple months of tribute. Many of us know \nof the great strides made by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Frederick \nDouglas, Booker T. Washington, W. E. B. DuBois, Ida B. Wells, and Rosa \nParks. Many of the Members in this chamber have worked alongside \nShirley Chisholm, Thurgood Marshall Sr., Charles Rangel, Clifford \nAlexander, Jr., and Colin Powell.\n  African Americans from New York have been pioneers in many different \nfields. In 1981, Pam McAllister Johnson was named publisher of \nGannett's Ithaca (NY) Journal, making her the first African American \nwoman to head a general circulation newspaper in the United States. In \nJune 1995, Dr. Lonnie Bristow, a Harlem native, became the first \nAfrican American appointed as president of the American Medical \nAssociation. American Express announced in February 1997 that Kenneth \nChenault was named president and heir apparent to the position of CEO, \nmaking the Long Island native the highest-ranking African American \nexecutive in corporate America.\n  Art Hardwick, husband of Shirley Chisholm, won the 1962 State \nAssembly race becoming the first African American to represent Western \nNew York. In 1971, Carmel C. Marr became the first woman of any race to \nserve as Commissioner of the New York State Public Service Commission. \nHarry Belafonte, a Harlem native, was recently honored at the Grammy's \nfor his lifetime contributions as an actor and entertainer. Denzel \nWashington, born and raised in Mount Vernon, recently won a Golden \nGlobe for his role in the movie Hurricane. The critically acclaimed \nauthor of The Women of Brewster Place, Gloria Naylor, hails from \nQueens, New York.\n  In 1957, New York City native Althea Gibson was the first African \nAmerican woman to compete and win at the Wimbledon and Forest Hills. \nThe following year, she repeated as the Wimbledon and U.S. National \nTennis Champion. Former NBA coach and Brooklyn native, Lenny Wilkins, \nwas voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for holding the NBA record \nfor the most regular season victories by a coach.\n  Almost 70 years after the Renaissance began, New York continues to be \nthe place where African American innovators and pioneers distinguish \nthemselves, thereby continuing the Renaissance and enhancing our \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S926-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOMINATION OF GEORGE DANIELS\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the General \n     Assembly of the State of Iowa relative to appropriations for \n     the United States Naval Fleet and the United States Flag \n     Merchant Marine Fleet; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 108\n\n       Whereas, the continuing reduction of the United States \n     armed forces is dangerously straining the ability of the \n     United States to respond adequately to regional threats, with \n     the United States Naval Fleet shrinking from nearly 600 ships \n     in 1987 to less than 325 ships today; and\n       Whereas, the United States is currently building military \n     ships at half the rate needed to maintain even a modest \n     fleet, while the demands on the United States sea power \n     forces have increased significantly since the end of the Cold \n     War; and\n       Whereas, the United States is presently deploying its Navy \n     and Marines three times as often as the United States did \n     before the fall of the Soviet Union, while procuring fewer \n     ships than at anytime since 1932, with the current fleet \n     being the smallest since 1917; and\n       Whereas, the safety and economic prosperity of the United \n     States are tied to the political stability of every part of \n     the globe, and the United States faces a dangerous and \n     challenging situation where, as the only superpower, it has \n     an obligation to ensure that conflicts do not escalate into \n     major military or humanitarian disasters; and\n       Whereas, the United States has a different and far more \n     complex duty now than during the Cold War, and must be \n     prepared to deploy air and sea power as well as ground \n     troops, upon short notice; and\n       Whereas, because the United States has closed many military \n     bases in the past decade, only the Naval Fleet can transport \n     large numbers of Army and Air Force equipment, troops, and \n     supplies around the world to support military operations that \n     deal with threats to national security of the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, nations engaging in terrorist activities have vast \n     supplies of chemical and biological agents, with several \n     nations developing their own nuclear weapons; and\n       Whereas, the health of the economy of the United States \n     depends on international stability as vast markets for the \n     agricultural and manufactured products of the United States \n     and the world's investment markets are intertwined; now \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, the Senate \n     concurring, That the Iowa General Assembly requests that the \n     Congress of the United States, committed to the safety and \n     economic security of the United States, authorize and \n     appropriate sufficient funding to build at least 10 ships per \n     year for the next decade; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Iowa General Assembly call upon the \n     Presidential candidates to express their commitment to \n     rebuilding the United States Naval Fleet and the United \n     States Flag Merchant Marine Fleet; and be it further\n       Resolved, That official copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the President of the United States, the \n     President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     Iowa's congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S929-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S929-S930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst time and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as \nindicated:\n\n           By Mr. CLELAND :\n       S. 2113.

A bill to exempt certain entries of titanium disks from \nantidumping duties retroactively applied by the United States Customs \nService; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            legislation relating to a tariff classification\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation to correct a \ntechnical error made by the U.S. Customs Service, and exempt Waldron \nPacific from antidumping duties which were retroactively applied by \nCustoms to three import shipments of titanium. This bill is a companion \nto legislation introduced by Representative David Wu in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n  Waldron Pacific, a small business located in Lake Oswego, Oregon, is \na distributor of non-ferrous alloys, such as aluminum, zinc and brass, \nused in the die casting and foundry industries. With just two \nemployees, Waldron Pacific has been a very successful business \noperation.\n  When a customer of Waldron Pacific needed a certain type of titanium \nnot available in this country, the entrepreneurial Waldron Pacific \nfound a supplier outside the U.S., in Russia. Having no import \nexperience, but hearing of potential antidumping duties on certain \ntitanium products, Waldron Pacific sought a binding Classification \nRuling from Customs before importing the product. Customs' \nClassification Ruling indicated that the proper import duty was 15%, \nand Waldron Pacific began importing the product to fulfill the needs of \nits customer. After three shipments had been imported, Customs revoked \nits previous Classification Ruling and applied retroactively an \nadditional 85% antidumping duty on these shipments. The three shipments \nhad already been imported, delivered and paid for by Waldron Pacific's \ncustomer, leaving Waldron Pacific liable to pay $42,000 in unexpected \nduties.\n  Whether or not the product should be subject to the antidumping order \nis not at issue nor is that the matter addressed by this legislation. \nThe key point is that Waldron Pacific exercised due diligence in \nobtaining a Classification Ruling prior to importing the product, and \nrelied upon that Classification Ruling as a basis for importing and \nselling the product. Even the domestic producers who are protected by \nthe antidumping order agree that Waldron Pacific should not have to pay \nantidumping duties on these three shipments. Ironically, the \nantidumping order has since been repealed entirely. Providing Waldron \nPacific relief from Customs' mistake and subsequent attempt to \nretroactively apply a higher tariff is a question of basic fairness.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would correct this technical \nerror and exempt these import shipments from the unfair, retroactive \napplication of antidumping duties.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2114\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN ENTRIES OF TITANIUM DISKS.\n\n         (a) In General.--Notwithstanding section 514 of the \n     Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 15144) or any other provision \n     of law, the United States Customs Service shall--\n       (1) not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, liquidate or reliquidate the entries listed in \n     subsection (b) as exempt from antidumping duties under \n     antidumping case number A-462-103; and\n       (2) not later than 90 days after such liquidation or \n     reliquidation under paragraph (1), refund any antidumping \n     duties paid with respect to such entries, including interest \n     from the date of entry, if the importer of the entries files \n     a request therefor with the Customs Service within such 90-\n     day period.\n       (b) Entries.--The entries referred to in subsection (a) are \n     as follows:\n\n        Entry Number                                      Date of Entry\nEE1-0001115-8..........................................January 26, 1995\nEE1-0001313-9.............................................June 23, 1995\nEE1-0001449-1........................................September 25, 1995\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Wyden, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 2115. A bill to ensure adequate monitoring of the commitments made \nby the People's Republic of China in its accession to the World Trade \nOrganization and to create new procedures to ensure compliance with \nthose commitments; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             china-world trade organization compliance act\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the China WTO \nCompliance Act, along with Senators Murkowski, Bingaman, Akaka, Wyden, \nand Dorgan.\n\n  This bill is designed to ensure continuous and rigorous monitoring of \nChina's WTO commitments. It also provides new mechanisms in the \nCongress and in the Executive Branch to make sure that China complies \nwith those commitments.\n  Twenty years of negotiations with our Asian partners have \ndemonstrated that trade agreements are often not self-executing. This \nis just as true with China today as it has been with Japan over these \nlast two decades. The Congress and the Administration must both be \nresolutely committed to monitoring and enforcement. Only then do our \ntrade agreements succeed and bring the desired results. Inattention by \nthe United States leads to inaction\n\n[[Page S931]]\n\nby our trading partners. It leads to failure to achieve market opening \nobjectives.\n  This bill will make sure that future Congresses and future \nAdministrations, whether they are Democratic or Republican, will keep \ntrade agreement compliance permanently at the top of the agenda with \nChina. We must ensure that inattention never sets in. We must also \nensure that other elements in the bilateral relationship not be allowed \nto prevent the United States from gaining the maximum trade and \neconomic benefit from China's WTO promises.\n  Let me be clear that this bill is not designed to set conditions for \nthe Congressional vote on granting China Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations status, PNTR. Rather, this bill addresses one of the major \nconcerns that many in the Congress have. That is, China historical \nrecord in complying with bilateral trade agreements has been spotty. \nSo, how can we be confident that compliance with this agreement will be \nany better? I hope that enactment of this bill will provide some \nreassurance to Senators and House members in this regard. I urge my \nSenate colleagues to join me in approving this legislation.\n  Let me outline the main provisions of the China WTO Compliance Act.\n  First, monitoring. The President must submit a detailed plan to \nCongress for monitoring Chinese compliance three months after China \naccedes to the WTO. The plan must be updated yearly and include \ndetailed tasking responsibilities for each agency.\n  The General Accounting Office will be required annually to survey the \ntop 50 American firms in each of five different categories. Companies \nthat export non-agricultural goods to China. That export agricultural \ngoods to China. That provide services in China. That invest in China. \nAnd that import goods from China. The purpose of the survey is to \ndetermine if China is abiding by its WTO commitments. The survey will \nalso provide information about any problems confronted by those firms.\n  The International Trade Commission will report annually on United \nStates-China bilateral export and import statistics. They will also, as \nbest they can, seek to reconcile the different United States-source and \nChina-source statistics.\n  The second element in the bill deals with compliance. USTR must \nsubmit an annual report to Congress on China's compliance with its WTO \ncommitments. After analyzing this report, a majority vote of either the \nFinance Committee or the Ways and Means Committee would require USTR to \ninitiate a Section 301 investigation of Chinese practices that do not \nabide by China's WTO commitments. If USTR then determines that China is \nviolating any of those commitments, USTR shall initiate dispute \nsettlement action at the WTO, unless there exists another more \neffective action. USTR shall consult with the Congress and provide an \nexplanation of its action.\n  Going further, a majority vote of both the Finance Committee and the \nWays and Means Committee will require USTR to initiate immediately a \ncase under the dispute settlement mechanism of the WTO.\n  The bill also amends Section 301. It authorizes USTR to draw a \nnegative inference if a country being investigated does not cooperate \nin providing information. This has become a serious problem with some \nof our trading partners. A 301 investigation can bog down when a \ncountry with a non-transparent trading regime refuses to provide \ndetailed information. This provision provides an incentive for \ncooperation.\n  Third, the bill calls for a special WTO review of China. It is the \nSense of the Congress that there should be a special multilateral \nprocess at the WTO for a thorough and comprehensive annual review of \nChinese compliance. The bill directs USTR to propose that the Trade \nPolicy Review Mechanism, the TPRM, at the WTO execute such a review of \nChina's trade policies every year. It also directs USTR to take \nmeasures to improve the TPRM process.\n  Finally, institution-building in China. Coming out of half a century \nof communism, China does not have the institutions necessary to carry \nout fully its WTO obligations. This bill requires the President to \nsubmit a plan to provide assistance to China to build those \ninstitutions necessary to fulfill the obligations China has made as \npart of its accession to the WTO. The bill expresses the sense of the \nCongress that the United States should provide such assistance through \nbilateral mechanisms, in particular, through appropriate non-\ngovernmental organizations. It also provides for the possibility of \nsome multilateral assistance under the auspices of the WTO.\n  Finally, because a primary beneficiary of the results of successful \ninstitution-building in China would be American business, efforts shall \nbe made to develop cost-sharing with the private sector.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the need to ensure full Chinese \ncompliance with its WTO commitments. This bill is an attempt to \nestablish a system that will do just that. We need this legislation. \nAnd we need to pass PNTR as soon as possible.\n  Let me conclude with a few remarks about Chinese compliance with the \nAgricultural Cooperation Agreement, which went into effect in December. \nThree weeks ago, I initiated a letter signed by 53 Senators to Chinese \nPresident Jiang Zemin. In the letter, we insisted that China proceed \nwith full and immediate implementation of that agreement. I was pleased \nto announce on Monday the first purchase by China under this agreement. \n50,000 metric tons of Pacific Northwest wheat. This is an important \nstep that should be followed by other agricultural purchases.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nintroduced today by the distinguished Senators from Montana (Mr. \nBaucus) and Alaska (Mr. Murkowski) entitled the ``China-World Trade \nOrganization Compliance Act.''\n  Last November, the United States and China announced that a bilateral \nagreement had been reached on China's accession to the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO). The agreement covers all agricultural products, \nindustrial goods, and service areas. It promises to open up the Chinese \nmarket to American exports and American investment.\n  Nevertheless, many Americans are hesitant at embracing this accord. \nPart of their concern is over the requirement that in order for the \nUnited States to benefit fully from this agreement. Congress will have \nto pass legislation granting permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) \nstatus to China. Previously known as Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) trading \nstatus, NTR has been subject to an annual renewal vote each year in the \nCongress. This yearly vote has allowed for a full airing of American \nconcerns over relations with China--relations which remain contentious \nto this day because of the Chinese government's human rights behavior, \nproliferation activities, trade policy, and relations with its \nneighbors, most especially Taiwan.\n  I cannot predict the result of the vote later this year on granting \nChina permanent NTR.\n  I do know that a Congressional vote against China will not \nnecessarily prevent China from joining the WTO if it concludes \nsuccessfully its accession agreements with other WTO members. China \nstill has to resolve issues with the European Union and then have its \naccession approved by the WTO General Council/Ministerial Conference. \nBut I think it is reasonable to assume that later this year China will \njoin the WTO whether or not the United States grants permanent NTR.\n  In light of this possibility, the legislation proposed today by my \ncolleagues, and which I am pleased to cosponsor, is a reasonable and \nprudent step to take in order to ensure that the agreements which China \ncommits to in joining the WTO are ones which China will fulfill.\n  The history of Chinese compliance with international agreements has \nnot been as good as it should be. In particular, China has not \nsuccessfully implemented the commitments it made in March 1995 to \nprotect American intellectual property rights. Intellectual piracy \nremains a major threat to the American music, cinema, and computer \nsoftware industries. The Chinese government has demonstrated an \nimpressive ability to arrest and intimidate massive numbers of Falun \nGong followers but seems unable to locate factories mass producing \nthousands of counterfeit CDs, videos, and computer software. Clearly, \nwhere there is a will, there is a way for the Chinese government.\n\n[[Page S932]]\n\n  In addition, the Chinese government has proven itself very adept at \nprotecting its domestic market from foreign goods and investment, \ndevising formal and informal barriers to trade. The concept of \ntransparency in Chinese trade law leaves much to be desired. An October \n1992 market access agreement between the United States and China has \nyet to be fully implemented with China eliminating some barriers while \nimposing new ones.\n  The pattern of past Chinese behavior to international trading \nagreements suggest that we must be vigilant in ensuring compliance with \nthe WTO accession agreement.\n  The legislation we offer today is a significant step towards ensuring \nthat China's promises are fulfilled. The bill establishes a process \nwithin the United States government for monitoring Chinese compliance \nwith its WTO commitments. The monitoring would occur regardless of \nwhether or not the United States grants permanent NTR to China, \nalthough surely it would have more effect if we do grant this to China.\n  We have lacked a process, and an agency, within the United States \ngovernment with the mandate, the expertise, institutional memory, and \nthe resources to ensure that the promise of bilateral and multilateral \ntrade agreements are fulfilled. This legislation is a major step in \nstarting the debate on how to ensure that promises made are promises \nkept.\n  As ranking member of the International Security, Proliferation And \nFederal Services Subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nam keenly interested in the implications of the legislation for the \norganization of our government's trade agencies. There are several \nareas where I would like to work with the legislation's authors to \nrefine their proposal. I believe that it might be appropriate to \ndesignate the United States Trade Representative's Office as the lead \nagency working with other agencies to monitor compliance. I intend to \nstudy further the best means for ensuring the effectiveness of this \nlegislation.\n  I believe it also important that public participation in commenting \non China's compliance should not be limited to business groups but \ninclude environmental, labor, and human rights organizations. The \nclimate affecting the world economy is not solely determined by the \nfinancial bottom line.\n  This legislation is an important step towards a trade environment \nwhich benefits the many, not the few, and I am pleased to cosponsor it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2116. A bill to amend title II of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act of 1965 to support teacher corps programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                             teacher corps\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if there is one thing we all can \nagree on in education, it is that teacher quality is absolutely \ncritical to how well children learn. Yet, the nation confronts one of \nthe worst teacher shortages in history. With expanding enrollment, \ndecreasing class size and one third of the nation's teachers nearing \nretirement age, public schools will need to hire as many as 2.2 million \nteachers over the next decade.\n  The need is greatest in specific subject areas such as mathematics, \nscience, special education and bilingual education, all important \nsubjects if the nation is to have an educated work force to keep it \ncompetitive in the world marketplace.\n  Need is also greatest in specific geographical areas such as the \ninner city and rural areas. Ironically, it is the most educationally \nand socio-economically disadvantaged students that are under served. If \nthere is one action we can take guaranteed to help struggling schools \nand children, it is to provide states and school districts the means to \nensure that there is a highly qualified teacher in every classroom.\n  My legislation, Teacher Corps, which I am proud to introduce today \nwith my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Schumer, who for so long have \nfought to bring the best possible educational opportunities to all of \nAmerica's children, is designed to do just that. Its components are \nbased on a definite need and sound research concerning effective \nmechanisms for meeting that need.\n  Teacher Corps would fund collaboratives between state education \nagencies, local education agencies and institutions of higher \neducation.\n  The collaboratives would recruit top ranked college students and \nqualified mid career individuals, who have not yet been trained as \nteachers, to teach in the nation's poorest schools in the areas of \ngreatest need--both geographically and academically. Districts and \nuniversities would work together to only recruit candidates who have an \nacademic major or extensive and substantive professional experience in \nthe subject in which they will teach.\n  The collaboratives would provide recruits a tuition free alternative \nroute to certification which includes intensive study and a teaching \ninternship. The internship would include mentoring, co-teaching and \nadvanced course work in pedagogy, state standards, technology and other \nareas.\n  After the internship period, the collaboratives would offer \nindividualized follow up training and mentoring in the first two years \nof full time teaching.\n  Corps members that become certified will be given priority in hiring \nwithin that district in exchange for a commitment to teach in low \nincome schools for 3 years.\n  A good teacher can mean the world to any child whether it is through \ncaring or through providing children with the skills they need to open \ntheir own doors to the future. Every time I enter schools in Minnesota, \nI am in awe of teachers' work.\n  That is why it is so tragic to think that there are so many children \nthat do not have access to qualified teachers, at the same time that \nmany people interested in teaching are either not entering the \nprofession or are not staying there once they have qualified.\n  Teacher Corps will help meet the growing need for teachers in low \nincome urban and rural schools, and in high need subject areas such as \nmath, science, bilingual and special education.\n  It will do so because Teacher Corps is rooted in three fundamental \nparts. Recruitment, retention and innovative, flexible, high quality \ntraining programs for college graduates and mid-career professionals \nwho want to teach in high need areas.\n  The first principle is recruitment. As I mentioned before, we may \nneed to hire as many as 2.2 million new teachers in the next decade to \nensure that there are enough teachers in our schools. But, overall \nquantity is not the only issue. Quality and shortages in specific \ngeographic and curriculum areas are equally critical. While there are \nteacher surpluses in some areas, certain states and cities are facing \nacute teacher shortages. In California, 1 out of every 10 teachers \nlacks proper credentials. 58 percent of new hires in Los Angeles are \nnot certified.\n  There are also crucial shortages in some subject areas such as math, \nscience, bilingual and special education. In my home state of \nMinnesota, 90 percent of principals report a serious shortage of strong \ncandidates in at least one curriculum area. 54 percent of the \nmathematics teachers in the state of Idaho and 48 percent of the \nscience teachers in Florida and Tennessee did not major in the subject \nof their primary assignment.\n  Teacher Corps would meet this need because it would recruit and train \nthousands of high quality teachers into the field to meet the specific \nteaching needs of local school districts.\n  It would recruit and train top college students and mid-career \nprofessionals from around the country, who increasingly want to enter \nthe teaching profession.\n  More college students want to enter teaching today than have wanted \nto join the profession in the past 30 years. According to a recent UCLA \nsurvey, over 10 percent of all freshman say they want to teach in \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  Second, the design of the program ensures that the needs of local \nschool districts will be considered so that only those candidates who \nmeet the specific needs of that district will be recruited and trained. \nIf, for example, there is a shortage of special education, bilingual, \nmath and science teachers in a particular district, Teacher Corps\n\n[[Page S933]]\n\nwould only train people with those skills. In setting up collaboratives \nin this way, teacher corps helps avoid the overproduction of candidates \nin areas where they are not needed.\n  Finally, Teacher Corps gives priority to high need rural, inner \nsuburban and urban districts to ensure that new teachers will enter \nwhere they are needed most.\n  However, it does not help to recruit teachers into high need schools \nand train them if we cannot retain them in the profession. Teaching is \none of the hardest, most important jobs there is. We ask teachers to \nprepare our children for adulthood. We ask them to educate our children \nso that they may be productive members of society. We entrust them with \nour children's minds and with their future. It is a disgrace how little \nsupport we give them in return. It is no surprise that one of the major \ncauses of our teacher shortage is that teachers decide to change \nprofessions before retirement. 73 percent of Minnesota teachers who \nleave the profession, leave for reasons other than retirement. In urban \nschools, 50 percent of teachers leave the field within five years of \nwhen they start teaching.\n  To retain high quality teachers in the profession, we must \ngive teachers the support they deserve. Teachers, like doctors need \nmonitoring and support during the first years of their professional \nlife. Teacher Corps offers new teachers the training, monitoring and \nsupport they need to meet the profession's many challenges. It includes \nmethods of support that have proven effective in ensuring that teachers \nstay in schools. The key elements for effective teacher retention were \nlaid out by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future in \n1996. Effective programs organize professional development around \nstandards for teachers and students; provide a year long, pre-service \ninternship; include mentoring and strong evaluation of teacher skills; \noffer stable, high quality professional development.\n\n  Each of these criteria are included in the Teacher Corps program.\n  Further, Teacher Corps supports people who choose teaching by paying \nfor their training. Through this financial and professional support, \nTeacher Corps will go a long way toward keeping recruits in teaching.\n  But, it is still not enough to recruit and retain teachers. Quality \nmust be of primary importance. Research shows that the most important \npredictor of student success is not income, but the quality of the \nteacher. Despite this need, studies show that as the level of students \nof color and students from low-income families increases in schools, \nthe test scores of teachers declines.\n  This is wrong. We are denying children from low-income areas, from \nracial minorities, with limited English proficiency, access to what we \nknow works. Several studies have shown that if poor and minority \nstudents are taught by high quality teachers at the same rate as other \nstudents, a large part of the gap between poor and minority students \nand their more affluent white counterparts would disappear. For \nexample, one Alabama study shows that an increase of one standard \ndeviation in teacher test scores leads to a two-thirds reduction in the \ngap between black/white tests scores.\n  We can not turn our back on this knowledge. We must act on it. We \nmust give low income, minority and limited English proficiency children \nthe same opportunities that all children have and we must do it now.\n  The very essence of Teacher Corps is to funnel high quality teachers \nwhere they are needed most. Teacher Corps would help ensure quality by \nusing a selective, competitive recruitment process. It would provide \nhigh quality training, professional development, monitoring and \nevaluations of corps member performance, all of which have been proven \nto increase the quality of the teaching force and the achievement of \nthe students they teach.\n  Further, by creating strong connections between universities and \ndistricts and by implementing effective professional development \nprojects within districts, we are setting up powerful structures to \nbenefit all teachers and students.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity to do what we know works to \nhelp children who need our help most. Good teachers have an \nextraordinary impact on children's lives and learning. We need to be \nsure that all children have access to such teachers and all children \nhave the opportunity to learn so that all children may take advantage \nof the many opportunities this country provides.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 2117. A bill to amend title 9, United States Code, with respect to \nconsumer credit transaction; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I introduce the Consumer \nCredit Fair Dispute Resolution Act of 2000, a bill that will protect \nand preserve American consumers' right to take their disputes with \ncreditors to court. This bill is identical to an amendment that I \noffered recently to the bankruptcy reform bill.\n  In recent years, credit card companies and consumer credit lenders \nare increasingly requiring their customers to use binding arbitration \nwhen a dispute arises. Consumers are barred by contract from taking a \ndispute to court, even small claims court. While arbitration can be an \nefficient tool to settle claims, it is credible and effective only when \nconsumers enter into it knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily. \nUnfortunately, that's not happening in the credit card and consumer \ncredit lending arenas.\n  One of the most fundamental principles of our justice system is the \nconstitutional right to take a dispute to court. Indeed, all Americans \nhave the right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. The \nright to a jury trial in criminal cases is contained in the Sixth \nAmendment to the Constitution. The right to a jury trial in civil cases \nis contained in the Seventh Amendment, which provides ``In Suits at \ncommon law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, \nthe right of trial by jury shall be preserved. . . .''\n  Some argue that Americans are over-using the courts. Court dockets \nacross the country are congested with civil cases. In part as a \nresponse to these concerns, various ways to resolve disputes have been \ndeveloped, short of going to court. Alternatives to court litigation \nare collectively known as alternative dispute resolution, or ADR. ADR \nincludes mediation and arbitration. Mediation and arbitration are often \nefficient ways to resolve disputes because the parties can have their \ncase heard well before they would have received a trial date in court.\n  Mediation is conducted by a neutral third party--the mediator--who \nmeets with the opposing parties to help them find a mutually \nsatisfactory solution. Unlike a judge in a courtroom, the mediator has \nno power to impose a solution. No formal rules of evidence or procedure \ncontrol mediation; the mediator and the parties mutually agree on the \nbest way to proceed.\n  Arbitration also involves a third party--an arbitrator or arbitration \npanel. Unlike mediation but similar to a court proceeding, the \narbitrator issues a decision after reviewing the arguments by all \nparties. Arbitration uses rules of evidence and procedure, although it \nmay use rules that are simpler or more flexible than the evidentiary \nand procedural rules that the parties would follow in a court \nproceeding.\n  Arbitration can be either binding or non-binding. Non-binding \narbitration means that the decision issued by the arbitrator or \narbitration panel takes effect only if the parties agree to it after \nthey know what the decision is. In binding arbitration, parties agree \nin advance to accept and abide by the decision, whatever it is.\n  Some contracts contain clauses that require arbitration to be used to \nresolve disputes that arise after the contract is signed. This is \ncalled ``mandatory arbitration.'' This means that if there is a \ndispute, the complaining party cannot file suit in court and instead is \nrequired to pursue arbitration. ``Mandatory, binding arbitration'' \ntherefore means that under the contract, the parties must use \narbitration to resolve a future disagreement and the decision of the \narbitrator or arbitration panel is final. The parties have no ability \nto seek relief in court or through mediation. In fact, if they are not \nsatisfied with the arbitration outcome, they are probably stuck with \nthe decision.\n\n[[Page S934]]\n\n  Under mandatory, binding arbitration, even if a party believes that \nthe arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow the law, the \nparty cannot file a suit in court. The only basis for challenging a \nbinding arbitration decision is if there is reason to believe that the \narbitrator committed actual fraud. In contrast, if a dispute is \nresolved by a court, the parties can potentially pursue an appeal of \nthe lower court's decision.\n  Mr. President, because mandatory, binding arbitration is so \nconclusive, it can be a credible means of dispute resolution only when \nall parties understand the full ramifications of agreeing to it.\n  But that's not what's happening in a variety of contexts--from motor \nvehicle franchise agreements, to employment agreements, to credit card \nagreements. I'm proud to have sponsored legislation addressing \nemployment agreements and motor vehicle franchise agreements. In fact, \nI am the original cosponsor with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Grassley, of S. 1020, which would prohibit the unilateral \nimposition of mandatory, binding arbitration in motor vehicle \ndealership agreements with manufacturers. Many of our colleagues have \njoined us as cosponsors.\n  Similar to the problem in the motor vehicle dealership franchise \ncontext, there is a growing, menacing trend of credit card companies \nand consumer credit lenders inserting mandatory, binding arbitration \nclauses in agreements with consumers. Companies like First USA Bank, \nAmerican Express and Green Tree Discount Company unilaterally insert \nmandatory, binding arbitration clauses in their agreements with \nconsumers, often without the consumer's knowledge or consent.\n\n  The most common way credit card companies have done this is through \nthe use of a ``bill stuffer.'' Bill stuffers are the advertisements and \nother materials that credit card companies insert into envelopes with \ntheir customers' monthly statements. Some credit card issuers like \nAmerican Express have placed fine print mandatory arbitration clauses \nin bill stuffers. The arbitration provision is usually buried in fine \nprint in a mailing that includes a bill and various advertising \nmaterials. It is often described in a lengthy legal document that most \nconsumers probably don't even skim, much less read carefully.\n  American Express issued its mandatory arbitration provision last \nyear. It took effect on June 1st. So, if you're an American Express \ncardholder and you have a dispute with American Express, as of June \n1999, you can't take your claim to court, even small claims court. You \nare bound to use arbitration, and you are bound to the final \narbitration decision. In this case, you are also bound to use an \narbitration organization selected by American Express, the National \nArbitration Forum.\n  American Express isn't the only credit card company imposing \nmandatory arbitration on its customers. First USA Bank, the largest \nissuer of Visa cards, with 58 million customers, has been doing the \nsame thing since 1997. First USA also alerted its cardholders with a \nbill stuffer, containing a condensed set of terms and conditions in \nfine print. The cardholder, by virtue of continuing to use the First \nUSA card, gave up the right to go to court, even small claims court, to \nresolve a dispute.\n  Mr. President, this growing practice extends beyond credit cards into \nthe consumer loan industry. Consumer credit lenders like Green Tree \nConsumer Discount Company are inserting mandatory, binding arbitration \nclauses in their loan agreements. The problem is that these loan \nagreements are usually adhesion contracts, which means that consumers \nmust either sign the agreement as is, or forego a loan. In other words, \nconsumers lack the bargaining power to have the clause removed. More \nimportantly, when signing on the dotted line of the loan agreement, \nconsumers may not even understand what mandatory arbitration means. In \nall likelihood, they do not understand that they have just signed away \na right to go to court to resolve a dispute with the lender.\n  It might be argued that if consumers are not pleased with being \nsubjected to a mandatory arbitration clause, they can cancel their \ncredit card, or not execute on their loan agreement, and take their \nbusiness elsewhere. Unfortunately, that's easier said than done. As I \nmentioned, First USA Bank, the nation's largest Visa card issuer, is \npart of this questionable practice. In fact, the practice is becoming \nso pervasive that consumers may soon no longer have an alternative, \nunless they forego use of a credit card or a consumer loan entirely. \nConsumers should not be forced to make that choice.\n  Companies like First USA, American Express and Green Tree argue that \nthey rely on mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes faster and \ncheaper than court litigation. The claim may be resolved faster but is \nit really cheaper? Is it as fair as a court of law? I don't think so. \nArbitration organizations often charge exorbitant fees to the consumer \nwho brings a dispute--often an initial filing fee plus hourly fees to \nthe arbitrator or arbitrators involved in the case. These costs can be \nmuch higher than bringing the matter to small claims court and paying a \ncourt filing fee.\n  For example, the National Arbitration Forum, the arbitration entity \nof choice for American Express and First USA charges fees that are \nlikely greater than if the consumer brought a dispute in small claims \ncourt. For a claim of less than $1,000, the National Arbitration Forum \ncharges the consumer a $49 filing fee. In contrast, a consumer can \nbring the same claim to small claims court here in the District of \nColumbia for a filing fee of no more than $10. In other words, the \nconsumer pays a fee to the National Arbitration Forum that is nearly \nfive times more than the fee for filing a case in small claims court.\n  That's bad enough, but some other arbitration firms are even more \nexpensive. The American Arbitration Association charges a $500 filing \nfee for claims of less than $10,000, or more if the claim exceeds \n$10,000, and a minimum filing fee of $2,000 if the case involves three \nor more arbitrators. In addition to the filing fee, it also charges a \nhearing fee for holding hearings other than the initial hearing--$150 \nto be paid by each party for each day of hearings before a single \narbitrator, or $250 if the hearing is held before an arbitration panel. \nThe International Chamber of Commerce requires a $2,500 administrative \nfee plus an arbitrator's fee of at least $2,500, if the claim is less \nthan $50,000. These fees are greater if the claim exceeds $50,000. The \nfees could very well be greater than the consumer's claim. So, as you \ncan see, a consumer's claim is not necessarily resolved more \nefficiently with arbitration. It is resolved either at greater cost to \nthe consumer or not at all, if the consumer cannot afford the costs, or \nthe costs outweigh the amount in dispute.\n  Another significant problem with mandatory, binding arbitration is \nthat the lender gets to decide in advance who the arbitrator will be. \nIn the case of American Express and First USA, they have chosen the \nNational Arbitration Forum. All credit card disputes with consumers \ninvolving American Express or First USA are handled by that entity. \nThere would seem to be a significant danger that this would result in \nan advantage for the lenders who are ``repeat players.'' After all, if \nthe National Arbitration Forum develops a pattern of reaching decisions \nthat favor cardholders, American Express or First USA may very well \ndecide to take their arbitration business elsewhere. A system where the \narbitrator has a financial interest in reaching an outcome that favors \nthe credit card company is not a fair alternative dispute resolution \nsystem.\n  There has been one important court decision on the enforceability of \nmandatory arbitration provisions in credit card agreements. The case \narose out of a mandatory arbitration provision announced in mailings to \nBank of America credit card and deposit account holders. In 1998, the \nCalifornia Court of Appeals ruled that the mandatory arbitration \nclauses unilaterally imposed on the Bank's customers were invalid and \nunenforceable. The California Supreme Court refused to review the \ndecision of the lower court. As a result, credit card companies in \nCalifornia cannot invoke mandatory arbitration in their disputes with \ncustomers. In fact, the American Express bill stuffer notes that the \nmandatory, binding arbitration provision will not apply to California \nresidents until further notice from the company. The California \nappellate court decision was wise and\n\n[[Page S935]]\n\nwell-reasoned, but consumers in other states cannot be sure that all \ncourts will reach the same conclusion.\n  My bill extends the wisdom of the California appellate decision to \nevery credit cardholder and consumer loan borrower. It amends the \nFederal Arbitration Act to invalidate mandatory, binding arbitration \nprovisions in consumer credit agreements. Now, let me be clear. I \nbelieve that arbitration can be a fair and efficient way to settle \ndisputes. I agree we ought to encourage alternative dispute resolution. \nBut I also believe that arbitration is a fair way to settle disputes \nbetween consumers and lenders only when it is entered into knowingly \nand voluntarily by both parties to the dispute after the dispute has \narisen. Pre-dispute agreements to take disputes to arbitration cannot \nbe voluntary and knowing in the consumer lending context because the \nbargaining power of the parties is so unequal. My bill does not \nprohibit arbitration of consumer credit transactions. It merely \nprohibits mandatory, binding arbitration provisions in consumer credit \nagreements.\n  Credit card companies and consumer credit lenders are increasingly \nslamming the courthouse doors shut on consumers, often unbeknownst to \nthem. This is grossly unjust. We need to restore fairness to the \nresolution of consumer credit disputes. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Consumer Credit Fair Dispute Resolution Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nreauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) \nand am pleased to be introducing five bills that will benefit teachers \nand students all across this Nation. Collectively, these measures \ncreate a package of fundamental reform to the ESEA bill. These pieces \nof legislation complement existing programs that have proven to work \nsuccessfully in schools and they provide assistance and support in \nareas where educators have expressed the greatest need. And these \nmeasures represent my commitment to improving the quality of education \nso that all of our children can achieve their greatest potential.\n\n  First, I am introducing a measure to strengthen the Federal Impact \nAid program. Specifically, my bill, which is supported by the National \nAssociation of Federally Impacted Schools, recommends increasing the \nweighted Federal student units for off-base military children and for \ncivilian dependent children. Knowing that Impact Aid funds help 1.6 \nmillion federally-connected children, as well as 1,600 school districts \nserving over 17 million students, I am confident that my colleagues in \nthe Senate support increases in funding for the Impact Aid program. But \nsome of them may not be familiar with the formulas by which these funds \nare distributed to schools. Changing the computation of repayment will \nassure that funds will be distributed in a more equitable manner, \nreflecting the composition of local education agencies.\n  The simple changes, which I am proposing, will benefit children in \nschools where the loss of local property taxes due to a large Federal \npresence has placed an extra burden on local taxpayers. We must make up \nthe difference for all the children in the Impact Aid program, not just \na select few.\n  The second bill that I am proposing would build on the strong \neducational technology infrastructure already in place in school \ndistricts in nearly every state. As you know, education technology can \nsignificantly improve student achievement. Congress has recognized this \nfact by continually voting to dramatically increase funding for \neducation technology. In fact, in just the programs under ESEA, federal \nsupport has grown from $52.6 million in Fiscal Year 1995, to $698 \nmillion just four years later.\n  But we need to do more than simply place computers in classrooms. We \nneed to provide our educators with the skills they need to incorporate \nevolving educational technology in the classroom. My bill does exactly \nthat. It will encourage states to develop and implement professional \ndevelopment programs that train teachers in the use of technology in \nthe classroom. Effective teaching strategies must incorporate \neducational technology if we are to ensure that all children have the \nskills they need to compete in a high-tech workplace. An investment in \nprofessional development for our teachers is an investment in our \nchildren and our future.\n\n  Third, continuing on the lines of professional development, I am \nintroducing a bill that outlines the essential components of mentoring \nprograms that would improve the experience of new teachers and reduce \nthe high turn-over currently seen among beginning teachers. My \nlegislation will ensure program quality and accountability by providing \nthat teachers mentor their peers who teach the same subject. The \nmentoring programs that are created in this legislation must comply \nwith state standards. Additionally, the bill will provide incentives, \nand grant states the flexibility to create alternative teacher \ncertification and licensure programs, to recruit well-educated and \ntalented people into the teacher profession.\n  The recruitment and retention of good teachers is paramount to \nimproving our national education system. Mentor programs provide \nteachers with the support of a senior colleague. And under the \nsupervision and guidance of a colleague, teachers are able to develop \nskills and achieve a higher level of proficiency. The confidence and \nexperience gained during this time will improve the quality of \ninstruction, which in turn will improve overall student achievement.\n  Fourth, attracting and retaining quality teachers is a difficult \ntask, especially in rural impoverished areas. As a result, teacher \nshortages and high turnover are commonplace in rural\n\n[[Page S936]]\n\ncommunities in almost every state in the nation. The fourth education \nbill I am introducing today would allow the Secretary of Education to \ndirect a portion of the general funds in ESEA to rural impoverished \nareas. Under this proposal, a needy rural school district could prevent \nthe exodus of qualified teachers by first creating incentive programs \nto retain teachers; second, improve the quality of the teacher through \nenhanced professional development; and, third, hire new teachers. This \nbill recognizes the unique challenges facing rural school districts and \nallows them the option of addressing these challenges.\n  The final bill, is the only one being introduced today with an \nauthorization for appropriation. It makes Federal grant programs more \nflexible in order to help school districts in rural communities. Under \nthis provision, districts would be able to combine the funds from \nspecified programs and use the money to support local or statewide \neducation reform efforts intended to improve the achievement of \nelementary school and secondary school students and the quality of \ninstruction provided. This measure asks for an authorization of $125 \nmillion for small rural and poor rural schools--a small price that \ncould produce large results.\n  The goal of these bills, which I have briefly outlined, are \nthreehold: 1) to provide teachers with the tools to grow as \nprofessionals; 2) to assist rural school districts so that they may \ncompete competitively with other school districts that oftentimes have \nmore money and resources; and, (3) to provide every child with \nunsurpassed education opportunities. Together, these are the keys to \nour children's success.\n\n  In reauthorizing ESEA, Congress has an extraordinary opportunity to \nchange the course of education. We must embrace this opportunity by \nsupporting creative and innovative reform proposals, like the ones that \nI have introduced here today. I am committed to working in the best \ninterest of our children to develop an education system that is the \nbest in the world. These bills move us in the right direction and I \nhope my colleagues will join me in supporting these measures. I urge \nthe Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to \nincorporate these provisions into the upcoming ESEA bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Lott, Mr. \n        Breaux, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2123. A bill to provide Outer Continental Shelf Impact assistance \nto State and local governments, to amend the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act of 1965, the Urban Park and Recreation Recovery \nAct of 1978, and the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly \nreferred to as the Pittman-Robertson Act) to establish a fund to meet \nthe outdoor conservation and recreation needs of the American people, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n               conservation and reinvestment act of 1999\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, on Thursday February 17th, the House \nResources Committee filed their report on a historic piece of \nlegislation, the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, H.R. 701 which \nwould reinvest a portion of offshore oil and gas revenues in coastal \nconservation and impact assistance programs,the Land and Water \nConservation Fund, wildlife conservation, historic treasures and \noutdoor recreation. This remarkable compromise was developed by \nCongressmen Don Young, George Miller, Billy Tauzin, John Dingell, Chris \nJohn, Bruce Vento, and Tom Udall and was passed by the House Resources \nCommittee by a vote of 37-12 on November 10, 1999. To date, the bill \nhas accumulated over 300 co-sponsors. Hopefully, this legislation will \nbe considered by the full House sometime this Spring.\n  The H.R. 701 compromise is a companion to the Senate version of the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act, S. 25. Today I would like to \nacknowledge the remarkable work done by Mr. Young, Mr. Miller, Mr. \nTauzin, Mr. Dingell, Mr. John, Mr. Vento, and Mr. Udall as I, along \nwith Senators Murkowski, Lott, Breaux and Feinstein introduce the H.R. \n701 compromise in the Senate. While I would like to take a moment to \nnote that there are some provisions of S. 25 that I along with several \nother co-sponsors strongly believe need to be incorporated into H.R. \n701, today I am introducing the exact version that the House Resources \nCommittee reported out on February 17th.\n  This compelling and balanced bi-partisan proposal: will provide a \nfair share of funding to all coastal states, including producing \nstates; is free of harmful environmental impacts to coastal and ocean \nresources; does not unduly hinder land acquisition yet acknowledges \nCongress' role in making these decisions; reflects a true partnership \namong federal, state and local governments and reinvests in the \nrenewable resource of wildlife conservation through the currently \nauthorized Pittman-Robertson program by nearly doubling the Federal \nfunds available for wildlife conservation and education programs.\n  This legislation provides $2.8 billion for seven district \nreinvestment programs. Title I authorizes $1 billion for Impact \nAssistance and Coastal Conservation by creating a revenue sharing and \ncoastal conservation fund for coastal states and eligible local \ngovernments to mitigate the various impacts of OCS activities while \nproviding funds for the conservation of our coastal ecosystems. In \naddition, the funds of Title I will support sustainable development of \nnonrenewable resources without providing incentives for new oil and gas \ndevelopment. All coastal states and territories will benefit from \ncoastal impact assistance under this legislation, not just those states \nthat host federal OCS oil and gas development. Title II guarantees \nstable and annual funding for the state and federal sides of the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) at its authorized $900 million level \nwhile protecting the rights of private property rights owners. The bill \nwill restore Congressional intent with respect to the LWCF, the goal of \nwhich is to share a significant portion of revenues from offshore \ndevelopment with the states to provide for protection and public use of \nthe natural environment. Title III establishes a Wildlife Conservation \nand Restoration Fund at $350 million through the successful program of \nPittman-Robertson by reinvesting the development of nonrenewable \nresources into a renewable resource of wildlife conservation and \neducation. This new source of funding will nearly double the Federal \nfunds available for wildlife conservation. This program enjoys a great \ndeal of support and would be enhanced without imposing new taxes. Title \nIV provides $125 million for the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery \nprogram through matching grants to local governments to rehabilitate \nand develop recreation programs, sites and facilities. The Urban Parks \nand Recreation program would enable cities and towns to focus on the \nneeds of its populations within our more densely inhabited areas with \nfewer greenspaces, playgrounds and soccer fields for our youth. Stable \nfunding will provide greater revenue certainty to state and local \nplanning authorities. Title V provides $100 million for a Historic \nPreservation Fund through the programs of the Historic Preservation \nAct, including grants to the States, maintaining the National Register \nof Historic Places and administering numerous historic preservation \nprograms. Title VI provides $200 million for Federal and Indian Lands \nRestoration through a coordinated program on Federal and Indian lands \nto restore degraded lands, protect resources that are threatened with \ndegradation and protect public health and safety. Title VII provides \n$150 million for Conservation Easements and Species Recovery through \nannual and dedicated funding for conservation easements and funding for \nlandowner incentives to aid in the recovery of endangered and \nthreatened species. Finally, there is up to $200 million available for \nthe Payment In-Lieu of Taxes (PILT) program through the annual interest \ngenerated from the CARA fund.\n\n  The time has come to take the proceeds from a non-renewable resource \nfor the purpose of reinvesting a portion of these revenues in the \nconservation and enhancement of our renewable resources. To continue to \ndo otherwise, as we have over the last fifty years, is fiscally \nirresponsible. I want to thank the chairman of the Senate Energy \nCommittee, Senator Murkowski, the majority leader, Senator Lott, my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Breaux as well as the other co-\nsponsors of S. 25 for all their continued\n\n[[Page S937]]\n\nsupport and efforts in attempting to enact what may well be the most \nsignificant conservation effort of the century. I look forward to \ncontinue working with the other members of the Energy Committee on this \nlegislation this year so that we may reach a compromise and give the \ncountry a true legacy for generations to come.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2123\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

In order for the Secretary to provide funding \n     under this Act in a timely manner each fiscal year, the \n     Secretary shall compare a State or local government's \n     prospective expenditure level to that of its second preceding \n     fiscal year.\n       (b) Exception.--The Secretary may provide funding under \n     this Act to a State or local government not meeting the \n     requirements of subsection (a) if the Secretary determines \n     that a reduction in expenditures is attributable to a non-\n     selective reduction in the expenditures in the programs of \n     all Executive branch agencies of the State or local \n     government.\n       (c) Use of Fund To Meet Matching Requirements.--All funds \n     received by a State or local government under this Act shall \n     be treated as Federal funds for purposes of compliance with \n     any provision in effect under any other law requiring that \n     non-Federal funds be used to provide a portion of the funding \n     for any program or project.\n\n     SEC. 10.

IMPACT ASSISTANCE FORMULA AND PAYMENTS.\n\n       (a) Impact Assistance Payments to States.--\n       (1) Grant program.--Amounts transferred to the Secretary of \n     the Interior from the Conservation and Reinvestment Act Fund \n     under section 5(b)(1) of this Act for purposes of making \n     payments to coastal States under this title in any fiscal \n     year shall be allocated by the Secretary of the Interior \n     among coastal States as provided in this section in each such \n     fiscal year. In each such fiscal year, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall, without further appropriation, disburse such \n     allocated funds to those coastal States for which the \n     Secretary has approved a Coastal State Conservation and \n     Impact Assistance Plan as required by this title. Payments \n     for all projects shall be made by the Secretary to the \n     Governor of the State or to the State official or agency \n     designated by the Governor or by State law as having \n     authority and responsibility to accept and to administer \n     funds paid hereunder. No payment shall be made to any State \n     until the State has agreed to provide such reports to the \n     Secretary, in such form and containing such information, as \n     may be reasonably necessary to enable the Secretary to \n     perform his duties under this title, and provide such fiscal \n     control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to \n     assure proper disbursement and accounting for Federal \n     revenues paid to the State under this title.\n       (2) Failure to have plan approved.--At the end of each \n     fiscal year, the Secretary shall return to the Conservation \n     and Reinvestment Act Fund any amount that the Secretary \n     allocated, but did not disburse, in that fiscal year to a \n     coastal State that does not have an approved plan under this \n     title before the end of the fiscal year in which such grant \n     is allocated, except that the Secretary shall hold in escrow \n     until the final resolution of the appeal any amount \n     allocated, but not disbursed, to a coastal State that has \n     appealed the disapproval of a plan submitted under this \n     title.\n       (b) Allocation Among Coastal States.--\n       (1) Allocable share for each state.--For each coastal \n     State, the Secretary shall determine the State's allocable \n     share of the total amount of the revenues transferred from \n     the Fund under section 5(b)(1) for each fiscal year using the \n     following weighted formula:\n       (A) 50 percent of such revenues shall be allocated among \n     the coastal States as provided in paragraph (2).\n       (B) 25 percent of such revenues shall be allocated to each \n     coastal State based on the ratio of each State's shoreline \n     miles to the shoreline miles of all coastal States.\n       (C) 25 percent of such revenues shall be allocated to each \n     coastal State based on the ratio of each State's coastal \n     population to the coastal population of all coastal States.\n       (2) Offshore outer continental shelf share.--If any portion \n     of a producing State lies within a distance of 200 miles from \n     the geographic center of any leased tract, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall determine such State's allocable share \n     under paragraph (1)(A) based on the formula set forth in this \n     paragraph. Such State share shall be calculated as of the \n     date of the enactment of this Act for the first 5-fiscal year \n     period during which funds are disbursed under this title and \n     recalculated on the anniversary of such date each fifth year \n     thereafter for each succeeding 5-fiscal year period. Each \n     such State's allocable share of the revenues disbursed under \n     paragraph (1)(A) shall be inversely proportional to the \n     distance between the nearest point on the coastline of such \n     State and the geographic center of each leased tract or \n     portion of the leased tract (to the nearest whole mile) that \n     is within 200 miles of that coastline, as determined by the \n     Secretary for the 5-year period concerned. In applying this \n     paragraph a leased tract or portion of a leased tract shall \n     be excluded if the tract or portion is located in a \n     geographic area subject to a leasing moratorium on January 1, \n     1999, unless the lease was issued prior to the establishment \n     of the moratorium and was in production on January 1, 1999.\n       (3) Minimum state share.--\n       (A) In general.--The allocable share of revenues determined \n     by the Secretary under this subsection for each coastal State \n     with an approved coastal management program (as defined by \n     the Coastal Zone Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1451)), or which \n     is making satisfactory progress toward one, shall not be less \n     in any fiscal year than 0.50 percent of the total amount of \n     the revenues transferred by the Secretary of the Treasury to \n     the Secretary of the Interior for purposes of this title for \n     that fiscal year under subsection (a). For any other coastal \n     State the allocable share of such revenues shall not be less \n     than 0.25 percent of such revenues.\n       (B) Recomputation.--Where one or more coastal States' \n     allocable shares, as computed under paragraphs (1) and (2), \n     are increased by any amount under this paragraph, the \n     allocable share for all other coastal States shall be \n     recomputed and reduced by the same amount so that not more \n     than 100 percent of the amount transferred by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury to the Secretary of the Interior for purposes \n     of this title for that fiscal year under section 5(b)(1) is \n     allocated to all coastal States. The reduction shall be \n     divided pro rata among such other coastal States.\n       (c) Payments to Political Subdivisions.--In the case of a \n     producing State, the Governor of the State shall pay 50 \n     percent of the State's allocable share, as determined under \n     subsection (b), to the coastal political subdivisions in such \n     State. Such payments shall be allocated among such coastal \n     political subdivisions of the State according to an \n     allocation formula analogous to the allocation formula \n     used in subsection (b) to allocate revenues among the \n     coastal States, except that a coastal political \n     subdivision in the State of California that has a coastal \n     shoreline, that is not within 200 miles of the geographic \n     center of a leased tract or portion of a leased tract, and \n     in which there is located one or more oil refineries shall \n     be eligible for that portion of the allocation described \n     in subsection (b)(1)(A) and (b)(2) in the same manner as \n     if that political subdivision were located within a \n     distance of 50 miles from the geographic center of any \n     leased tract.\n       (d) Time of Payment.--Payments to coastal States and \n     coastal political subdivisions under this section shall be \n     made not later than December 31 of each year from revenues \n     received during the immediately preceding fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 102. COASTAL STATE CONSERVATION AND IMPACT ASSISTANCE \n                   PLANS.\n\n       (a) Development and Submission of State Plans.--Each \n     coastal State seeking to receive grants under this title \n     shall prepare, and submit to the Secretary, a Statewide \n     Coastal State Conservation and Impact Assistance Plan. In the \n     case of a producing State, the Governor shall incorporate the \n     plans of the coastal political subdivisions into the \n     Statewide plan for transmittal to the Secretary. The Governor \n     shall solicit local input and shall provide for public \n     participation in the development of the Statewide plan. The \n     plan shall be submitted to the Secretary by April 1 of the \n     calendar year after the calendar year in which this Act is \n     enacted.\n       (b) Approval or Disapproval.--\n       (1) In general.--Approval of a Statewide plan under \n     subsection (a) is required prior to disbursement of funds \n     under this title by the Secretary. The Secretary shall \n     approve the Statewide plan if the Secretary determines, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, that the plan is \n     consistent with the uses set forth in subsection (c) and if \n     the plan contains each of the following:\n       (A) The name of the State agency that will have the \n     authority to represent and act for the State in dealing with \n     the Secretary for purposes of this title.\n       (B) A program for the implementation of the plan which, for \n     producing States, includes a description of how funds will be \n     used to address the impacts of oil and gas production from \n     the Outer Continental Shelf.\n       (C) Certification by the Governor that ample opportunity \n     has been accorded for public participation in the development \n     and revision of the plan.\n       (D) Measures for taking into account other relevant Federal \n     resources and programs. The plan shall be correlated so far \n     as practicable with other State, regional, and local plans.\n       (2) Procedure and timing; revisions.--The Secretary shall \n     approve or disapprove each plan submitted in accordance with \n     this section. If a State first submits a plan by not later \n     than 90 days before the beginning of the first fiscal year to \n     which the plan applies, the Secretary shall approve or \n     disapprove the plan by not later than 30 days before the \n     beginning of that fiscal year.\n       (3) Amendment or revision.--Any amendment to or revision of \n     the plan shall be prepared in accordance with the \n     requirements of this subsection and shall be submitted to the \n     Secretary for approval or disapproval. Any such amendment or \n     revision shall take effect only for fiscal years after the \n     fiscal year in which the amendment or revision is approved by \n     the Secretary.\n       (c) Authorized Uses of State Grant Funding.--The funds \n     provided under this title to a coastal State and for coastal \n     political subdivisions are authorized to be used only for one \n     or more of the following purposes:\n       (1) Data collection, including but not limited to fishery \n     or marine mammal stock surveys in State waters or both, \n     cooperative State, interstate, and Federal fishery or marine \n     mammal stock surveys or both, cooperative initiatives with \n     university and private entities for fishery and marine mammal \n     surveys, activities related to marine mammal and fishery \n     interactions, and other coastal living marine resources \n     surveys.\n       (2) The conservation, restoration, enhancement, or creation \n     of coastal habitats.\n       (3) Cooperative Federal or State enforcement of marine \n     resources management statutes.\n       (4) Fishery observer coverage programs in State or Federal \n     waters.\n       (5) Invasive, exotic, and nonindigenous species \n     identification and control.\n       (6) Coordination and preparation of cooperative fishery \n     conservation and management plans between States including \n     the development and implementation of population surveys, \n     assessments and monitoring plans, and the preparation and \n     implementation of State fishery management plans developed by \n     interstate marine fishery commissions.\n       (7) Preparation and implementation of State fishery or \n     marine mammal management plans that comply with bilateral or \n     multilateral international fishery or marine mammal \n     conservation and management agreements or both.\n\n[[Page S940]]\n\n       (8) Coastal and ocean observations necessary to develop and \n     implement real time tide and current measurement systems.\n       (9) Implementation of federally approved marine, coastal, \n     or comprehensive conservation and management plans.\n       (10) Mitigating marine and coastal impacts of Outer \n     Continental Shelf activities including impacts on onshore \n     infrastructure.\n       (11) Projects that promote research, education, training, \n     and advisory services in fields related to ocean, coastal, \n     and Great Lakes resources.\n       (d) Compliance With Authorized Uses.--Based on the annual \n     reports submitted under section 4 of this Act and on audits \n     conducted by the Secretary under section 8, the Secretary \n     shall review the expenditures made by each State and coastal \n     political subdivision from funds made available under this \n     title. If the Secretary determines that any expenditure made \n     by a State or coastal political subdivision of a State from \n     such funds is not consistent with the authorized uses set \n     forth in subsection (c), the Secretary shall not make any \n     further grants under this title to that State until the funds \n     used for such expenditure have been repaid to the \n     Conservation and Reinvestment Act Fund.\n       TITLE II--LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND REVITALIZATION\n\n     SEC. 201.

Mr. President. I rise today with my \ncolleagues from Louisiana, Mississippi and California to introduce the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000. This legislation remedies a \ntremendous inequity in the distribution of revenues generated by \noffshore oil and gas production from the Federal Outer Continental \nShelf (OCS). It directs that a portion of those moneys be allocated to \ncoastal States and communities who shoulder the responsibility for \nenergy development off their coastlines. It also provides secure \nfunding for a number of conservation programs.\n  This bill is similar to S. 25 which I cosponsored a little more than \na year ago with Senators Landrieu and Lott, along with a number of \nother Senators from both sides of the aisle. S. 25 and other proposals \nto spend OCS revenues are pending before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and a series of legislative hearings were held on \nthese bills in the first session. The Committee continues to strive to \nreach an agreement on legislation which can be reported favorably to \nthe floor.\n  Today, I am cosponsoring this bill in an effort to continue to move \nthe process forward in the Senate. This bill is identical to the \nbipartisan bill reported by the House Resources Committee and which \npresently has 302 sponsors. At the same time, the Administration has \nproposed its Lands Legacy Initiative which would provide $1.4 billion \nannually in dedicated funding for a number of the programs funded in \nthis bill. Given the Administration's action and anticipated passage by \nthe House of Representatives of OCS legislation, I believe it is \ncrucial that the Senate pass its own OCS bill.\n  This bill is not perfect and I have serious reservations about some \nof the provisions in Title 1. Title 1 provides $1 billion a year to \ncoastal States and communities to mitigate the impacts of OCS \nactivities off their shores. Offshore oil and gas production generates \n$3 to $4 billion in revenues annually for the U.S. Treasury. Yet, \nunlike mineral receipts from onshore Federal lands, very little of OCS \noil and gas revenues are shared with coastal States. This bill remedies \nthat disparity.\n  As Americans confront increasing oil and gas prices caused by this \nnation's reliance on foreign petroleum products, we should all \nrecognize the importance of the OCS to this nation's energy \nindependence. According to the Energy Information Administration, the \nOCS accounts for 27 to 28 percent of total U.S. oil and gas production. \nThis production is authorized to occur off the coast of six States: \nparts of Alaska, parts of California; Texas, Mississippi, Alabama; and \nLouisiana. All Americans benefit from OCS production yet the States \nwhich produce this oil and gas off their coasts bear the burden.\n  It is in the long-term best interest of this country to support \nresponsible and sustainable development of nonrenewable resources. We \nnow import more than 55 percent of our domestic petroleum requirements \nand it is predicted that America will be at least 65 percent dependent \non foreign energy sources by 2020. OCS development will play an \nimportant role in offsetting even greater dependence on foreign energy.\n  I do, however, have concerns about some of the provisions in Title 1. \nTitle 1 places unreasonable restrictions on the use of coastal impact \nassistance funds by States and local governments. Like onshore mineral \nrevenue sharing payments, the decision as to how to spend this money \nshould be made by State and local government officials after a public \nprocess. There is no need for the Federal government to mandate that \nthese funds be used for only certain, specific programs. Coastal impact \nassistance funds are just that--funds coastal States can use to offset \nthe unavoidable impacts of OCS development. These impacts can range \nfrom shoreline erosion to the need for new schools to educate the \nchildren of oil and gas workers. And, these impacts can vary from year-\nto-year. It is important that the Federal government give States the \nflexibility they need to determine their needs and for Washington not \nto mandate a one-size fits all solution.\n  I also am concerned that Title 1 allows coastal States--without any \nOCS production--to receive more coastal impact assistance funds than \nStates with OCS production. We cannot forget where this money comes \nfrom: it is generated by OCS oil and gas development. Nor can we forget \nthe purpose of sharing these revenues with coastal\n\n[[Page S946]]\n\nStates: to offset the unavoidable impacts of this OCS development. It \nis unfair to allow States which do not bear the burdens of \nthis development to benefit at the expense of States off whose shores \ndevelopment occurs. This provision must be added to this bill.\n\n  I do want to note a few other provisions in this bill which I believe \nare critical. Title 2 provides $900 million a year for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund (LWCF). These LWCF monies are split between \nFederal land acquisition and the state-side LWCF matching grant \nprogram. As to the Federal land acquisition funds, a number of sensible \nlimitations are placed on the expenditure of this money to ensure that \nFederal funds are spent to address Americans' concerns about the loss \nof private property in many States.\n  Each year the Administration must submit a list to Congress of each \ntract of land it proposes to acquire with LWCF monies and Congress must \nspecifically approve each project through the appropriations process. \nWithin 30 days of the submission of this list, Congressional \nrepresentatives, the Governors and local government officials must be \nnotified of relevant purchase requests. At the same time, the local \npublic must be notified in a newspaper that is widely distributed in \nthe area in which the proposed acquisition is to take place.\n  The Administration must seek to consolidate Federal land holdings in \nStates with checkerboard Federal land ownership patterns. It also must \nseek to use exchanges and conservation easements as an alternative to \nfee title acquisition. If the Administration identifies tracts from \nnon-willing sellers, it must notify Congress and, unless specifically \nauthorized by Congress, the bill prohibits adverse condemnation. The \nAdministration must identify to Congress its authority to carry out \nFederal acquisitions. No purchases can occur until all actions under \nFederal law are completed and a copy of the final NEPA document must be \nsent to Congress and the Governor and local government officials must \nbe notified that the NEPA document is available.\n  The bill has a number of other provisions of interest to Westerners \nwhere the vast majority of Federal land is located. The bill requires \njust compensation for the taking of private property and protects State \nwater rights. It provides $200 million annually for the maintenance of \nFederal lands managed by the Department of the Interior or the Forest \nService. It also provides up to $200 million in additional funding for \nthe Payment in-lieu-of Taxes and Refugee Revenue Sharing programs. The \nbill provides the necessary funds to reduce the $10 billion backlog of \nwilling sellers located within the boundaries of Federal land \nmanagement units. Finally, the bill restricts the Federal government's \nregulatory ability over private lands.\n  This bill is not perfect but it does reflect a bipartisan consensus. \nIt provides a starting point for Senate discussions of conflicting OCS \nrevenue-sharing proposals. With the anticipated action of the House and \nthe Administration's Lands Legacy Initiative, it is imperative that the \nSenate put forth its own proposal to distribute OCS revenues. I remain \ncommitted to working with all Senators on such a proposal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. L. \n        Chafee):\n  S. 2125. A bill to provide for the disclosure of certain information \nrelating to tobacco products and to prescribe labels for packages and \nadvertising of tobacco products; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n        SMOKER'S RIGHT TO KNOW AND TRUTH IN TOBACCO LABELING ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I introduce the Smoker's \nRight to Know and Truth in Tobacco Labeling Act. I am joined by my \ncolleagues, Senator Lugar, Senator Durbin, and Senator Chafee.\n  Mr. President, the Smoker's Right to Know and Truth in Tobacco \nLabeling Act has two common-sense objectives.\n  First, the bill will require tobacco manufacturers to disclose the \ningredients of their products to the public--including toxic and \ncancer-causing ingredients.\n  Second, our bill will replace the small health warnings on the side \nof a cigarette pack with larger warnings on the front and back that are \nsimple and direct: ``Cigarettes Cause Cancer.'' ``Cigarettes are \nAddictive.'' ``Smoking Can Kill You.''\n  Of the hundreds of products for sale in America that go into the \nhuman body, tobacco products are the only ones--the only ones--for \nwhich manufacturers do not have to disclose ingredients. Even Coca-\nCola, with a proud tradition of keeping its formula secret, has to list \nCoke's ingredients on every can.\n  Mr. President, manufacturers of every food product and every over-\nthe- counter drug disclose their contents. Cigarette manufacturers do \nnot. Yet, of any consumable product for sale in the United States, \ncigarettes are by far the most deadly.\n  One in three smokers will die from a smoking-related disease. That is \nmore than 400,000 Americans every year. We should disclose information \non cigarette ingredients to the public and provide realistic warnings \nabout the health risks cigarettes cause.\n  Mr. President, how much do smokers really know about the chemicals \nthey are inhaling with every puff of cigarette smoke? When a smoker \nlights a cigarette, the burning ingredients create other chemicals. \nSome of these are carcinogenic.\n  A Surgeon General's report in 1989 reported that cigarettes contain \n43 carcinogens. Forty-three. The public has a right to know.\n  Do most smokers realize that one of these chemicals is arsenic? Yes, \narsenic. I do not think most smokers know that.\n  Our bill will disclose that, as well as the other chemical \ncarcinogens in cigarette smoke.\n  Mr. President, with all these known dangers about smoking, we should \nnot hide the health warning labels in small type on the side of a \ncigarette pack. Other countries, such as Canada, Australia and \nThailand, put large labels on the front of each pack. The United States \nshould provide equal protection to consumers. The warnings should be \nstark, clear, and easily seen.\n  When cigarettes get in the hands of children, and with 3,000 children \nbecoming regular smokers every day, we have a duty to give them the \nfacts: ``Cigarettes Cause Cancer.'' ``Smoking is Addictive.'' ``Smoking \nCan Kill You.''\n  That is a lot more graphic and descriptive than the small print that \nappears today. Large and forthright warnings are more likely to be \nseen, read, understood, and recalled. More children--and adults--will \nget the message, and put down the pack rather than lighting up.\n  In a recent study of Canadian cigarette pack messages--similar to \nthose required by this legislation--half of all smokers who were \nsmoking less, or trying to quit, cited cigarette pack messages as \ncontributing to their decisions. Larger, bolder warnings can make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, the 106th Congress should enact this legislation. This \nis a bipartisan bill, and I want to thank my cosponsors, Senators \nLugar, Durbin and Chafee for joining me in this effort. In the coming \nweeks, I expect that this bill will attract more cosponsors from both \nsides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2125\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I wish to say a few words, and \nperhaps echo some of those of my colleague. I am proud to sponsor this \nimportant piece of legislation with Senator Lautenberg. I was a co-\nsponsor of a similar bill in the last Congress, and am glad to join him \nagain in this effort. I also thank my colleagues Senator Durbin and \nSenator Chafee for their co-sponsorship of this good policy initiative.\n  Let me start by saying that this bill is about health education and \nresponsible individual decision-making. As Mayor of Indianapolis and in \nthe U.S. Senate, I have advocated good health and fitness. I have \nintegrated running into my daily routine and encourage my staff to do \nthe same. In 1977, I founded the annual Dick Lugar Fitness festival in \nIndiana, which is an event I look forward to every year.\n  A good health and fitness regimen requires an assumption of personal \nresponsibility and an active role on the part of the individual, but it \nalso requires a knowledge of two essential components of good health--\nproper diet and exercise. I speak on a regular basis on the exercise \ncomponent, but would like to make a couple of basic points about proper \ndiet that are well within\n\n[[Page S950]]\n\nthe scope of the federal government's responsibilities.\n  We have taken great strides in the area of food packaging and \nlabeling, pointing out to consumers vitamin and fat content; caloric \nand cholesterol facts. We require data on tests done on artificial \nsweeteners. But, in a product that threatens the life of one out of \nthree regular users, we ignore those basic principles.\n  Mr. President, we all know that in a food product, the discovery of \neven a single carcinogen can trigger media attack, consumer outrage and \nFDA regulation. However, under current law, a cigarette package is not \neven required to list its ingredients despite the presence of dozens of \ncarcinogens. Applying a simple content labeling standard to tobacco in \nthe interest of consistency and public health is overdue considering \nthe massive health problems inflicted by tobacco.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry, which has jurisdiction over some aspects of tobacco, I \nbelieve that our government must speak consistently and clearly about \ntobacco's risks. That has not always been the case. In the past, our \ngovernment has sent mixed messages, for example, subsidizing the \ncultivation of tobacco and including cigarettes in military rations, \neven as it warned against tobacco's dangers. If public health warnings \nare to be trusted, they should not be ambiguous. The small, side-panel \nwarnings currently in use on tobacco packages are not adequate in \nreflecting the risks of tobacco use as we now know them. We can and we \nshould speak the truth with a clearer voice.\n  Prominent labels on cigarette packages in plain English would be a \nsteady reminder of the risks smokers face when they light up. True, \nalmost every smoker understands that cigarettes are bad for health, but \nfewer know the degree of risk.\n  Many smokers have tried to quit, some more than once. These labels \nwill encourage them in this endeavor and remind them why they should \ntry again.\n  Most importantly, Mr. President, as Senator Lautenberg stated, the \nwarnings will be prominent and readily understood by young Americans, \nthousands of whom light up for the first time every day.\n  This bill does not interfere with an adult's freedom to choose to \nsmoke, it does not raise tobacco prices, and it does not expand \ngovernment regulatory authority beyond the labeling requirement. It is \na modest and conservative step, but a decisive and important step in \ngood public policy.\n Mr. L. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators \nLugar, Lautenberg, and Durbin today in introducing the Smoker's Right \nto Know and Truth in Labeling Act, which would require comprehensive \nand prominent labeling of cigarettes. This legislation is a commonsense \nand bipartisan approach to give every American a chance to make an \ninformed decision about tobacco use.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, nearly one in five \ndeaths annually are attributed to tobacco use, making it the single \nmost preventable cause of premature death, disease and disability \nfacing our nation. In fact, more Americans die each year from tobacco \nuse than from AIDS, alcohol, drug abuse, car accidents, murders, \nsuicides, and fires combined.\n  America's children are most at risk. Despite all we know about the \neffects of tobacco, each day, 3,000 kids become regular smokers. Of \nthese, 1,000 will eventually die from tobacco-related illnesses. Almost \n90 percent of current adult smokers began at or before age 18.\n  Rhode Island--which already has one of the highest rates of teen \nsmoking in the nation--has recently seen another increase in teen \nsmoking. Today, over 37 percent of Rhode Island's high school kids \nsmoke cigarettes. Over 23,000 Rhode Island kids under age 18 will die \nprematurely from tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Tobacco manufacturers say that tobacco use is a matter of choice. \nThey argue that adults, with the full knowledge of the consequences, \nhave the right to choose to smoke. I agree. But I also believe that \nindividuals who choose to smoke should be making informed decisions.\n  The Smoker's Right to Know and Truth in Tobacco Labelling Act would \nensure that tobacco users understand the consequences of the choice \nthey are making. With comprehensive labelling of cigarette packs, \nadults and especially minors, will know the dangers that cigarettes \npose to their health and the health of their loved ones.\n  This legislation follows on the recent example set by Canada, which \npassed tough labelling guidelines that have worked as a strong \ndisincentive to beginning this deadly habit. Under the legislation we \nare introducing today, there will be no mistake about the life-\nthreatening health effects of tobacco products.\n  As the father of three young children, I have a personal stake in \nhelping to pass legislation to ensure that our kids do not develop this \ndeadly habit. I hope our colleagues in the Senate will join us in \npassing this important, common-sense legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Robb, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wellstone, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2124. A bill to authorize Federal financial assistance for the \nurgent repair and renovation of public elementary and secondary schools \nin high-need areas; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n              the public school repair and renovation act\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today we will be introducing the Public \nSchool Repair and Renovation Act. This legislation will authorize $1.3 \nbillion in grants and no interest loans to enable school districts to \nmake urgent repairs at our nation's public schools. I am pleased to be \njoined by Senators Robb, Bingaman, Feinstein, Kennedy, Wellstone, and \nDodd in cosponsoring this legislation in the Senate.\n  The facts about the condition of our nation's schools are well known. \nThe average age of the schools in this country is 42 years. 14 million \nchildren attend classes in buildings that are unsafe or inadequate. The \nGeneral Accounting Office reports we need $112 billion to just bring \nour schools up to overall good condition. How can kids prepare for the \n21st century in schools that didn't even make the grade in the 20th \ncentury?\n  It is a national disgrace that the nicest thing our kids see are \nshopping malls, sports arenas, and movie theaters, and the most rundown \nplace they see is their school. What signal are we sending them about \nthe value we place on them, their education and future?\n  I was disturbed by the comments of Tunisia, a Washington, D.C. 5th \ngrader in Jonathan Kozol's book, ``Savage Inequalities.'' This is what \nshe said.\n\n       It's like this. The school is dirty. There isn't any \n     playground. There's a hole in the wall behind the principal's \n     desk. What we need to do is first rebuild the school. Build a \n     playground. Plant a lot of flowers. Paint the classrooms. Fix \n     the hole in the principal's office. Buy doors for the toilet \n     stalls in the girl's bathroom. Make it a beautiful clean \n     building. Make it pretty. Way it is, I feel ashamed.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing would make it possible to fix the \nholes in the walls of Tunisia's school, put doors on the bathroom \nstalls and paint the classrooms. These repairs would make Tunisia feel \na little less ashamed of herself and of her school.\n  This legislation is part of a comprehensive two-prong strategy to \nmodernize our nation's schools. This bill complements our continuing \neffort to provide tax credits for new construction and modernization \nprojects. We have advocated school modernization tax credits that would \nfinance $25 billion in new construction or major renovations. The \nPublic School Repair and Renovation Act will complement that effort and \nI urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Frist):\n  S.J.

Mr. President, as my colleagues know, February is \ndesignated as ``Black History Month.'' As part of the celebration of \nAfrican American achievements and contributions to our country, I would \nlike to draw your attention to the heroic and courageous acts of the \nAfrican Americans who served in the Ninth and Tenth Horse Cavalry Units \nof the United States Army.\n  These units were established at the end of the Civil War and composed \nof former slaves. Their first charge was to maintain trails and protect \nsettlers from Native Americans during the period of westward expansion. \nThe units were called to combative service during the wars against the \nNative Americans, where they were also given the name of ``Buffalo \nSoldiers.''\n  During the Spanish American War, the Buffalo Soldiers were among \nTheodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. In 1916, they crossed into Mexico \nunder the direction of General John J. Pershing. At a time when the \nmajority of the troops fighting in Mexico were from the South, these \nsoldiers faced many internal obstacles and discriminatory actions, even \nwhile defending our country.\n  The Buffalo Solders were last called into service during World War \nII. The soldiers went to North Africa, Iran, and Italy and held various \npositions as combat engineers and paratroopers, among others. When the \nArmy feared a Japanese invasion, the Buffalo Soldiers were placed along \nthe rugged border terrain of the Baja Peninsula and protected dams, \npower stations, and rail lines to ensure the safety of crucial war \nindustries in San Diego.\n  Currently, there are twenty-one existing chapters of the 9th and 10th \nHorse Cavalry associations, one in Germany and twenty in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today to honor these \nbrave men through the creation of a commemorative postage stamp. This \nstamp is a way to pay tribute to the Buffalo Soldiers' great acts of \ncourage and dedication to our country. It is my hope that this stamp \ncan serve as a reminder of their valor and to help teach future \ngenerations about their contributions to our nation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  An informative article about the Buffalo Soldiers in my home state of \nOhio was recently featured in the Cincinnati Enquirer. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of this article be reprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Cincinnati Enquirer, Feb. 9, 2000]\n\nLast of a Storied Cavalry Fights for Recognition--All-Black Unit Served \n                      in WW II After Long History\n\n                           (By Mark Curnutte)\n\n       In 1943, Lorenzo Denson was one of about two dozen men from \n     Cincinnati drafted to serve in an all-black cavalry unit on \n     the Mexican border.\n       ``The only horse I'd ever seen was the milkman's horse on \n     Seventh Street,'' he said. Shortages of men in segregated \n     black infantry units took Mr. Denson and other Cincinnatians \n     overseas--without their horses--to North Africa, Iran and \n     Italy. They worked as everything from paratroopers to combat \n     engineers. Mr. Denson was a firefighter at an airfield.\n       ``We did our job,'' he said. ``We did what we were told.''\n       These Tristate men also found their way into history as the \n     last of the Buffalo Soldiers, members of the renowned all-\n     black cavalry units formed during the Indian wars. The U.S. \n     Army disbanded all horseback cavalry units in 1944.\n       This month--Black History Month--finds Cincinnati's Buffalo \n     Soldiers on a final ride. Like the Tuskegee Airmen and other \n     groups of black veterans before them, the Buffalo Soldiers \n     are trying to win recognition for contributions that they say \n     have been overlooked for more than 50 years.\n       Mr. Denson, now 79, retired and living in Columbia \n     Township, will be among a group of nine living World War II-\n     era Buffalo Soldiers scheduled to make its first Tristate \n     appearance Thursday at the public library in Corryville.\n       ``We helped to win World War II,'' said Linwood Greene Jr., \n     79, of Silverton, another Buffalo Soldier.\n       At least 14 of Cincinnati's World War II Buffalo Soldiers \n     are dead--none was killed in action--and chances are this \n     piece of Tristate history would have faded away if not for \n     George Hicks III. A retired Army veteran who's a fan of the \n     all-black cavalry units; Mr. Hicks moved from Washington, \n     D.C., to the Tristate a couple of years ago and immediately \n     organized the Cincinnati-based Heartland Chapter of the Ninth \n     and Tenth Horse Cavalry Association.\n       ``These men are American heroes,'' said Mr. Hicks, 50.\n       There are 20 domestic chapters of the Ninth and Tenth \n     Association and one in Germany. About 650 black cavalry \n     veterans from World War II are still living.\n       ``We owe a lot to George,'' said Mr. Denson, who appeared \n     at the Buffalo Soldiers booth at the Indiana Black Expo in \n     July in Indianapolis. Public reaction there added urgency to \n     the black troopers mission.\n       People--black and white alike--didn't know who they were. \n     ``They thought we were actors,'' Mr. Denson said.\n       The men sported black hats with crossed cavalry swords and \n     the No. 10 affixed to the front. With blue shirts they wore \n     the cavalry's standard yellow neckerchief.\n       ``Once people found out who we were and what we did, they \n     wanted to have their pictures taken with us,'' Mr. Denson \n     said.\n       William Snow, 77, of New Burlington will appear at the \n     library with Mr. Denson and at least three other men.\n       ``Overseas, we did everything we were instructed to do,'' \n     said Mr. Snow, a Walnut Hills native and retired postal \n     worker. ``I was proud to be in the cavalry. I am proud to be \n     part of the history.''\n       The black cavalry dates to post-Civil War North America. \n     It's first recruits in 1866 were former slaves who patrolled \n     the frontier from Texas to Montana. They guarded settlers and \n     protected wagon trains.\n       Buffalo Soldiers earned respect and their nickname from the \n     Cheyenne, Arapahoe, Kiowa, Comanche and Apache Indians they \n     sometimes fought, a story captured in the song ``Buffalo \n     Soldier'' by the late reggae icon Bob Marley. Indians said \n     black soldiers' hair resembled buffalo fur.\n       Four all-black regiments, stationed throughout the western \n     territories, were known as some of the fiercest fighters of \n     the Indian wars.\n       They were among Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders in Cuba \n     during the Spanish-American War and crossed into Mexico in \n     1916 under Gen. John J. Pershing.\n       During World War II, fearing a Japanese land invasion \n     through Mexico's Baja Peninsula, the government placed \n     cavalry units--first white, then black--along the rugged \n     border terrain. Armed units on horseback protected dams, \n     power stations and rail lines important to San Diego's war \n     industries.\n       Black troopers from Cincinnati were sworn in at Fort Thomas \n     and sent to train at Camp Lockett near San Diego.\n       ``We were trained in infantry and how to be infantry on \n     horseback,'' Mr. Denson said. ``When you were assigned a \n     horse, you were instructed to treat this animal like it was \n     your best friend.''\n       African-Americans could not rise beyond the rank of \n     sergeant, so all commanding officers were white.\n       ``They treated black troopers very well,'' Mr. Denson said.\n       Patrolling the border is how Buffalo Soldiers figured they \n     would close out the war.\n       But within a year of arriving in California, the cavalry \n     troopers were put on alert to go\n\n[[Page S955]]\n\n     overseas. They were put aboard a segregated train for a two-\n     day ride to Newport News, Va.\n       A stop in Houston showed the men that many of their white \n     countrymen wouldn't accept them, even though the troopers \n     would put their lives on the line for them.\n       ``We were in cramped quarters on the train, and the colonel \n     got us out and had us marching up and down the platform to \n     stretch our legs,'' said Mr. Greene, the Madisonville native \n     who lives in Silverton.\n       ``The mayor of Houston heard we were there, and he came out \n     and said, `Get them niggers back on the train.' And that's \n     exactly what he said.\n       ``So the colonel has us go back to a train car and assemble \n     our .50-caliber machine guns. We went back out and marched \n     until it was time to switch trains.''\n       Many historians consider Buffalo Soldiers unsung heroes, \n     troopers who did jobs a lot of white soldiers didn't want to.\n       ``Blacks were second-class citizens in the military, and \n     blacks were second-class citizens in society,'' said Pat \n     O'Brien, a history professor and 20th century America expert \n     at Emporia State University in Emporia, Kan.\n       Emporia is near Junction City, Kan., home of the Ninth and \n     Tenth Cavalry Association, which is raising money to build a \n     Buffalo Soldiers memorial there.\n       ``In many ways, World War II--and the performance of the \n     black soldiers--provided the context for the civil rights \n     movement,'' Mr. O'Brien said. ``It readily exposed the \n     paradox--how could you fight against one thing overseas and \n     promote it at home.''\n       Mr. Greene, who joined the combat engineers and worked as a \n     welder, landed at Normandy on D-Day. He was wounded six days \n     later when the Jeep in which he was riding ran over a mine.\n       He took shrapnel in the head, hand and stomach. The next 14 \n     days were a blur. He received the Purple Heart and an \n     honorable discharge at a Cleveland hospital on Aug. 4, 1945.\n       Mr. Greene came home to Cincinnati and went to work as a \n     railway mail clerk. He experienced more racism at home than \n     he did abroad.\n       ``I was in the same boxcars sorting the same mail, and they \n     wouldn't let me join the union,'' he said.\n       Paul Greene, his son, was a U.S. Marine killed in Vietnam \n     in 1966. Paul Greene was 19.\n       ``I'm proud of my son's service to his country,'' Linwood \n     Greene Jr. said slowly. ``I'm proud of my service to my \n     country.''\n       Mr. Snow, who also received an honorable discharge, didn't \n     think he would live to see the United States again.\n       ``I had as much fun as I could because I thought I would be \n     gone at any minute,'' he said. ``God was with me. That's how \n     I didn't get hurt.''\n       Mr. Denson is most proud of his honorable discharge, dated \n     Nov. 6, 1945. He also received the American Theater Ribbon, \n     Good Conduct Medal and Victory Medal.\n       ``The No. 1 thing is that honorable discharge. A lot of \n     things happen in the service, and they had a lot of ways of \n     busting you down,'' said Mr. Denson, who retired in 1981 from \n     Cincinnati Public Schools as a plant operator.\n       Not far behind are his feelings for his unit.\n       ``I liked the outfit. I liked the horses. I learned a \n     lot,'' he said. ``We didn't come in until the tail end, but \n     we did a good job.\n       ``No, we weren't actors. We were the real thing.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S955-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 264--CONGRATULATING AND THANKING CHAIRMAN ROBERT F. \n  BENNETT AND VICE CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER J.

Bennett and Vice Chairman Christopher J. Dodd--\n       (1) for their tremendous leadership in addressing a massive \n     and pervasive problem; a problem that was largely unknown, \n     but thanks to Chairman Bennett and Vice Chairman Dodd was \n     studied, evaluated, and resolved;\n       (2) for presiding over the Special Committee on the Year \n     2000 Technology Problem which did its work in a bipartisan \n     and fair manner; and\n       (3) for helping the Government and the Nation minimize the \n     Y2K computer problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S955-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S955-S962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE AFFORDABLE EDUCATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  DODD (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2857\n\n  Mr. REID (for Mr. Dodd (for himself, Mr. Reid, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \nReed)) proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1134) to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow tax-free expenditures from \neducation individual retirement accounts for elementary and secondary \nschool expenses, to increase the maximum annual amount of contributions \nto such accounts, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike section 101 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 101.

EXPANSION OF INCENTIVES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Record numbers of students are enrolled in our Nation's \n     elementary and secondary schools and that record is expected \n     to be broken every year through 2007. The record numbers are \n     straining many school facilities. Addressing that growth will \n     require an increasing commitment of resources to build and \n     modernize schools, and to hire and train new teachers. In \n     addition, the increasing use of technology in the workplace \n     is creating new demands to incorporate computers and other \n     high-technology equipment into the classroom and into \n     curricula.\n       (2) The General Accounting Office (in this section referred \n     to as the ``GAO'') has performed a comprehensive survey of \n     the Nation's public elementary and secondary school \n     facilities and has found severe levels of disrepair in all \n     areas of the United States. The GAO report concluded that \n     more than 14,000,000 children attend schools in need of \n     extensive repair or replacement, 7,000,000 children attend \n     schools with life safety code violations, and 12,000,000 \n     children attend schools with leaky roofs.\n       (3) The General Accounting Office has found the problem of \n     crumbling schools transcends demographic and geographic \n     boundaries. At 38 percent of urban schools, 30 percent of \n     rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools, at least \n     one building is in need of extensive repair or should be \n     completely replaced.\n       (4) The condition of school facilities has a direct effect \n     on the safety of students and teachers and on the ability of \n     students to learn. Academic research has provided a direct \n     correlation between the condition of school facilities and \n     student achievement. At Georgetown University, researchers \n     have found the test scores of students assigned to schools in \n     poor condition can be expected to fall 10.9 percentage points \n     below the test scores of students in buildings in excellent \n     condition. Similar studies have demonstrated up to a 20 \n     percent improvement in\n\n[[Page S958]]\n\n     test scores when students were moved from a poor facility to \n     a new facility.\n       (5) Furthermore, a recent study by the Environmental \n     Working Group concluded that portable trailers, utilized by \n     many school districts to accommodate school over-crowding, \n     can ``expose children to toxic chemicals at levels that pose \n     an unacceptable risk of cancer or other serious illnesses.'' \n     Because ventilation in portable trailers is poor, the \n     pollution through the build-up of toxins can be significant. \n     This is particularly hazardous to those children who have \n     asthma. The prevalence of asthma in children increased by 160 \n     percent between 1980 and 1994. The report also stated, \n     ``Schools are facing two epidemics: an epidemic of \n     deteriorating facilities and an epidemic of asthma among \n     children.''\n       (6) The General Accounting Office has found most schools \n     are not prepared to incorporate modern technology in the \n     classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \n     electrical wiring to support the full-scale use of \n     technology. More than a third of schools lack the requisite \n     electrical power. Fifty-six percent of schools have \n     insufficient phone lines for modems.\n       (7) The Department of Education has reported that \n     elementary and secondary school enrollment, already at a \n     record high level, will continue to grow over the next 10 \n     years, and that in order to accommodate this growth, the \n     United States will need to build an additional 2,400 schools.\n       (8) The General Accounting Office has determined the cost \n     of bringing schools up to good, overall condition to be \n     $112,000,000,000, not including the cost of modernizing \n     schools to accommodate technology, or the cost of building \n     additional facilities needed to meet record enrollment \n     levels.\n       (9) Schools run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs (in this \n     section referred to as the ``BIA'') for Native American \n     children are also in dire need of repair and renovation. The \n     General Accounting Office has reported that the cost of total \n     inventory repairs needed for BIA facilities is $754,000,000. \n     The December 1997 report by the Comptroller General of the \n     United States states that, ``Compared with other schools \n     nationally, BIA schools are generally in poorer physical \n     condition, have more unsatisfactory environmental factors, \n     more often lack key facilities requirements for education \n     reform, and are less able to support computer and \n     communications technology.''\n       (10) Across the Nation, schools will need to recruit and \n     hire an additional 2,000,000 teachers during the period from \n     1998 through 2008. More than 200,000 teachers will be needed \n     annually, yet current teacher development programs produce \n     only 100,000 to 150,000 teachers per year. This level of \n     recruitment is simply the level needed to maintain existing \n     student-teacher ratios.\n       (11) The rapid growth in the student population, in \n     addition to the imminent shortage of qualified teachers and \n     recent efforts by Congress to help States reduce class size, \n     present urgent infrastructure needs across the Nation.\n       (12) State and local financing mechanisms have proven \n     inadequate to meet the challenges facing today's aging school \n     facilities. Large numbers of local educational agencies have \n     difficulties securing financing for school facility \n     improvement.\n       (13) The Federal Government has provided resources for \n     school construction in the past. For example, between 1933 \n     and 1939, the Federal Government assisted in 70 percent of \n     all new school construction.\n       (14) The Federal Government can support elementary and \n     secondary school facilities without interfering in issues of \n     local control, and should help communities leverage \n     additional funds for the improvement of elementary and \n     secondary school facilities.\n       (b) Public School Modernization.--Chapter 1 is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new subchapter:\n\n         ``Subchapter X--Public School Modernization Provisions\n\n``Part I.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nfellow Kentuckian Steve Higdon on his recent success in becoming \npresident and chief executive officer of Greater Louisville, Inc.\n  Steve Higdon grew up in Hikes Point and graduated from Trinity High \nSchool. He received a bachelor's degree in business administration from \nthe University of Kentucky and began work with Yellow Freight Systems \nin Louisville after college.\n  Steve made his way to the top of the Louisville business world \nthrough hard work and determination. After his work at Yellow Freight \nSystems, he held several positions of leadership within the United \nParcel Service (UPS), including economic development manager. Steve's \nwork at UPS led to his involvement with Greater Louisville, Inc., and \nto his being hired as executive vice president for economic development \nand chief operating officer.\n  Many of Steve's colleagues have noted his extraordinary leadership \nskills. Steve's co-workers at UPS and colleagues within Greater \nLouisville, Inc. have all spoken of his drive and ambition, his work \nethic and intelligence. From everything I've observed, Steve deserves \nall of these compliments--and more. He has taken on a huge \nresponsibility in the Louisville community, and his past experience and \nsuccess is a sign of good things to come for the city, its residents \nand its workers.\n  Steve also is involved in efforts to build a better Louisville \ncommunity. He holds positions on the Workforce Investment Board, \nHousing Partnership Board, Kentucky Industrial Development Council, \nIndustrial Development Research Council, and the Trinity High School \nAlumni association. This is further evidence that Steve's commitment to \nthe community goes beyond mere business interests--he genuinely cares \nabout Louisville's children and families.\n  Steve, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank you for your \ndedicated service to Louisville and to the people of Kentucky. I have \nevery confidence in your ability to lead Greater Louisville, Inc. and \nits efforts to build great accomplishments and successes in the years \nto come.\n  Mr. President, I also ask that an article which ran in the Louisville \nCourier-Journal on Sunday, January 30, 2000, appear in the record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The article follows:\n\n          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Jan. 30, 2000]\n\nGreater Louisville Grew New Leader From the Inside--Steve Higdon Loves \n                          To Deal With People\n\n                            (By David Goetz)\n\n       Steve Higdon, the new man in charge of Louisville's \n     economic future, speaks the language of development in a \n     broadcast-quality baritone. He moves seamlessly from \n     discussions of work-force issues to business retention to the \n     prospects of city-county merger.\n       But if you watch him speak as well as listen, you can catch \n     glimpses in his gestures of the airport baggage handler he \n     was not too many years ago. He seems to grab his words as he \n     speaks them bracketing them between his hands or rolling them \n     up in front of him. Then he hands them to you, or takes them \n     to heart, or just places them here and there like a man \n     sorting bundles.\n       Higdon, 37, is the new president and chief executive \n     officer of Greater Louisville, Inc., a hometown guy whose \n     love of long distances shaped a business career in shipping \n     and distribution that never took him very far from home.\n       He's not too far removed in years or though from the \n     college graduate of 1987 who found himself bossing men twice \n     his age on the loading dock of Yellow Freight Systems at 35th \n     and Duvall streets in Louisville.\n       ``It was the most stressful job I've ever had,'' Higdon \n     recalled last week in his modest new office, a passable view \n     of Sixth Street over his shoulder, business cards on his desk \n     still identifying him in his former job as the non-profit \n     corporation's head of economic development.\n       ``I was very young and green, there were the hours, \n     managing Teamsters whose average on the job was 25 to 30 \n     years,'' Higdon continued. ``The productivity goals were \n     extremely tough.''\n       He was young and it would have been easy to quit, Higdon \n     said, but he had already developed a sense of having a career \n     rather than just a job.\n       ``I didn't know what the career was, but I knew I would \n     have to be responsible,'' he said. ``I knew I would have to \n     work my way through it.''\n       It was the beginning of a career that eventually placed \n     Higdon with air carrier UPS and brought him into contact with \n     the old Greater Louisville Economic Development Partnership.\n       There he garnered the notice and respect of entrepreneur \n     Doug Cobb, who had signed on as president of Greater \n     Louisville Inc., in 1997 when the partnership merged with the \n     Chamber of Commerce to create a unified front for \n     Louisville's business-support and economic-development \n     efforts.\n       Cobb said he wasn't intentionally grooming a successor when \n     he hired Higdon to run the development side of Greater \n     Louisville Inc., in 1997.\n       ``I called Steve because he had a good idea of what was \n     going on'' in Louisville, Cobb said. ``But when you find out \n     what people can do and you ask them to do more, which they do \n     well, they just naturally grow into leadership.''\n       Higdon is ``maybe the most impressive executive I've ever \n     worked with,'' Cobb said. ``He's a great organizer. He knows \n     how to figure out what needs to be done and get it done. He's \n     good judge of talent.''\n       Higdon has ``a lot of the leadership characteristics that \n     make the difference,'' said LG Energy Corp. executive Steve \n     Wood, chairman of Greater Louisville, Inc.'s economic \n     development committee.\n       ``To be a successful executive, you have to out-work and \n     out-think the competition, in this case, other jurisdictions \n     competing for new business,'' Wood said. ``I don't think you \n     can outwork him. His energy level's extremely high, and he's \n     as bright as they come.''\n       Retired banker and civic leader Malcolm Chancey advocated a \n     broader, national search for Cobb's successor, but he praised \n     Higdon's energy and talent.\n       ``If he has the right kind of support, he'll be \n     successful,'' Chancey said. ``I hope everybody will support \n     him. I certainly will.''\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\n       Higdon grew up one of four kids in a house off Klondike \n     Lane near Hikes Point. His father was a photoengraver at the \n     old Standard Gravure printing plant.\n       The Rev. David Zettel, a counselor at Trinity High School, \n     remembers Hidgon as bright, gregarious and outgoing. ``He \n     smiled a lot,'' Zettle said.\n       Higdon was ``more social than most smart guys.'' and he had \n     the ability to befriend any group, said friend Tom Scanlon, \n     now president of ScanSteel Service Center Inc. in \n     Louisville.\n       Scanlon remembers exchanging words with students from a \n     rival school in the parking lot one night after a football \n     game. Then Higdon walked over to them.\n       ``What looked like it was going to turn into a fight, 30 \n     minutes later we were sitting on the hood of their car \n     drinking beer with them,'' Scanlon said. ``He has a look in \n     his eye and you trust him.''\n       Higdon started out in accounting at the University of \n     Kentucky but found marketing more to his taste. ``It was \n     exciting. It was fun. It was creative,'' he said. ``You got \n     these marketing problems and there were 30, 40, 50 different \n     ways to come up with a solution.''\n       He had never been on a plane before, but on a whim Higdon \n     left a summer job before his senior year to fly with a co-\n     worker to Europe. He visited 13 countries on about $4 a day, \n     he said, and discovered a personal maturity and a love of \n     travel that have marked his career since.\n       His first job out of college was as a part-time baggage \n     handler for Piedmont Airlines in Louisville--not for the $6 \n     an hour, Higdon said, but for the free flights, employees got \n     if the planes weren't full.\n       ``I flew 100,000 miles that year. We'd fly out to L.A. for \n     ladies night at the Red Onion, fly to Miami for the Super \n     Bowl, all we did was travel--it was so much fun,'' he said. \n     ``I've worked for an airline most of my life since. Travel is \n     the spice of life.''\n       Even the full-time jobs at Yellow Freight and Emery \n     Worldwide that followed had a touch of the exotic for Higdon. \n     ``Every piece of freight had a destination or an origin in \n     cities all over the world,'' he said.\n       He was a sales manager for the local office of Emery parent \n     CF Airfreight when UPS won landing rights in Japan and hired \n     him to run the Louisville office of its new UniStar cargo \n     company. His charge was finding enough freight customers to \n     fill the overnight package-delivery jets flying to and from \n     Japan.\n       ``I was one of the first people hired to a significant \n     management position from outside UPS,'' Higdon said. ``In \n     less than two years this was the most profitable of their 40 \n     offices in the U.S.''\n       UPS later named Higdon the first marketing manager of its \n     own air-cargo division and had him create its first air-\n     passenger charter service.\n       ``In a real sense I've been like a corporate \n     entrepreneur,'' Higdon said. ``Every job I've had (with UPS) \n     was a new job. I never went into a position where I was \n     replacing somebody.''\n       Doug Kuelpman, a former boss at UPS, said Higdon \n     ``understands the business world and what has to be done. He \n     has a knack.\n       ``I never had to tell Steve more than once about doing \n     something, even in areas where he may not have felt well-\n     equipped going into it. He's the kind of guy who likes to put \n     his head down and charge.''\n       In 1995, UPS ``loaned'' Higdon to the development \n     partnership to help recruit transportation-intensive \n     businesses. Louisville Mayor Dave Armstrong was county judge-\n     executive at the time and worked with Higdon in an \n     unsuccessful attempt to lure a new Harley-Davidson \n     manufacturing plant to the area.\n       ``We were out of the picture altogether'' when he and \n     Higdon went to work on the project, but in the end, ``we were \n     barely edged out'' by Kansas City, Armstrong said. ``He did a \n     great job with that.''\n       Higdon concentrated on a strategy for attracting high-tech \n     industries and recruited seven computer-repair firms with 700 \n     jobs by the end of 1996.\n       But while he loved his work, Higdon said, ``there was never \n     a time I felt this is where I want to be.'' The following \n     year he went to Cobb for advice on starting his own company.\n       Instead, Cobb hired Higdon to head the business-attraction \n     efforts of what had become Greater Louisville Inc.\n       His first day on the job, Oct. 8, 1997, Higdon told Cobb \n     that UPS was planning to expand its operations and was \n     seriously considering Columbus, Ohio, as the site.\n       That conversation resulted in five months of intensive \n     negotiations that ended with the announcement that the $1 \n     billion expansion and its 6,000 jobs were ticketed for \n     Louisville.\n       As a former UPS insider, Higdon had ``a good sense of what \n     was going on'' inside the company, Cobb said, and he played \n     ``a huge role'' in the negotiations' success.\n       Higdon is credited with helping develop the innovative \n     Metropolitan College concept that lets UPS package handlers \n     work their night shifts while attending college.\n       When Cobb said last fall that he wanted to step down as \n     president and CEO, the board of directors decided to look \n     internally for a successor, said Ed Glasscock, chairman of \n     the board's search committee. The aim was to maintain \n     momentum and avoid a long adjustment period under a new \n     executive.\n       They chose Higdon.\n       ``It's not fair to characterize it as Doug naming his \n     successor. We asked Doug for his recommendations,'' Glasscock \n     said. ``You had a number of independent business people on \n     the search committee who reviewed the job description and \n     Steve's background. We felt he matched up, not because Doug \n     said he was the perfect candidate. We came to that conclusion \n     independently.''\n       Choosing a successor internally is not unusual in \n     corporations, Higdon said, and, under Cobb, Greater \n     Louisville Inc. adopted the corporate model in its structure \n     and thinking.\n       ``That's why we're successful,'' he said. ``The mentality \n     is we're all running a business here.''\n       Running a business--his own--is still on Higdon's mind, \n     though it's been pushed into the indefinite future. He said \n     he is committed to his new job for at least three years and \n     that has its rewards.\n       ``I love dealing with people more than anything,'' he said. \n     ``Since I was a kid I loved to be out among people.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S966-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S966-S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN MEMORY OF GEORGE A. ATHANSON\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on January 11, 2000, with the passing \nof George A. Athanson, the state of Connecticut lost a faithful and \ncompanionate public servant and one of its most colorful political \nfigures in recent memory. Often called the ``people's mayor,'' George \nwas one of the longest serving and most beloved mayors in the history \nof Hartford, Connecticut. I would like to take a few moments to reflect \non his many contributions to the city of Hartford.\n  George Athanson was a product of the city he came to love and serve \nso well. A Hartford-born son of Greek heritage, he attended Hartford \nPublic High School, where his intelligence and personal charm won him \nthe admiration of his peers and teachers alike. He went on to Amherst \nCollege where he graduated cum laude with a degree in political \nscience. Following a short stint in the Marines, George returned to \nacademia, this time to the University of Chicago law school where he \nreceived a law degree in 1955. George would also earn a masters in \ninternational relations from the University of Connecticut in 1958.\n  George's love for his home town and affinity for learning lead him to \nteaching at the University of Hartford. As a professor of history and \npolitical science, George was known for a dramatic flair that enlivened \nhis classes--a flair that George would bring to the mayor's office with \nhis election in 1971. His magnetic personality, energy, creativity and \nverve for the dramatic contributed to his tremendous popularity and \nresulted in one of the longest mayoral tenures in Hartford's history, \nfrom 1971 to 1981.\n  He considered himself a liberal Democrat and was confident that \ngovernment could play a role in solving social and economic problems. \nGeorge was a colorful politician with a flamboyant style. While he was \nhard working, his efforts were often overshadowed by the creative and \nnovel actions he undertook to promote the city. On one occasion, George \nrowed across the Connecticut River holding a state flag and dressed as \nGeorge Washington to protest a General Assembly vote. On another \noccasion, he stepped into a boxing ring with a Republican opponent to \nraise money for charity. And in perhaps his best known act of political \ntheater, George showed up to promote development at Brainard Airport in \nHartford dressed as the Red Baron and climbed into the cockpit of a bi-\nplane for photographers.\n  It wasn't these dramatics that made George Athanson so popular, \nhowever, but his underlying dedication to the city of Hartford. He \nhumanized the mayor's office. George was a man of great personal \nstrength and he used his talent and energy to bring the city together. \nHe built and maintained lines of communication among the city's diverse \nracial and ethnic communities and in the process became the people's \nmayor.\n  It was fitting that in his final days in office, George continued \nwhat had become a tradition during his tenure, the delivery of the \nannual New Year's poem. The poems were symbolic of the man who composed \nthem--witty, humorous and full of political insight. With tears in his \neyes, George delivered his last New Year's poem in 1981 entitled Ode to \nthe People of Hartford, which read in part:\n\n     Those stunts for charity, I did my part\n     ``Buffoon,'' critics said, but where's THEIR heart?\n     Resolutions by the thousands, I've made my mark\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\n     Now it's time for a stroll through the park.\n\n  Indeed, George did leave his mark. He will long be remembered as a \npolitical leader of great insight, compassion, wit, and enduring \naffection for the people he felt so privileged to serve. My thoughts \nand prayers go out to his wife of 37 years, Zoe, and their son \nArthur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S967-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CONGRATULATING THE COMMUNITY OF FILLMORE\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to offer my \ncongratulations to the community of Fillmore, New York on the occasion \nof its sesquicentennial, and to wish them great success with their May \n27 to 29 celebration of this milestone.\n  What is now Fillmore was originally a small settlement nestled into \nthe corner where Cold Creek joins the Genesee River. The land was once \npart of the Caneadea Indian Reservation. By 1826, the Seneca Indians, \nwho owned the land, had sold off all of the reservation. In 1850, \nduring the Presidency of Millard Fillmore, the second New York State \nnative to hold that distinguished office, a post office was \nestablished. Local lore has it that the citizens decided to name the \nsettlement Fillmore in order to convince the government to establish \nthe post office.\n  The first settlers were attracted to the area by timber, but the \nbuilding of the Genesee Valley Canal Line connecting the Erie Canal to \nthe Allegany River brought an economic boom to all the areas along the \nline, including Fillmore. With its fertile soil, the Community \neventually also became a farming area.\n  The citizens of Fillmore are proud of their backgrounds, their \ncommunity, their State and their country. It is a community with a \nstrong work ethic. It places a high priority on education and for years \nhas supported a superior school system that is the envy of many larger \ncommunities. It is proud of the success of its young people, both those \nwho leave and those who stay and believes that the values instilled by \nthe citizens of the community is one of the reasons their young people \nare successful in their careers, be they farmers or educators in \nFillmore, government workers in Washington, business leaders in \nFillmore or across the country, or professors in America's great \ncolleges and universities.\n  Fillmore has contributed many of its finest young men and women to \nserve this country in war and peace. All of them have served their \ncountry and their community with distinction and honor. During the \nMemorial Day weekend sesquicentennial celebration, Fillmore will \nremember with pride all of those service men and women who have served \nand are serving. It will pay special homage to those whose service \nrequired the ultimate sacrifice.\n  The community is planning for its future. It is hopeful of attracting \nnew and modern businesses to the community. It is developing community \nprojects to improve key services and improve the environment. It \nintends to continue to improve its already outstanding public school by \nadding any needed facilities and continuing to attract outstanding \nteachers.\n  It is anticipating with excitement its next 150 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S967-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1996 TELECOMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, 4 years ago, Congress passed a \nlandmark measure, the Telecommunications Act of 1996. This bill was \npassed in an attempt to break down some of the regulatory barriers \namong various communications sectors. It is one of the sparks that \nignited our booming new economy in this information technology age.\n  In New York especially, the 1996 law has created competition in local \ntelephone networks, areas previously dominated by monopolies. After an \n18 month marathon of hard work by the New York State Public Service \nCommission and a thorough review by the Federal Communications \nCommission, Bell Atlantic became the first Bell operating company in \nthe country to offer long distance service. Already, nearly one million \nNew Yorkers have exercised their right to choose a new local telephone \ncompany. Creative new packages of local/long distance and ``all \ndistance'' telecom services are being offered by many different \ncarriers. To date, there are more than 350 competitive local exchange \ncarriers, CLECs, in the country that are able to provide local \ntelephone service, furthering consumer choice options.\n  Competition and innovation is working as we intended with the Telecom \nAct, and our experience in New York is proof positive.\n  I commend Bell Atlantic, the newer carriers on the scene, and our own \nNew York State Public Service Commission Chairman Maureen Helmer and \nher team for their hard work in bringing the benefits of competition to \nall New Yorkers. It has been well worth the effort, and provides a \nvaluable road map to competition for other States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S967-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LLOYD REDMAN\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nLloyd Redman on the occasion of a special recognition of his commitment \nto Kentucky's youth.\n  Lloyd Redman has led a life that is certainly worthy of recognition. \nFirst and foremost, Lloyd is a dedicated family man. He and his wife of \n55 years, Loretta, are the proud parents of two children, who have \nblessed them with three grandchildren and one great grandchild.\n  Lloyd also is a tried and true Kentuckian. He grew up in Kentucky and \nplayed basketball and football at Okalona High School. After high \nschool Lloyd played football for Western Kentucky University and the \nUniversity of Louisville, where he received a bachelor of science \ndegree in 1949, and a masters degree in 1955. Lloyd's football talent \nalso earned him a place on the 1944 U.S. Navy team. Lloyd was skilled \nat baseball too, and served as captain of the U of L baseball team in \n1949. He gave a great deal of his time and energy playing and coaching \nsports in Kentucky. Lloyd has coached at Okalona High School, Southern \nHigh School, and Durrett High School and was named ``Jefferson County \nFootball Coach of the Year'' in 1959. He also coached football, \nbasketball and softball at The Cabbage Patch for eleven years. Lloyd \ncurrently works with the Cabbage Patch Settlement House in Louisville \nto help provide athletic, arts and educational programs for children.\n  While Lloyd obviously loves youth athletics, he is equally as \nconcerned for the educational well-being of Kentucky's children. He \nreceived administration certification from Eastern Kentucky University \nin 1962, and served in numerous administrative positions within the \nJefferson County school system including director of adult education \nand administrative problems, assistant and associate superintendent, \nand he currently serves as a consultant at the Kentucky State \nDepartment of Education.\n  Lloyd Redman has had a positive influence on Kentucky's youth \nthroughout his many years as administrator, coach, and mentor--and I am \ncertain his concern for and service to the community and its children \nwill not end here. Lloyd, on behalf of my colleagues and myself, thank \nyou for your service and congratulations on your worthy \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S967-4", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S967-S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IN RECOGNITION OF SENATOR ALAN CRANSTON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to inform \nmy colleagues of the recent achievement of a friend and former member \nof this body, Senator Alan Cranston. On Tuesday March 14, 2000, in San \nFrancisco, Senator Cranston will receive the prestigious W. Averell \nHarriman Award from the Lawyers Alliance for World Security for his \ntireless efforts to achieve a safer, more peaceful world.\n  Alan Cranston served the people of California in the United States \nSenate, in the seat I now occupy, for 24 years. During this time he \ndistinguished himself as one of this institution's most passionate and \neffective voices for the rights of ordinary people. From protecting a \nwoman's right to choose, to fighting for adequate and affordable \nhousing, to making certain our veterans are treated with the respect \nthey deserve, Senator Cranston devoted his career to making this nation \na stronger, more decent place.\n  One of the most important ways he set about making his vision for a \nbetter America a reality was by not limiting his efforts to these \nshores alone.\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\nAlan Cranston is very much a citizen of the world. Having witnessed the \ndevastation of war in Europe and Japan, he has always acted on the \nbelief that America's future cannot be guaranteed unless the world's \nis. And nothing threatens global security more than the continuing \nprevalence and proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  There are few people who are more dedicated to the reduction and \nelimination of nuclear weapons than Alan Cranston. So deeply does he \nfeel about this issue that he has made it his life's work. In 1995, \nwith the guidance of President Mikhail Gorbachev and others, he \nlaunched the Nuclear Weapon Elimination Initiative. From this initial \nblueprint sprang the Global Security Institute. As its president, \nSenator Cranston and GSI are committed to educating the people of the \nworld and their leaders about the enormous threats posed by nuclear \nweapons.\n  It is for his work with GSI, and indeed his literal lifetime of \ncommitment to global peace, that Senator Cranston so richly deserves \nthe W. Averell Harriman Award. Few men or women have done so much to \nsecure a safe future for all the people of the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S968-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF ROBERT DONOVAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise \ntoday to recognize the 33 years of dedicated government service of Mr. \nRobert Donovan of Connecticut. His retirement from the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development on February 3, 2000 marks the end of a \ndistinguished and highly esteemed career in public service.\n  In September of 1968, Mr. Donovan began his career with the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development as a Housing Intern in the \nPhiladelphia Office. Two years later he moved to Hartford, Connecticut \nto become an Urban Renewal Representative. Over the next thirty years \nMr. Donovan's dedication and commitment guided him through various \nroles within the Department, such as the Director of the Housing \nManagement Division and the Director of the Multifamily Housing \nDivision. He retired as a member of the leadership team of the \nConnecticut Multifamily Program Center.\n  For the better part of his adult life, Bob worked on behalf of \ncountless Connecticut families. He believed that a safe, affordable \nhome should be attainable for those who are committed to working for \nit. A home is more than just bricks and boards, it represents an \nopportunity for betterment and is the foundation for success. Bob's \nefforts day in and day out made that opportunity a possibility for \nConnecticut's citizens.\n  In each role that he assumed, be it representative or director, Bob \nremained responsive to the people he served.

Mr. President, I rise today to address a very \nserious development in foreign trade. It is a development which hurts \nAmerican interests. It has been brewing for quite some time, and it \nfinally came to a head last week in Geneva. A World Trade Organization \n(WTO) appeals panel ruled against us in a case the European Union \nbrought against American tax law.\n  The ruling was not a complete surprise. A few months ago, the WTO \nruled that our laws for Foreign Sales Corporations, usually known as \nFSC's, are illegal export subsidies. We appealed that decision. We lost \nthe appeal. The WTO said that we have until October 1 of this year to \ncome into compliance with the ruling.\n  Why is the WTO dealing with this case to begin with? Why isn't it \nsticking to its mandate, which is international trade, and stay out of \ntax matters?\n  The EU brought this case to the WTO 2 years ago. In doing so, Europe \nbroke an agreement with us that dates back to 1981. Congress passed the \nFSC in 1984. I remember very well all the work that we put into \ncrafting the rules to place U.S. exports on a more equal footing with \nEuropean competition. In crafting the rules, we relied on that 1981 \nunderstanding with the EU. It confirmed that foreign source income need \nnot be taxed, and that failing to tax such income is not a subsidy. \nEuropean exporters are not taxed on such income, and they enjoy value \nadded tax rebates on exports as well.\n  This case is just another step in a European Union campaign which \nundermines the world trading system.\n  We saw it very clearly last year in the run-up to the Seattle \nministerial. EU leaders tried in every way they could to avoid coming \nto the table to talk seriously about their number one problem: \nagriculture.\n  First, they started a public relations campaign to downplay \nexpectations. In a number of meetings, they hinted that the Seattle \ntalks would probably fail. Second, they tried to overload the \nnegotiating agenda. They wanted to turn the trade talks into such a \ncomplex undertaking that we would never get to the real problem: EU \nagriculture. Third, they stalled in Geneva, so there wasn't any \nagreement on the scope of agriculture talks in Seattle. In 1995, they \nagreed to start agriculture talks in January 2000. But they wanted to \nput off getting down to business for as long as possible.\n  They are still trying to put it off. Putting it off hurts American \nfarmers and agro-business. Putting it off hurts developing countries. \nPutting it off even hurts Europe itself in the long term. It just \nundermines confidence in the world trading system.\n  This FSC case makes things worse. Let's be very clear on what's going \non here. We can set aside the European rhetoric about ``respecting \ninternational obligations'' in tax policy. That's not what this case is \nabout. If the EU were serious about ``respect for international \nobligations,'' it would take a close look at the tax policies of its \nmembers. This case is not about respecting international obligations.\n\n  This case is not about tax policy. If the EU were seriously concerned \nabout the trade effects of tax policy, it wouldn't file a case in the \nWorld Trade Organization. That's no way to fix an international tax \nproblem. Instead, it would seek multi-party talks in an organization \nlike the OECD or the UN. But the EU doesn't really care about tax \npolicy in this case.\n  This case is not even about money. The EU has no real commercial \ninterest at stake here. They haven't demonstrated any appreciable \nadverse impact on European companies from US tax laws. In fact, a \nnumber of European companies benefit from FSC! They have domestic \nsubsidiaries in the United States, and these subsidiaries have set up \nForeign Sales Corporations.\n  So what is this case about? It's about revenge. Pure, simple revenge. \nThe Eurocrats want revenge for losing WTO disputes with the United \nStates over bananas and beef. That's an open secret. Everyone knows \nwhere this case came from. It didn't come from European manufacturers \nfacing unfair competition from US firms because of FSC. It didn't come \nfrom European banks. Or from European consumers. Or from European \nfarmers. It didn't come from the members states. It came from EU \nbureaucrats, the gnomes of Brussels.\n  They were angry over losing the beef and banana disputes with the \nUnited States. The cases were long and hard. They took years. The EU \nfought us all the way. They lost at every turn, because we were in the \nright. When they refused to correct their illegal policies, the WTO \nauthorized us to retaliate legally. And we did.\n  For revenge, the Eurocrats wanted to poke us in the eye, and show us \nthat they could hurt us. So they took this case, which had been sitting \non their shelf for years. They dusted it off and sent it to the WTO, \ndespite our 1981 agreement with them on tax policy.\n  Well, they're playing with fire. Using the WTO as an instrument of \nrevenge is dangerous for them, and dangerous for us. The WTO is a five-\nyear old child. Its\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\ndispute settlement system is still young and fragile. The FSC case \nstrains its resources, which are limited. But more important, the FSC \ncase strains the political acceptability of the WTO system.\n  The political leaders of the EU should not have let this case go \nforward. It was a bad judgement on their part. Now it is in their \ninterest and in the interest of the world trade system for them to \nsettle this case amicably and fast. It will take wisdom and courage for \nthem to do so. I hope they find that wisdom and courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S969-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN C. SCHNABEL\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of \nJohn C. Schnabel, who retired after fourteen years of service from the \nWisconsin Association of County Veteran's Service Officers. He began \nhis career with the Wisconsin Association of County Veteran's Service \nOfficers in 1989 as the Secretary of the organization. During that time \nhe used his personal laptop computer to electronically record \nAssociation records. This included researching and organizing a history \nof all CVSOs and Assistant CVSOs. He also developed and printed the \nfirst handbook for Association Officers so that policies, procedures \nand other information were easily transferred from one secretary to the \nnext. John Schnabel was effective in his career as Secretary of CVSO \nand went on to become Second Vice President in 1994, First Vice \nPresident in 1995 and President in 1996. Schnabel has been the Langlade \nCounty Veteran's Services Officer for the last 14 years and is the \nfirst service officer from the county to be elected president of the \norganization.\n  During his time as president he became instrumental in the \nestablishment of the Advocacy Award as well as the state representative \nto coordinate access to VA OnLine, initiating sites for CVSOs and WDVA. \nHe has worked on many Ad Hoc committees regarding computer operations \nand program development. He most recently acted as a member of an Ad \nHoc committee to establish long term goals and training for the CVSO \nassociation. During his tenure, Schnabel was also named a recipient of \nthe Citation for Meritorious Service, awarded by the American Legion's \nNational Veteran's Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission in Washington, \nD.C.\n  The staff and veteran clients of the Langlade County Veteran's \nService Office and the Wisconsin Association of County Veterans Service \nOfficers will miss John's wonderful advocacy work greatly. However, \nNancy, his wife of 36 years will enjoy spending more time with \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S969-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S969]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ALEISHA CRAMER\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President--I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend an outstanding student athlete from my home \nstate of Colorado. Aleisha Cramer of Green Mountain High School has \nbeen named the 1999-2000 Gatorade National High School Girls Soccer \nPlayer of the Year. Aleisha's hard work and dedication earned her the \nprestige of being the number one soccer player of 246,000 high school \ngirls across the country.\n  Ms. Cramer's athletic accomplishments include being the Parade Player \nof the Year, the National Soccer Coaches of America's Player of the \nYear as well as being accepted on the U.S. Women's National Team. \nAleisha has lead her team to the State Finals for three consecutive \nyears, winning the championship in 1997 and 1999. Not only is Aleisha \nan amazing athlete, she is honor student with a 4.0 grade point \naverage, a member of the student senate and a volunteer for church and \nschool groups.\n  It is an honor for me to recognize the achievements of this amazing \nyoung woman. Aleisha leads by example and her work ethic, talent and \ncivic duties have made her a role model that any student can look up \nto. Aleisha Cramer has proved what hard work as a student, athlete and \ncommunity member can accomplish.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate Aleisha Cramer, the 1999-2000 \nGatorade National High School Girls Soccer Player of the Year, for her \naccomplishments. She has made the State of Colorado and this nation \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S969-3", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S969-S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    GRACE TOWNS HAMILTON (1907-1992)\n\n   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, ``A political leader who changes \nhis stances to fit the times is often called a politician in the \ndirtiest sense of the word. One who refuses to change, who remains with \nher lifelong ideals, is often called reactionary and stubborn. But such \na person may also be seen as possessing both honesty and intrigue.'' So \nspoke Alton Hornsby, Morehouse College historian in 1990 as the city of \nAtlanta remembered one of its greatest treasures, Grace Towns Hamilton.\n  Grace Towns was quite simply, a legend in her own time. Born in \nAtlanta in 1907, Grace entered this world during a time of severe \nracial tension. In fact, her birthday came only 5 months after a \nferocious racial massacre in Atlanta. For whites, the first decades of \nthe twentieth century were the ``Progressive Era.'' For blacks, it was \nindeed a most dismal era. The end of Reconstruction had left blacks as \nan often despised and almost always disenfranchised class made up \nlargely of dependent laborers with little land and even less rights. \nAtlanta University (AU), on the city's western reaches, seemed an \nisland of tranquility in the South, where blacks experienced the worst \nof the racial oppression and exclusion. Grace Towns' father was a \nprofessor at AU and she was able to enjoy a sheltered existence where \nboth the student body and the faculty were integrated.\n  Grace Towns flourished while growing up at AU. Once she matriculated \nas a collegiate there, Grace became active in the Interracial Student \nForum. She took this advantage of the opportunity to discuss a wide \nrange of topics, including those which were most racially sensitive. \nFor her, this was a forum to bring black and white students together. \nWhile she was editor of the AU student newspaper, the Scroll, Grace \nwrote of the forum, ``the Forum has given us contact. We have heard \neach other's music, and talked as fellow students.''\n  After graduating from AU in 1927, Grace Towns went on to pursue a \nmaster's degree in psychology at Ohio State University in Columbus, \nOhio. During her college years, she became involved with the YWCA. The \nAtlanta chapter had a burgeoning student movement that took a divergent \napproach on race that was less cautious than its parent organization at \nthe time. It was interracial far before the first ``Negro'' was \nappointed to the board. After she graduated, the National YWCA offered \nher a secretarial job in one of its Negro branches. A favorite \npsychology professor at AU had a high regard for the psychology \ndepartment at Ohio State and seeing as how the YWCA job would make it \npossible to finance her post-graduate education at the same time, Grace \ndecided to go.\n  Grace Towns later admitted that there was no way she could have been \nprepared for what she faced in Ohio. The cocoon of Atlanta University \nill-prepared her for the shock that awaited her in the Ohio capital \ncity. Barred from movies, restaurants, hotels, even public restrooms, \nTowns felt accepted only within the confines of the Ohio State \npsychology department. Even the YWCA, which in Atlanta had seemed so \ndedicated to the rights of all women, without regard to the color of \ntheir skin, had its barriers and limitations. The prejudice and violent \nattitude towards blacks at the time made the goals and the religious \nand moral precepts professed by the organization a challenge that the \n``Y'' often failed to meet.\n  These factors combined to make Grace Towns not sorry to leave \nColumbus, Ohio in the summer of 1928. She returned to Atlanta to finish \nthe written requirements for her master's from Ohio State, having \nalready finished the course work. After receiving the degree in 1929, \nshe went on to teach at the Atlanta School of Social Work and also at \nClark College in Atlanta. She married the love of her life, Henry Cooke \nHamilton, in the summer of 1930. They moved shortly thereafter to \nMemphis where her husband had taken a job doing triple duty as dean, \nregistrar and professor of education.\n  Grace Hamilton continued teaching, even through the first months of \nher pregnancy with her first daughter Eleanor, born in March of 1931. \nShe had\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\ntaken a position at LeMoyne Junior College and resumed teaching at \nLeMoyne while Eleanor was still young. She continued to teach there, \nalthough circumstances compelled her to undertake courses that she did \nnot feel qualified to teach. In 1934, this frustration came to a head \nwhen gender issues and the Great Depression forced LeMoyne to terminate \nher employment. After volunteering with the NAACP and the YWCA, Grace \ntook a position with the Works Progress Administration (WPA) conducting \na survey on The Urban Negro Worker in the United States 1925-1936.\n  In 1941, the Hamilton family returned to Atlanta where Grace's \nhusband became principal of Atlanta University's Laboratory High \nSchool. Grace had never set out to be a leader, but at this point she \nwas thirty-four years old, had an advanced education degree, and had \nworked steadily at professional jobs for more than a decade. She knew \nthe value of community activism and education and set out to take part \nin the fight. This led her to the Atlanta Urban League.\n  From 1943 until 1960, Grace Hamilton served as the Executive Director \nof the Atlanta Urban League. During her tenure, she shaped the path of \nthe League to better serve Atlanta, which was increasingly being seen \nas the South's ``hub city.'' She moved the focus away from the national \norganization's emphasis on philanthropy and job procurement to a more \nAtlanta-focused program of housing, equality in school funding, voter \nregistration and better medical care. Her biographers, Lorraine Nelson \nSpritzer and Jean B. Bergmark, wrote of her legacy that it ``. . .was \nbetter appreciated by whites than blacks. The white world glorified \nher, clothing her in virtue without flaws. The black community viewed \nher with greater ambivalence, seeing blemish as well as the best and \ncame closer to discerning the real and important person she was, \nprobably because she was truly one of their own.''\n  After Mrs. Hamilton resigned in 1960, she set out on her path to \npolitical success. She ran in a special off-year election in 1965 which \nbrought her and six other black Democrats into the Georgia state \nlegislature. The first black woman in the Georgia State Legislature, \nHamilton was called ``Atlanta's only real integrationist,'' ``a \nleader,'' and a ``bridge-builder.'' It was here where she made her most \nlasting contribution to her city and state, and all agreed she was that \nrare person who gave politics a good name. I remember fondly serving \nwith her while I was in the Georgia state senate from 1970 until 1974.\n  While serving in the state legislature, Grace Hamilton sought to \nstrengthen local government, particularly the Mayor's role. She also \nworked towards equal justice for blacks, and the elimination wasted tax \ndollars by seeking consolidation of Georgia's numerous counties. In \n1971, she persuaded her colleagues in the Legislature to approve a \nsales tax increase to finance a city-wide rail and subway system--now \nknown in Atlanta as MARTA, a crown jewel among the nation's urban mass \ntransit systems. Her time in the Legislature was infinitely successful \nand in 1984, at the age of 78 she began to consider retirement. She \ndecided for ``one last go-around'' but failed to detect the political \nrisk she faced. She was defeated by a 26 year-old graduate student in \npublic administration at Georgia State named Mable Thomas. After almost \ntwenty years in public office, Grace Hamilton set out for the next \nphase of life.\n  Grace Hamilton lived on another eight years, overseeing the care of \nher ailing husband and guiding the search for a suitable depository for \nher papers and effects. She collected numerous accolades and awards \nbefore she finally succumbed to illness in 1992, survived by her \ndaughter Eleanor.\n  As we come to the end of Black History Month, I respectfully submit \nthis insert into the Congressional Record in honor of one of my \npersonal heroes, Grace Towns Hamilton. Her service has been an \ninspiration to me and many others who have known her. I am proud of her \nlegacy in Georgia and pleased to have this opportunity to share it. I \nwould also like to thank Mrs. Hamilton's biographers, Lorraine Nelson \nSpritzer and Jean B. Bergmark, for their contribution to Grace's \nlegacy--Grace Towns Hamilton and the Politics of Southern Change.\n  Thank you Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S970-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             JAKE D. ROBEL\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to extend \nmy heartfelt sympathies to the family of 6-year-old Jake D. Robel of \nBlue Springs, Missouri.\n  One week ago Jake died after being dragged for almost five miles at \nhigh speed by a man who had stolen Jake's mother's car in Independence, \nMissouri.\n  Jake's mom had stopped at a sandwich shop to run in and pick up her \norder. She left her car running and Jake was waiting in the car.\n  This town and area should be safe. Many would say tragedies like this \none happen everywhere else, but not here. In this area, there are \npeople who always leave their car doors unlocked and their keys in the \nignition. Many leave their homes unlocked and have no idea where to \nfind the house key.\n  Unfortunately, that sense of security is now shattered.\n  In those few moments it took Jake's mom to run into the sandwich \nshop, an assailant jumped in her vehicle and sped away. Jake, with his \nmother's help, tried to escape from the vehicle, but became entangled \nin the seat belt. In a heartbeat, the car door closed--with Jake \ntangled in the seat belt--being dragged behind.\n  I can't imagine the loss felt by the family and friends of Jake \nRobel. However, I want to join with the countless families in Missouri \nand across the nation in sending my thoughts and prayers to those in \ngrief.\n  Mr. President, in addition, it is important to recognize the bravery, \nheroism, and citizenship of those that tried to come to Jake's rescue.\n  The man who stole the car took off on Interstate 70 at high speed. \nAll along the way, people honked and shouted from their cars for him to \nstop. The driver was stopped and apprehended, not by the police, but by \napproximately four gentlemen who managed to surround the vehicle after \nthe man left I-70 and turned onto a busy street in Independence, \nMissouri. The man tried to escape on foot, but was stopped by these \nheroes who tied his feet together and sat on him until the police \narrived. These men acted swiftly and responsibly.\n  Once again, Mr. President, my thoughts and prayers go out to the \nfamily of Jake Robel as well as to all those who witnessed such a \ntragedy. I also want to recognize the gentlemen who apprehended the \ndriver. These honorable citizens have shown us first-hand that heroes \ndo exist.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S970-2", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S970-S971]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RETIREMENT OF CHIEF ANGELO TOSCANO\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to rise today to pay \ntribute to a well-respected and remarkable officer, Chief Angelo \nToscano, whose retirement from the Wilton Police Force marks the end of \n43 years as a Connecticut law enforcement officer. Day in and day out, \nChief Toscano ensured that safety and peace prevailed in the Wilton \ncommunity. I am honored to extend thanks and appreciation to him. On \nbehalf of the people of Wilton and the entire state of Connecticut, \nwhom I am privileged to represent in the United States Senate.\n  Chief Toscano was born and raised in Darien, Connecticut. After \ngraduating from Darien High School he attended Norwalk Community \nCollege and the Federal Bureau of Investigation National Academy. In \n1957, after serving in the United States Marine Corps for three years, \nhe began his career in law enforcement as a patrolman. His dedication \nearned him the respect of his colleagues, and his leadership propelled \nhim up the ranks--from patrolman, to sergeant, to detective, and \nfinally, to Chief of Police.\n  Throughout his career in public service, Chief Toscano remained on \nthe cutting edge of law enforcement techniques, always believing that \nthere was more for him to learn. Chief Toscano continued his training \nup until the very end of his career, including participation in the \nConnecticut Police Academy, the Darien Power Squadron, and a wide range \nof F.B.I. training programs.\n  Chief Toscano embodied everything a community could hope for in a \nChief of Police. He was a veteran of the streets\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nwhose years of experience became the source of his good judgment and \ndependability. He was a well-trained cop whose background and skill \nensured that, as Chief, he led with a steadfast and reliable hand. \nMoreover, Chief Toscano was an innovative leader, with the uncanny \nability to incorporate his specialized skills with his personal insight \nand creativity. Under his leadership, the Wilton Police Force \nintroduced such initiatives as D.A.R.E. and C.O.P.S., as well as the \ninstallation of defibrillators into every patrol car.\n  The job of a chief of police is a demanding task that requires \nstrength of character and good judgment. One need not look far for \nproof of Chief Toscano's success and ability, for it is visible in the \nsafety that Wilton residents relish everyday.\n  Today, it is my pleasure to join the Town of Wilton and the State of \nConnecticut in thanking Chief Toscano for his many years of dedicated \nservice and wishing him well in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S971-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S971-S972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I am very pleased today that the Senate \nhas confirmed New Mexican Sylvia Baca for Assistant Secretary of the \nInterior for Land and Minerals Management. I have been working hard to \nsee this day, and I am glad the Senate has finally confirmed this \nworthy individual.\n  Ms. Baca is a native New Mexican who has worked for the Department of \nInterior for over four years, and has been Acting Assistant Secretary \nsince November of 1998. Since January of 1995, she served as Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management.\n  Assistant Secretary for Land and Minerals Management has direct \nsupervisory responsibility for three principal bureaus of the \nDepartment of the Interior: The Bureau of Land Management, the Minerals \nManagement Service, and the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \nEnforcement. In 1997, she served as Acting Director for the Bureau of \nLand Management. in such capacity, she was responsible for direct \nmanagement of 10,000 employees, a budget of $1.2 billion, and the \nmaintenance of 270 million acres of public lands and 570 million acres \nof subsurface minerals.\n  Ms. Baca previously served the state of New Mexico with distinction \nas a Senior Fiscal Analyst for the state Legislative Finance Committee \nfor five years. Ms. Baca served as Director of Finance and Management \nfor the City of Albuquerque immediately before leaving for Washington, \nD.C. Some of you may know that I served as what was then the equivalent \nof Mayor of Albuquerque, New Mexico's largest city. I can assert that \nadministering the operating budget and administering city employees is \na big job.\n  Sylvia Baca has a tremendous tie to the land. Sylvia, whose New \nMexico ranching family history dates back to Spanish colonial times, is \none of the many distinguished New Mexicans who have served the Interior \nDepartment. I am sure she will continue to work with distinction and \nserve well managing our federal public lands. Based upon her experience \nand commitment, I trust she will do a good job for the people of the \nUnited States. She has demonstrated that she has the administrative \nskills and experience needed to do this job well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S972-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 310, S. 935.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 935) to amend the National Agricultural \n     Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to \n     authorize research to promote the conversion of biomass into \n     biobased industrial products, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry, with an amendment to strike all after enacting clause and \ninserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Sustainable Fuels \n     and Chemicals Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) conversion of biomass into biobased industrial products \n     offers outstanding potential for benefit to the national \n     interest through improved strategic security and balance of \n     payments, healthier rural economies, improved environmental \n     quality, near-zero net greenhouse gas emissions, technology \n     export, and sustainable resource supply;\n       (2)(A) biomass is widely available at prices that are \n     competitive with low cost petroleum; and\n       (B) the key technical challenges to be overcome in order \n     for biobased industrial products to be cost competitive are \n     finding new technology and reducing the cost of technology \n     for converting biomass into desired biobased industrial \n     products;\n       (3) biobased fuels, such as ethanol, have the clear \n     potential to be sustainable, low cost, and high performance \n     fuels that are compatible with both current and future \n     transportation systems and provide near zero net greenhouse \n     gas emissions;\n       (4) biobased chemicals--\n       (A) can provide functional replacements for essentially all \n     organic chemicals that are currently derived from petroleum; \n     and\n       (B) have the clear potential for environmentally benign \n     product life cycles;\n       (5) biobased power can provide environmental benefits, \n     promote rural economic development, and diversify energy \n     resource options;\n       (6) many biomass feedstocks suitable for industrial \n     processing show the clear potential for sustainable \n     production, in some cases resulting in improved soil \n     fertility and carbon sequestration;\n       (7)(A) grain processing mills are biorefineries that \n     produce a diversity of useful food, chemical, feed, and fuel \n     products; and\n       (B) technologies that result in further diversification of \n     the range of value-added biobased industrial products can \n     meet a key need for the grain processing industry;\n       (8)(A) cellulosic feedstocks are attractive because of \n     their low cost and widespread availability; and\n       (B) research resulting in cost-effective technology to \n     overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass would allow \n     biorefineries to produce fuels and bulk chemicals on a very \n     large scale, with a commensurately large realization of the \n     benefit described in paragraph (1);\n       (9) research into the fundamentals to understand important \n     mechanisms of biomass conversion can be expected to \n     accelerate the application and advancement of biomass \n     processing technology by--\n       (A) increasing the confidence and speed with which new \n     technologies can be scaled up; and\n       (B) giving rise to processing innovations based on new \n     knowledge;\n       (10) the added utility of biobased industrial products \n     developed through improvements in processing technology would \n     encourage the design of feedstocks that would meet future \n     needs more effectively;\n       (11) the creation of value-added biobased industrial \n     products would create new jobs in construction, \n     manufacturing, and distribution, as well as new higher-valued \n     exports of products and technology;\n       (12)(A) because of the relatively short-term time horizon \n     characteristic of private sector investments, and because \n     many benefits of biomass processing are in the national \n     interest, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to \n     provide precommercial investment in fundamental research and \n     research-driven innovation in the biomass processing area; \n     and\n       (B) such an investment would provide a valuable complement \n     to ongoing and past governmental support in the biomass \n     processing area; and\n       (13) several prominent studies, including studies by the \n     President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and \n     the National Research Council--\n       (A) support the potential for large research-driven \n     advances in technologies for production of biobased \n     industrial products as well as associated benefits; and\n       (B) document the need for a focused, integrated, and \n     innovation-driven research effort to provide the appropriate \n     progress in a timely manner.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONVERSION OF BIOMASS INTO BIOBASED INDUSTRIAL \n                   PRODUCTS.\n\n       The National Agricultural Research, Extension, and Teaching \n     Policy Act of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.) is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n\n ``Subtitle N--Conversion of Biomass Into Biobased Industrial Products\n\n     ``SEC. 1490.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for Mr. Murkowski, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2862.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to recommend that the Senate pass S. \n935.\n  At a time when American farmers and rural communities are having a \ndifficult time making ends meet, it is appropriate for the Senate to \nsupport this initiative that holds great promise for agriculture, \nstrengthens America's energy security and helps clean America's air and \nwater while dramatically reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Early civilizations relied on plants and trees for all their energy \nand food needs. With the passage of time and technological advancement, \nhowever, an increasing share of the world's energy demands shifted from \nplants and trees toward fossil fuels. Time and technology march on, and \ntoday we witness the beginning of a revolution from non-renewable \nfossil fuels toward\n\n[[Page S975]]\n\nrenewable resources that can help meet the energy demands of a world \nnow numbering six billion people. Ironically, plants and trees are once \nagain being valued as raw material for energy production because they \ncontain an enormous store of energy freely delivered by the sun.\n  Using nature's renewable raw material for production of needed fuels, \nchemicals and energy is not a new idea. What is new, however, is a \nbetter understanding of chemistry and molecular biology which has led \nto the development of advanced biotechnologies and processing \ntechniques for efficiently converting plants to energy. With these \nadvances, it is now possible to envisage a future where the world's \nthirst for additional sources of energy is fueled by biomass.\n  Biobased fuels are our best means of reducing American dependence on \nimported oil. Reliance on the unstable states of the Middle East \nadversely impacts American strategic security, and massive oil imports \nskew our balance of payments. Fuels and chemicals derived from biomass \nwill reduce our dependence on Middle Eastern oil without necessitating \na rebuilding of the existing gasoline infrastructure. With the need for \naffordable energy rising as population grows, the Middle East will \ncontrol nearly three-quarters of the world's oil this century. We have \nstark options: submit to increased influence of foreign oil cartels; \nwrangle over pipeline routes to new oil supplies at the ends of the \nEarth, such as the Caspian region; or, support research that could lead \nto a revolution in the way we produce energy.\n  In addition to fuels, biobased chemicals have the potential to \nreplace essentially all chemicals currently derived from petroleum, and \nthey are often endowed with superior performance characteristics. The \nmanufacturing of biobased products is generally more environmentally \nfriendly than analogue petrochemical processes.\n  Fuels, cloth fibers, plastics and adhesives are already produced from \ncorn; the new genetic engineering techniques will make it possible to \nuse entire plants, rather than just the tiny portion of edible grains. \nWith sound land use policies, local crops that enrich the soil, prevent \nerosion and improve local environmental conditions can be planted and \nthen harvested for co-production of food, fuel, chemicals, electricity \nand materials. Rural communities will be strengthened through the \ndiversification of marketable agricultural products and farmers will \nhave expanded sources of income.\n  Before we are able to reap the outstanding benefits offered through \nutilization of America's sustainable biomass resource, costs of the new \nconversion technology must be significantly reduced. Research offers \nthe only systematic means for creating the innovations and technical \nimprovements that will lower the costs of biomass processing. Given the \nrelatively short-term horizon characteristic of private sector \ninvestments, and because many benefits of biomass processing are in the \npublic interest, the Federal government has a compelling mandate to \nfund the necessary innovation-driven research that will result in cost \neffective technologies for biomass conversion.\n  Although government sponsored research programs have been largely \nresponsible for demonstrating the potential of biomass conversion \ntechnology, coordination among key Federal agencies is disjointed and \nfunding levels are declining. The Biomass Research and Development Act \nis designed to address these shortcomings. America's leading technical \nexperts from universities, national laboratories and the private sector \nwill be brought together in a dynamic research initiative with the \npurpose of overcoming technical barriers to low cost biomass \nconversion.\n  At a time when political compromise seems elusive and progress on \nenvironmental and energy issues often seems slow, I am convinced that \nthe idea of encouraging human ingenuity to create a sustainable \nresource for clean fuels and chemicals represents a remarkable \nopportunity for consensus. Working together we can promote research \nthat will improve our national security and balance of payments, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions and strengthen rural economies.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. \nJoseph Michels, my science policy adviser, for the excellent advice he \nhas provided me on this issue. Dr. Michels is leaving my staff to \nassume an important post at Princeton University. I shall miss him.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n\n                      jurisdictional clarification\n\n Mr. LUGAR. I would like to enter into a colloquy with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee. I want to inform my colleague that any \naction taken by the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry \nin relation to S. 935 is not an attempt to encroach on the jurisdiction \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Further, the fact \nthat S. 935 was reported from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \nand Forestry does not affect the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources over energy matters, including biofuels \nand bioenergy. Specifically, USDA biomass research and development \nprograms remain within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry and DOE biomass research and \ndevelopment programs remain within the jurisdiction of the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my colleague, the Chairman of the Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry Committee, for addressing this matter and \nclarifying our understanding that this legislation does not alter the \njurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  I would also like to note that the authorization of appropriations \ncontained in section 3 of S. 935 clarifies that money may be \nappropriated for the biomass research and development activities \ndescribed in the bill pursuant to the existing general authority of the \nSecretary of Energy to fund biomass research and development, and does \nnot create a new specific level of authorization for this program.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree and thank the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. CRAPO.

Mr. President, I will speak this evening on an issue of \ngreat importance to the country and every family in America. That is \nthe issue of education.\n  For the past 4 months, the Republicans and Democrats on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee have been working to come up \nwith a bipartisan approach to the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. Sadly, those efforts have collapsed and we are \nbeing presented with a Republican bill, the Straight A's Act, which is \nessentially a block granting of critical programs and the amassing of \nFederal resources to be distributed with little accountability by the \nStates.\n  This issue is of great importance because education is what I believe \nis fueling the great economic progress we are making today. The 5-\npercent growth in productivity in the last quarter recognizes the \ncombination of American technology, which is a product of our ideas, \nour education, and the skills and talents of the American people that \nhave been forged in the classrooms of America.\n  Just as importantly, this recognition of the centrality and \nimportance of education is shared by every American because they the \nmothers and fathers of this country, recognize that the future of their \nfamilies, the future of their children, are dependent almost \nexclusively on how well they are educated. As a result, we cannot take \nlightly the proposals that are before the Senate with regard to the \neducational policy of the United States.\n  There are some who do not think the National Government has a role in \neducation. I disagree. We recognize, of course, the primacy of States \nand localities in terms of forging educational policy, but we do have a \nrole at the national level. We have a role of providing both \nencouragement and support for local innovation and also support to \novercome local inertia.\n  We have seen that played out throughout our history. We have seen a \nsituation where years ago the States were inattentive to the needs of \nlow-income students, particularly minority students. That is one of the \nprimary impulses for the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act. \nWe have seen in the past where States were indifferent to the education \nof students with disabilities, and we acted properly and appropriately \nto do that. So we do have this national role and we have to carry it \nout conscientiously, recognizing that public education is the bulwark \nof our society and our country.\n  Ninety percent of our students attend public schools. Public schools \noffer not only educational benefits but are the devices that bring us \ntogether, the common ground, the area in which one can enter and \nprepare to seize the opportunities of life without regard to race, \ncreed, or ethnicity.\n  It is this public education system that we must enhance, reform, and \nreinvigorate. I argue that the approach to do that is not through block \ngrants. The approach is a careful consideration of the appropriate \nFederal initiatives, both in terms of resources and in terms of \nprograms, that will help stimulate reform at the local level and help \novercome the inertia and the political gridlock we see every day at the \nlocalities and at the States just as they see on certain issues in \nWashington.\n  Again, I yield, as do all my colleagues, that the Federal Government \nis the junior partner in this partnership for education in America. We \nsupply roughly 7 percent of all the resources; the States, the cities, \nand the towns supply 93 percent of the resources. However, we can do \nmuch, particularly in the area of focusing assistance on the neediest \nchildren and also, as I said before, to help invigorate our school \nsystem, to help accelerate reform.\n\n  Money isn't everything; it is vitally important, but we also need a \nsense of direction or purpose, of national statements about what is \ncritical to the Nation as well as critical to localities and to States. \nThat, too, is part and parcel to our deliberations about the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act.\n  We should be providing resources for local communities. One of the \nproblems with the educational policy in the United States is it is tied \nso closely to property tax that we can witness situations where good \nschool systems, particularly school systems in urban areas that were \nmodels of efficiency and expertise decades ago, have fallen on hard \ntimes because their property base has evaporated. People have moved to \nthe suburbs; the industries have left the central city and moved out. \nWe can help, and we do that principally through title I programs.\n  Again, as we help with resources at the local level, we cannot give \nup the idea also that we have to provide this spark of innovation, the \nspark of reform that is so critical to the efforts. I believe also that \nthis is recognized by many people at the State and local level, that \nour Goals 2000 initiative several years ago helped essentially start a \nreform process that was inchoate at the State and local level and many \nplaces that needed resources, even if there was a sense of reform. This \neffort, this identification of reform together with resources helped \nstimulate productive efforts that are improving the quality of \neducation. But I also would say we have a long way to go before we can \nsatisfy ourselves that every student in America, every child in \nAmerica, has access to excellent public schools. That should be our \ngoal, a goal we must insist upon.\n  Again, I am disappointed that efforts over the last several months to \ntry to forge bipartisan compromise on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act have failed, apparently, for the moment. Tomorrow in the \ncommittee we begin to debate a legislative proposal that is simply \nabdicating the responsibilities of the National Government to the \nStates without any real accountability. That is a wrong approach.\n  We have seen that because we have seen what the States have done in \ncontrast to what the Federal Government has done in some critical areas \nof concern. I am not trying to suggest there is any type of nefarious \nplot at the States, but we all have to recognize they are under very \nspecial pressures in terms of allocating funds, in terms of local \nproblems, a host of local issues that complicate their politics, and we \nhave an opportunity sometimes to avoid those internecine fights that go \non and provide direction that they welcome and they, in fact, in many \ncases expect.\n  One aspect of this debate about Federal versus State perspectives is \na report prepared by the General Accounting Office in 1998. It was \nfound Federal aid was seven times more targeted to poor students than \nState programs overall. It found our effort to reach out and help low-\nincome students was disproportionately greater than State efforts. I \nthink you have to ask yourself, logically, had we not acted in 1965 \nwith title I, and in Congresses subsequent to that date to help out \nlow-income students, both in center-city areas and in rural areas, \nwould they enjoy the limited success they have had to date? I am not \nsuggesting we succeeded in that arena.\n\n  I suggest you might find that same proportion of funding, those who \nare politically powerful in States, those suburban areas, those areas \nthat themselves with property tax can fund schools, would do much \nbetter. In fact,\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nour situation in center-city and rural areas would be much more severe \nwithout specified targeted Federal assistance--not a block grant, \nspecified targeted Federal assistance.\n  I should point out in the last reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act--I was a Member of the other body at that \ntime--we were aware of some of the shortcomings and limitations and \ninhibitions in the title I program, and we made changes to streamline \nit and make it more effective, as we did with several other programs. \nThe results from the last few years seem to suggest this combination of \nmore programmed and efficient Federal support, together with State \ninitiatives, have led to real improvements. We want to continue that \npartnership and certainly those improvements.\n  There is another aspect, too, that affects the State and Federal \nGovernments. I think sometimes we sit back and say: The States have it \nright; they know how to allocate and distribute funds. It turns out in \nover one-third of the States in these United States, people are suing \nthe States claiming they are unfairly distributing their school aid. If \nwe are going to turn around and give moneys to such a State without \nreal accountability, without real direction, we, frankly, are running \nright into the teeth of those suits that are saying the States do not \nknow how to spend their money fairly, wisely, or well; they are \ndisadvantaging large parts of the population.\n  I think there are many reasons why we can argue with great \ncredibility and force that Federal programs and Federal resources, \nnational policies, can complement, supplement, help States do things \nthat, because of politics, because of resource limitations, because of \na host of reasons, they would not do of their own volition.\n  There is another issue, too, and it becomes, frankly, an issue that \nis much more specific to us today than it was 10 years ago or 20 years \nago. We are in a global economy. Our competition is no longer between \nRhode Island and South Carolina or Pennsylvania and Utah. It is between \nstudents in Singapore and in Japan and around the world versus American \nstudents. To suggest at this time there is not a national need for some \ndirection, some support, some help to States to move forward their \neducational process is to disregard the global nature of the world we \nface today.\n  There are examples, frankly, of where we have acted successfully with \nfederally directed programs to set national policies with national \nresources to facilitate State reform. One I mentioned previously is \nGoals 2000. I participated in the drafting of this legislation in 1994. \nI would have liked to have gone much further in terms of \naccountability, in terms of many other things. But the sense of the \nCongress and the administration was let's get into the States' \nresources with a direction to begin to start reforming or helping their \nreform efforts. That took place. In fact, it has been acknowledged that \nGoals 2000 has been a force for reform in places such as Texas and \nGeorgia and Vermont and elsewhere. Indeed, in 1998, in another GAO \nreport, State and local officials stated:\n\n       Goals 2000 funding provided valuable assistance and that, \n     without this funding, some reform efforts would not have been \n     accomplished or would not have been accomplished as quickly.\n\n  Again, had we simply back in 1994 said take this money and do what \nyou like, without some structure, some framework, it would not have \nbeen as successful, I believe, as it has been to date.\n  There is another area where we can play a critical role--it is a role \nwe have played in the past--and that is educational technology. \nNational investment in educational technology since 1994, in programs \nsuch as the Technological Literacy Challenge Fund and the Technology \nInnovation Challenge Grants, as well as the E-Rate, have led to a \ndramatic increase in the number of schools connected to the Internet. \nAgain, these are very specific targeted national programs. Between 1994 \nand 1998, Internet access in public schools increased from 35 to 89 \npercent of schools. The percentage of public school instruction rooms \nwith Internet access also increased during this time period from 3 \npercent in 1994 to 51 percent in 1998.\n  High poverty schools, which have long lagged behind wealthier schools \nin Internet access, were as likely to have Internet access as low-\npoverty-level schools by the fall of 1998 because of these \ninitiatives--again, appropriate. We are not supplanting State and local \nefforts, but we are identifying a national need to wire up to the \nInternet the children in the classroom, providing resources, direction. \nIt gets done. It succeeds.\n  There is still a need, in fact, for additional effort in that regard. \nThat is why we are missing a real opportunity in this reauthorization \nto build upon the success of our technology initiatives. In fact, the \ngap between high- and low-poverty schools and the percentage of \nclassrooms with Internet access does not seem to be stabilized. It \nseems to be a widening; there is a bit of widening at the gap. We have \nto continue to work to make sure that gap does not exist.\n  My colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, is often quoted talking \nabout the digital divide; the fact that affluent students enjoy \ncomputer access at home and in classrooms. Low-income students do not \nhave that opportunity. In the information age that digital divide could \nbe decisive. So we have an opportunity to work now to build on prior \nsuccess to ensure we truly close the digital divide.\n  There is another area--this one, I think, is very emblematic of the \ndangers of reflexively shifting from targeted programs to block \ngrants--and that is school libraries. In 1965, Congress enacted \nlegislation in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act which \nincluded specific provisions to assist school libraries to buy library \nmaterial, principally books. But in 1981, with the advent of the Reagan \nadministration, this specific program was thrown into a large block \ngrant.\n  Now what has happened? What happened is all the material that was \nbought in 1965 through the late 1960s and 1970s is still on the shelves \nand has not been replaced because when this library program was thrown \ninto a block grant, local pressures took out the support to buy library \nbooks. It always seemed there was something else to crowd it out, some \nother immediate problem. As a result, what I believe is a strong \nnational thought that children in our schools should have up-to-date, \nmodern library books has withered away, and we can see the proof on the \nshelves of school libraries throughout this country.\n  When I was talking about this issue several years ago, a librarian in \na school in Arizona sent me a book. The title was ``The Constitution of \nthe United States,'' by James Beck. But what I thought was interesting \nis that there was a foreword by the President of the United States, \nCalvin Coolidge. The book was written in 1924 and was still on the \nshelves in 1993.\n  I went to law school. I think there were a couple of amendments to \nthe Constitution after 1924.\n  I would be hard pressed if I were a student in that school in Arizona \nto confirm or deny that fact.\n  There is another book found in Boston entitled ``Planets, Stars, and \nSpace'' which noted:\n\n       Of course, the trip (to the moon) cannot yet be made. . . . \n     It may be necessary to establish a giant artificial moon or \n     satellite a thousand miles or so above the earth, from which \n     to launch the moon rocket.\n\n  That is copyright 1957, and that was in a school library recently.\n  From my own home State, there was in a school library a book entitled \n``Ms. MD'' which stated only men could enroll in Brown Medical School, \nand the tuition--this really dates it--was $2,800 a year.\n  The effort to block grant the library program led to the \ndeterioration and destruction of the library program, and as a result \nthere are thousands of schools across the country that have books so \nout of date that if parents saw them, they would recall their child.\n  I hope we can change it. In this authorization, contrary to block \ngrant, we can try to develop another library approach to assist \nlibraries in buying not just books but CDs and all the media we need \nfor an information age.\n  The other presumption is--in addition to the fact there is a \npresumption in some quarters that the States know how to spend the \nmoney--all of the successes are because of local initiatives. The \nreality is there are too many\n\n[[Page S978]]\n\nfailing schools in America, and the people directly responsible for \nthese schools--we all admit it here--are the States and localities. I \nthink that somewhat undercuts this notion of infallibility at the local \nlevel and supports the notion that at the national level, our ideas and \nour initiatives and complementary activities have a place and a \npurpose.\n  There are about 8,000 schools across the country which are failing \ntheir own standards set by their States--not national standards but \nState standards. Ask yourself: What is happening? Why are these schools \nnot being reformed?\n  What has happened in our proposal, and I hope we can deal with it in \nthe ESEA, is we are asking for more accountability by the States. We \nare asking them to tell us: What are you going to do about these 8,000 \nschools? How are you going to fix them? Do you need additional \nresources?\n  We are not trying to be prescriptive--one way to do it--but we want \naccountability. That, too, is going to be decisively lost if we simply \nturn over large block grants to Governors and say do what you will \nbecause doing what they will has led to 8,000 schools across this \ncountry failing their students, failing the parents, and failing the \nNation. We should not tolerate that.\n  There is another area that is important that represents, in many \ncases, the clash of conflicting priorities at the local level and \nresults in a poor educational environment for students. That is the \nissue of school modernization. There are schools in this country that \nare literally falling apart or so out of date that they impair the \neducational experience of children.\n  There are schools in my communities in Rhode Island that were built \nin 1876 and in 1898. In 1876, George Armstrong Custer lost a battle at \nthe Little Big Horn. Much has changed since then, except children are \nstill walking and busing to this school in a community in Rhode Island.\n  In the wintertime, the way they regulate the heat is they open the \nwindows because once they turn that boiler on, it gets so hot that the \nonly thing they can do to cool it down to room temperature is to open \nthe windows. There is a trailer outside, but the trailer is not a good \nplace to put computers because it is not fully air conditioned, not \nwell ventilated. This is one example. These examples are replete \nthroughout the entire country.\n  In Rhode Island, 81 percent of schools report a need to upgrade or \nrepair a building to good overall condition. Again, this is an area \nwhere national assistance can be very helpful. There is not a weekend--\nand I go home every weekend--where I do not run into someone--a parent, \na school committee person--who says: You know what, we sure could use \nsome help fixing up our schools.\n  This is not some plot hatched in Washington, DC, to take over \nelementary and secondary education. This is what people intimately \ninvolved in elementary and secondary education in our communities want \nus to do, but we will not be able to do it if we simply bundle up the \nmoney in a block grant and give it to the Governors.\n  I talked a good bit about some of the problems we have in our school \nsystem, some of the problems we have in terms of our response in the \nSenate to these issues. But I would be remiss if I did not mention some \nof the good news because of our efforts over the last several years.\n  It turns out that high school students are taking tougher \nmathematical and science courses because this notion of increased \nstandards which began with the Governors' conference years ago and \ncertainly were highlighted by the efforts of President Clinton, \ncertainly underscored by the Goals 2000 Act, certainly reemphasized in \nthe last reauthorization, this is leading to students taking tougher \nmathematical and science courses.\n  These increased participation rates are cutting across different \nlines of income, ethnicity, and race, which are very good signs for our \ncountry. Student mathematical achievement is improving. Between 1982 \nand 1986, students improved their achievement in mathematics, as \nmeasured by the National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n  There is some good news, and it is the result not of the absence of \nthe National Government from policy or solely because of the presence \nof national programs; it is because of this partnership that has been \nworked out, somewhat fluidly and sometimes roughly, over several \ndecades between local initiatives and national complementary \ninitiatives.\n  I could go on about student achievement. It is improving but not \nenough. Certainly, in international comparisons, we are not where we \nwant and must be.\n  The other item is we have seen some of these improvements in math and \nscience and some in part--I do not want to overstate this--might be \nattributable to a specific Federal national initiative, and that is the \nEisenhower Professional Development Program established in 1984 to \nincrease the quality of math and science teaching by giving math and \nscience teachers opportunities to develop their expertise and \nunderstanding and to develop their techniques to teach; again, part of \nwhat I hope is good news about improving mathematical scores in this \ncountry.\n  Had we been presented with a bill in the HELP Committee which would \nhave given us the opportunity to talk seriously about issues of \nprogrammatic content and national priorities, there are some things I \nwould have liked to emphasize. I will mention them.\n\n  First, we have to improve the quality of teaching in the United \nStates. We just had an amendment by my colleague, the Senator from \nMaine, Ms. Collins. It was a very good amendment because it talked \nabout allowing teachers to get more tax benefits for their investment \nin professional development, for taking courses in graduate school, and \nbuying material. That is a good effort. Frankly, that is just the \nsurface.\n  If we want to improve the performance of teachers in our schools, we \nhave to go into the classroom. We do not have to send the teachers \nnecessarily to graduate school. We have to go into the classroom. We \nhave to embed professional development as part of the daily life of the \nschool. That is not being done across this country.\n  What we have in many places is what I experienced as a child when I \nwent to school, and that is the proverbial teacher's institute. It was \nthe one day we celebrated because there was no school or no holiday. \nThey just took the day off. Teachers went to a big conference center, \nlistened to a speaker, chatted about all sorts of things, and that was \nprofessional development.\n  It does not work that way, particularly nowadays. They have to make \nprofessional development part and parcel of the school. They have to \nhave senior teachers and principals involved in the professional \ndevelopment of their teachers. They have to have the flexibility to get \nsubstitute teachers into the classroom so teachers can get out and \nobserve other teachers teaching. This is a national priority.\n  We should be able to give the States both financial assistance and a \nsense of direction about the best techniques, if you will, give them a \nspectrum, a menu of things from which they can choose. But we cannot do \nthat if our fixation is just ship the money down to the Governor. We \nhave to improve the quality of professional development.\n  A 1998 study in California found that the more teachers were engaged \nin ongoing curriculum-centered professional development, holding school \nconditions and student characteristics constant, the higher the \nstudents' mathematical achievements.\n  We know from the data, if you can embed professional development, put \nit in the life of the school, you can improve performance. That is what \nit is all about, not winning debating points but ensuring that the \nperformance of students in the classrooms of this country improves and \nimproves dramatically.\n  The teachers themselves recognize this. One in five talk about the \nfact they need more professional development, that what is being \nrequired of them by the States is inadequate. In fact, I believe the \nstatistic would probably be higher if you pressed and probed more. So \nthat is an area to which I would like to be able to devote attention. I \nam sure I will offer an amendment in the committee, but it is starkly \ndifferent than the approach of simply shrugging our shoulders and \nsaying: Let the Government figure it out.\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\n  We have ideas. We have an obligation to take what we see across this \ncountry and try to move States forward to do something that would \nimprove the quality of education.\n  There is another area that is important. That area is parental \ninvolvement. The national PTA did a survey of public school parents and \nfound that 91 percent believe it is ``extremely important'' for parents \nto be involved in their children's school, but more than half of the \nparents stated that schools need direction about how to make parents \ntrue partners in their children's education.\n  The overwhelming view of parents is they need to be more involved in \nthe school. But a significant number say the schools are deaf to their \nconcerns. They do not have the programs or the attitudes or the \npolicies that will get parents into the schools.\n  This is particularly the case when you get to areas where there are \nlow-income students because the reality is many times their parents \nhave an unsuccessful educational experience. It is not as if school was \na good place for them. There are also practical problems in many urban \nareas, and some rural areas, about language difficulties, about \nreaching out to parents in their own language to get them involved in \nthe lives of their children. We have not, as a nation, been able to \ndevelop the kinds of policies and programs that assist States and \nlocalities in making parents real partners in their children's \neducation. I hope we could do that. I hope we could do that by using \nESEA to start thinking about ways we can jump-start parental \ninvolvement at the local level.\n  Again, you can always fall back to the point: Why is this not \nhappening if the States have the vision, the resources, and the \ncommitment to do it? Why should we tolerate it continuing in such a \ndeplorable way if there is a lack of resources, vision, or commitment \nat the local level when we know it should and must be done?\n  As I mentioned, I would love very much to be able to take out some of \nthose antiquated books on the library shelves of America and replace \nthem with modern books that talk about the fact that we have landed on \nthe Moon, that include all the amendments of the U.S. Constitution. \nAgain, we will not be able to do that if we are simply block granting \nour educational dollars.\n  There is also a program that is based upon one State's experience \nhelping another State. The States have long been described as \nlaboratories of innovation and experiment. But I think we have a job, \nand that is to disseminate all that good work, making it available \nthroughout the Nation, giving other States the incentive or the ideas \nor the resources to put in place what some States have succeeded so \nwell in doing.\n\n  One program in Rhode Island is called the Child Opportunity Zones, \nCOZs. These are places within schools that bring together all sorts of \nsocial services, mental health services, child care services, and \nsocial work services. It is designed to assist the family, recognizing \nthat the success of a child is dependent not only on his or her innate \ntalent, and the teachers and the facilities, but also in the support \nand the participation of the whole family. If the family has problems, \nthat child will likely have problems. Indeed, one of the things that \nhas changed since my education is that family life in so many parts of \nthis country has been terribly complicated by social problems, health \ncare problems, issues that are not educational but decisively impact on \nthe ability of a young child to learn.\n  I am encouraged that the President has sent up his budget proposing \nincreases in Head Start. I have colleagues such as Chris Dodd who are \nworking valiantly to improve early childhood education. All of these \nthings coming together recognize the fact that today, in so many \nplaces, it is not the educational problems holding children back; it is \nthe health problem; it is the mental health problem; it is a host of \nproblems that are outside the strict purview of what we used to think \nof as educational policy.\n  This COZ program is very successful in Rhode Island. It brings these \ndisciplines to one place in the school. It gives families easy access \nto all of these disciplines.\n  Once again, this is an example of how the experience of one State--\nhighlighted, illustrated, and disseminated by national legislation--can \nbenefit the entire country. I would like very much to be able to work \non that.\n  Finally, we come back to a major issue which will preoccupy all of \nus. That is this issue of accountability. Block grants, without \naccountability, are an abdication of our responsibility not only to \nhave good educational policy but to the taxpayers. We cannot hand over \nmillions of dollars with the assumption that States and localities are \ndoing it right, when we know in some cases they do not invest enough in \nlow-income education, that in some cases States and localities will not \nprovide the kind of innovative change that is necessary for this new \ncentury.\n  We have to work hard to ensure we have accountability standards that \nwork. I know Senator Bingaman has been a champion of this issue in the \nSenate. I worked with him as a Member of the other body in our \nreauthorization of the prior Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I \nanticipate, if we have a chance--and I hope we do--that both in \ncommittee and on the floor we will push hard for accountability. So we \nhave a lot of work to do. It is national work. We simply cannot walk \naway from it.\n  Unfortunately, the approach that I see the Republican majority taking \nis effectively walking away from it, to hand it off to the States, to \nstep back and say it is not our job, not our role, when, in fact, we \ncan and should be a partner, the junior partner but a partner, in this \neffort to improve education throughout the United States.\n  We have made progress. Statistics are encouraging in relation to \nstudent performance, but we will give up this progress, I fear, if we \ndo not innovate, if we do not continue to support local initiatives, \nand if we do not continue to try to overcome the local inertia that \nleads to 8,000 failing schools, that leads to a malapportionment of \ndollars between poor students and more affluent students.\n\n  It is a national role that we have long had. It is increasingly a \nnational priority, as we face a world of international competition, as \nwe face a world where the future of our families literally depends upon \nthe quality of the education that our children receive.\n  I hope that in this great debate we will, in fact, be able to talk \nabout libraries, talk about child opportunity zones, talk about \nimproving the accountability, and talk about how we can put technology \ninto classrooms, not simply to walk away from this issue with the \nassumption that the States can and will do it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/02/29/senate-section/article/S979-1", "month": "02", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S979-S980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONGRATULATING AND THANKING CHAIRMAN ROBERT F.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 264) congratulating and thanking \n     Chairman Robert F. Bennett and Vice Chairman Christopher J. \n     Dodd for their tremendous leadership, poise, and dedication \n     in leading the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \n     Problem and commending the members of the Committee for their \n     fine work.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as the Special Committee on the Year \n2000 Technology Problem prepares to release its final report and \ndisband today, I think it is only appropriate to thank our Chairman \nRobert F. Bennett and Vice Chairman Christopher J. Dodd for the \ntremendous job that they did. They assembled the committee, held \nhearings to measure the problem, and in the end led the nation and \nworld in ameliorating it. Well done.\n  We are told that nothing is more permanent than ``temporary,'' \nespecially with regard to congressional committees. But our special \ncommittee did its job, in the time allotted--under Senate Resolution \n208, the committee was to\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\nlast from April 2, 1998 to February 29, 2000--and now it will be no \nmore.\n  I am pleased to join the Democrat leader, Senator Daschle, and others \nin introducing a resolution that congratulates and thanks the chairman \nand vice chairman for their fine leadership and work.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and, finally, any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 264) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 264\n\n       Whereas Senator Robert F. Bennett and Senator Christopher \n     J. Dodd had the foresight to urge Majority Leader Lott and \n     Senator Daschle to establish the Special Committee on the \n     Year 2000 Technology Problem under Senate Resolution on April \n     2, 1998;\n       Whereas under Chairman Bennett's and Vice Chairman Dodd's \n     leadership, the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \n     Problem always acted in a bipartisan manner;\n       Whereas Chairman Bennett and Vice Chairman Dodd presided \n     over 35 hearings on various aspects of technology \n     infrastructure including utilities, health care, \n     telecommunications, transportation, financial services, \n     Government involvement, and litigation;\n       Whereas the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology \n     Problem became the central repository for Y2K computer \n     problem information both nationally and internationally;\n       Whereas Chairman Bennett and Vice Chairman Dodd guided the \n     Senate in working with the White House, the House of \n     Representatives, the United Nations, and other international \n     organizations, and the private sector in addressing the Y2K \n     computer problem;\n       Whereas under Chairman Bennett's and Vice Chairman Dodd's \n     leadership, the Committee issued 3 excellent reports that \n     quickly became the authoritative source on the progress of \n     the Federal Government, the private sector, and foreign \n     countries on the Y2K computer problem;\n       Whereas Chairman Bennett, Vice Chairman Dodd and the \n     Committee helped the Federal Government, industry, nations, \n     and global enterprises learn that by working together we can \n     solve the kinds of technology problems we will likely face in \n     the 21st century;\n       Whereas Chairman Bennett and Vice Chairman Dodd always \n     conducted hearings in a thoughtful and judicious manner, with \n     the intent of addressing key issues so that the Senate could \n     better evaluate and solve the problem;\n       Whereas because of Chairman Bennett's and Vice Chairman \n     Dodd's initiative, the Nation and the world began to take the \n     Y2K computer problem seriously and worked to resolve the \n     problem; and\n       Whereas due to Chairman Bennett's and Vice Chairman Dodd's \n     tremendous leadership, dedication, and the work of the \n     Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, the \n     first potential catastrophe of the new century was avoided: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate congratulates and thanks Chairman \n     Robert F.
