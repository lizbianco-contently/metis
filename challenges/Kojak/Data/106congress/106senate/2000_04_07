Mr. President, today the Senate will continue to vote \non the remaining amendments to S. Con. Res. 101. Needless to say, votes \nare expected to occur throughout the morning with an expectation of \nvoting this afternoon and perhaps into the evening, if we are not able \nto resolve some of the pending sense-of-the-Senate amendments and other \namendments.\n  There are 2 minutes of explanation on amendments prior to each vote. \nTo make this process as smooth as possible, I ask that Senators remain \nin the Chamber between votes. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation.\n  We will be talking with various Senators about amendments. So that \neverybody will know, there are 75 amendments filed by Republicans and \n36 by Democrats. We are going to work with our Democratic minority whip \nand the ranking member of the Budget Committee to see if we can \nencourage a number of Senators to accept sense-of-the-Senate proposals \nand let us accept them on both sides. We will be working diligently at \nthat. If we don't have success, then looking at this, I say that \nprobably we would not finish before 6 o'clock tonight, or even later. \nWe will work very hard. If Members will help us, we can do better than \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have lined up five votes on each side. I \nsay, however, to my friend, the manager of the bill, there is a \ntremendous amount of staff time that is still going to be required. \nEach side has not been able to review each other's amendments. I \nrespectfully suggest to the majority that the minority doesn't think we \nhave done anything untoward in offering amendments. We have offered \nhalf as many as the majority. This doesn't mean they should have twice \nas many cleared as we have cleared. If both sides can work out the \nclearance, that is fine.\n  The point I am trying to make is that we are trying to work our way \nthrough this amendment process. If there is some effort, in effect, to \ntry to punish us by staying here late to work through these amendments, \nwe are willing to do that. I think the more logical way to go would be \nto work our way through the amendments.\n  I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, we would be much \nbetter off if we gave the staff a matter of hours, perhaps days, to \nwork their way through these amendments. These are very difficult \nsubjects. As to the sense-of-the-Senate aspect, most of those have been \nresolved. There are some that are very substantive in nature, and we \nneed to work our way through them.\n  I personally think it is going to be impossible to finish this bill \ntoday. If we have to vote on all these amendments, we are not talking \nabout 6 o'clock tonight; we are talking about 6 o'clock Monday morning. \nIt is up to the majority whether they want to put us through this. I \nthink the more logical way to do it would be to have our very \nproficient staffs work on these amendments over the weekend and get it \ndown to a reasonable number so we can complete this bill next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will carry the Senator's message to the majority\n\n[[Page S2384]]\n\nleader. Right now, we have 10 votes that we are willing to proceed \nwith, 5 on each side. The first one is the Santorum amendment on \nmilitary benefits; followed by Conrad on lockbox; Abraham on Social \nSecurity lockbox; Johnson on veterans; Ashcroft on Social Security \ninvestment; Mikulski on digital divide; Senator Bob Smith on \nprescription drugs; Graham of Florida on education; Voinovich on \nreconciliation instruction and taxes; and Kennedy on Pell grants.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2384-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2384-S2432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FISCAL YEAR 2001 BUDGET--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I understand my amendment is next in the \nqueue. I ask the amendment be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Santorum] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3058.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 23, line 7, strike ``47,568,000,000'' and insert \n     ``48,068,000,000''.\n       On page 23, line 8, strike ``47,141,000,000'' and insert \n     ``47,641,000,000''.\n       On page 27, line 7, strike ``-59,931,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-60,431,000,000''.\n       On page 27, line 8, strike ``-48,031,000,000'' and insert \n     ``-48,531,000,000''.\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       ``(A) It is the sense of the Senate that the provisions in \n     this resolution assume that if CBO determines there is an on-\n     budget surplus for FY 2001, $500 million of that surplus will \n     be restored to the programs cut in this amendment.\n       ``(B) It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying this budget resolution assume that none of these \n     offsets will come from defense or veterans, and to the extent \n     possible should come from administrative functions.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, my amendment increases veterans' health \ncare benefits by $500 million, which is what the Independent Budget, \nwhich is supported by a variety of veterans organizations, has come \nforward and said they need to provide adequate health care for our \nNation's veterans.\n  I commend the chairman of the Budget Committee for increasing \nveterans' health care benefits by $1.4 billion, but that isn't enough \nto provide for the needs of our veterans population.\n  This is an important issue to keep the promise that we made to our \nveterans to provide adequate health care. It is also important for our \nmilitary. What we need to do is to show the people in the service right \nnow, who want to stay in the service and make careers out of the \nservice, that we are going to keep our promises to them when they leave \nthe service. This is an important amendment to provide adequate health \ncare benefits for our veterans as well as to show our people in the \ncurrent military that we are going to keep our promises.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Abraham be added as a cosponsor \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I applaud anybody who attempts to address \nissues of veterans' health care. However, I think it is regrettable \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania chose not to work in a bipartisan \nfashion with Senators Craig, Wellstone, myself, and other veterans \norganizations across the country with our amendment that we will be \noffering very shortly, which has a longer-term, 5-year fix for the \nveterans' health care funding shortfall.\n  Our amendment will far more significantly address the problems with \nveterans' health care in this Nation. The one offered by Senator \nSantorum is a fine step, in a small sense. I have no problems \nsupporting it. I think the body needs to understand that we will come \nto a far more significant amendment shortly. The amendment this morning \nwill deal with a 5-year approach to veterans' health care.\n  I yield to Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think the Independent Budget is very \nimportant. We have been out here working on it. This amendment follows \nthe amendment we introduced. One year is fine, but we need 5 years. \nLet's vote for this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3058) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3016\n\n(Purpose: To protect Social Security surpluses and reserve a portion of \n          on-budget surpluses for Medicare and debt reduction)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3016.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SAVE SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE LOCKBOX.\n\n       (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``Social \n     Security and Medicare lockbox'' includes--\n       (1) the amount of the Social Security surplus (as defined \n     in section 311(b)(1) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974), with respect to any fiscal year; and\n       (2) the amount of the ``Medicare surplus reserve'' defined \n     as a minimum of one-third of the on-budget surplus as \n     estimated by the Congressional Budget Office for each of the \n     3 applicable time periods, which are--\n       (A) the budget year;\n       (B) the budget year plus the subsequent 4 years; and\n       (C) the budget year plus the subsequent 9 years.\n       (b) Budget Resolution Point of Order.--It shall not be in \n     order in the Senate to consider any concurrent resolution on \n     the budget (or amendment, motion, or conference report on the \n     resolution) that would decrease the on-budget surplus below \n     the levels of the Medicare surplus reserve, except for \n     legislation that reforms the Medicare program and provides \n     coverage for prescription drugs.\n       (c) Subsequent Legislation Point of Order.--It shall not be \n     in order in the Senate to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report that \n     together with associated interest costs would decrease the \n     on-budget surplus below the level of the Medicare surplus \n     reserve, except for legislation that reforms the Medicare \n     program and provides coverage for prescription drugs.\n       (d) Social Security Off-Budget Point of Order.--It shall \n     not be in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate \n     to consider a concurrent resolution on the budget (or any \n     amendment thereto or conference report thereon) or any bill, \n     joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference report \n     that would violate section 13301 of the Budget Enforcement \n     Act of 1990.\n       (e) Strengthening Social Security Points of Order.--It \n     shall not be in order in the Senate to consider a concurrent \n     resolution on the budget (or any amendment thereto or \n     conference report thereon) or any bill, joint resolution, \n     amendment, motion, or conference report that would--\n       (1) decrease Social Security surpluses in any year covered \n     by this resolution below the levels established in this \n     resolution; or\n       (2) amend section 301(i) or 311(a)(3) of the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 to allow Social Security surpluses to be \n     decreased below the levels established in this resolution.\n       (f) Supermajority Waiver.--\n       (1) Waiver.--This section may be waived or suspended only \n     by the affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly \n     chosen and sworn.\n       (2) Appeals.--An affirmative vote of three-fifths of the \n     Members, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain \n     an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order \n     raised pursuant to this section.\n       (g) Senate Pay-As-You-Go Rule Extended Through 2010.--\n     Section 207(g) of H.\n\n[[Page S2385]]\n\n     Con.

Mr. President, this amendment is designed to safeguard \nboth Social Security and Medicare. We have, on a bipartisan basis, \nachieved consensus now that we should not spend the Social Security \nsurplus for other programs. That is an enormous advancement. That is a \ncommitment to fiscal responsibility. We ought to take the next step now \nand protect Medicare as well. That is what this lockbox amendment does. \nIt protects every penny of Social Security for Social Security in each \nand every year, and it commits one-third of the non-Social Security \nsurplus to Medicare. So we are taking care of our two major programs \nthat are most at risk, Social Security and Medicare.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this lockbox amendment so we can \nleave this Congress with a full commitment to Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is almost comical that this is called \na Medicare lockbox because it has nothing to do with Medicare. The \nSocial Security lockbox at the Social Security trust fund actually puts \nthose away. This amendment never references the Medicare trust fund. It \nsays we are to run on-budget surpluses equal to a third of the \nCongressional Budget Office surpluses, using the most recent baseline \nprojections. I don't think we ought to do that. We have priorities set \nup in the budget. It violates the Budget Act.\n  I make a point of order that it is not germane to provisions of the \nBudget Act. I therefore raise that point of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional Budget Act, \nI move to waive the applicable sections of the Budget Act for \nconsideration of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act in \nrelation to the Conrad amendment No. 3016.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe Senator Abraham has the next \namendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3063\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the protection of Social Security trust funds \n                               surpluses)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Abraham], for himself, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Grams, Mr. Craig, \n     Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Crapo, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3063.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  . PROTECTION OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Congress balanced the budget excluding the surpluses \n     generated by the Social Security trust funds in 1999, and \n     should do so in 2000 and every future fiscal year;\n       (2) reducing the federal debt held by the public is a top \n     national priority, strongly supported on a bipartisan basis, \n     as evidenced by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's \n     comments that debt reduction ``is a very important element in \n     sustaining economic growth'';\n       (3) according to even the most profligate spending \n     projection by the Congressional Budget Office, balancing the \n     budget excluding the surpluses generated by the Social \n     Security trust funds will totally eliminate the net debt held \n     by the public by 2010;\n       (4) the Senate adopted a Sense of the Senate amendment to \n     last year's budget resolution by a vote of 99-0 that called \n     for a legislative mandate that the Social Security surpluses \n     only be used for the payment of Social Security benefits, \n     Social Security reform or to reduce the federal debt held by \n     the public, and that a Senate super-majority Point of Order \n     lie against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or \n     conference report that would use Social Security surpluses on \n     anything other than the payment of Social Security benefits, \n     Social Security reform or the reduction of the federal debt \n     held by the public;\n       (5) the House adopted on a vote of 416-12, H.R. 1259, a \n     bill to provide a legislative lock-box to protect the Social \n     Security surpluses;\n       (6) the Senate has failed to hold a vote on passage of any \n     Social Security lock box legislation having failed five times \n     to overcome filibusters against both Senate and the House of \n     Representatives' legislative proposals; and\n       (7) the Senate Committee on the Budget unanimously adopted \n     an amendment to this Concurrent Resolution that provided a \n     permanent Senate super-majority Point of Order against any \n     budget resolution that would produce an on-budget deficit.\n       (b) It is the Sense of the Senate that the functional \n     totals in this concurrent resolution on the budget assume \n     that during this session of Congress the Senate shall pass \n     legislation which--\n       (1) reaffirms the provisions of section 13301 of the \n     Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 that provides that \n     the receipts and disbursements of the Social Security trust \n     funds shall not be counted for the purposes of the budget \n     submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, \n     and provides for a Point of Order within the Senate against \n     any concurrent resolution on the budget, an amendment \n     thereto, or a conference report thereon that violates that \n     section;\n\n[[Page S2386]]\n\n       (2) mandates that the Social Security surpluses are used \n     only for the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or to reduce the federal debt held by the \n     public, and not spent on non-social security programs or used \n     to offset tax cuts;\n       (3) provides for a Senate super-majority Point of Order \n     against any bill, resolution, amendment, motion or conference \n     report that would use Social Security surpluses on anything \n     other than the payment of Social Security benefits, Social \n     Security reform or the reduction of the federal debt held by \n     the public;\n       (5) Ensures that all Social Security benefits are paid on \n     time; and\n       (6) Accommodates Social Security reform legislation.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, if I might, in the Budget Committee as we \nprepared the resolution to come to the floor, we were successful in \nmaking the lockbox mechanism a permanent part of the budget process and \nmaking it enforceable with a 60-vote point of order. I consider that to \nbe a victory on this matter.\n  In the interest of setting a good precedent today, I therefore seek \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment at this time, and hope \nothers who have similar kinds of amendments will help us to expedite \nthe process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while this amendment expresses the \nsense of the Senate that Congress ought to pass legislation to \nestablish the security lockbox, we are concerned. I think it is fair to \nsay all of us endorse that principle. We want the Social Security funds \nreserved for Social Security recipients. I am going to support this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has been withdrawn.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am sorry, I was not paying attention. I am glad the \nSenator withdrew the amendment.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Since no objection was raised, apparently, to the \namendment, and since there may be an ability to have an immediate voice \nvote, I am happy to accept the proposal of the Senator from New Jersey \nand voice vote the amendment rather than withdrawing it to save time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I stopped in the middle of my statement because I was \nastonished by the Senator's generous attitude, and so we will skip the \namendment as long as he will withdraw the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator was asking the question, since the Senator \nfrom New Jersey does not object to it, could we accept it?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Given the opportunity to clean the slate and move \nalong, I withdraw my statement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, tomorrow, April 8, is the anniversary of the \nratification by the State of Connecticut of the 17th amendment. But for \nthat amendment, I would not be here and for that amendment, a good many \nof us would not be here.\n  That amendment provides for the popular election of Senators. I just \nwanted to call that to our colleagues' attention. Tomorrow is quite an \nimportant day for most of us. Does anyone think the West Virginia \nLegislature would have selected me for the Senate? I did not have two \nnickels I could rub together. Nobody knew me. My dad was a coal miner. \nI expect a lot of us can say somewhat the same things. Just keep that \nin mind tomorrow, how thankful we should be for the 17th amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I have 30 seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator probably agrees the popular \nelection created a better Senate.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I ask that this better Senate help us get rid of \nsome of these amendments that are irrelevant.\n  Mr. BYRD. I must say I expect some of those who were proponents of \nthe 17th amendment would probably be disappointed in the Senate if they \ncould see it today.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. A lot of the Senators who were here when I came would \nlikewise be chagrined, embarrassed, and disappointed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2934\n\n        (Purpose: To increase funding for veterans health care)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2934.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself, \n     Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \n     Robb, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2934.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 8, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 12, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 19, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 20, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $2,500,000,000.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I wish to add my voice to those who have \nalready spoken eloquently about the need to increase funding for \nAmerica's veterans. While I appreciate Senator Domenici's efforts to \nprovide the increase requested by the administration, many of my \ncolleagues agree with me that this is not sufficient to meet the needs \nof America's veterans. Years of underfunding coupled with spiraling \nhealth care costs have left the system struggling to provide the \nquality care that veterans expect and deserve. This trend must be \nstopped and reversed. We owe it to future generations to keep federal \nspending under control. But we must first recognize the prior claim of \nveterans who have already given of themselves and who expect to receive \nthe medical care and benefits they are promised.\n  Mr. President, veterans in my State of Vermont are very lucky. They \nhave been served for many years by a very dedicated and high quality VA \nsystem, headquartered in White River Junction with clinics in \nBurlington and\n\n[[Page S2387]]\n\nBennington. But this system is being stretched to the limit. Numbers of \nveterans wanting to use the services of the VA are increasing. While \nthe cost of providing quality medical care has risen less at our VA \nhospital than it has in the private sector, more funding is still \nrequired just to provide the same services this year as last. Budget \nshortfalls of about 10 percent per year for several years have forced \nadministrators to demand sacrifices of their personnel that would not \nbe tolerated in many other systems and make cuts in services that are \nregrettable. Thanks to our dedicated staff, Vermont veterans are still \nreceiving quality health care, but these trends can't continue. It is \nhigh time the system was given the funding it needs to do the job \nright.\n  In an improvement over last year, the President's budget for fiscal \nyear 2001 requested an increase of $1.3 billion for veterans health \ncare. But that is still about $600 million below the amount that is \nneeded to maintain existing programs and fulfill the funding \nrequirements of the Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act, \npassed by Congress last year. This amount, $21.2 billion, has been \nidentified by the Independent Budget coalition as the minimum \nacceptable funding level for veterans health care programs.\n  While veterans, just like all Americans, would love to see their \nbenefits increase, this request does not do that. Funding the Veterans \nHealth Administration at $21.2 billion would merely take a bite out of \nthe increasing cost of medical care, particularly pharmaceutical costs, \nfor an aging veterans population. Demand for VA health care continues \nto rise and enrollment is going up at many facilities, with no \ncorresponding increase in funding to cover those veterans. The \nMillennium bill authorized better nursing home care, home health and \nlong-term care services, greatly needed by veterans. It also provided \nveterans with long-desired emergency room coverage, and recognizes the \nimperative of covering the increasing number of hepatitis C cases among \nveterans. But if additional funds are not provided to cover these \ncosts, these promises will be hollow.\n  I am very pleased to join Senators Johnson and Wellstone in offering \nthis amendment to add $500 million to the budget for the Veterans \nHealth Administration. I urge all my colleagues to support this worthy \neffort. This is the very least we can do!\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I thank Senators Wellstone, Domenici, and \nCraig for working out an agreement on a veterans amendment which \nincreases outlays for veterans' health care by $500 million over the \nBudget Committee's level in each year of the budget resolution and \nraises the funding to the level requested in the veterans' Independent \nBudget, a $1.9 billion, increase over fiscal year 2000.\n  This level of funding is advocated by 40 veterans groups and medical \nsocieties. I urge all Senators to support this critically important \namendment which ensures adequate funding for veterans over a 5-year \nperiod.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3074 to Amendment No. 2934\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment which I \nsend to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself, Mr. \n     Murkowski, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Abraham, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3074 to amendment No. 2934.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 4, line 4, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 5, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 6, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 7, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 8, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 13, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 14, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 15, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 24, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 4, line 25, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 8, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 9, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 10, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 5, line 11, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 23, line 7, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 8, increase the amount by $430,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 11, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 12, increase the amount by $485,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 15, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 16, increase the amount by $497,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 19, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 20, increase the amount by $498,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 23, increase the amount by $500,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 24, increase the amount by $498,000,000.\n       On page 29, line 3, decrease the amount by $0.\n       On page 29, line 4, decrease the amount by $0.\n       At the end add the following: Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of this resolution the appropriate levels for \n     function 920 are as follows--\n       For fiscal year 2001:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$60,431,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$48,461,000,000.\n       For fiscal year 2002:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$60,229,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$71,796,000,000.\n       For fiscal year 2003:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$500,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$5,287,000,000.\n       For fiscal year 2004:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$500,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$7,268,000,000.\n       For fiscal year 2005:\n       (A) New budget authority, -$500,000,000.\n       (B) Outlays, -$6,570,000,000.\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING MEDICAL CARE FOR VETERANS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the provisions of this resolution assume that if the \n     Congressional Budget Office determines there is an on-budget \n     surplus for fiscal year 2001, $500,000,000 of that surplus \n     will be restored to the programs cut by this amendment; and\n       (2) the assumptions underlying this resolution assume that \n     none of the offsets made by this amendment will come from \n     defense or veterans and should, to the extent possible, come \n     from administrative functions.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, my amendment to the Johnson amendment is \nthe exact amendment that Senator Johnson put on the budget resolution \nlast year. It increases veterans spending the same amount that the \nJohnson amendment does, by $500 million a year, but instead of blocking \nour ability to give tax cuts, as his would do, mine is spread across a \n5-year discretionary pattern.\n  American citizens, along with veterans, deserve to be treated \nequally. We ought to recognize our veterans and do as Senator Johnson \nhas proposed. At the same time, we ought to recognize American families \nwho are now taxed at the highest level in our Nation's history and give \nthem an opportunity for some tax relief. My amendment grants us that \noption. I urge consideration of the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope all Senators will vote for this \namendment. A recorded vote is important because there are a lot of gaps \nin the veterans health care system. For my own part, I would far rather \ntake it out of tax cuts which are disproportionately aimed at higher \nincome people. I hope there is a 100-percent vote for this. The \nveterans need our support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3074.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We asked for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I call up sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nNo. 2946. It is a sense of the Senate rejecting the President's plan \nfor direct Government investment of Social Security as an option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Ashcroft], for himself, Mr. \n     Inhofe, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Allard and Mr. \n     Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 2946.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT OF SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Government investment of the social security trust \n     funds in the stock market is a gamble Congress should be \n     unwilling to make on behalf of the millions who receive and \n     depend on social security to meet their retirement needs;\n       (2) in 1999, the Senate voted 99-0 to oppose Government \n     investment of the social security trust funds in private \n     financial markets;\n       (3) in addition to the unanimous opposition of the United \n     States Senate, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and \n     Securities and Exchange Commissioner Arthur Levitt also \n     oppose the idea; and\n       (4) despite this opposition, and despite the dangers \n     inherent in having the Government invest social security \n     trust funds in private financial markets, President Clinton \n     has once again suggested, on page 37 of the Administration's \n     proposed fiscal year 2001 Federal budget, that the Government \n     invest part of the social security trust funds in corporate \n     equities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that the Federal Government should not \n     directly invest contributions made to the Federal Old-Age and \n     Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability \n     Insurance Trust Fund established under section 201 of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401), or any interest derived \n     from those contributions, in private financial markets.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator \nAshcroft's amendment to the budget resolution. I commend his leadership \non this vitally important issue. This amendment reassures the American \npeople that Congress will not spend a penny of their Social Security \nand Medicare money. It will put the Senate on record that we honor our \ncommitment.\n  This is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses and save them exclusively for American's retirement \nand health care needs, not for tax relief, not for government spending.\n  Beginning in 2008, 78 million baby-boomers will become eligible for \nretirement, and without immediate action taken by the Congress the \nsystem will begin to collapse. From that point on, we will have more \nretirees than ever before, and fewer workers paying into the system.\n  Washington has made the situation even worse because it keeps raiding \nthe Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In 1998, American workers \npaid $489 billion into the Social Security system, but most of that \nmoney, $382 billion, was immediately paid out that same year to 44 \nmillion beneficiaries. That left a $106 billion surplus. The total \naccumulated surplus in the trust fund is more than $750 billion.\n  Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The government has \nconsumed all that $750 billion for non-Social Security related \nprograms. All it has are Treasury IOUs.\n  Even the Clinton administration admits that the trust fund does not \nactually exist. Here is what the President's last budget stated:\n\n       These trust funds balances are available to finance future \n     benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only \n     in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be \n     pension funds, like the funds of private pension plans. They \n     do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down \n     in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on \n     the Treasury, that, when redeemed, will have to be financed \n     by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing \n     benefits or other expenditures.\n\n  That's not acceptable. We must say no to anyone who wants to spend \neven a penny of the Social Security surplus because we promised the \nAmerican people we would save it. There is no excuse in an era of \nbudget surplus to continue raiding the Social Security trust funds. \nWashington has done enough damage to America's retirement system.\n  The just-released annual report of the Social Security Trust Fund's \nBoard of Trustee's shows short-term improvement but continued long-term \ndeterioration. The government will have to come up with $11.3 trillion \nfrom general revenues between 2015 and 2036 to make up the annual \nshortfall in the Social Security System. The inflation-adjusted \ncumulative deficit between 2015 and 2075 is now projected to be $21.6 \ntrillion, up nearly 7 percent compared with last year's projection. If \nthe economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic \nassumptions are too optimistic, the trust fund could go bankrupt much \nsooner.\n  This makes our work to save and reform Social Security and Medicare \neven more urgent.\n  The Ashcroft amendment will bring us one step closer to protecting \nSocial Security and Medicare. Unlike the previous Social Security \nlockbox, which locks up only the Social Security surplus, this \namendment would extend that protection to the Medicare surplus as well. \nThe Medicare part A surplus will be about $20 billion a year. This \nsurplus should be preserved only for the medical expenses of senior \nAmericans, not the general government spending.\n  If enacted, the Ashcroft amendment would, in effect, prevent anyone, \nwhether it is the Congress or the administration, for raiding the \nSocial Security and Medicare surplus. I believe this is absolutely the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, the American people demand that we truly protect the \nSocial Security and Medicare surplus, and they want to stop the federal \ngovernment's practice of so-called ``borrowing'' from the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds. They are very worried that \nretirement funds will not be there for them, and they are concerned \nthat the government will not be\n\n[[Page S2389]]\n\nable to return the more than $750 billion ``borrowed'' and spent by the \ngovernment.\n  Over the next 10 years, American workers will put more than $2.3 \ntrillion into the Social Security system. We must do everything we can \nto prevent the government from spending this Social Security and \nMedicare surplus under any circumstances. We need an enforcement \nmechanism to keep our promise to the American people.\n  The Ashcroft amendment provides the protection for Americans' \nretirement and health care money. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this is an amendment which would express \nthe sense of the Senate that the Government should not invest the \nSocial Security trust fund in the stock market. I believe there is a \nconsensus on both sides that this is the case.\n  Last year, we voted 99-0 to say we did not want the Government \nplaying stockbroker for a day with the retirement security of the \nAmerican people.\n  I personally believe we could do this on a voice vote as a matter of \nsaving the time and energy of this body. I suggest we do so.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we agree with the Senator's idea of a \nvoice vote. Then we can move on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2946.\n  The amendment (No. 2946) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2956\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning an increase in \n                    funding for digital opportunity)\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2956, a sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution on the necessary budget funding to cross the \ndigital divide.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mrs. \n     Boxer, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Kennedy, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2956.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING DIGITAL OPPORTUNITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) A digital divide exist in America. Low-income, urban \n     and rural families are less likely to have access to the \n     Internet and computers. African American and Hispanic \n     families are only \\2/5\\ as likely to have Internet access as \n     white families. Access by Native Americans to the Internet \n     and to computers is statistically negligible.\n       (2) Regardless of income level, Americans living in rural \n     areas lag behind in Internet access. Individuals with lower \n     incomes who live in rural areas are half as likely to have \n     Internet access as individuals who live in urban areas.\n       (3) The digital divide for the poorest Americans has grown \n     by 29 percent since 1997.\n       (4) Access to computers and the Internet and the ability to \n     use this technology effectively is becoming increasingly \n     important for full participation in America's economic, \n     political and social life.\n       (5) Unequal access to technology and high-tech skills by \n     income, educational level, race and geography could deepen \n     and reinforce the divisions that exist within American \n     society.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) to ensure that all children are computer literate by \n     the time they finish the eighth grade, regardless of race, \n     ethnicity, gender, income, geography or disability, to \n     broaden access to information technologies, to provide \n     workers, teachers and students with information technology \n     training, and to promote innovative online content and \n     software applications that will improve commerce, education \n     and quality of life, initiatives that increase digital \n     opportunity should be provided for as follows:\n       (A) $200,000,000 in tax incentives should be provided to \n     encourage private sector donation of high quality computers, \n     sponsorship of community technology centers, training, \n     technical services and computer repair;\n       (B) $450,000,000 should be provided for teacher training;\n       (C) $150,000,000 for new teacher training;\n       (D) $400,000,000 should be provided for school technology \n     and school libraries;\n       (E) $20,000,000 should be provided to place computers and \n     trained personnel in Boys & Girls Clubs;\n       (F) $25,000,000 should be provided to create an E-Corps \n     within Americorps;\n       (G) $100,000,000 should be provided to create 1,000 \n     Community Technology Centers in low-income urban and rural \n     communities;\n       (H) $50,000,000 should be provided for public/private \n     partnerships to expand home access to computers and the \n     Internet for low-income families;\n       (I) $45,000,000 should be provided to promote innovative \n     applications of information and communications technology for \n     underserved communities;\n       (J) $10,000,000 should be provided to prepare Native \n     Americans for careers in Information Technology and other \n     technical fields; and\n       (2) all Americans should have access to broadband \n     telecommunications capability as soon as possible and as \n     such, initiatives that increase broadband deployment should \n     be funded, including $25,000,000 to accelerate private sector \n     deployment of broadband and networks in underserved urban and \n     rural communities.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the amendment is very simple. It states \nit is the sense of the Senate that the Federal budget will provide the \nframework and the funding necessary to ensure that all Americans cross \nthe digital divide.\n  The goal of the legislation is to ensure that every child is computer \nliterate by the eighth grade, regardless of race, ethnicity, income, \ngender, geography, or disability. It is the single most empowering tool \nwe could pass this year.\n  This amendment would increase funds for teacher training and school \ntechnology, create 1,000 community-based tech centers, strengthen tax \nincentives for public-private partnerships, create an e-Corps within \nAmeriCorps, and be able to make wise and prudent use of Federal funds.\n  It will be absolutely crucial to get our children ready to be able to \nleapfrog into the future and participate in the new economy.\n  Mr. President, I really do hope the Senate will adopt this. If we \ncould come to an agreement on a voice vote to accept it, I would be \ndelighted and not insist on a rollcall vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I ask the Senator, I believe this is a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment; is that correct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection. We could accept it.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent Senator Baucus of Montana be added \nas a cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2956.\n  The amendment (No. 2956) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3031\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the type of \n     medicare prescription drug benefit that Congress should pass)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. \n3031.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], for himself, \n     Mr. Allard, and Mr. Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3031.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     budget resolution assume that among\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\n     its reform options, Congress should explore a medicare \n     prescription drug proposal that--\n       (1) is voluntary;\n       (2) increases access for all medicare beneficiaries;\n       (3) is designed to provide meaningful protection and \n     bargaining power for medicare beneficiaries in obtaining \n     prescription drugs;\n       (4) is affordable for all medicare beneficiaries and for \n     the medicare program;\n       (5) is administered using private sector entities and \n     competitive purchasing techniques;\n       (6) is consistent with broader medicare reform;\n       (7) preserves and protects the financial integrity of the \n     medicare trust funds;\n       (8) does not increase medicare beneficiary premiums; and\n       (9) provides a prescription drug benefit as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment is quite \nsimple. It saves $40 billion that is now in the budget which we don't \nhave to spend because the Smith-Allard amendment costs nothing. It is \nrevenue neutral. It provides no increase in premiums for seniors. It \ntakes effect as early as 2001, rather than 2009 under the President's \nplan. It covers 50 percent of prescription drugs, up to $5,000. For \nevery dollar spent, 50 cents is covered, up to $5,000, and the \nprescription drug goes toward the deductible. So if we want to save \nmoney on the budget and allow seniors to have prescription drug \ncoverage at no cost to the Government--revenue neutral, no increase in \npremiums to seniors--it is a good deal. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I will not suggest that people vote \nagainst the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, but it is \ninteresting to me that in his original amendment, he said that Congress \n``should'' pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. He changed it to \nthe budget resolution ``assumes that among its reform options, Congress \nshould explore a Medicare prescription drug.'' That is a very different \ncontent statement regarding the seriousness about prescription drugs. I \ndo not, however, oppose his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3031.\n  The amendment (No. 3031) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2966\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for additional ESEA funding)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2966.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR ADDITIONAL ESEA FUNDING IN THE \n                   SENATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, upon reporting of a bill, \n     the offering of an amendment thereto, or the submission of a \n     conference report thereon that allows local educational \n     agencies to use appropriated funds to carry out activities \n     under a reauthorized Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     that complies with subsection (b), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may increase the \n     functional totals and outlay aggregates and allocations--\n       (1) for fiscal year 2001 by not more than $3,000,000,000; \n     and\n       (2) for the period of fiscal years 2001 through 2005 by not \n     more than $15,000,000,000.\n       (b) Condition.--Legislation complies with this subsection \n     if it provides--\n       (1) increased accountability;\n       (2) encouragement of State educational agencies (SEAs) and \n     local educational agencies (LEAs) to establish high student \n     performance standards;\n       (3) a concentration of resources around central education \n     goals, including compensatory education for disadvantaged \n     children and youth, teacher quality and professional \n     development, innovative education strategies, programs for \n     limited English proficiency students, student safety, and \n     educational technology; and\n       (4) an allocation of funds that targets the most \n     impoverished areas and schools most likely to be in distress.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nFeinstein and  Kohl be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, this amendment would reserve $15 billion \nover the next 5 years to be able to meet the projected additional \nfunding for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We propose this \nadditional funding as part of a comprehensive Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act reform which focuses on principles such as accountability \nbased on student performance, greater flexibility in terms of the \nStates and local school districts' ability to utilize this money, and a \nstrong focus on the at-risk child, the child who today is falling \nfurther and further behind and is going to be less able to be an equal \ncontributant to the new economy era in which they will be living, \nunless the Federal Government increases the strength of its partnership \nwith the States and local school districts. I urge adoption of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we add $23 billion to education in this \nbudget. I don't think we need a reserve fund. This amendment violates \nthe Budget Act because it is not germane to the budget. Therefore, I \nmake a point of order in that regard.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for consideration of the pending amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment is easy to understand. \nRather than reduce taxes by $150 billion over the next 5 years, about \n$13.5 billion in this particular budget, my amendment would use those \ndollars to reduce the national debt. Most families and businesses that \nfinally had a surplus of funds like we have would be paying off their \ndebt. Today, 13 cents out of every dollar we spend goes to pay interest \non the debt. That is almost as much as we spend on defense, and more \nthan we spend on Medicare.\n  All of the leading economists in this country say we should take the \non-budget surplus and use it to pay down the debt. It encourages more \nsavings and investment, and it lowers interest rates, which is a real \ntax savings.\n  Last, but not least, it fulfills a moral obligation to our children \nand grandchildren to remove the debt Congress has put on their backs \nbecause Congress did not have the courage to either pay for the things \nit wanted, or do without.\n  We have the resources now. We ought to use those resources to pay \ndown the national debt.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment strikes the \nreconciliation instructions. What we have said in our budget resolution \nis, if we don't get any tax relief, the money will go to reducing the \ndebt. I believe the budget resolution needs to have a reconciliation \ninstruction if we are going to give a fair chance at the tax reforms \nthat are proposed--any size, from $10 billion to $75 billion or \nwhatever can be done. Without the reconciliation, we would get none of \nit done.\n  Therefore, I oppose it and hope it will be defeated. I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer this on behalf of myself, Senator \nFeingold, our education committee, Senator Sarbanes, and others; and \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Collins, and Senator Chafee. This is a \nbipartisan amendment. It is a very simple amendment. At the present \ntime, we are providing $3,300 on the Pell grants. The Budget Committee \nhas raised that up to $3,500. This amendment would make it $3,700. It \ncosts $1.4 billion a year. This amendment applies for 5 years.\n  This chart indicates what the Pell grant has meant to education for \nchildren. Back in the 1970s it paid effectively 90 percent of the \npublic education for children. It has gone down, now, to about 40 \npercent for public education--20 percent in private colleges. Ninety \npercent of the children who are getting Pell grants have incomes of \n$9,000 or less.\n  Finally, for families that have incomes of $74,000, 90 percent of \ntheir children are going on to higher education, whether public \neducation or private education. For families with $25,000, it is 26 \npercent. Talk about a digital divide, this is growing and growing and \ngrowing.\n  The money in this amendment all goes to tuition; nothing for rooms, \nnothing for food, nothing for additional services.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters from \nthe various groups that support this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                      Office of the President,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 3, 2000.\n       Dear Senator: I write to urge you to support Senator \n     Kennedy's amendment to the FY 2001 Budget Resolution that \n     would increase funding for the Pell Grant program by $1.4 \n     billion. These funds would translate into a much-needed $400 \n     increase in the maximum Pell Grant award.\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\n       As you know, Congress has made progress in recent years in \n     providing much-needed increases in funding for the Pell Grant \n     program. As a result, millions of low- and middle-income \n     students who would not otherwise be able to access a college \n     education have done so.\n       The $30 increase in the maximum Pell Grant award included \n     the S.

These funds would translate into a \n     much-needed $400 increase in the maximum Pell Grant award.\n       As you know, the Pell Grant is the foundation of student \n     aid packages for millions of low- and middle-income students \n     who would not otherwise be able to access a college \n     education.

Con. Res. 101 to \n         increase education funding.\n\n     Member,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senator: The Committee for Education Funding, a \n     nonpartisan coalition of over 90 organizations reflecting the \n     broad spectrum of the education community, urges you to \n     support amendments during floor debate to increase education \n     investment in S. Con. Res. 101, the FY01 Budget Resolution \n     reported by the Senate Budget Committee on March 30. The \n     proposed budget resolution provides an increase of only $2.2 \n     billion for discretionary funding for Function 500, education \n     and related programs and is $4.7 billion below the \n     President's request.\n       We welcome Chairman Domenici's stated support for making \n     education a top budget priority. The Budget Resolution \n     proposes an increase of $2.6 billion for elementary and \n     secondary education, including $1 billion for the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act, and assumes a modest \n     increase in the Pell Grant maximum award. While these \n     increases are important, they are $2.2 billion below the \n     President's request for a $4.5 billion increase in \n     discretionary spending for education and would require cuts \n     and freezes in other education and related programs to meet \n     the total increase for the function of only $2.2 billion. The \n     budget resolution also provides $2.3 billion in mandatory \n     funds for a proposed Performance Bonus Fund that has not yet \n     been enacted and would not make grants until after FY05.\n       We urge you to support amendments that would add funding to \n     more adequately reflect the important role of education in \n     the overall fiscal health and competitiveness of the nation's \n     economy and its high priority among the American people.\n       For example, the Bingaman-Kennedy amendment would add $5.6 \n     billion to the Budget Resolution in FY01 for such key \n     programs as Title I aid for disadvantaged students, Pell \n     grants for student aid, class size reduction, IDEA, school \n     modernization, teacher recruitment and professional \n     development, after school, GEAR UP, TRIO and college work \n     study. The Kennedy-Feingold amendment increases the Pell \n     grant maximum award to $400. The Jeffords-Dodd amendment \n     would fully fund IDEA at $15.8 billion over five years and \n     meet the federal commitment of support for special education. \n     CEF strongly supports these amendments and other amendments \n     that increase funding for education. It does not support \n     amendments that increase funding for one education program at \n     the expense of another.\n       Recent polls show that 61% of the American public believe \n     that the federal government spends too little on education. \n     Americans expect the federal budget to reflect a national \n     commitment to improve and expand educational opportunities \n     for America's children, youth and adults to meet the pressing \n     challenges of the new century. We urge you to support a \n     budget resolution with amendments, such as the Bingaman, \n     Kennedy and Jeffords amendments that make that national \n     commitment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ellin Nolan,\n       President.\n     Edward Kealy,\n       Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Association of Jesuit\n\n\n                                    Colleges and Universities,\n\n                                                    April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Ted Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the twenty-eight Jesuit \n     colleges and Universities, I want to commend you and Senators \n     Feingold and Dodd for introducing an amendment to the budget \n     Resolution for FY2001 that would increase the maximum amount \n     per student for Pell Grants to $400.\n       The higher education community remains concerned with a \n     budget that in essence would freeze any increases for grant \n     programs and campus-based aid programs, except for a marginal \n     increase of $30 for Pell Grants. Our needs are great and will \n     continue to be so over the next ten years. While on-budget \n     federal funds for higher education decreased by 28% from 1983 \n     to 1998, after factoring in inflation, enrollments rose by \n     17.4% between 1982 and 1998. And, according to the ``Baby-\n     Boom Echo Report on Higher Education'' issued by the \n     Department of Education, enrollment in higher education will \n     continue to rise rapidly over the next ten years by a \n     whopping 16% to 20%.\n       Pell Grants are the cornerstone of all student financial \n     aid. Sadly, Pell Grants are only 75% of the value that they \n     were in 1980. Our twenty-eight Jesuit colleges and \n     institutions have given institutional grants to needy \n     students for centuries. Assisting poor needy students to \n     receive quality education is at the cornerstone of Jesuit \n     higher education. Currently, our twenty-eight institutions \n     give an average of 40% in institutional aid to needy students \n     to make up for declining federal dollars. We will always \n     remain committed to assisting needy students but continue to \n     need the assistance and committed support of the federal \n     government to educate all young Americans regardless of their \n     income.\n       Please know that we have been appreciative for the \n     increases that higher education has received over the last \n     four years. We know that the American public agrees with our \n     premise that education should be the number one priority in \n     this country. It is our hope that the Senate will see fit to \n     concur with the American public by adopting your Pell \n     amendment. And, it is our long-term hope that the Senate will \n     adopt a budget that offers opportunities for more \n     disadvantaged Americans across the country so that they too \n     can dream the same dreams that other Americans do without an \n     income prohibition.\n       Thank you for taking the initiative once against to assist \n     needy students. Our association commends your efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Cyndy Littlefield,\n                                    Director of Federal Relations.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nKennedy's amendment which would raise the individual maximum Pell grant \nAward to $3,700, an increase of $400.\n  Higher education is one of the most important investments our Federal \ngovernment can make. After all, for the United States to continue its \neconomic growth, we need an educated workforce.\n  I recognize that the federal government cannot guarantee that all \nAmericans will be able to attend a post secondary institution. But we \nmust ensure that all qualified Americans have equal access to a post \nsecondary education.\n  After all, Congress created need-based student financial aid programs \nto ensure that individuals from low-income families are not denied post \nsecondary education because they cannot afford it.\n  Grant aid, specifically Pell grant aid, is the key that enables many \nindividuals to graduate from college.\n  I am deeply concerned about the emergence of a widening educational \ngap between rich and poor. Statistic after statistic illustrates that \nstudents from low-income families are pursuing a post-secondary \neducation at a much slower rate than individuals from middle and upper \nincome families.\n  With more and more students attending college, the situation may get \nmuch worse unless Congress fully funds Pell. Over the next ten years, \nmore than 14 million undergraduates will be enrolled in colleges and \nuniversities around the country--an increase of 11 percent.\n  Many of these students will be the first in their families to attend \ncollege and one in five of these students will come from families with \nincomes below the poverty level. The same students that rely on need-\nbased student grant aid.\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\n  Without Pell grants, many individuals simply can't consider college--\nand without a college degree or serious post-secondary training, some \nemployers won't consider hiring these individuals.\n  Statistic after statistic shows that a college education helps those \nwho graduate from college with a bachelor's degree earn 74 percent more \nthan those who only complete high school.\n  What is so tragic is the decrease in Pell grant funding. The Pell \ngrant has failed to keep up with inflation. Over the past 25 years, the \nvalue of the average Pell grant has decreased by 23 percent--the \naverage grant is now worth only 77 percent of what Pell grants were \nworth in 1975.\n  What is even more troubling about the trend of increasing tuition and \ndecreasing impact of grant value is how students, especially low-income \nstudents, make up the difference between aid and tuition.\n  This chart illustrates grant and loan funding as a percentage of \ntotal aid.\n  As you can see, twenty years ago, grant aid comprised approximately \nfifty-two percent of a student's aid package, and loans comprised about \nforty-two percent.\n  Over the past 20 years, this trend has reversed itself--loans now \nconstitute almost 60 percent of total aid, and grants have plummeted to \nabout forty percent.\n  Unfortunately, some aren't aware of the recent funding trends for the \nPell Grant or its importance. Let's take a look at a recent headline of \nthe Eau-Claire Leader-Telegram:\n\n       Bush Averse to more college grant funding. Let students get \n     loans, candidate says in Eau Claire.\n\n  Apparently, Governor Bush isn't aware that most students are already \nhaving to fund their education through loans and more and more debt. \nWell, Mr. President, as I visit college campuses each year in \nWisconsin, I hear from students who are forced to turn to credit cards \nto pay the difference on tuition, for books or groceries.\n  In fact, last year alone, the number of students who took out non-\nfederal loans increased by 25 percent.\n  Well, it seems that Governor Bush believes that Congress needs to \nforce students to take on even more debt. Again, Governor Bush's views \non how students should pay for a post secondary education:\n\n       Some of it you are going to have to pay back, and that's \n     just the way it is because there is nothing free in society. \n     College is not free.\n\n  What, then, is need-based grant aid? Congress created need-based \ngrant aid to ensure that individuals from low and middle income \nfamilies are not denied post secondary education because they cannot \nafford it.\n  Congress created the student grant aid programs under the Higher \nEducation Act for the specific purpose of making college affordable for \nthose in need.\n  Even after someone pointed out that some students already carry a \nheavy loan repayment burden, Governor Bush didn't get the picture. \nAccording to the Leader-Telegram, Bush responded to this statement by \nsaying ``too bad.''\n  Congress should not say ``too bad'' to students who are in need. I \nbelieve that everyone deserves fair and equal access to a higher \neducation.\n  After all, that is why Congress created need based grant aid.\n  By supporting this amendment and an increase for the Pell grant \nprogram, Congress has a chance to renew its commitment to equal access \nfor all to higher education. I thank my colleagues for their time and \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in the Budget Committee, there was an \namendment offered to raise the Pell grants in this budget to the exact \nlevel the President of the United States requested, up to $3,500. That \nis what the President asked for. That is what is in the budget. I do \nnot think the President of the United States, the education President, \nwould be underfunding Pell grants. He has increased them in his budget, \nand it seems as if it is never enough.\n  What we have done is right and fair and leaves some room for other \neducation programs. We do not use up all the money doing that extra \nadd-on the Senator is asking for, but we do increase it up to the level \nof the President. I do not believe we should add to it at this point. I \nhope Senators will reject the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PROTECTION OF MEDICARE SURPLUSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President, \n     instead of protecting Medicare, reduces payments to Medicare \n     providers by $53 billion over 10 years;\n       (2) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President \n     calls for an increase in spending for fiscal year 2001 of $58 \n     billion and would increase taxes collected next year by $12 \n     billion;\n       (3) the fiscal year 2001 budget submitted by the President \n     continues to use the Medicare,\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\n     Part A surplus to mask the President's proposed increases in \n     spending; and\n       (4) in contrast to the President's budget, this budget \n     resolution protects Medicare, rejects the President's \n     Medicare cuts and provides $40 billion for prescription drug \n     coverage for needy seniors.\n       (b) Medicare Surpluses Off-budget.--The net surplus of any \n     trust fund for part A of Medicare shall not be counted as a \n     net surplus for purposes of the congressional budget.\n       (c) Points of Order to Protect Medicare Surpluses.--\n       (1) Concurrent resolutions on the budget.--It shall not be \n     in order in the House of Representatives or the Senate to \n     consider any concurrent resolution on the budget, or \n     conference report thereon or amendment thereto, that would \n     set forth an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year.\n       (2) Subsequent legislation.--It shall not be in order in \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any \n     bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion, or conference \n     report if--\n       (A) the enactment of that bill or resolution as reported;\n       (B) the adoption and enactment of that amendment; or\n       (C) the enactment of that bill or resolution in the form \n     recommended in that conference report; would cause or \n     increase an on-budget deficit for any fiscal year.\n       (3) Defintiion.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``on-budget deficit'', when applied to a fiscal year, means \n     the deficit in the budget as set forth in the most recently \n     agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget pursuant to \n     section 301(a)(3) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 for \n     that fiscal year.\n       (d) Medicare Look-back Sequester.--If in any fiscal year, \n     the Medicare, Part A surplus has been used to finance general \n     operations of the Federal government, an amount equal to the \n     amount used shall be sequestered for available discretionary \n     spending for the following fiscal year for purposes of any \n     concurrent resolution on the budget.\n       (e) Super Majority Requirement.--This section may be waived \n     or suspended in the Senate only by the affirmative vote of \n     three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the \n     Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required in the \n     Senate to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a \n     point of order raised under this section.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I would like to begin by praising Chairman Domenici for \nproducing this responsible budget, which I intend to support.\n  Chairman Domenici's budget will fully protect Social Security over 5 \nyears. This represents a sea change in the way business is done in \nWashington. When I came to Washington, Congress routinely spent money \nout of the Social Security trust fund, something that Chairman \nDomenici's budget does not even consider.\n  As a result of this hard-fought fiscal discipline, this budget will \nretire $1.1 trillion in publicly held debt over 5 years, and $177 \nbillion next year. If we continue upon the path laid out by this \nbudget, we will completely eliminate the publicly-held debt over the \nnext 13 years.\n  In addition to responsibly paying off our debt, this budget allows \nfor $150 billion in tax cuts over 5 years, including $13 billion in FY \n2001, and responsible increases in other discretionary accounts, \nincluding a 4.8% increase in national defense.\n  I would like to commend Senator Domenici for crafting this budget, \nand emphasize what a pleasure it is to work with him.\n  Last year, I worked with Senator Domenici on a rule in last year's \nbudget that created a point of order against any budget that spends \nmoney out of the Social Security surplus.\n  As a result of last year's budget rule, the CBO has stated that they \nFY 2000 budget will not spend a penny out of the Social Security \nsurplus for the first time in 40 years. This year, the Senate Budget \nCommittee estimates that the United States government will have an on-\nbudget surplus of $8 billion. This on-budget surplus allows the \ngovernment to protect the Social Security trust fund and to help reduce \nour publicly held debt by $300 billion by the end of this year.\n  Early last year, I introduced the first legislation designed to \nlockbox the Social Security trust fund. This legislation formed the \nbasis of the Ashcroft rule protecting Social Security included in last \nyear's budget resolution.\n  In addition, we spent much of last year working on the Abraham-\nDomenici-lockbox, which also would have protected all of the Social \nSecurity surpluses from new spending.\n  Unfortunately, the Democrats saw fit to block this legislation, \nfilibustering the lockbox 6 times.\n  Despite this opposition, we have succeeded in creating in practice \nwhat we have not yet achieved in legislation.\n  This year Senator Domenici included last year's Social Security rule \nin the FY 2001 budget, and Senator Abraham successfully offered a \ncommittee amendment to extend that point of order to 60 votes, which \nwas my original intention.\n  Protecting Social Security through the Social Security lockbox has \nbeen a giant step forward in the fight for responsible budgeting. Now \nit is time to take that fight one step further.\n  Today I am offering an amendment that creates points of order in the \nSenate and the House against any budget resolution or subsequent bill \nthat uses the Medicare or Social Security surpluses to finance on-\nbudget deficits. We do not have that protection now.\n  This new rule I am proposing expands the Social Security budget rule \nby adding Medicare part A to the Social Security lockbox, ensuring that \nCongress must balance the budget without using any money from the \nannual Social Security or Medicare part A surpluses. If Congress does \ndip into the Medicare part A surplus, my amendment calls for a \nsequester of discretionary spending in the amount of the violation.\n\n  While protecting the Medicare surplus seemed to be an unattainable \ngoal just a few short years ago, this goal is now within our reach. In \naddition to funding the government for fiscal year 2000 without \nspending a penny out of the Social Security trust fund, CBO projections \ndemonstrate that we now have enough revenue available to protect the \n$22 billion part A Medicare surplus as well.\n  It is imperative that we limit spending this year so that we do not \ndip into the Medicare surplus in FY 2001.\n  Both Medicare and Social Security are funded out of payroll taxes \nspecifically delineated for their respective purposes, and are supposed \nto be reserved for those purposes. If there are surpluses in these \naccounts, if these accounts take in more money than is necessary for \ntheir stated purposes in a specific year, then that money should not \nsuddenly be available for general government spending.\n  Any and all surpluses in those two accounts should be reserved for \ntheir stated purposes, or be used to help shore up those accounts. This \nlegislation promotes honest accounting, and requires the government to \nuse funds for their advertised purposes.\n  In addition to protecting these essential funds, the Medicare lockbox \nrule will send the powerful message that protecting Medicare and Social \nSecurity is our highest priority.\n  Social Security is scheduled to go bankrupt by 2037. Medicare is \nprojected to become insolvent even sooner, in 2023. We have made real \nprogress on these two fronts since the beginning of the Republican \nCongress. Social Security's projected insolvency has been extended from \n2029 to 2037, while Medicare's bankruptcy has been pushed back by a \ngreater amount, from 2002 to 2023. Despite this progress, we still have \nmore work to do.\n  Lockboxing Social Security and Medicare surpluses is an essential \nfirst step in securing the long term financial solvency of Medicare and \nSocial Security.\n  It is vitally important that we ensure that the government not spend \nmonies dedicated for the trust funds that sustain these essential \nprograms.\n  The Medicare lockbox rule will change the way business is done in \nWashington. We should pass the Medicare lockbox rule, so that \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare will be part of the rules of \nthe Senate. Passing this rule will be the next step on our journey to \nsecure the long term solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am opposed but I yield half of my time \nto Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment sounds as if it protects \nMedicare, but it would cause even\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\ndeeper cuts in education and law enforcement and would make \nimplementing Medicare reforms more difficult in the future, including \nimplementing a prescription drug benefit. I recommend that my \ncolleagues vote against this amendment and hope it will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not believe we ought to take the HI \ntrust fund off budget. That is what this amendment does. In the budget \nresolution, we have $40 billion for Medicare and we do not accept the \nPresident's cuts for Medicare. I think we have done right by Medicare. \nIf we can incorporate these numbers in a bill this year, I think we \nwill be on the right track. This just won't work. Medicare is not a \ntrust fund like Social Security. I am grateful that Senator Ashcroft is \ntrying to do this. He has been a leader in protecting Medicare and \nSocial Security. I do not think this will work.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment is not \ngermane to the budget resolution.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of \norder. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to the motion to waive the Budget Act \nin relation to the Ashcroft amendment No. 3032.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Lautenberg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2957.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the substitute \nBudget Resolution introduced by Senator Lautenberg. Unlike the \nRepublican Budget Resolution, Senator Lautenberg's Democratic \nalternative puts real teeth into priorities such as prescription drugs, \nSocial Security, education, and paying down the debt. I support the \nDemocratic proposal because it focuses on our national priorities \nfirst. But I want to add a word of caution. Our national defense is \nunderfunded in both resolutions. We cannot afford, as a nation, to \ncontinue to underfund our nation's security. Freedom has a price. We \ncan't take it for granted. We're not building enough new weapons \nplatforms and systems to be able to meet our obligations here at home \nor our commitments to our allies abroad. We can't recruit and maintain \nthe soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines we need. We can't adequately \nmodernize, much less revolutionize, our Armed Forces without putting \nmore money into our defense budget. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle to meet our responsibilities in \nthis area.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Democratic alternative reflects \nsix key principles in its budget. It protects every penny of the Social \nSecurity surplus; it pays down the public debt by 2013; it funds a \nbadly needed prescription drug benefit; it includes targeted tax cuts \nfor working Americans, and it funds important defense and domestic \npriorities such as education, health, research, and agriculture.\n  Unlike the Republican budget, this plan is based on realistic \nassumptions about domestic spending. It contains projections for a full \n10 years so we know what will happen.\n\n  In sum, we have a responsible package that focuses on the needs of \nordinary Americans today and the needs of our Nation in the future. I \nurge my colleagues to support this Democratic alternative.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a full substitute. It is a so-\ncalled Democrat budget, and essentially the big difference between the \ntwo budgets is that over time this Democrat budget will give back to \nthe American people 4 percent of the non-Social Security surplus. We \nthink over time we should give them back 11 percent. The difference is \nthe Democrats spend 22 percent and we spend 17 percent of the surplus.\n  We think this is not the time to grow Government that much but, \nrather, leave a little bit more than 4 percent for tax relief for the \nAmerican people. There are many other differences, but this essentially \nis the difference.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning).

CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator \nJeffords, Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, and a bipartisan group of Senators in offering this \namendment which reaches the goal of fully-funding IDEA--the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act--within five years.\n  IDEA was first enacted in 1975 and authorizes funding, mostly in the \nform of state grants, to assist states in paying for educational \nservices for disabled young people from 3-21. It requires states which \nprovide public education, also to provide a ``free, appropriate public \neducation'' to this population. Prior to enactment, an estimated 2 \nmillion young people either were not receiving any public educational \nservices, or the services they were receiving were inadequate. A number \nof judicial decisions held that it was unconstitutional for States \nwhich provide public education to withhold services from a specific \ngroup--the disabled. As a result, States felt compelled to provide \neducational services to individuals with disabilities and sought help \nto do so at the Federal level.\n  The Federal Government responded by enacting IDEA. This important \nprotection for young people with disabilites suggests that the Federal \nGovernment will pay for up to 40 percent of the average per pupil \nexpenditure for these students. Regrettably, despite Republican efforts \nto increase IDEA funding each year for the past several years, we have \nfallen far short of that goal. Also, Senator Domenici has included a \nsignificant increase for IDEA in this Budget Resolution that is before \nus, and I commend him for his effort to address this problem. But I \nbelieve we must do even more.\n  I would like to read the lead paragraph from an article that appeared \nin the Providence Journal yesterday on this subject. Headline: \n``Special-ed costs soaring, board is told.'' Dateline: Warwick--I was \nMayor of Warwick for seven years and am very familiar with its funding \nneeds:\n\n       The school committee was told last night that the system's \n     special education costs, already a heavy burden for schools \n     throughout the state, are continuing to grow and that there \n     will be less federal money around to help pay for it next \n     year.\n\n  Already at 20 percent of the city's education budget, the article \nwent on to say, special education is the fastest growing cost for the \nschool district.\n  It's important to remember that typically school costs are borne by \nproperty taxpayers. If we want to help the taxpayers, we should be \nhelping the property taxpayers. This is a message that will resonate \nback home.\n  Of course, this situation isn't unique to Warwick or a problem just \nin Rhode Island. I would venture to say that there probably isn't a \nSenator in this Chamber who hasn't heard from his state's school boards \nabout the spiraling costs of special education. Now, Senator Jeffords \nhas crafted an amendment which will bring Federal funding for special \neducation up to the promised 40 percent level within five years. This \nis an amendment in which I believe wholeheartedly, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, to \nstrike a small part of the overly large tax cut included in this budget \nresolution and instead use that money for grants to the states under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, IDEA.\n  For too long the federal government has failed to live up to its \nresponsibility to provide to the States the up to 40 percent of the \nnational average per pupil expenditure for each disabled child served \nallowed by IDEA.\n  During the current fiscal year, the federal government will fund only \nabout 12.6 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure. This \nis 37.4 percent less than the maximum amount allowed under IDEA--an \namount that the federal government has not once provided to the states \nsince this funding formula was created.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, Congress is \nappropriating only about a third of what would be required to fully \nfund IDEA.\n  As I travel around my home state of Wisconsin every year to host \nlistening sessions in each of our 72 counties, I hear time and time \nagain from frustrated parents, school administrators, teachers, school \nboard members, and others about the need for an increase in special \neducation funding at the federal level.\n  Just last week at my Dane County listening session, one of my \nconstituents told me that full funding of the maximum federal share of \nIDEA would have meant an additional $17 million for his school district \nduring the 1999-2000 school year. And there are stories like that \nacross my state and around the country.\n  In Wisconsin, and in many other states, the population of students \neligible for special education is outpacing the modest annual increases \nin the Federal share of special education funding, and state and local \ngovernments are struggling to keep up.\n  Mr. President, the efforts of our pubic schools to serve students \nwith disabilities are a hallmark of our national commitment to a free \nappropriate public education for all children. Since 1975, public \nschools have helped students with disabilities become more self-\nsufficient, to prepare for employment, and to learn the skills they \nwill need to lead productive lives. America's public schools have led \nthe way toward the full integration of individuals with disabilities in \nour national life. Our society is richer for it.\n  IDEA has provided access to free, appropriate public education for \nmillions of previously unserved or underserved students. Through \nassessments, evaluations, and Individual Education Program (IEPs), \nevery disabled student is\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nserved based on his or her individual educational needs in the setting \nwhere those needs can best be met.\n  We must do more to help state and local governments pay for the cost \nof educating these children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support his common sense amendment. It will \nmove toward fully funding the federal share of IDEA, and it will help \nto provide badly needed relief for a deserving group of Americans.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support this bipartisan effort \nto provide more funding for the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct. As I've said time and again, disability is not a partisan issue. \nWe all share an interest in ensuring that children with disabilities \nand their families get a fair shake in life. And the 25th anniversary \nof IDEA is the perfect year to improve the capacity of school districts \nto meet their responsibilities to children with disabilities.\n  Currently, the State grant program within IDEA receives $5 billion. \nEstimates by the Congressional Research Service suggest that the \nprogram needs to be funded at $15.8 billion each year to meet the \ntargets established in 1975. Our amendment would increase funding for \nIDEA annually in roughly $2 billion increments over the next five years \nand would put us on track to meet our goal of 40 percent funding.\n  I know many of you have heard this speech before. Every year I stand \non the Senate floor at least once or twice and give a short history \nlesson around IDEA. Well, this year is no different.\n  In the early seventies, two landmark federal district court cases--\nPARC versus Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Mills versus Board of \nEducation of the District Court of Columbia--established that children \nwith disabilities have a constitutional right to a free appropriate \npublic education. In 1975, in response to these cases, Congress enacted \nthe Education of Handicapped Children Act, the precursor to IDEA--to \nhelp states meet their constitutional obligations.\n  Congress enacted PL 94-142 for two reasons. First, to establish a \nconsistent policy of what constitutes compliance with the equal \nprotection clause of the 14th amendment with respect to the education \nof kids with disabilities. And, second, to help States meet their \nconstitutional obligations through federal funding. The Supreme Court \nreiterated this in Smith versus Robinson: ``[EHA] is a comprehensive \nscheme set up by Congress to aid the states in complying with their \nconstitutional obligations to provide public education for handicapped \nchildren.''\n  I strongly agree with the policy of this amendment and the infusion \nof more money into IDEA. A Senator Jeffords has explained, this is a \nwin-win for everyone. Students with disabilities will be more likely to \nget the public education they have a right to because school districts \nwill have the capacity to provide such an education--without cutting \ninto their general education budgets.\n  However, as much as I agree with the policy of our amendment, I \ndisagree with some of the rhetoric around this issue.\n  As I see it, a mythology has been created around the 40 percent \nfigure. Some people describe it as a ``promise'' or ``pledge'' on the \npart of the federal government to fund IDEA at 40 percent. Well, the 40 \npercent figure is simply a funding formula, just like the funding \nformulas found in lots and lots of other statutes.\n  In 1975, the EHA authorized the maximum award per state as being the \nnumber of children served times 40 percent of the national average per \npupil expenditure--known as the APPE. The formula does not guarantee 40 \npercent of national APPE per disabled child served; rather, it caps \nIDEA allotments at 40% of national APPE. In other words, the 40 percent \nfigure was a goal, not a commitment.\n  As the then ranking minority member on the House Ed and Labor \nCommittee, Representative Albert Quie, explained: ``I do not know in \nthe subsequent years whether we will appropriate at those [authorized] \nlevels or not. I think what we are doing here is laying out the goal. \nIgnoring other Federal priorities, we thought it acceptable if funding \nreaches that level.''\n  The important point in the Congressman's statement is that we cannot \nfund IDEA grant programs at the cost of other important federal \nprograms. That is why historically the highest appropriation for \nspecial education funding was in FY 1979, when allocations represented \n12.5 percent APPE. During the Reagan years, the appropriation went back \ndown.\n  But, over the last five years, as ranking member on the Labor-H \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have worked with my colleagues across \nthe aisle to more than double the IDEA appropriation so that we're back \nup to over 12.5 percent.\n  And, today, we are in an even better position to do the right thing. \nWe are presented with a non-Social Security budget surplus. Our economy \nis in great shape. We have the opportunity to pay off the public debt. \nWe will continue to protect the Social Security trust fund. And--even \nbetter--we can use money from the non-Social Security surplus to ensure \nthat seniors get prescription drugs, school kids benefit from smaller \nclass size, and students with disabilities get the services they have a \nright to.\n  All of these proposals make more sense than providing wealthy \nAmericans with tax cuts that will eat up the non-Social Security \nsurplus.\n  Last year's Supreme Court decision regarding Garret Frey of Cedar \nRapids, Iowa underscores the need for Congress to help school districts \nwith the financial costs of educating children with disabilities. While \nthe excess costs of educating some children with disabilities is \nminimal, the excess costs of educating other children with \ndisabilities, like Garret, is great.\n  Under our amendment, my home state of Iowa would receive a total \nincrease of over $346 million over the next five years.\n  Of course, lots of places are already doing a great job of educating \nall of our kids. I just found out about a school district in Iowa--a \ndistrict that includes my hometown of Cumming--that's delivering on \nIDEA's promise of full inclusion . . . on budget! According to the \nsuperintendent, IDEA works for everyone. For example, a girl with \ncerebral palsy takes home economics and French in the regular \nclassroom. Just imagine varsity football players working on home-ec \nprojects with a girl in a wheelchair. Each student learns about their \nvalue as individuals and their value as members of a team and \ncommunity.\n  These new dollars would go a long way toward making a real difference \nfor both children with disabilities and their families. I've heard from \nparents in Iowa that their kids need more qualified interpreters for \ndeaf and hard of hearing children and they need better mental health \nservices and better behavioral assessments. And the additional funds \nwill help local and area education agencies build capacity in these \nareas.\n  We must redouble our efforts to help school districts meet their \nconstitutional obligations. We need to increase dollars to every \nprogram under IDEA, not just the state grant programs.\n  And, of course, by receiving federal dollars, states take on certain \nresponsibilities. IDEA dollars are intended to provide children with \ndisabilities an equal opportunity to public education. States must use \nthis money in a way that builds their capacity to deliver necessary \neducational and related services to students with disabilities and meet \ntheir obligations under the law.\n  As I understand it, one of the National Governors' Association's top \npriorities is to get more funding for special education. And that's \njust what our amendment does. The Education Task Force of the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities strongly supports this \namendment, along with the National Association of Directors of Special \nEducation, the National School Boards Association, and American \nAssociation of School Administrators.\n  As I said at the beginning, we can all agree that states should \nreceive more money under IDEA. And, today, we have the incredible \nopportunity to fund IDEA--at no real cost to other national programs. I \nthank Senator Jeffords and Senator Dodd for their leadership on this \nissue. I encourage my colleagues to join us in support of the \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment by \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Dodd to increase funding for IDEA by $2 \nbillion a year for the next five years.\n\n[[Page S2398]]\n\n  For 22 years, IDEA has brought hope to young persons with \ndisabilities that they too can learn, and that their learning will \nenable them to become independent and productive citizens and live \nfulfilling lives. For millions of children with disabilities, IDEA has \nmeant the difference between dependence and independence, between lost \npotential and productive careers.\n  In 1975, 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they \nneeded to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers received \nservices, and 1 million children with disabilities were excluded from \npublic school. Now, IDEA serves 5.4 million children with disabilities \nfrom birth through age 21. Every state in the nation offers public \neducation and early intervention services for children with \ndisabilities.\n  Today, fewer than 6,000 disabled children are living in institutional \nsettings away from their families, compared to 95,000 children in 1969. \nWe are keeping families together, and reducing the cost to the \ntaxpayers of paying for institutional care, which averages $50,00 a \nchild each year.\n  The number of disabled students completing high school with a diploma \nor certificates has increased by 10% in the last decade. The number of \nstudents with disabilities entering higher education has more than \ntripled since the implementation of IDEA.\n  Most important, 57% of disabled youth are competitively employed \nwithin five years of leaving school today, compared to an employment \nrate of only 25% for disabled adults who have not benefited from IDEA.\n  These accomplishments do not come without financial costs. It is time \nfor Congress to meet its commitment to help schools provide the \nservices and support that give children with special needs the \neducational opportunities to pursue their dreams. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, 25 years ago, the United States Congress \nmade a commitment to pay each school in America 40 percent of the \nnational average per pupil expenditure for every special education \nstudent it enrolled--Washington promised it would help our local \ncommunities meet the cost of educating students with special needs.\n  Unfortunately, the Federal Government has failed to meet this \nobligation, creating an unfunded mandate that must be borne by every \nstate and community in America. For the current school year the average \nper pupil expenditure is $6,000, yet we have appropriated only $702 per \nstudent only 11.7% of the cost--slightly more than one fourth of out \npromise. To meet the Federal commitment, the budget resolution should \nassume an expenditure of $15.8 billion for this year. I commend Senator \nDomenici and the Budget Committee for recognizing the importance of \nthis commitment and for providing a $1 billion increase in fiscal year \n2001. But this is not enough, and we must do more--we must embark on a \nshort path to full funding. We have the resources to do it, and the \namendment before the Senate starts us on our journey to full funding.\n\n  What would this mean for our states and local school districts? Let's \ntake Maine as an example. For this year the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act promises Maine $2,400 per student receiving \nspecial education services. However, the Federal Government will spend \nonly slightly more than $702 per student--which means that Maine will \nreceive $60 million less than it was promised. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education, the unmet mandate stands at an astounding $11 \nbillion nationally. We can not continue to shift this burden to our \nlocal communities. We must meet the Federal commitment to help pay for \nspecial education and end this unfunded mandate.\n  Last month, I met with about 75 superintendents and principals from \nnorthern and eastern Maine to discuss the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. What was supposed to be a wide-\nranging dialog about Federal funding under the ESEA immediately settled \ninto a discussion about special education. They told me that in each of \ntheir schools and districts, meeting the special education mandate \nrequires dollars that otherwise could be used for school construction, \nteacher salaries, new computers, and other effort to improve the \nperformance of their students. They called on us to meet our promise to \nhelp pay for special education. They spoke with one voice in strong, \nunified support for more special education funding, not for new Federal \nprograms.\n  The Jeffords-Collins amendment would means an additional $155 million \nfor Maine schools over the next five years. Mr. President, we need to \nmeet our commitment to bear our fair share of special education costs. \nWhen faced with the siren's call for new Federal programs, we must keep \nin mind what our parents, teachers, and local administrators have told \nus. If we want to do something for the children of America, let us fund \nspecial education, and our schools will be able to hire their our own \nteachers and build their own schools. The best thing this Congress can \ndo for education is to move toward fully funding the Federal \nGovernment's share of special education--not to stand in place as the \nPresident's budget would have us do.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jeffords-Collins amendment and \ngive our states and local communities the financial help they have been \npromised and so desperately need. Let's finally keep the promise made \nmore than 25 years ago.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have a clear choice before us today. We \nhave the opportunity to fulfill our commitment to fully fund the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). We can accomplish \nthis long overdue goal by simply reducing this measure's tax relief. We \ncan strengthen our commitment to special needs children, their parents, \nand our local school boards, or instead, we can once again shirk our \ncommitment to special education in favor of even larger tax relief, the \ngreat majority of which benefits the most wealthy.\n  The Jeffords-Dodd amendment is simple. When Congress passed IDEA in \n1975, we made a commitment to provide 40 percent of special education \ncosts. Presently we provide 12.7 percent, the highest level ever \nreached by the federal government. Our amendment would fully fund IDEA \nover a five-year period, at the 40 percent level Congress originally \npledged, by increasing the allocation to Function 500 of the budget \nresolution for special education, and for the first time will allow us \nto meet our obligation to special needs children and local schools.\n  In my own state of Connecticut, Mr. President, the state spends more \nthan $700 million annually, or 18 percent of the state's overall \neducation budget, to fund special education programs. In Connecticut's \ntowns, the picture is even worse. Too often our local school districts \nare struggling to meet the needs of their students with disabilities. \nIn Torrington, Connecticut, special education costs recently increased \nfrom $635,000 to $1.3 million over a two year period. Our schools need \nour help.\n  The National Governors' Association (NGA) recently wrote me--in a \nletter dated March 7, the NGA writes: ``Governors believe the single \nmost effective step Congress could take to help address education needs \nand priorities, in the context of new budget constraints, would be to \nmeet its commitment to fully fund the federal portion of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).''\n  Additional organizations in support of this amendment include the \nConsortium for Citizens with Disabilities, the National School Boards \nAssociation, the National League of Cities, the National Education \nAssociation, the National Federation of Teachers, and the National \nAssociation of State Directors of Special Education.\n  Mr. President, isn't it time Congress made good on its pledge to \nspecial needs of children? We have an opportunity before us today to \nstrengthen our commitment to children with special needs. We have the \nopportunity to simply reduce the tax cuts contained within the budget \nresolution, and by doing so, offer our state and local school district \nhelp in providing educational services to children with disabilities. \nBy supporting this amendment, we not only fulfill our commitment to \nspecial education, we also alleviate the burden we place on our local \nschool districts by not providing our fair share of special education \ncosts. I ask that my colleagues seize this opportunity and support this \namendment and choose to help our schools better serve children with \ndisabilities.\n\n[[Page S2399]]\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask that Senator Lieberman be added as \na cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthe amendment by Senators Jeffords, Dodd, Stevens, Kennedy, Collins, \nSnowe, L. Chafee, and Feingold. We have voted many times, often 99-0, \nto fully fund IDEA. Failure to agree to this amendment will tell the \nNation we do not ever intend to make good on this pledge. We have \nunprecedented economic prosperity. We have surpluses well into the \nfuture. We can do it now.\n  For 25 years, we have promised to pay 40 percent of the cost of \neducating students with disabilities. Today, we pay 13 percent. The \nchart behind me shows the truth about the budget resolution. It \nproposes to move us from 13 percent to 18 percent. It says clearly to \nthe Nation, despite all our rhetoric, we never intend to keep our word.\n  Our amendment will fully fund our promise. I ask my colleagues: If \nnot now, when?\n  The time is now.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \nJeffords amendment to the desk.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As good as this idea sounds, we ought not do this. This \nis taking a major appropriation, a program we fund in appropriations \nevery year, and making it an entitlement.\n  There are a lot of great education programs. What if we start taking \nevery appropriations bill that has exciting ideas for Americans and we \nsay we don't want to appropriate them anymore; we will just turn them \nup as if they are Social Security, entitled to automatic funding.\n  It is not the right thing to do, no matter what the program is. It is \nour responsibility to pay for IDEA, and special ed, not an entitlement \nagainst the American people without anybody voting on it again.\n  It is not the right thing to do. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 3075 To Amendment 2984\n\n              (Purpose: To provide full funding for IDEA)\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment to the Jeffords amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Ohio [Mr. Voinovich], for himself, Mr. \n     Gregg, and Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 3075 \n     to amendment 2984.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, the budget resolution provides a \ngenerous increase in spending in education, just as the FY 2000 \neducation appropriations bill did. Basically, this amendment says that \nwithin the framework of the budget resolution, IDEA should be given \npriority. We have increased discretionary spending on education 100 \npercent during the last 10 years, but during that same period, the most \nwe have spent is 12.6 percent of the cost of IDEA, and we are supposed \nto be spending 40 percent. This amendment gives priority to IDEA \nwithout spending another $31 billion over the next 5 years, as \nsuggested in the underlying amendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \nsecond-degree amendment. It does not do anything at all. I listened to \nmy colleague from New Mexico talk about the pointlessness of sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendments.\n  The Senator from Vermont is offering the Senate an opportunity to do \nsomething that every Governor and mayor in this country wants, and that \nis to increase funding for special education.\n  The Governors were here only a month ago, and their top priority was \nspecial education. The Senator from Vermont is offering a real \namendment, and that is, over the next 4 to 5 years, reduce this tax cut \na little bit and apply those resources to special education; send the \nmoney back to our communities and States.\n  With all due respect, the second-degree amendment says it is the \nsense of the Senate that we ought to do something about it sometime. We \nare not going to do anything about it if we do not adopt the Jeffords \namendment. I urge rejection of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this will use $31 billion of the \nsurplus. It will eat it up with a brand new entitlement, and it will \ntake jurisdiction away from the appropriators in the normal course of \nallocating what America's Government ought to be doing.\n  I repeat, the sense-of-the-Senate amendment establishes this as the \nhighest priority, but we should not be\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\nsetting a $31 billion entitlement program in motion today for a piece \nof education. Because we did not do our job on this, we should not make \nan entitlement to make up for our deficiency in not funding it \nproperly.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I move to table the second-degree \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n3075.

Mr. President, 7 months after Hurricane Floyd hit North \nCarolina and other States along the east coast, we still have thousands \nof people who are living in trailers and thousands more who have no \nplace to live. We have towns such as Princeville and Tarboro that have \nliterally been wiped out. Innocent, law-abiding, tax-paying people \ndesperately need our help. This amendment provides $250 million in \nrelief for the people of North Carolina and all of the victims of \nHurricane Floyd.\n  This photograph, taken the day before yesterday, shows that we are \nstill suffering and are still struggling. I thank my colleagues very \nmuch for their support of this amendment, and I yield to the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator.\n  Hurricane Floyd may be out of the headlines, but it is not out of \npeople's lives. From Florida to Maine, thousands of people lost their \nhomes. Communities are facing devastating tax increases to repair \nbridges and roads and schools. This addition to the budget will allow \nus to begin the planning to help these families. I urge my colleagues \nto vote in favor of it, and I thank Senator Domenici for his help.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I am pleased to co-sponsor the \nSpecter-Harkin amendment to increase funding for health research by \n$2.7 billion, an increase of 15 percent over last year.\n  For Fiscal Year 2001, the President is requesting a 5.6 percent \nincrease. That is not enough. Congress has shown its commitment to our \nfive-year goal of doubling NIH funding. In 1997, the Senate voted 98-0 \nto adopt the Mack-Feinstein amendment, which urged Congress to double \nthe budget of the National Institutes of Health over 5 years. To stay \non target, we must add 15 percent again this year, bringing NIH funding \nto $20.5 billion. That is what this amendment does.\n  This Fiscal Year, the National Institutes of Health is only funding \nan estimated 31 percent of grant applications. The National Institute \non Aging is only funding 22 percent, and the National Institute of \nEnvironmental Health Sciences, 25 percent. NIH officials believe that \nat least 35 percent of applicants are worthy of funding and others say \n50 percent should be funded. Without a significant increase in funding, \nhundreds of important projects will go without funding. What is it we \naren't learning? How many millions of people aren't treated, or cured?\n  Every day 1,500 people in the U.S. die of cancer, our nation's second \nleading cause of death. This year over half a million people will die \nof cancer, and 1.2 million will face a new cancer diagnosis. While the \nmortality rate has dropped for major cancers, including lung, \ncolorectal, breast, and prostate, the mortality rate has risen for \nliver cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n  The National Cancer Institute has a number of promising areas of \nresearch, including: (1) better understanding the unique \ncharacteristics of cells and how they become cancerous; (2) molecule-\ndirected prevention approaches, such as Herceptin for advanced breast \ncancer, Rituximab for non-Hodgin's lymphoma, and STI 571 for leukemia; \nand (3) early detection of cancer and cancer risk through genetic \nexplanation for cancer risks, environmental influences, and responses \nto therapies. But we spend one-tenth of one cent of every federal \ndollar on cancer research.\n  There are still too many diseases for which we have no cure. AIDS has \nsurpassed accidents as the leading killer of young adults; it is now \nthe leading cause of death among Americans ages 25 to 44. Diabetes and \nasthma rates are rising. Forty-thousand infants die each year from \ndevastating diseases. Seven to 10 percent of children are learning \ndisabled. Birth defects affecting function occur in 7 percent of \ndeliveries; that's 250,000 children.\n  Another compelling reason to double NIH funding is that the baby boom \ngeneration is getting older. Over the next 30 years, the number of \nAmericans over age 65 will double. As our population ages, we are \nseeing an increase in chronic and degenerative diseases like arthritis, \ncancer, osteoporosis, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. For example, the 4 \nmillion people with Alzheimer's Disease today will more than triple, to \n14 million, by the middle of the next century--unless we find a way to \nprevent or cure it. Health care costs will grow exponentially and we \nsee that in part reflected in our budget debates over Medicare and \nMedicaid expenditures. The total annual cost of Alzheimer's today is \n$100 billion. By finding new treatments through research, if we delay \nthe onset of this disease by 5 years, we can save $50 billion annually.\n  This increase in funding for the NIH is important to California. \nCalifornia organizations receive 20 percent of all NIH grants, and the \nUniversity of California is one of the top recipients of NIH funding. I \nam proud to say that California and the UC system contribute \nimmeasurably to medical research supported by NIH grants. With support \nof NIH, many California researchers have helped find new cures and \ntreatments. For example, Dr. Naomi Balaban at the University of \nCalifornia, Davis, with funding from the NIH, discovered a \nrevolutionary way to fight staph infections without antibiotics by \nblocking the occurrences that make the bacteria harmful to humans. \nThen, she created a vaccine that successfully aided mice in resisting \nthis infection.\n  We have made tremendous strides in medical research in the last \ndecade. The Association of American Medical Colleges states, in a June \n1999 paper on clinical research:\n\n       Perhaps the most profound challenge of this era is the \n     sheer scope of scientific and technologic opportunity. The \n     future of scientific advancement and its potential to \n     transform medical practice and improve the health of the \n     public have never been brighter. Astonishing advancements in \n     the basic sciences have profoundly increased understanding of \n     disease mechanisms and identified a plentitude of novel \n     targets for therapeutic and preventive interventions.\n\n  Better treatments are available, and scientists are learning more and \nmore about how to treat diseases. Patient access to cutting-edge \ntreatments is critical to further research and improve the health of \nAmericans. The NIH is beginning to expand clinical research and, with \nadditional funds, more people can reap the benefits of clinical trials \nand more effective treatments can be found.\n  For example, the NIH is working on a vaccine for AIDS, better \ntreatments for diabetes, and a better understanding of the entire human \ngenome and its implications. Understanding a person's genetic make-up \nis helping researchers understand how genes affect a person's \nsusceptibility to disease. This year's development of a new flu drug is \na direct result of AIDS research, and a drug now used to treat \nhepatitis B was originally created to treat AIDS. Additionally, studies \nhave produced better glucose-sensing devices that will greatly reduce \nthe number of finger pricks that diabetics endure.\n  The United States is the world's leader in understanding disease, in \ndeveloping sophisticated treatments for illnesses and diseases, in \nmaking important medical discoveries, and in improving human life \nexpectancy. Yet, we are spending only three cents of every health care \ndollar on health research. NIH's budget is less than one percent of the \nfederal budget.\n  Inconsistent funding for the NIH discourages the medical community \nfrom pursuing research. According to the National Academy of Sciences, \nwe are not producing enough research scientists. That is, in part, due \nto the uncertainty in health research funding.\n  Simply put, we can do better. We must try to ensure that all \npromising areas of research are pursued.\n  The public is with us. Fifty-five percent of Californians said they \nwould spend one dollar more in taxes per week for medical research, and \n55 percent of Americans said that it is important for the U.S. to \nremain a world leader in medical research. Every day, I hear from \nCalifornians who want a cure for their children, a better treatment for \na parent, and more knowledge to prevent disease in themselves. I \nbelieve the public wants us to fight a war on disease and that the \npublic sees medical research as a top priority for the federal \ngovernment. I urge passage of this amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this amendment seeks to add $1.6 billion \nfor NIH funding to fulfill the commitment made by the Senate on the \nunanimous 98-0 vote to double NIH funding over 5 years.\n  The National Institutes of Health are the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment. In fact, they are the only jewel of the Federal Government. \nThere will be a second-degree amendment offered that will seek to \nestablish a priority for this money, to take it from somewhere else, \nwhich is meaningless. The only way to fund NIH in accordance with the \ncommitment of the Senate is to adopt this amendment, which is \ncosponsored by Senators Harkin, Mack, Dodd, Snowe, Collins, Bingaman, \nSarbanes, Mikulski, Breaux, Boxer, Johnson, Graham of Florida, \nFeinstein, Wellstone, Kennedy, and Durbin.\n  We have gotten a detailed appraisal from NIH as to what they have \ndone with the money. It is being wisely used. It is the most important \ncapital investment for America for the future.\n\n[[Page S2402]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that is an incorrect statement. The NIH \ncan go up the amount the Senator desires if he and his subcommittee, \nwhich will be receiving a 14-percent increase under the allocation we \nhave made--and I would not be surprised if this got more than a 14-\npercent increase by the time allocations are completed. In other words, \nthe subcommittee with NIH in it is already going up about 14 percent. \nNIH is going up to a huge sum of $19 billion.\n  But the Senator who chairs the committee can decide he wants to spend \nmore than $19 billion. He will have to look at that myriad of \nprograms--you know, $100 billion in that subcommittee --and decide \nwhether he can find money to increase NIH even more. We increased it \n$1.1 billion in this budget.\n  That is our recommendation. Frankly, all we are doing here is \nspending more money. It really doesn't have anything to do with NIH. It \nis raising the amount of money available to be spent on domestic \nprograms.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3076 to Amendment No. 2994\n\n   (Purpose: Increase discretionary health funding by $1,600,000,000)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3076 to Amendment No. 2994.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 19, line 7, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 19, line 8, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 7, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, increase the amount by $1,600,000,000.\n       On page 42, line 5, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 42, line 6, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 43, line 14, increase the amount by $1.\n       On page 43, line 15, increase the amount by $1.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. It says that \nthe Senate, if it votes for the Domenici substitute, is saying to the \nAppropriations Committee, within that $100 billion or more you are \ngoing to have to spend on labor, health, and human services, the \nhighest priority shall be given to the National Institutes of Health. \nThat is what this amendment says. If that isn't enough of an \ninstruction, saying how we feel, I don't know how we can do it. But we \ndon't have to increase the overall spending by the amount requested by \nthe distinguished Senator. We can just say find it within this 14-\npercent increase that is going to his subcommittee to be spent on \nlabor, health, and human services in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is true that the budget for three \nmajor departments is a large budget. But it is not possible to find \n$2.7 billion in the budget as proposed, when we have other education \nprograms, where we have other health programs, where we have other \nlabor programs on worker safety. The choice really is up to the Senate; \nthat is, whether they will authorize the $2.7 billion increase, which \nis what NIH needs to fulfill the commitment already made by the Senate \non the unanimous 98-0 vote. A vote in favor of this second-degree \namendment is a vote against NIH funding for $2.7 billion.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator. He is absolutely right. The \nnondiscretionary budget we have to work with is $7 billion below a \nfreeze. It is not a 14-percent increase. As the Senator knows, we took \nsome of that BA last year and put it into this year. So we had an \nartificially low BA that year. What is in the Specter amendment is so \nimportant.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nsupport for the amendment offered by Senators Durbin, Schumer and \nKennedy to fully fund the President's firearms law enforcement \ninitiatives.\n  Clearly, the gun violence facing our Nation is a complex problem, and \nthere is disagreement in the Congress about the need for additional \nfirearms legislation. However, many of my colleagues--both Democratic \nand Republican alike--are heeding the call of their constituents and \nadvocating more stringent enforcement of our existing gun laws. With \nour Nation experiencing unprecedented fiscal health, we now have the \nopportunity to provide law enforcement with the resources it so \nurgently needs to enforce those laws. The Administration recognized \nthat opportunity, and included in its proposed budget approximately \n$284 million to fund the largest national gun enforcement initiative in \nour history.\n  Mr. President, the Republican budget resolution does not include this \n$284 million for gun enforcement measures and, as a result, jeopardizes \nprograms that have begun to make a real impact and helped to reduce \nfirearms violence. For example, in my own State of Maryland, our United \nStates Attorney, Lynne Battaglia has utilized Project DISARM--a \ncooperative effort between Federal, State, county, and local law \nenforcement officials that targets violent and repeat offenders for \nprosecution under Federal firearms laws. Similar to Richmond, \nVirginia's well-known ``Project Exile,'' Project DISARM was initiated \nin 1994 and has real potential for reducing firearm violence across the \nState.\n  Despite the initial success of Project DISARM--and tough Maryland \nlaws that also prohibit felons from possessing firearms --the program \nsimply does not have the resources to prosecute every person who \nviolates these Federal laws. Project DISARM works with a limited staff, \nwhich is also responsible for prosecuting complex drug and money \nlaundering cases. Simply put, for Project DISARM to effectively reduce \nfurther gun violence, additional prosecutors are needed. The \nPresident's $284 million gun control and enforcement initiative would \nadd 500 new Federal ATF agents and over 1,000 new Federal, State and \nlocal prosecutors; $14.5 million of these funds would be used to create \n163 positions--including 113 attorneys--to bolster firearms prosecution \nefforts like Project DISARM.\n  The resources provided in the President's budget are critical to \nMaryland's efforts to prevent gun violence, and could save lives in my \nState. Whatever our views on new gun control measures, we must work to \nensure that our existing laws are enforced to their fullest extent--\nwhich will not occur unless law enforcement agencies have the resources \nto investigate and prosecute crimes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this amendment to fully \nfund the President's gun control and enforcement initiative. This is a \nsimple proposition that we should all agree on--the enforcement of our \nexisting gun laws is a necessary step in reducing crime and making the \nNation a safer place for us all.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield my 1 minute to my colleague and \ncosponsor of the amendment, Senator Schumer.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and for \nhis leadership on this amendment.\n  This is an amendment on guns but one on which we can all come \ntogether because it simply deals with increasing enforcement. It would \nadd 500 new Federal ATF agents and inspectors and 1,000 Federal, State, \nand local prosecutors, at a cost of $284 million, and should be \nincluded in the budget resolution.\n  It is no secret we in this Chamber have had many disagreements on the \nissue of guns. The one place I think we can all come together is on a \nview that there ought to be more enforcement. I, for instance, in my \nState, have worked with the National Rifle Association on something \ncalled Project Exile, which is a forerunner of what we are proposing \nhere, in many ways, because what we do is give money to prosecutors at \nthe Federal and State levels, as well as ATF agents, whose sole job is \nto prosecute gun crimes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Idaho.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator can make a 1-\nminute argument against it and then a minute on his.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment has not been reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. The amendment has not been reported.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appropriate procedure is for the 1 minute \non the first-degree amendment to expire before the second-degree \namendment is offered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will use that 1 minute yielded to me for \npurposes of explanation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho was recognized by the \nChair.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will send a second-degree amendment to \nthe desk to the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. The Senator \nfrom New York and I and most of us agree we need more money and \neffective law enforcement against gun violence. The amendment I will \noffer uses the same amount of money the Senator from Illinois has \nproposed. It does not take it out of the tax cut pool; it takes it out \nof the 902 fund. It directs it to hire Federal prosecutors, U.S. \nattorneys in Project Exile, puts them on the ground, gives State grants \nfor gun violence reduction, and causes States also to put their mental \nadjudicant into the background check program. That is exactly what it \ndoes.\n  It also does not prohibit this Congress from offering up a reasonable \ntax cut to the American citizens. I believe it is the kind of \nlegislation we are expecting and want. But it also addresses the very \nissue my colleagues from Illinois and New York wish to address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3077 to Amendment No. 2954\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the enforcement \n                       of Federal firearms laws)\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I now send my second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3077 to amendment No. 2954.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to terminating the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the terminating the \nreading of the amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I do not \nspeak for my colleague from the State of Nevada, but I address this, \nnot to my friend who offered the amendment but\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nto the Senate in general. It would be much better, I think, if, when we \nfile amendments, we have two copies so they can be shared with each \nside, rather than suspending the reading and having no knowledge of the \nsubstance of the amendment. That is the reason I object at this point. \nIf there is a copy to be shared for us to read it, I would have no \nobjection.\n  Mr. REID. If I may say to my friend from Illinois, we understand it \nis frustrating from everybody's standpoint. We are moving very rapidly. \nIt is a moving target. The reason the absence of a quorum was suggested \nwas so we could have time to read the amendment. The majority has been \ntrying to supply us with the second-degree amendments. They were unable \nto do that at this time.\n  So, if it is appropriate, will my friend withdraw his objection? Will \nthe Senator withdraw his objection to the waiving of the reading?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL \n                   FIREARMS LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Clinton Administration has failed to adequately \n     enforce Federal firearms laws. Between 1992 and 1998, \n     Triggerlock gun prosecutions--prosecutions of defendants who \n     use a firearm in the commission of a felony--dropped nearly \n     50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n       (2) The decline in Federal firearms prosecutions was not \n     due to a lack of adequate resources. During the period when \n     Federal firearms prosecutions decreased nearly 50 percent, \n     the overall budget of the Department of Justice increased 54 \n     percent.\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997.\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997.\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997.\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm \n     under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite \n     this Federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed \n     on the national instant criminal background system \n     established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note).\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm \n     under section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United States Code. It \n     is also a Federal crime for convicted felons to possess or \n     purchase a firearm under section 922(g) of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n       (8) More than 500,000 convicted felons and other prohibited \n     purchasers have been prevented from buying firearms from \n     licensed dealers since the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention \n     Act was enacted. When these felons attempted to purchase a \n     firearm, they violated section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United \n     States Code, by making a false statement under oath that they \n     were not disqualified from purchasing a firearm. Nonetheless, \n     of the more than 500,000 violations, only approximately 200 \n     of the felons have been referred to the Department of Justice \n     for prosecution.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     concurrent resolution on the budget assume that Federal funds \n     will be used for an effective law enforcement strategy \n     requiring a commitment to enforcing existing Federal firearms \n     laws by--\n       (1) designating not less than 1 Assistant United States \n     Attorney in each district to prosecute Federal firearms \n     violations and thereby expand Project Exile nationally;\n       (2) upgrading the national instant criminal background \n     system established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note) by encouraging \n     States to place mental health adjudications on that system \n     and by improving the overall speed and efficiency of that \n     system; and\n       (3) providing incentive grants to States to encourage \n     States to impose mandatory minimum sentences for firearm \n     offenses based on section 924(c) of title 18, United States \n     Code, and to prosecute those offenses in State court.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on why I will \nvote against the Craig amendment to the budget resolution, amendment \n#3007. While the amendment offered by Senator Craig has many law \nenforcement provisions that I support, I am very concerned that Senator \nCraig deleted funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, tobacco and Firearms \n(ATF) in his amendment.\n  If we are serious about providing the necessary resources to \neffectively pursue offenders of existing federal firearms laws, we \ncannot exclude the ATF. A true law enforcement initiative should \nprovide sufficient funding for both ATF agents and inspectors. \nAfterall, the ATF is the federal agency whose mission is to reduce \nviolent crime by enforcing our laws and regulations concerning firearms \nand explosives. Because the Craig amendment deliberately deleted \nfunding for the ATF, I decided to vote against it. I repeatedly hear \nthat in order for prosecutors to do their job, they need law \nenforcement, such as the ATF, to detect interstate drug running and to \ninvestigate gun dealers making illegal transfers of firearms.\n  Due to Senate procedures, the amendment offered by Senator Craig \nvitiated a vote on amendment #2954, an amendment offered by Senator \nDurbin, that I fully supported. The Durbin amendment included funding \nfor more than 1,000 local, State and Federal prosecutors to prosecute \nfirearms offenses. The Durbin amendment also provided funding to expand \nProject Exile across the country and funding for ballistics testing \nprograms to support law enforcement efforts. As opposed to the Craig \namendment, the Durbin amendment provided $94 million in funding for an \nincrease in ATF agents and inspectors.\n  Mr. President, prosecutors and federal task forces aimed at enforcing \nour existing firearms laws will be missing a key element if the ATF's \nfunding is excluded from a federal law enforcement funding initiative.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll to ascertain the \npresence of a quorum.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the pending amendment be set aside.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3003\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for early learning and parent \n                           support programs)\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate \namendment No. 3003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens], for himself, Mr. \n     Kennedy, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3003.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR EARLY LEARNING AND PARENT SUPPORT \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Adjustment.--When the Committee on Education and the \n     Workforce of the House of Representatives or the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the Senate reports \n     a bill, an amendment is offered in the House of \n     Representatives or the Senate, or a conference report is \n     filed that improves opportunities at the local level for \n     early learning, brain development, and school readiness for \n     young children from birth to age 6 and offers support \n     programs for such families, particularly those with special \n     needs such as mental health issues and behavioral disorders, \n     the relevant chairman of the Committee on the Budget may \n     increase the allocation aggregates, functions, totals, and \n     other budgetary totals in the resolution by the amount of \n     budget authority (and the outlays resulting therefrom) \n     provided by the legislation for such purpose in accordance \n     with subsection (b) if the legislation does not cause an on-\n     budget deficit.\n       (b) Limitations.--The adjustments to the aggregates and \n     totals pursuant to subsection (a) shall not exceed \n     $8,500,000,000 on budget authority (and the outlays resulting \n     therefrom) for the period fiscal years 2001 through 2003.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senators Stevens, Dodd, \nJeffords, Bond, Kerry, Cochran, Murray, Gordon Smith, Lautenberg, \nChafee, Durbin, Reed, Warner, Murkowski, and Bingaman for their \nleadership on this amendment to ensure that children begin school ready \nto learn.\n  The amendment establishes a reserve fund of $8.5 billion over the \nnext five years to support local investment in early learning and \nschool readiness initiatives for children from birth through age six. \nOver the past decade medical research has confirmed that stimulation is \nessential for proper brain development in infants and toddlers. The \nbuilding blocks for later learning begin to develop during these early \nyears. Stimulation through reading, visual and vocal interaction with \nadults, and group activities with other children is essential to \ndevelop the connection within the brain that result in effective \neducational, social, and motor skills for each child.\n  It is long past time to put these medical discoveries into practice. \nMany parents are well aware of the stimulation needed by their infants \nand toddlers, and they amply provide it. But many working parents face \nbarriers, including their own lack of education and their inability to \nobtain quality child care for their children. As a result, millions of \nchildren never get the chance to reach their full potential. This is a \ntragedy for the child, and an unacceptable price for the nation to pay, \nsince many of society's most complex and costly long-run problems can \nbe avoided by paying greater attention to children early in their \nlives.\n  To deal with these problems more effectively, Senators Stevens, \nJeffords, Dodd, and I have taken a number of steps to improve early \nlearning. First, we need to fill in the gaps in existing programs, and \nmake activities such as childhood literacy training, parenting support, \nand parenting education more widely available to all parents who seek \nthese services. Second, we need to support local councils that can \nassess early learning needs of communities and allocate resources to \nmeet those needs. These councils are already formed in some states. In \nMassachusetts, it is known as the Massachusetts Community Partnerships \nfor Children. Our amendment brings us closer to enabling such councils \nto direct resources where they are needed most.\n  Finally, we need to expand access to effective programs like Head \nStart. More parents are satisfied with Heard Start than any other \ngovernment program, but only two in five eligible children have access \nto Head Start today.\n  Today's Senate action is a significant step forward for the nation on \nthis fundamental issue. It shows what can be accomplished when we reach \nacross party lines and work together for educational goals that are \nclearly in the country's best interest. Early learning should be a high \npriority for this Congress. It is pro-family and pro-work, and it is \none of the best long-term investments we can make in the country's \nfuture security and prosperity.\n  The $8.5 billion in additional resources proposed by today's budget \namendment will make it much easier to enable more children to obtain \nthe services they need in the years ahead. I look forward to the day \nwhen every child begins school ready to learn, and I will continue \nworking to pass legislation that makes this day come as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment establishes a priority of \nfunding for early education of children. It has broad bipartisan \nsupport. It does not make it mandatory.\n  We now know the stimulus children get at a very early age contributes \nto the development of their brain and increases the ability of children \nwho receive that stimulus to learn readily.\n  This creates a program for stimulation and sets aside funds for \ngrants to the States. It is not a mandatory program. It will be put in \nthe discretionary level. I do hope the Senate will accept this. My \nunderstanding is the managers will accept it.\n  Mr. REID. No objection.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No objection.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 3003.\n  The amendment (No. 3003) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3077\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe the pending business is the \nSchumer-Durbin amendment No. 2954.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. If that is the pending business, my second-degree \namendment is the pending business. I believe it is appropriate then \nthat I now speak for 1 minute in support of the second-degree \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, all of us are concerned about law \nenforcement and making sure those who misuse firearms are appropriately \nprosecuted. The Senator from Illinois and the Senator from New York \nhave that same concern. I choose to get the money from the 920 account \nand not take it out of tax cuts. I direct it at the hiring of Federal \nprosecutors.\n  I also direct it to the States for grants in law enforcement because \nthe States continue to put into the background check program those who \nare legally mental adjudicants. We direct it to law enforcement, which \nis what the American people say we should do, on the ground where the \ncriminal activity is occurring. The $283 million increases the \nintensity of effort against gun violence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I urge Members of the Senate to oppose \nthis amendment. We have debated gun safety back and forth and one side \nsays we need more enforcement. The second-degree amendment before us \nprovides no new ATF agents. If we are going to enforce the laws to find \nthe 1,000 Federal gun dealers responsible for selling 57 percent of the \nguns traced in crime, we need more ATF agents. If we are going to stop \ninterstate gunrunning, we need more ATF agents. This second-degree \namendment provides no new ATF agents. If my colleagues say enforcement \nis the key to gun safety, they have to oppose this amendment and \nsupport the underlying amendment which provides new ATF investigators, \nas well as new prosecutors, across America. I hope my colleagues will \noppose the second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The question is on agreeing \nto amendment No. 3077.\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe the next amendment is the \nminimum wage amendment by Senator Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2951.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2951.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that Congress should enact legislation to \n     amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.) to increase the Federal minimum wage by $1.00 over 1 \n     year with a $0.50 increase effective May 1, 2000 and another \n     $0.50 increase effective on May 1, 2001.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have tried for over the last 2 years \nto get an increase in the minimum wage for those Americans who are at \nthe lowest rung of the economic ladder and who have not had any pay \nincrease. This chart shows what has happened to the minimum wage since \nthe 1960s. As the minimum wage has been going down, the poverty line \nhas been going up. There are more Americans working harder today who \nare living in poverty than at any time in the history of the country.\n  Why is this an important issue? Close to 60 percent of the minimum-\nwage workers are women. One-third of those workers have children, so it \nis a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights \nissue because over one-third of minimum-wage workers are men and women \nof color. It is fundamentally an issue of fairness.\n  I think in this country individuals who work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year should not live in poverty. We are asking for the \nopportunity to have a vote on an increase in the minimum wage. Since \nthe minimum wage was last increased, those workers have lost the \nequivalent of $500 in purchasing power. It is time that the Senate go \non record in support of increasing the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we voted on this amendment in November. \nIt didn't pass. What we did pass on November 9 was the Domenici \namendment. It passed 54-44. It was an amendment that would increase the \nminimum wage not over 13 months, as proposed by Senator Kennedy, but \nover 28 months. In addition, we provided for some small business tax \nrelief, those businesses that would be negatively impacted by a big \nincrease in the minimum wage. We did that. That passed.\n  I will be sending a second-degree amendment to the desk that would \nreiterate our support for that. I hope our colleagues will join us in a \nrequest to move that amendment, which was attached to bankruptcy, to \nthe House-passed minimum wage so we can go to conference and pass a \nminimum wage package with tax relief.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3078 to Amendment No. 2951\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate that any increase in the \n minimum wage should be accompanied by tax relief for small businesses)\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I now send the second-degree amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3078 to amendment No. 2951.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment strike all after the first word and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SENSE OF THE SENATE\n\n       (B) It is the sense of the Senate that the functional \n     totals underlying this resolution on the budget assume that \n     the minimum wage should be increased as provided for in \n     amendment #2547, the Domenici and others amendment to S. 625, \n     the Bankruptcy Reform legislation.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. This is the same amendment we passed in November. This \nis an amendment that says we should have 100 percent deductibility for \nself-employed individuals. Right now they only get 60 percent. This is \nan amendment that says we should give an above-the-line deduction for \nindividuals so they can deduct health care costs. This is not a big tax \ncut. This is a tax cut targeted towards small business and people who \nwould have a hard time paying the minimum wage. It also\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nsays we should stretch out the minimum wage, instead of doing it over \n13 months as proposed by Senator Kennedy. The language we passed will \ndo it over the next 24 months or 28 months.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the proposal that is offered by the \nSenator is to cut taxes by $100 billion without paying for them. It \nstretches the minimum wage increase of a dollar over 3 years. According \nto CBO, it is $100 billion in unpaid tax cuts. We are prepared to work \nwith our friends on the other side for a reasonable proposal to offset \nany potential kinds of challenges for small business. This is $100 \nbillion in tax cuts over 10 years. Why should minimum-wage workers be \nheld hostage to this kind of proposal?\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 22 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, my \ncolleague was incorrect on his figures. The net cost of our tax cut was \n$25 billion over the next 5 years. The budget resolution before us says \n$150 billion over 5 years. It is clearly within the budget. It is \naffordable. It is targeted. I don't know where he got the $100 billion. \nMaybe that is over 10 years. Over 5 years, the net tax cut targeted \ntoward small business is $25 billion. I urge my colleagues to adopt the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 26 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, his tax cuts are over 5 years. The ten \nyear cost is $100 billion, which are unpaid for. All we are saying is, \nwhy stretch it for the hard-working Americans when we have the greatest \nprosperity in the history of this country and we are denying those \nhard-working Americans 50 cents a year this year and 50 cents a year \nnext year? That is what our proposal does.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE MINIMUM WAGE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that Congress should enact legislation to \n     amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et \n     seq.) to increase the Federal minimum wage by $1.00 over 1 \n     year with a $0.50 increase effective May 2, 2000 and another \n     $0.50 increase effective on May 2, 2001.\n  Mr. REID. I ask to take a minute in leader time; how long did the \nlast vote take?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Sixteen minutes.\n  Mr. REID. There has been a suggestion we go to 7\\1/2\\ minutes. If \nthat happens, we have to stay in here to do that. There are people \ndoing their very best. They spent all day here ready to vote and others \nwalk away to other meetings. If people are not here, they should not be \nrecorded, I respectfully submit on behalf of the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Do you ask consent we go to 7\\1/2\\ minutes?\n  Mr. REID. I do at the present time.\n  Mr. LOTT. That was agreed to?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it was not presented in a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent we limit the next votes to 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, on this vote people are \nout to lunch. I don't mind saying the next one will be 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. REID. A lot of people are out to lunch all the time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. This one just came back from lunch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is effectively the identical \namendment in the sense the time has been changed, but it still provides \na 50-cent increase this year, and 50 cents next year.\n  I have every intention of continuing to offer these amendments until \nwe get a vote on the amendment. I think we are entitled to that. This \nhas been an issue we have been raising for over 2 years. We have \neffectively been denied that opportunity.\n  During that period of time, those at the lowest end of the economic \nladder have been falling further and further behind. Six months ago was \nthe last increase we have had on the minimum wage. Since that time, the \npurchasing power of these men and women has fallen $500. It will \ncontinue to do so unless we take action.\n  Who are the minimum-wage workers? They are workers working in nursing \nhomes; they are working in childcare centers; they are working with \nteachers. Those are hard-working people. They are entitled to this body \ngoing on record.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I hope my colleagues vote no. If the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants to support minimum wage, he should support the \nunanimous consent request Majority Leader Lott has made twice, saying \nlet's break it apart from bankruptcy and go to conference with the \nHouse.\n  What the Senator's amendment says is increase minimum wage 20 percent \nin 13 months with no tax relief.\n  We just passed an amendment that said we should pass minimum wage \nwith tax relief. That is the right position. I urge my colleagues not \nto vote on this big minimum wage increase with no tax relief for small \nbusiness.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have 15 seconds remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3079.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FUNDING FOR THE \n                   PARTICIPATION OF MEMBERS OF THE UNIFORMED \n                   SERVICES IN THE THRIFT SAVINGS PLAN.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the levels of funding for \n     the defense category in this resolution--\n       (1) assume that members of the Armed Forces are to be \n     authorized to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan; and\n       (2) provide the $980,000,000 necessary to offset the \n     reduced tax revenue resulting from that participation through \n     fiscal year 2009.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, since the men and women in our armed \nservices provide 100 percent of our national security, they deserve at \nleast 1 percent of the tax cuts as outlined in this budget resolution. \nWe are the largest employer as the Federal Government. The members of \nour armed services constitute the largest single workforce in America \nnot yet covered by a thrift savings plan.\n  This amendment does not ask for the same match program we have but \nthat simply they be allowed to have a thrift savings plan. It allows \nfor the participation by all members of our armed services, and it will \nnot replace the current military retirement plan.\n  I understand this amendment is acceptable, and I ask for a voice \nvote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment. I yield back my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2979) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, under the agreement of the manager of the \nbill, Senator Domenici, we now go to amendment No. 2941, Senator Kohl \nand Senator Leahy.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2941\n\n (Purpose: To strike the reserve fund for allocation of any additional \n  surplus forecast by the Congressional Budget Office in July to the \n                   Committee on Finance for tax cuts)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2941, which is filed \nat the desk, and I ask unanimous consent that Senators Leahy, \nLieberman, Robb, Graham, Bryan, Kerrey, Levin, and Feingold be added as \ncosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for himself, Mr. \n     Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Robb, Mr. Bryan, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2941.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 36, strike beginning with line 1 and all that \n     follows through page 37, line 5.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this is a simple amendment. The budget \nbefore us allots to tax cuts any extra surplus forecast by CBO this \nsummer. Our amendment strikes that section and saves the extra surplus \nfor debt reduction. That is good for the economy and good for the \nsolvency of Social Security.\n  There are $150 billion for tax cuts and $19 billion for debt \nreduction in this budget. Our amendment does not change that. It just \nsays that--if we end up with extra money this summer--it ought to go to \nthe debt reduction side of the equation.\n  Some have argued that the extra surplus go to tax cuts because \notherwise Congress will spend it. That argument is a straw man. Under \nthe budget as it stands, there is a point of order against spending the \nextra surplus on anything except tax cuts. Under the budget as we would \namend it, there is a point of order against spending the extra surplus \non anything. It has to be saved for debt relief.\n  The Concord Coalition and Taxpayers for Common Sense have endorsed \nthe amendment. I ask unanimous consent that their statements of support \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Concord Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2000.\n     Hon. Herb Kohl,\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kohl and Leahy: The Concord Coalition is \n     pleased to support your amendment striking Section 206 from \n     the Senate Budget Resolution (S. Con. Res. 101). We believe \n     that striking Section 206, which allows the proposed five-\n     year tax cut to be increased by the amount of any increase in \n     the current on-budget surplus projection, would strengthen \n     the Senate's bipartisan commitments to reducing publicly held \n     debt, and maintaining balanced budgets without borrowing from \n     the Social Security trust fund. Because these goals are \n     widely endorsed on both sides of the aisle, The Concord \n     Coalition hopes that you will seek, and receive, bipartisan \n     support for your amendment.\n       The Concord Coalition is greatly heartened by the vast \n     improvement in the federal government's short-term fiscal \n     position over the last several years. Members of both parties \n     can claim a share of the credit for this turnaround. Concord \n     also fully supports the bipartisan commitment to reserve 100 \n     percent of the Social Security surplus, regardless of the \n     differences of opinion that exist over how this money can \n     best be used to ensure Social Security's future.\n       And yet, it is important to remember that we are not out of \n     the woods. As a nation, we currently have no strategy for \n     dealing with the huge unfunded obligations of Social Security \n     and Medicare, estimated at about $15 trillion dollars. The \n     Concord Coalition, therefore, recommends a fiscal goal beyond \n     merely achieving short-term on-budget balance. We advocate \n     using the current economic, fiscal, demographic and political \n     windows of opportunity to address the long-term Social \n     Security and Medicare deficits that will accompany the aging \n     of our nation's population. These deficits threaten to undo \n     the hard work and fiscal discipline of recent years and \n     undermine our potential for future economic growth.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\n       In the absence of substantive Social Security and Medicare \n     reform, the next best thing we can do to prepare for the \n     future is use every penny of surplus that happens to come our \n     way to reduce the publicly held debt. Debt reduction will \n     enhance net national savings, thereby freeing up resources \n     for investments in productivity that will lead to stronger \n     economic growth in the future. A larger economy will, in \n     turn, help case the burden on today's preschoolers who will \n     find it a struggle, when they become working age taxpayers, \n     to finance the retirement and health care costs of a \n     dramatically older population.\n       Recognizing the benefits of debt reduction, the Senate \n     Budget Resolution properly sets aside the entire Social \n     Security surplus for this purpose. But this commitment is not \n     self-executing. Fiscal responsibility is still required to \n     ensure that we do not return to the days when the Social \n     Security trust fund surpluses were used to pay for general \n     government expenses. Vigilance is required on both the \n     spending and tax sides of the budget. So while it is \n     legitimate to debate competing uses of the non-social \n     Security surplus, including tax cuts, great caution is in \n     order. Surplus projections are inherently uncertain, \n     particularly over many years. For that reason, policy \n     options that depend upon these surplus projections should \n     contain an ample margin for error.\n       As it currently stands, the Senate Budget Resolution \n     contains little margin for error. It assumes that \n     discretionary spending can be held below inflation over the \n     next five years--a very ambitious goal given the experience \n     of the last two years--and includes a commitment to spend \n     more on priorities such as defense and education. Moreover, a \n     bipartisan consensus is developing around the need to add a \n     prescription drug benefit to Medicare. While $40 billion is \n     conditionally set aside in the Budget Resolution for this \n     purpose, it is only the tip of the iceberg. No matter how it \n     is designed, a Medicare prescription drug benefit would be an \n     expensive, permanent and growing entitlement expansion. \n     Finally, the Budget Resolution already assumes a five-year \n     tax cut of $150 billion. Assuming enactment of all these \n     policies, and the accuracy of the projections on which they \n     are based, the Budget Resolution has a razor thin margin for \n     error of just $19.5 billion in non-Social Security surpluses \n     over the next five years.\n       Given this narrow margin for error, it is all the more \n     important that any increase in the projected non-social \n     Security surplus be reserved for debt reduction. \n     Unfortunately, Section 206 of the Budget Resolution would \n     allow any such increase to be used immediately, and in its \n     entirety, to enlarge the size of the tax cut, thus consuming \n     any additional margin for error that may be provided later \n     this year by continued economic growth.\n       Your amendment is simple and clear. It would not prejudice \n     the $150 billion tax cut already provided for the Budget \n     Resolution. Strictly speaking, it would not even prevent a \n     large tax cut if the Congressional Budget Office does \n     increase its on-budget surplus projection in its summer \n     update. Your amendment would, however, make debt reduction \n     the preferred use of any such windfall and strengthen the \n     chances that the budget will remain in balance without having \n     to borrow from Social Security. The Concord Coalition \n     believes that this approach would be a more fiscally prudent \n     way of dealing with unanticipated surpluses than the approach \n     provided in Section 206.\n       The Concord Coalition commends your effort to improve the \n     Budget Resolution's commitment to debt reduction and \n     preserving the Social Security surplus. We hope your \n     amendment striking Section 206 will receive strong bipartisan \n     support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert L. Bixby,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Taxpayers for Common Sense,\n\n                                                    April 5, 2000.\n     Hon. Herbert H. Kohl,\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kohl and Leahy: Taxpayers for Common Sense is \n     pleased to support your efforts to strengthen the Senate's \n     commitment to debt reduction by offering an amendment to \n     strike Section 206 of the Budget Resolution.\n       Section 206 would allow tax cuts to be paid for from the \n     possible budget surplus that would be identified by the \n     Congressional Budget Office in July. Taxpayers for Common \n     Sense is concerned about the current $5.8 trillion national \n     debt. We believe that before money is spend on major new tax \n     cuts or major new spending programs, the national debt should \n     be reduced.\n       The budget surplus is not a reality; it is an illusion \n     based on projections. If we spend money based on projections \n     that turn out to be wrong, then deficits could reemerge \n     instead of the rosy future now in the forecast.\n       TSC would urge all Senators to vote for your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jill Lancelot,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we Vermonters know that if you have a debt, \nyou pay it off. It is time to pay off the national debt so our children \ndo not have to. This will help us pay it off.\n  I thought it was time to introduce a dose of Yankee thrift in this \ndebate. Though he is not a Yankee, the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin seems to share Vermonters' thrifty outlook. The amendment we \nare introducing is simple, but important. This amendment strikes \nSection 206 of the budget resolution to ensure that additional \nsurpluses estimated by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reduce the \nnational debt, instead of being used for irresponsible tax cuts.\n  The next CBO update in July is expected to increase the on-budget \nsurplus by at least $40 billion over the next five years. As it now \nstands, Section 206 would allow Congress to apply those additional \nprojected dollars to tax cuts, on top of the $150 billion in tax cuts \nalready called for in the resolution. That would amount to $190 billion \nin tax cuts over five years, which is even larger than the fiscally \nirresponsible tax bill that Congress passed last year, and the \nPresident sagely vetoed. That bill would have cost $156 billion over \nfive years and $850 billion over 10 years.\n  Without Section 206, which our amendment would strike, any windfall \nsurplus estimated by CBO would go automatically towards reducing the \nnational debt. In addition, striking this section would ensure that any \nincrease in the projected surplus would further protect Social Security \nsurpluses from additional spending. I thank Senator Kohl and our other \ncosponsors of this amendment for making the sensible choice, the \nthrifty choice, the Yankee choice, to make paying down the national \ndebt our top priority.\n  In the 1980's, Congress went on a tax cut binge and left the bill for \nour children. During those years we all saw the lip service and slogans \nabout balancing the budget, while Congress, President Reagan and \nPresident Bush simultaneously tripled the national debt and ran the \nbiggest deficits of any nation in the history of the world. As a \nresult, the national debt now stands at $3.6 trillion and the Federal \ngovernment pays almost $1 billion in interest every working day on this \ndebt. Now that we have surpluses, we have a chance and an obligation to \npay off that debt. Let's not make the mistakes of the 1980's. Let's not \njust talk about balancing the budget and paying down the debt. Let's \nactually do it.\n  Nothing would do more to keep our economy strong than paying down our \nnational debt. Paying down our national debt will keep interest rates \nlow. Consumers gain ground with lower mortgage costs, car payments, \ncredit card charges with low interest rates. And small business owners \ncan invest, expand and create jobs with low interest rates.\n  A sound economy rests on a solid foundation of balanced revenue and \nspending policies. I am proud to have voted for the 1993 deficit \nreduction package, which was a tough vote around here, and has brought \nthe deficit down. I am also proud to have voted for the 1997 balanced \nbudget and tax cut package--tax cuts that were fully paid for by \noffsetting spending cuts, not by pie in the sky projected surpluses \nthat had not yet materialized.\n  For the past seven years, the President and Congress have built this \nsolid foundation by reducing the deficit and restraining spending. In \n1992, President Clinton inherited a deficit of $290 billion. Since \nthen, the Administration and Congress have steadily cut it down, \nturning it into a projected record surplus of $171 billion in 2000. \nBecause of our sound fiscal policies, the national debt was $1.7 \ntrillion lower in 1999 than was projected in 1993--that is $25,000 less \ndebt for each family of four in Vermont.\n  These balanced policies have also kept interest rates down and \nemployment up. Since 1993, the unemployment rate in Vermont has dropped \nfrom 5.8% to just 2.7%. Now that we have a projected surplus, we should \nstay the course of fiscal discipline rather than make irresponsible tax \ncuts. Paying down the debt, protecting Social Security and Medicare, \ninvesting in education, and providing hard working Americans with \ntargeted tax cuts should be our top priorities.\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\n  The budget resolution we have before us would use almost the entire \nnon-Social Security surplus for tax breaks which would primarily \nbenefit the wealthy. CBO's recent estimates predict that over the next \n5 years, the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. The \nbudget resolution calls for a minimum of $150 billion in tax cuts. When \nyou take into account the cost of future interest payments due to a \nreduction in future surpluses, that brings us to $168 billion. That is \n98% of the projected surplus. Not 25%, not 50%, not even 75%, but close \nto 100% of the projected surplus that will NOT be used to pay down the \nnational debt, according to this resolution. This does not make fiscal \nsense.\n  Imagine that you had a credit card debt of $20,000 and you received a \nbonus of $1,000. Would you use only 2%, which is $20, of that bonus to \npay down your substantial debt. Would you continue to carry a debt and \nwaste money on interest payments when it is within your means to pay it \ndown? I do not know of a single Vermonter who would make that choice \nand yet, incredibly, that is what the budget before us would recommend.\n  This budget resolution would use only 2% of projected non-Social \nSecurity projected surpluses to pay down the debt. Is this Congress \nserious about paying down the debt? Committing only 2% of projected \nsurpluses to debt reduction suggests that the majority is not. \nRegardless of slogans offered or lip service paid to reducing the debt, \nthe numbers speak for themselves.\n  Alan Greenspan and nearly every other economist who has testified \nbefore the Senate Budget and Finance Committees has stated that our \nnation's budget surpluses should be used to pay down the debt. And yet, \nthe Republican budget resolution proposes far less debt reduction than \nthe budgets developed by President Clinton and others. During markup in \nthe budget committee, Senator Lautenberg offered an alternative budget \nthat would have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while \nproviding almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts--cuts that would go \ntowards eliminating the marriage tax penalty, permitting the self-\nemployed a full tax deduction for their health insurance and providing \nestate tax relief for family farmers and small business owners. Such \ncuts would be fair and targeted to help all Vermonters.\n  In 1993, Congress and President Clinton charted a course of fiscal \ndiscipline and the country has reaped the benefits of this successful \nplan. Republicans and Democrats can rightfully claim their shares of \nthe credit for getting the nation's fiscal house in order. The \nimportant thing now is to keep our budget in balance, to pay down our \ndebt, and to keep our economy growing. The amendment that I have \noffered with Senator Kohl will help us to reach these goals by ensuring \nthat additional surpluses are used to pay down our national debt. I \nurge my colleagues to support our amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, with the full understanding that the \nSenator from New Mexico is taking this amendment-laden resolution to \nconference and that it may come back much skinnier and thinner, I agree \nto accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2941) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. The next amendment is offered by Senator Reed from Rhode \nIsland, No. 3037.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have Senator Fitzgerald.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2961\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Social Security \n         trust funds should be protected through sequestration)\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I have amendment No. 2961 at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Fitzgerald], for himself, \n     Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Craig, and Mr. Grams, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2961.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . PROTECT THE SOCIAL SECURITY TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the levels in this \n     resolution assume that the Congress shall pass legislation \n     which provides for sequestration to reduce federal spending \n     by the amount necessary to ensure that, in any fiscal year, \n     the Social Security surpluses are used only for the payment \n     of Social Security benefits, retirement security, social \n     security reform, or to reduce the Federal debt held by the \n     public.\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, this is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment which provides that in the event it is determined we have \nspent any of the Social Security trust fund moneys on any other \nprogram, we will provide for a sequestration law that will cause \nacross-the-board cuts to ensure that we are not dipping into Social \nSecurity for any other purpose.\n  There are 25 cosponsors of this amendment. In my judgment, it is a \nmore effective way than any of the other ways we have talked about, \nwith points of order and the like, to assure that Congress and \nWashington are not plundering the Nation's Social Security trust fund.\n  Congress has passed laws that prohibit private employers from dipping \ninto their employees' pension funds. We even passed laws that prohibit \nState and local governments from dipping into their employees' pension \nfunds for any other purpose. Yet we have no law on the books that \nensures we will not spend Social Security money on other programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not believe the other side has any \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2961) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3037\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should grant \n  the Food and Drug Administration the authority to regulate tobacco \n                               products)\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3037.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, Mr. \n     Bingaman, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Durbin, Mr. L. \n     Chafee, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Murray, \n     Mr. Graham, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3037.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. REGULATION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use is the single most \n     preventable cause of death and disability in the United \n     States.\n       (2) Cigarette smoking and tobacco use cause approximately \n     400,000 deaths each year in the United States.\n       (3) Health care costs associated with treating tobacco-\n     related diseases are $80,000,000,000 per year, and almost \n     half of such costs are paid for by taxpayer-financed \n     government health care programs.\n       (4) In spite of the well established dangers of cigarette \n     smoking and tobacco use, there is no Federal agency that has \n     authority to regulate the manufacture, sale, distribution, \n     and use of tobacco products.\n       (5) Major tobacco companies spend over $5,600,000,000 each \n     year ($15,000,000 each day) to promote the use of tobacco \n     products.\n       (6) Ninety percent of adult smokers first started smoking \n     before the age of 18.\n       (7) Each day 3,000 children become regular smokers and \\1/\n     3\\ of such children will die of diseases associated with the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (8) The Food and Drug Administration regulates the \n     manufacture, sale, distribution, and use of nicotine-\n     containing products used as substitutes for cigarette smoking \n     and tobacco use and should be granted the authority to \n     regulate tobacco products.\n       (9) Congress should restrict youth access to tobacco \n     products and ensure that tobacco products meet minimum safety \n     standards.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that--\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\n       (1) the Food and Drug Administration is the most qualified \n     Federal agency to regulate tobacco products; and\n       (2) Congress should enact legislation in the year 2000 that \n     grants the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \n     regulate tobacco products.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, and others. It expresses the sense of the \nSenate that Congress enact legislation this year that grants the Food \nand Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco products. This \namendment does not specify what form of regulation will be adopted, but \nit authorizes the FDA to adopt a legislative scheme to regulate tobacco \nproducts.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be added to the \namendment as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, with the recent Supreme Court decision, it \nis imperative Congress act, and it is imperative it act this year to \nensure we can properly regulate tobacco products in society. I urge \nadoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been worked \nout with Members on our side who have a genuine interest. We have no \nobjection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 3037) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2997\n\n (Purpose: Redirect tax cuts to the program for disadvantaged children \nin order to meet the bipartisan commitment to increase Title I funding \n                            to $15 billion)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Mr. President, disadvantaged communities need more help \nto ensure that all public schools give children a good education. \nIncreased funding for Title I sends a strong signal that we will \nincrease support for low-achieving children attending schools with high \nconcentrations of poor students.\n  Nationwide, Title I reaches more than 50,000 schools in over 13,000 \nschool districts. It serves over 11 million students. Approximately 99% \nof Title I dollars go to local school districts. In addition, Title I \nis much more targeted to high-poverty districts than state and local \nfunds.\n  Title I is working effectively in schools. It has contributed to the \nrapid development of challenging state standards that apply to all \nstudents in Title I schools. Teachers are using these standards to \nguide instruction. States that have implemented high standards and \nassessments consistent with Title I show increased achievement levels \nin high-poverty schools. It is clear that Title I is driving higher \nstandards in poor districts and schools.\n  The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown significant \nincreases in math scores in the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Reading and \nmath performance among nine-year-olds in high-poverty public schools \nand among the lowest-achieving fourth-graders has improved \nsignificantly.\n  The achievement gap between minority students and white students has \nnarrowed since 1982, one of the greatest gains in science were made by \nblack and Hispanic students.\n  Average SAT scores--math and verbal--were higher in 1999 than the \naverages for either 1983 or 1989. These improvements have come at the \nsame time that the proportion of test-takers with a native language \nother than English has been increasing (to 8 percent in 1999). Test \nresults are continuing a 10-year trend of stable or increasing scores. \nAt the same time, record numbers of students are taking the tests.\n  More than 80 percent of poor school districts, and almost half of all \ndistricts nationwide, report that Title I is ``driving standards-based \nreform in the district as a whole.'' In addition, Title I funds, as \nwell as all federal education funds, are more targeted to high-poverty \ndistricts than state and local funds. Title I now supports 95% of the \nhighest-poverty schools and is helping these schools to dramatically \nimprove student performance.\n  In Atlanta, Georgia, Burgess Elementary School is a Title I school \nthat serves 430 students. 99% of them are black, and more than 80% are \neligible for free or reduced-price lunches. In 1998, 64% of students \nperformed above the national norm in reading, an increase of 35% over \n1995. 72% scored above the national norm in math, an increase of 38% \nover 1995.\n  In Baltimore County, Maryland, all but one of the 19 Title I schools \nshowed increased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The success \nhas come from Title I support for extended year programs, \nimplementation of effective programs in reading, and intensive \nprofessional development for teachers.\n  In Boston, the Harriet A. Baldwin School is a Title I program that \nserves 283 students. 93 percent of them are minorities, and 80 percent \nare eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. From 1996 to 1998, math \nand reading scores improved substantially, and are currently well above \nthe national median and are much higher than district scores.\n  In spite of this progress, there is still a substantial achievement \ngap between students in the highest poverty schools and students in \nlow-poverty schools. The time is now to build on these successes and \nmake them available to more schools in more communities. We should \nincrease support for Title I to show the nation that we are committed \nto a level playing field to help all children achieve high standards. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am offering this amendment on behalf \nof myself, Senator Dodd, and Senator Kennedy. What it does is set aside \nin this budget $15 billion in next year's budget funding of title I.\n  This is an issue that came up in the authorization committee when we \nwere considering the title I reauthorization.\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\n Senator Dodd offered an amendment at that time to raise this to $15 \nbillion. It was unanimously agreed to. Now is the chance for everybody \nto go ahead and vote for the funds to carry out that which all agree \nshould be done.\n  Senator Dodd would like to speak for a minute. I yield my time to \nhim.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank our colleague from New Mexico.\n  Title I funds go to the poorest students, the poorest school \ndistricts in the United States. All of us know that in the 21st century \nthese children have to be the best prepared generation we have ever \nproduced. My hope is to get the resources back to these communities.\n  It was unanimously adopted by the Democrats and Republicans in the \ncommittee. We urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I say to Senators, we have been \nvery helpful. But we only have 1 minute on the amendments--not 2, not \n3, not 1 and a half. I ask the Chair to enforce the rule. Everybody is \nplaying by the game. There should be no exceptions.\n  From our standpoint, we do not want a rollcall vote on this but just \na voice vote. I oppose it. We do not need it. It is another effort \ntrying to raise the expenditure level, reducing the money available for \nthe taxpayers. I think we ought to do what we have done to the other \nones and vote it down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n2997.\n  The amendment (No. 2997) was rejected.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to express \nmy disappointment with the failed vote on my amendment to increase \nfunding for the Title I education program for disadvantaged children. \nDisadvantaged communities need more help to ensure that all public \nschools give children a good education. Title I is working in many \nschools across the country. We should help bring success to every \ncommunity. Ninety-nine percent of Title I funds go to local school \ndistricts and Title I is much more targeted to high poverty districts \nthan state and local funds. Yet, current federal resources dedicated to \nthe program fall far short of meeting the existing need. Many schools \nthat are eligible for the program do not receive funding due to \ninsufficient appropriations.\n  During the recent debate of the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act in the HELP committee, Senator Dodd offered an \namendment to authorize an increase in funding for Title I to $15 \nbillion. The amendment was unanimously adopted. My amendment to the \nbudget resolution would ensure that funds will be available to carry \nout this bipartisan goal. It is unfortunate that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle blocked passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2962\n\n(Purpose: To expand Medicaid and S-CHIP coverage to low-income families \n          by decreasing Republican tax break for the wealthy)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, in 1997, as a result of a bipartisan \neffort, the Senate and Congress went on record to provide $24 billion, \nover 5 years, in a program called CHIP; that is, to try to provide \nhealth insurance for poor children. Those are above the Medicaid level. \nWe are making progress on that.\n  This amendment says we are going to now try to provide the health \ninsurance for the parents of those children to try to keep the families \ntogether. It amounts to $11 billion off the tax break over a 5-year \nperiod.\n  This is a family values issue to try to keep needy families together. \nIt permits the States to make the judgment as to how it is going to be \nimplemented. Every single State now has a CHIP program. This builds on \nthe CHIP program. It is accepted by the States. It is virtually free \nfrom bureaucracy. It will make a major difference to 7 million parents \nin this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is another entitlement, $11.2 \nbillion added to the CHIPS program. In many States they have not even \nused the money yet for this program. I believe there are numerous \nStates that have not been able to cover children with it because it is \nvery difficult to locate them and put them under the program.\n  I do not believe we ought to be adopting this at this time. We do not \nneed it. We have plenty of money in the CHIP program. We are committed \nto continue the funding of the CHIP program.\n  With that, I yield back any time I have and move to table the Kennedy \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens).

Mr. President, a record 44 million Americans were \nuninsured last year, and that shameful number grows relentlessly by a \nmillion more each year. No man, woman, or child in America should have \nthe quality of their health measured by the quantity of their wealth. \nThe United States remains isolated as the only industrial nation in the \nworld, except South Africa, that doesn't guarantee health insurance to \nits citizens. Our failure to do so is a national disgrace.\n  A budget is a statement of principles and priorities. This budget \nstates that lavish tax breaks for the wealthy are more important than \nproviding families with health insurance. The amendment I am offering \nwith Senator Lautenberg and Senator Rockefeller is a significant step \ntoward that goal. It reduces the tax breaks for the wealthy by $11 \nbillion over five years, and the savings are used to provide health \ninsurance to the parents of children covered by Medicaid and CHIP. It \nis supported by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal \nEmployees, the American Nurses Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation, the Center on Disability and Health, Families USA, the \nNational Association of Community Health Centers, the National \nAssociation of Public Hospitals & Health Systems, the National Council \nof Senior Citizens, the National Partnership for Women & Families, and \nthe Service Employees International Union, as well as thirteen other \norganizations. I ask unanimous consent that their letter of support be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  We have budget surpluses as far as the eye can see. We have a strong \nand growing economy. Yet the divide between those who have and those \nwho have not is growing at an alarming pace. Millions of Americans are \nleft out and left behind under the Republican budget plan. Alarming \nrates of hunger, homelessness and lack of health care are indicators \nthat our economy is healthy, but our society is not. If we can't take \nsteps to address these challenges now, when will we ever do it?\n  Our colleagues argue that their budget accommodates some so-called \n``health'' tax breaks. But the health-oriented tax proposals in the \nRepublican budget are a raw deal for the American people. These \nproposals do very little to expand coverage among the uninsured. \nInstead, they propose to squander tens of billions of dollars on \nproposals that would largely give new subsidies to those who already \nhave insurance.\n  I am all in favor of making insurance more affordable. After all, \nunfair rating practices and price gouging by insurance companies is \npart of the problem. However, the Republican tax subsidies are not \ntargeted to those without health insurance, and they are too low to be \nof any real assistance to the millions of uninsured Americans who are \nuninsured because they can't afford the high cost of adequate coverage.\n  An overwhelming majority of the uninsured are working men or women, \nor family members of workers. Of these workers, the vast majority are \nmembers of families with at least one person working full-time.\n  Most uninsured workers are uninsured because their employer either \ndoes not offer coverage, or because they are not eligible for the \ncoverage if it is offered. Seventy percent of uninsured workers are in \nfirms where no coverage is offered. Eighteen percent are in firms that \noffer coverage, but they are not eligible for it, usually because they \nare part-time workers or have not worked in the firm long enough to \nqualify for coverage. Only 12 percent of uninsured workers are offered \ncoverage and decline.\n  Most of the uninsured have low or moderate incomes. Thirty-seven \npercent are at or below the federal poverty level. Twenty-eight percent \nhave incomes between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. Fifteen percent \nhave incomes between 200 and 300 percent of poverty. Only one in five \nhave incomes above 300 percent of poverty.\n  While good coverage for all Americans may not be feasible at this \ntime, we can and must do more to close the current health insurance \ngap.\n  It is a national scandal that lack of insurance coverage is the \nseventh leading--and most preventable--cause of death in America today. \nNumerous studies indicate that lack of insurance leads to second-class \nhealth care or no health care at all. Those without insurance are less \nlikely to get the care they need to stay healthy and productive. A \nrecent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association found \nthat angina patients with insurance are more than twice as likely as \nuninsured patients to receive needed bypass surgery. Across the nation, \nmore than 32,000 patients are going without needed heart surgery \nbecause of their lack of insurance.\n  The numbers are equally dramatic when it comes to cancer. Early \ndetection and treatment of cancer often makes the difference between \nlife and death. Uninsured patients are two and a half times more likely \nnot to receive an early diagnosis of melanoma and one and a half times \nmore likely not to benefit from early detection of breast cancer, \nprostate cancer, or colon cancer. Tragically, the new and promising \ntreatments resulting from our national investment in the NIH are out of \nreach for millions of uninsured Americans.\n  In 1997, we took a major step toward guaranteeing health insurance to \nmillions of children in low-income working families whose earnings are \nabove the cut-off for Medicaid. Every state is now participating in the \nchildren's health insurance plan, and most states have plans to \nincrease coverage under these programs again this year.\n  As of January, two million children had been enrolled in the program, \nand many other children had signed up for Medicaid as a result of the \noutreach efforts. Soon, more than three-quarters of all uninsured \nchildren in the nation will be eligible for assistance through either \nCHIP or Medicaid.\n  An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association found \nthat 57 percent of uninsured children had an unmet major medical need \nbefore enactment of CHIP. But just one year after receiving coverage, \nonly 16 percent of these same children had an unmet medical need.\n  The lesson is clear. We have the resources. We have good programs. We \nmust do all we can to increase their effectiveness.\n  Clearly, the states and the federal government have more to do. Fewer \nthan a quarter of post-welfare jobs offer health insurance as a \nbenefit--and even when it is offered, too few companies make it \navailable for dependents.\n  The overwhelming majority of uninsured low-wage parents are \nstruggling to support their families. Too often, there is too little \nleft to pay for health care. Parents who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks a year, should be eligible for assistance to buy the health \ninsurance they need to protect their families. Our message to them \ntoday is that help with health care is on the way.\n  Currently, Medicaid is generally available only to single-parent \nfamilies. Our proposal repeals this ``health marriage tax,'' a serious \npenalty for low-wage two-parent families, comparable to the ``marriage \npenalty'' in the tax code.\n  This proposal also rewards work. Most parents in families with an \nemployed person are not eligible for Medicaid, while families headed by \nnon-workers are eligible if their income is low enough.\n  Coverage for parents also means that coverage for their children is \nmore likely too. Parents are much more\n\n[[Page S2414]]\n\nlikely to enroll their children in health insurance programs, if the \nparents themselves can obtain coverage.\n  This step alone will give up to six and a half million more Americans \nthe coverage they need and deserve. Our goal should be to enact this \ncoverage before the end of this year. Our amendment lays the ground \nwork for this coverage by including this important idea in the Budget \nResolution. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    April 6, 2000.\n     Sen. Edward Kennedy,\n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, Health \n         Office, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The undersigned organizations support \n     your efforts to reduce the size of the tax cut in order to \n     provide funds for health coverage for low-wage working \n     families.\n       Now that states are implementing the State Child Health \n     Insurance Program, we are faced with the glaring problem of \n     these children's parents going without health coverage. The \n     numbers of uninsured Americans continue to grow; yet in 32 \n     states, a parent working full-time at the minimum wage is \n     considered too well off to qualify for Medicaid.\n       In addition, low-wage working parents are less likely to be \n     offered health benefits than higher-wage workers. Of \n     employees earning $15 or more per hour, 93 percent are \n     offered health benefits by their employer; by contrast, only \n     43 percent of employees earning $7 or less per hour are \n     offered such coverage. Even when low-wage workers are offered \n     coverage, the required average contribution--$130 a month--is \n     considerably higher than the $94 a month the average higher-\n     wage worker is required to contribute.\n       Your amendment will help millions of low-wage families gain \n     access to health coverage that is currently out of their \n     reach. We commend your efforts to help America's uninsured \n     families.\n           Sincerely,\n         AIDS Action; Alpha 1; American Association on Mental \n           Retardation; American Federation of State, County and \n           Municipal Employees; American Nurses Association; \n           American Public Health Association; Association of \n           Jewish Aging Services; Bazelon Center for Mental Health \n           Law; Brain Injury Association; Center on Disability and \n           Health; Families USA; National Association of Community \n           Health Centers; National Association of People with \n           AIDS.\n         National Association of Public Hosptials & Health \n           Systems; National Association of Social Workers; \n           National Council of Senior Citizens; National Hispanic \n           Council on Aging; National Partnership for Women & \n           Families; Neighbor to Neighbor; NETWORK A Catholic \n           Social Justice Lobby; Paralyzed Veterans of America; \n           Public Citizen's Congress Watch; Service Employees \n           International Union.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The demand for after school education is very high, \n     with more than 1,000,000 students waiting to get into such \n     programs.\n       (2) After school programs improve educational achievement \n     and have widespread support, with over 90 percent of the \n     American people supporting such programs.\n       (3) 450 of the Nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs, \n     and prosecutors, along with the presidents of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, and the International Union of Police \n     Associations, support government funding of after school \n     programs.\n       (4) Many of our Nation's governors endorse increasing the \n     number of after school programs through a Federal and State \n     partnership.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that this resolution assumes that the President's level of \n     funding for after school programs in fiscal year 2001 will be \n     provided, which will accommodate the current need for after \n     school programs.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this Senate should be very proud because \nin the last few years with our action and that of the administration, \nwe have accommodated a million kids into afterschool programs.

This sense \nof the Senate simply says we should take action to accommodate those \nnext million children.\n  I understand we are going to have this accepted.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING CASH BALANCE PENSION PLAN \n                   CONVERSIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Defined benefit pension plans are guaranteed by the \n     Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and provide a lifetime \n     benefit for a beneficiary and spouse.\n       (2) Defined benefit pension plans provide meaningful \n     retirement benefits to rank and file workers, since such \n     plans are generally funded by employer contributions.\n       (3) Employers should be encouraged to establish and \n     maintain defined benefit pension plans.\n\n[[Page S2415]]\n\n       (4) An increasing number of major employers have been \n     converting their traditional defined benefit plans to ``cash \n     balance'' or other hybrid defined benefit plans.\n       (5) Under current law, employers are not required to \n     provide plan participants with meaningful disclosure of the \n     impact of converting a traditional defined benefit plan to a \n     ``cash balance'' or other hybrid formula.\n       (6) For a number of years after a conversion, the cash \n     balance or other hybrid benefit formula may result in a \n     period of ``wear away'' during which older and longer service \n     participants earn no additional benefits.\n       (7) Federal law should continue to prohibit pension plan \n     participants from being discriminated against on the basis of \n     age in the provision of pension benefits.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that pension plan \n     participants whose plans are changed to cause older or longer \n     service workers to earn less retirement income, including \n     conversions to ``cash balance plans,'' should receive \n     additional protection than what is currently provided, and \n     Congress should act this year to address this important \n     issue. In particular, at a minimum--\n       (1) all pension plan participants should receive adequate, \n     accurate, and timely notice of any change to a plan that will \n     cause participants to earn less retirement income in the \n     future; and\n       (2) pension plans that are changed to a cash balance or \n     other hybrid formula should not be permitted to ``wear away'' \n     participants' benefits in such a manner that older and longer \n     service participants earn no additional pension benefits for \n     a period of time after the change.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. This has to do with pension plans. All too often when the \npension plans are changed, older workers who have been there a long \ntime see nothing added to their pensions; younger workers see their \npensions grow. This is age discrimination.\n  This puts the Senate on record saying we need to change the law so \nworkers receive adequate notice of their pension plan changes and \neliminate the so-called ``wear away'' where older workers get nothing \nadded to their pension plans for years.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nJeffords.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, when a pension plan is converted, long-\ntime loyal employees should not see their normal retirement benefits \nfrozen. I believe ``wear away'' is wrong and Congress should act this \nyear.\n  I hope the majority of my colleagues will join.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment, and I yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3073), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING UNINSURED AND LOW-\n                   INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED \n                   COMMUNITIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the uninsured population in the United States continues \n     to grow at over 100,000 individuals per month, and is \n     estimated to reach over 53,000,000 people by 2007;\n       (2) the growth in the uninsured population continues \n     despite public and private efforts to increase health \n     insurance coverage;\n       (3) nearly 80 percent of the uninsured population are \n     members of working families who cannot afford health \n     insurance or cannot access employer-provided health insurance \n     plans;\n       (4) minority populations, rural residents, and single-\n     parent families represent a disproportionate number of the \n     uninsured population;\n       (5) the problem of health care access for the uninsured \n     population is compounded in many urban and rural communities \n     by a lack of providers who are available to serve both \n     insured and uninsured populations;\n       (6) community, migrant, homeless, and public housing health \n     centers have proven uniquely qualified to address the lack of \n     adequate health care services for uninsured populations, \n     serving over 4,500,000 uninsured patients in 1999, including \n     over 1,000,000 new uninsured patients who have sought care \n     from such centers in the last 3 years;\n       (7) health centers care for nearly 7,000,000 minorities, \n     nearly 600,000 farmworkers, and more than 500,000 homeless \n     individuals each year;\n       (8) health centers provide cost-effective comprehensive \n     primary and preventive care to uninsured individuals for less \n     than $1.00 per day, or $350 annually, and help to reduce the \n     inappropriate use of costly emergency rooms and inpatient \n     hospital care;\n       (9) current resources only allow health centers to serve 10 \n     percent of the Nation's 44,000,000 uninsured individuals;\n       (10) past investments to increase health center access have \n     resulted in better health, an improved quality of life for \n     all Americans, and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures; and\n       (11) Congress can act now to increase access to health care \n     services for uninsured and low-income people together with or \n     in advance of health care coverage proposals by expanding the \n     availability of services at community, migrant, homeless, and \n     public housing health centers.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution on the \n     budget assume that--\n       (1) appropriations for consolidated health centers under \n     section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b) \n     should be increased by 100 percent over the next 5 fiscal \n     years in order to double the number of individuals who \n     receive health care services at community, migrant, homeless, \n     and public housing health centers; and\n       (2) appropriations for consolidated health centers should \n     be increased by $150,000,000 in fiscal year 2001 over the \n     amount appropriated for such centers in fiscal year 2000.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I rise today to offer an amendment that addresses what is \nperhaps the biggest problem we face in health care--the fact that \nmillions of Americans can't get health care when they need it.\n  Part of this problem is cause by the fact that about 44 million \nAmericans aren't covered by any type of health plan or health \ninsurance. For obvious reasons, it can be difficult to get care if you \ndon't have any insurance coverage.\n  An equally serious part of the access problem is many people's simple \ninability to get in to see a health care provider. Even if they have \ninsurance, a young couple with a sick child is out of luck if they \ncan't get in to see a pediatrician. And in too many urban and rural \ncommunities across the country, there just aren't enough doctors to go \naround.\n  This while issue is a hot topic, and there have been a number of \nrecent plans that address it. Some have made proposals that call for \nsomething close to a large, government takeover of our health care \nsystem--something that we soundly rejected in 1994. Others have \nproposed tax credits or other tax benefits to allow more people to buy \ninto the existing market-based health care system.\n  There are clearly many differences between all of these plans, but \nthey all have one thing in common--it will be difficult or impossible \nfor them to become law this year. Whether because of policy differences \nor political differences, they're just not likely to pass.\n  So today I'm offering an amendment with strong bipartisan support--\nbased on what I call the REACH Initiative--\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\nthat begins to address the health care access problem, and which does \nhave a chance to pass this year. There's no need to wait--we can start \nthis year.\n  This proposal builds on the crucial work that organizations known as \ncommunity health centers do to provide care and ensure access for \nmillions of Americans.\n  Heath centers are private, nonprofit clinics that provide primary \ncare and preventive health care services in medically underserved \ncommunities across the country. They exist in every State in hundreds \nof rural and urban communities. Overall, there are about 750 separate \ncenters with more than 3,000 clinics nationwide. This year, health \ncenters will provide basic care for about 11 million people every year, \n4 million of whom are uninsured.\n  The goal of this amendment and of the REACH Initiative is simple--to \nmake sure that even more people have access to health care. We do this \nby calling for a doubling in funding for community health centers over \na period of 5 years, including a 1-year increase of $150 million.\n  This will ultimately allow up to 10 million more women, children, and \nothers in need to receive care at health centers. If we are successful, \nwe can practically double the number of uninsured and underinsured \npeople that health centers care for.\n  I am pleased that 15 other Senators have joined me as cosponsors of \nthe REACH Initiative--the full 5-year plan. And I am ecstatic that 63 \nof my colleagues have agreed to join in a letter to support the $150 \nmillion increase in this coming year.\n  Now, out of all the ways we can address health care access problems, \nwhy are health centers a good solution and a worthwhile target for \nadditional funding?\n  Building on an existing program that produces results. Too many \nhealth care proposals out there suggest huge--even revolutionary--\nchanges to our health system. While I realize that we have many \nproblems, we must realize that many people are pleased with it despite \nthe flaws. Instead of radical new proposals, I believe it make sense to \nbuild on an existing part of the system that's been proven to provide \ncost-effective, high-quality care.\n  Health centers already play an essential role. It's amazing to me how \nfew people realize just how important community health centers are in \nour existing health system. Think about this--health centers provide \ncare to close to one out of every 20 Americans--11 million people \noverall. In addition, health centers provide care to one out of every \n12 rural residents, one out of every 6 low-income  children, and one of \nevery 5 babies born to low-income families.\n\n  Health centers truly target the health care access problem. By \ndefinition, health centers must be located in ``medically underserved'' \ncommunities--which simply means places where people have serious \nproblems getting access to health care. So health centers attack the \nproblem right at its source.\n  Relatively cheap. Health centers can provide primary and preventive \ncare for less than $1 dollar per person per day--about $350 per year. \nEven better, with the base federal grants, health centers are able to \nleverage additional private funding. This means that health centers can \nbasically turn one federal dollar into several--all of which can be \nused to address the health care needs in these underserved communities. \nWith an extra billion dollars a year--the goal of the REACH Initiative \nin its fifth year--health centers could be caring for an additional 10 \nmillion people.\n  Not a government takeover of health care. While this amendment and \nthe REACH Initiative call for some additional government spending, this \nis NOT a government takeover. Out of all the plans to address the \nhealth insurance and health access problem, the REACH Initiative is by \nfar the least costly. Unlike many of the other plans, this new funding \nwould not go to create a huge new bureaucracy. Instead, the REACH \nInitiative would invest additional funds into private organizations \nthat have consistently proven themselves to be efficient, high-quality, \nand cost-effective health care providers.\n  To me, all of these reasons point to one logical conclusion--a need \nfor drastically increased funding for health centers. Health centers \nare already helping millions of Americans get health care. But they can \nstill help millions more--pregnant women, children, and anyone else who \ndesperately needs care.\n  Simply put, we need to take the goal of this amendment and of the \nREACH Initiative--doubled funding for health centers within 5 years--\nand make it happen.\n  I thank my colleagues who have taken a leadership role in support of \nthis issue--Senator Hollings; Senator Hutchinson; and Senator Stevens, \nwho I am very pleased has joined as a cosponsor of this amendment. I \njoin with these powerful voices and urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I introduced an amendment earlier this \nweek which calls for a doubling of funding for community health centers \nover the next 5 years, and I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senator \nBond and Hollings, in a similar amendment, which I hope will pass the \nSenate unanimously.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, Community Health Centers serve rural, \nlow-income areas where access to primary health care is limited, if \neven existent. They serve anyone who walks through their door, whether \nthey have money or not, or whether they have insurance or not.\n  Back when there was a great ice storm in Arkansas, a 75-year-old farm \nlaborer came into the community health center in Portland, AR, \ncomplaining of terrible tiredness.\n  Upon examination and an electrocardiogram, it was found that he was \nin severe heart failure. His heart rate was so slow, it could barely be \ndetected.\n  With no money and no transportation, he had walked to the clinic. The \nclinic staff immediately got to work and gave him medication and \narranged for ambulance transfer to a larger hospital in Little Rock.\n  With ice forming, ambulances were hesitant to go, but one finally \nagreed. He and his wife were transferred and he arrived in time for \nlive-saving surgery.\n  In Dermott AR, a 2-year-old child was rushed into the Mainline Health \nClinic with convulsions. A blood test was performed and he was \ndiagnosed with meningitis, which is normally fatal for such a young \nchild. Life-saving medication was given, and he was transferred to \nArkansas Children's Hospital for intensive treatment.\n  If it were not for these community health centers, both the farmer \nand this little child would be dead.\n  Community health centers serve where no other medical professionals \nusually want to go and they are often the difference between life and \ndeath. They are the front line in rural America and their mission must \nbe supported by Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask my colleagues to adopt this on a voice vote.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3018) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3049, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask amendment 3049, of Senator DeWine, \nbe called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. DeWine, \n     for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Coverdell, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Graham, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Landrieu, \n     and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 3049, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. FISCAL YEAR 2001 FUNDING FOR THE UNITED STATES COAST \n                   GUARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 saved \n     approximately 3,800 lives in providing the essential service \n     of maritime safety.\n       (2) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 prevented 111,689 \n     pounds of cocaine and 28,872 pounds of marijuana from \n     entering the United States in providing the essential service \n     of maritime security.\n       (3) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 boarded more than \n     14,000 fishing vessels to check for compliance with safety \n     and environmental laws in providing the essential service of \n     the protection of natural resources.\n       (4) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 ensured the safe \n     passage of nearly 1,000,000 commercial vessel transits \n     through congested harbors with vessel traffic services in \n     providing the essential service of maritime mobility.\n       (5) The United States Coast Guard in 1999 sent \n     international training teams to help more than 50 countries \n     develop their maritime services in providing the essential \n     service national defense.\n       (6) Each year, the United States Coast Guard ensures the \n     safe passage of more than 200,000,000 tons of cargo cross the \n     Great Lakes including iron ore, coal, and limestone. Shipping \n     on the Great Lakes faces a unique challenge because the \n     shipping season begins and ends in ice anywhere from 3 to 15 \n     feet thick. The ice-breaking vessel MACKINAW has allowed \n     commerce to continue under these conditions. However, the \n     productive life of the MACKINAW is nearing an end. The Coast \n     Guard has committed to keeping the vessel in service until \n     2006 when a replacement vessel is projected to be in service, \n     but to meet that deadline, funds must be provided for the \n     Coast Guard in fiscal year 2001 to provide for the \n     procurement of a multipurpose-design heavy icebreaker.\n       (7) Without adequate funding, the United States Coast Guard \n     would have to radically reduce the level of service it \n     provides to the American public.\n       (b) Adjustment in Budget Levels.--\n       (1) Increase in funding for transportation.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the \n     amounts specified in section 103(8) of this resolution for \n     budget authority and outlays for Transportation (budget \n     function 400) for fiscal year 2001 shall be increased as \n     follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (2) Offsetting decrease in funding for allowances.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of this resolution, the \n     amounts specified in section 103(19) of this resolution for \n     budget authority and outlays for Allowances (budget function \n     920) for fiscal year 2001 shall be decreased as follows:\n       (A) The amount of budget authority for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (B) The amount of outlays for that fiscal year, by \n     $300,000,000.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the provisions of this resolution, as modified by \n     subsection (b), should provide additional budget authority \n     and outlay authority for the United States Coast Guard for \n     fiscal year 2001 such that the amount of such authority in \n     fiscal year 2001 exceeds the amount of such authority for \n     fiscal year 2000 by $300,000,000; and\n       (2) any level of such authority in fiscal year 2001 below \n     the level described in paragraph (1) would require the Coast \n     Guard to--\n       (A) close numerous stations and utilize remaining assets \n     only for emergency situations;\n       (B) reduce the number of personnel of an already \n     streamlined workforce;\n       (C) curtail its capacity to carry out emergency search and \n     rescue; and\n       (D) reduce operations in a manner that would have a \n     detrimental impact on the sustainability of valuable fish \n     stocks in the North Atlantic and Pacific Northwest and its \n     capacity to stem the flow of illicit drugs and illegal \n     immigration into the United States.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This year, the nation has set a new record for \nelementary and secondary student enrollment. The figure has reached an \nall-time high of 53 million students--500,000 more students than last \nyear.\n  Serious teacher shortages are being caused by this rising student \nenrollment. The nation's public schools will need to hire 2.2 million \nteachers over the next ten years just to maintain current student \nteacher ratios which are already viewed as too high. The teacher \nshortage is being worsened by the growing number of teacher \nretirements, and by the fact that too many new teachers leave within \nthe first three years of teaching, including 30-50% of teachers in \nurban areas.\n  The Troops to Teachers program was established in 1993 by Congress to \nencourage military personnel who leave the service to become public \nschool teachers. Since its inception, over 3,000 service men and women \nhave made the transition under this program, filling teaching positions \nin 48 states. This highly successful program is providing teachers in \nareas where educators face the greatest shortages.\n  The program has worked and has been highly successful in recruiting \nand retaining high quality teachers, especially in high-need subject \nareas and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Studies show that these service \nmen and women who become teachers are likely to fill the most urgent \ncurrent needs:\n\n       --29% of them are math teachers, compared to 13% of all \n     public school teachers.\n       --29% of them are minorities, compared to 10% of all public \n     school teachers.\n       --The overwhelming majority--90%--are male, compared to 23% \n     of all public school teachers.\n       --24% of them are teaching in inner-city schools, compared \n     to 16% of all public school teachers.\n\n  They are also highly committed, with very high retention rates. 82% \nof them continue in teaching beyond the first year.\n  Troops to Teachers is a program that works. California has hired \nnearly 300 teachers through the program, including a former Navy pilot \nwho used to hunt submarines, but now faces almost two dozen \nkindergarten students. He says, ``It doesn't pay as much, but the job \nsatisfaction is incredible.''\n  Florida hired more than 200 teachers through the program, including a \nformer Navy instructor who now teaches honors algebra to high school \nstudents. The students say, ``He gets all excited about this stuff. He \ndefinitely knows what he's talking about.'' Though the teacher had to \ntake a pay cut, he said, ``I enjoy the kids, and I enjoy the school.''\n  We need to do much more to help communities recruit qualified \nteachers, but Troops to Teachers is a strong step in the right \ndirection.\n  Senator DeWine's Sense of the Senate Amendment makes the \nauthorization and funding of the successful Troops to Teachers program \nwithin the Department of Education a priority, and I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me suggest, this is for Senator \nDeWine and others, including Democrats. We are willing to accept it. \nThe Democrats are willing to accept it.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3049), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to all Senators, we only have one rollcall \nvote left. That will be final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am not sure Senators can hear you. The Chair \nis to get order. We have welcome news from the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we only have one vote remaining. It is \non final passage. But we have about 50 sense of the Senates that we \nhave agreed on, on both sides. We will just offer those rather quickly \nhere and then go to final passage. But we are being asked, and \nappropriately so, by a Senator, that we read off the Senators and the \nsubject matter. We did not have that all prepared in that manner, but \nwe are working on it now. It should not take us very long. We will do \nour very best. Both sides are working on it, not just one.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in \norder that the following amendments be made the pending business, that \nthey be agreed to en bloc, and that the motion to table and motion to \nreconsider be agreed to en bloc, and that any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  Now, let me list what is in this, so Senator Byrd and others will \nknow.\n  First, what you have to know is these are all sense-of-the-Senate \namendments. We have worked them out so they are acceptable in the \nmanner I have just described. We will not have\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\nto vote on them. They will go to conference along with the other sense-\nof-the-Senate amendments that we had. I am going to start by just using \nthe Senators' names.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. May we have order \nplease.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will state the Senator's name and the \ngeneral nature of the amendment: Senator Lincoln, a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment on flood control; Senator Bayh, human genome; Senator Reid, \nwomen's health; Senator Reid, notch babies; Senator Reid, computers; \nSenator Kennedy, civilian/military research; Senator Dorgan, rural \nproviders; Senator Dorgan, empowerment zones; Senator Dorgan, trade; \nSenator Bayh, fatherhood; Senator Landrieu; children; Senator Landrieu, \nmilitary procurement; Senator Landrieu, thrift savings plan--military; \nSenator Cleland, Centers for Disease Control; Senator Cleland, long-\nterm health; Senator Feinstein, environmental cleanup; Senator \nLieberman, asset building; Senator Kohl, Medicare equity; Senator \nLautenberg, Amtrak; Senator Bingaman, veterans' benefits; Senator \nMurray, customs; Senator Bond, medically underserved; Senator Abraham, \nas modified, Medicare choice; Senator Bunning, mining; Senator Collins, \nhunger relief; Senator Collins, excess gas revenues; Senator Collins, \nhome health; Senator Coverdell, flood control; Senator DeWine, troops \nto teachers; Senator Fitzgerald, trust fund commission; Senator \nFitzgerald, child safety seats; Senator Grassley, World Trade \nOrganization; Senator Grassley, long-term care; Senator Grassley, child \nwelfare; Senator Gregg, Social Security education; Senator Jeffords, \nLIHEAP; Senator Kyl, estate taxes; Senator Santorum, farmland; Senator \nShelby, as modified, defense; Senator Smith of Oregon, fiber optics; \nSenator L. Chafee, breast and cervical cancer; Senator Burns, taxes; \nSenator Kyl, Medicare choice; Senator Grams, Social Security; Senator \nInhofe, impact aid; Senator Hutchison, oil; Senator Enzi, as modified, \nhome office; Senator Enzi, as modified, prevention health. We add \nSenator Hatch, No. 3022, sense-of-the-Senate on Internet drugs, and No. \n3023 on methamphetamines.\n  That is it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The modification will be sent to the desk. The \nSenator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nwhich has been cleared, No. 3014, that somehow was dropped from the \nlist. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Hutchinson had No. 2918, high-intensity drugs.\n  Now we have a question from the distinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. A sense-of-the-Senate amendment No. 3014. My \nunderstanding is it has been cleared and inadvertently dropped.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does the Senator remember what it is about?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is firefighters.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Has that been accepted on the Senator's side? It is all \nright with us. We will add it to the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it will be added to the \nlist.\n  What is the request of the Senator from New Mexico?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I asked unanimous consent, as I stated originally, that \nall of these amendments I have listed and explained be in order; that \nthey be made the pending business; that they be agreed to, en bloc; \nthat the motion to table and the motions to reconsider be agreed to, en \nbloc; and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, we are seeing \nbad, bad go to worse. There are many things that can  be said about the \nway this Senate is operating with respect to budget resolutions. Vote-\narama is bad enough, but now to ask the Senate to take all of these \namendments in bloc is just asking too much. I do not say this \ncritically of the distinguished Senator from New Mexico. He has a tough \nassignment, and he does it well. He is trying to accommodate a lot of \nSenators here. I would personally be willing to take him at his word. \nBut this is no way to legislate.\n\n  I will not be a part of gang rape of the legislative process. That is \nwhat this has become. If we are going to do all these amendments--I did \nnot count them; I do not know how many amendments there may be here--\nbut if we are going to do all of these just by voice vote, pig in a \npoke, just so we can get out--and I want to get out, too--then why \nshouldn't we have done it at the start of the process? Why have we gone \nthrough all this rigamarole voting on these matters? If we come to the \nend and we still have two-thirds of the amendments left undone, and we \nare just going to say: OK, let's go home; we will accept them all, \nsight unseen, and let them go to conference--I am not going to be a \npart of that, Mr. President. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from West \nVirginia, we have worked now for 4 days on this resolution, and we have \nworked our way through what we thought were the difficult amendments \nthat required votes. Staff has been working for several days on \namendments that have been cleared on both sides.\n  I respectfully suggest to my distinguished leader, this happens on \nevery piece of legislation, where staff gets together, subject to the \nmatters of the bill, and approves legislation by unanimous consent. \nThat is what we did here.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have been in this Senate now going on 42 \nyears. I know what is going on. We have time. We could come back next \nweek and vote on these amendments. The Senators who have offered the \namendments are entitled to a vote on each amendment. They are entitled \nto have some debate. Those of us who do not know what are in the \namendments are entitled to know what they are about, and we are also \nentitled to a vote on the amendments if we so desire. I have already \nobjected.\n  We can stay here this evening. We can come back tomorrow. We can come \nback Monday and finish voting on the amendments. We do not have to \nlegislate in this fashion. I am just not going to be a part of it. I \nmay earn the enmity of every Senator in this body, but I am keeping a \ngood relationship with my own conscience on this. We are seeing the \nlegislative process go downhill in this Senate.\n  More and more, this Senate is becoming like the other body. I am not \nfor that. And if I have to stand alone, I will stand alone. I have no \nproblems with that. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I suggest the absence of a quorum. I withhold the \nrequest.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to Senator Byrd, first, I \nappreciate the kind remarks he made about the Senator from New Mexico, \nbut on a budget resolution, we are dealt what we are dealt. It just \nhappens that a Parliamentarian had ruled that all these sense-of-the-\nSenate amendments are in order on a budget resolution. The Senator from \nWest Virginia knows as well as I know that many of them are not going \nto do anything, but if a Senator wants to offer them, not as \nlegislation or law--they will not be that, no matter what we do; even \nif we kept every one in conference, they would not be law.\n  We have worked our best to let every Senator who had an amendment who \nwanted a vote--the Senator raised the issue of why don't we vote on \nthese. I make the point that every Senator who had an amendment and \nwanted a vote got a vote.\n  I do not think you had any of the sense of the Senates here, but \nevery Senator whose amendment I read agreed that they did not need a \nrollcall vote. It is not like they want a vote. They do not want a \nvote. They want to do it this way.\n  Mr. BYRD. I did not say they wanted a vote. I said every Senator has \na right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You said they should be entitled to.\n  Mr. BYRD. Every Senator has a right to vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You say they have a right. They do not want to exercise \nthat right. They want to do it this way.\n  Frankly, we can stop and the leaders can decide where we go next. But \nthese sense-of-the-Senate amendments that we are adopting here should \nnot really hold up the budget because they do not affect the budget. \nThey are sense of the Senates that have to do with how we\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nfeel about things and what we want to make people think about the \nSenate with reference to the subject matter of the sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions.\n  But you have every right, and you exercise it with dignity, although \nfor many of us it is a pretty tough pill. Even your dignity makes it a \ntough pill.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe it was just a few years ago we had this \nstage of frustration. We were addressing the merits of these nonbinding \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I put the matter to a vote. After much \nself-examination, why, the Senate decided not to support my amendment \nto do away with these nonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. But \nthe debate was rather interesting because it addressed the right of a \nSenator to express himself or herself. Yet the realization that these \nshould not be a part of the budget process, I think, was generally \nagreed upon by most Members.\n  I leave that for you to ponder because I think it represents a degree \nof frustration here.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I guess I have a question of the manager and maybe a \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  The question is, Are all of these sense-of-the-Senate amendments; \nevery one of them?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have to agree with what Senator Byrd has said about the \nway we vote on the budget resolution at the end with the vote-arama. \nAlthough I must say, to everybody's credit, we only had 14 seriatim \nthis time.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolutions are not binding at all. They may \nmake a statement that makes you feel good, but many Senators are being \nasked to agree to these en bloc without knowing what the details are.\n  So the parliamentary inquiry is, since there has been objection, is \nthe status that these, then, are not agreed to, and we are ready to go \nto adoption of the concurrent resolution?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. These amendments have not yet been proposed. \nThe agreement was objected to; therefore, they have not been presented \nfor formal action.\n  Mr. LOTT. So what is the status, Mr. President? Are they all still \npending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They are not. The amendments have been \nidentified but are not pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we are ready to go to the adoption of the \nconcurrent resolution, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Unless they are called up, that is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I move regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no pending amendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks an historic point for the \nSenate. Not only did the Federal Government last year experience a \nbalanced Federal budget without the use of the Social Security surplus \nfor the first time since 1960, but we are now considering a budget \nresolution that will ensure we have a balanced Federal budget without \nthe use of the Social Security surplus for three consecutive years--the \nfirst time this has happened since 1947 to 1949--and that takes us one \nstep further on the path to actually eliminating our Nation's publicly-\nheld debt by the year 2013.\n  Needless to say, such a change in the way the Government does \nbusiness is not only a significant step for the Senate and the \nCongress, but a welcome relief to a generation of Americans who have \nbecome all too accustomed to the terms ``deficit'' and ``debt.''\n  Mr. President, in light of the non-Social Security budget surpluses \nwe are now enjoying, I thank the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Pete Domenici, for his unwavering commitment to a balanced \nbudget and fiscally responsible decision-making over the years. Thanks, \nin part, to his leadership and efforts, the turbulent waves of annual \ndeficits and mounting debt have been temporarily calmed. And, if we are \nwilling to adhere to these principles in this year's budget resolution \nand others yet to come, we may be able to maintain the current \nbudgetary calm for many years in the future.\n  The budget resolution reported by the Senate Budget Committee--and \nthat we are now considering on the floor--not only maintains fiscal \ndiscipline, but it also ensures that critical priorities are protected \nand addressed in fiscal year 2001 and beyond.\n  Specifically, the Senate budget resolution contains the following key \nprovisions:\n  First, it protects every penny of the Social Security surplus in \nupcoming years by devoting it solely to reducing publicly-held debt.\n  Second, through an amendment I offered in the Budget Committee markup \nwith Senator Wyden and Senator Smith (OR), provides a ``down-payment'' \nfor a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, while ensuring a strong \nimpetus for much-needed, comprehensive Medicare reforms.\n  Third, it provides a fiscally responsible increase in Federal \nspending, while targeting funds for critically needed priorities \nincluding education and defense.\n  Fourth, it provides tax relief for Americans at a time when the \ntypical family's tax burden exceeds the cost of food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. And as a result of another amendment I offered during \nmarkup, it places tax relief for higher education tuition paid and for \ninterest paid on student loans as a top priority in any tax cut package \nthat is ultimately crafted. When considering that the cost of college \nhas risen twice as fast as inflation and eight times as fast as median \nhousehold incomes over the past 20 years--and students borrowed more \nduring the 1990s than during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s combined--I \ncan think of no tax cut that would be more appropriate in any upcoming \ntax package.\n  Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those \nof most Americans--especially the protection of Social Security's \nmonies. Accordingly, I believe this resolution deserves broad \nbipartisan support in the Senate and, ultimately, by the entire \nCongress.\n  To truly appreciate what is contained in this budget resolution, I \nbelieve it is appropriate to compare it with the only other major \nproposal on the table: the budget proposal put forth by President \nClinton in early-February.\n  Specifically, as we have learned from CBO's analysis of his budget, \nPresident Clinton has proposed $1.3 trillion in new spending over the \ncoming 10 years. This new spending--of which $866 billion would be for \ndiscretionary spending program--would utilize 70 percent of the \nprojected on-budget surpluses over this period of time.\n  Furthermore, despite his initial claim of providing working Americans \nwith a tax cut of $250 billion over the coming 10 years, we now know \nthat the President's budget not only increases taxes by $5 billion in \nFY 2001, but he only cuts taxes by $4 billion over the coming five \nyears and $146 billion over 10 years, representing eight percent of the \nprojected on-budget surpluses, and the net result is far below his \noriginal proposal of a $250 billion tax cut!\n  In contrast, the Senate budget resolution provides a strong, but \nfiscally-responsible, increase in discretionary spending of $27 billion \nnext year--a 4.6 percent increase from the current fiscal year--and \n$125 billion over the coming five years. Furthermore, the resolution \nalso provides a tax cut of up to $13 billion in FY 2001 and up to $150 \nbillion over the coming five years--an amount that ensures for every \ndollar in tax relief, there will be $13 in debt reduction.\n\n  Finally, the Senate resolution contains a provision I authored with \nSenators Wyden and Smith (OR) that will be critical to our efforts to \nmove forward on an issue of critical importance to our nation's \nseniors: a reserve fund that will provide up to $40 billion for a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit. In contrast, the President's budget \nwould provide less than $30 billion for such a benefit over the coming \nfive years.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the need for a new Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit could not be more clear. When Medicare was created in 1965 \nit followed the private health insurance model of the time--inpatient \nhealth care. Today, thirty-five years later it is sadly out of date and \nit is time to bring Medicare back to the future by providing our \nseniors with prescription drug coverage.\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n  The lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit is the biggest \nhole--a black hole really--in the Medicare system. HCFA will tell you \nthat up to 69 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have drug coverage from \nother sources--but that number simply doesn't tell the whole story.\n  Specifically, ten percent of Medicare beneficiaries get drug coverage \nfrom one of the three Medigap policies that cover drugs. Two of these \npolicies require a $250 deductible and then only cover 50 percent of \nthe cost of the drug with a $1,250 cap. You can run up that cap pretty \nfast with today's drug prices. The third policy provides a cap of \n$3,000 but the premium ranges anywhere from $1,699 to $3,171 depending \non where you live. That is a significant amount of money for someone \nliving on a fixed income.\n  An estimated 8 percent get drug coverage from participating in \nMedicare HMOs and another 11 percent receive coverage from Medicaid. Of \ncourse to do that, they must be very low-income to begin with and may \nhave to spend a great deal out of pocket for their drugs--what we \ncommonly refer to as spending down--before they are eligible in a given \nyear for coverage. Finally there are those lucky enough--31 percent--to \nhave employer sponsored drug coverage through their retiree program.\n  In my view, a solution to the pressing problem of prescription drug \ncoverage can't come soon enough. Drug coverage should be part and \nparcel of the Medicare system, not a patchwork system where some get \ncoverage and some don't. Prescription drug coverage shouldn't be a \n``fringe benefit'' available only to those wealthy enough or poor \nenough to obtain coverage, it should be part and parcel of the Medicare \nsystem that will see today's seniors, and tomorrow's into the 21st \nCentury.\n  Accordingly, during the markup of the Senate budget resolution, I \noffered an amendment--along with Senators Wyden and Gordon Smith--that \nensures the Congress can move forward in creating a prescription drug \nbenefit before we adjourn this fall, while still providing a strong \nimpetus for comprehensive Medicare reform. Specifically, the reserve \nfund we offered not only provides a ``down-payment'' of $20 billion for \nsuch a benefit over the coming three years, but it provides an \nadditional $20 billion in years four and five if Congress moves forward \non legislation that extends the solvency of the Medicare program \nwithout any gimmicks. Furthermore, it ensures that the Finance \nCommittee has ample time--until September 1, to be exact--to craft a \nnew benefit that utilizes the $20 billion ``down-payment'' prior to \nthese monies being freed-up for stand-alone proposals on the floor.\n  Why is this reserve fund and its structure so important? Put simply, \nby providing a ``down-payment'' on a new prescription drug benefit over \nthe coming three years--but by linking the long-term funding of the \nbenefit to substantive reforms--my amendment ensures that a benefit can \nbe crafted immediately without undercutting the long-term reform \neffort. In fact, by linking the extension of this new benefit to actual \nreforms, my amendment serves as a strong impetus for reform as no \nmember of Congress would want to risk having such a benefit expire due \nto a failure to act on broader reforms.\n  Ultimately, I believe this reserve fund--which was adopted by voice \nvote in the Budget Committee--will serve as a catalyst for the most \nimportant changes to the Medicare program since its inception, both in \nterms of creating a much-needed new benefit and in terms of enacting \ncomprehensive reforms.\n  By maintaining fiscal discipline, protecting Social Security \nsurpluses, buying down debt, providing funds for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, and enhancing funding for shared priorities \nsuch as education, I believe the Senate budget resolution deserves \nstrong support by the full Senate.\n  Ultimately, while Members from either side of the aisle may disagree \nwith specific provisions in the resolution that has been crafted, the \nsimple fact is that this is a budget framework--or ``blueprint''--that \nestablishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on \nthese individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions \nwill initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, \nand ultimately by Members on the floor.\n  Therefore, I am hopeful that amendments offered to this framework do \nnot harm the broad and reasoned parameters that have been set, and \ncommend the Chairman Domenici, again, for his efforts in crafting this \nbalanced resolution.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Majority's \nbudget resolution pending before the Senate--a budget that, in my view, \nwill take the country in the wrong direction.\n  We meet at a time when the Nation is enjoying remarkable economic \nprosperity. Thanks to the strong economy and the fiscal discipline \nbegun in 1993, the country is in a fiscal position no one thought \npossible even a few years ago. In 1997, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Office of Management and Budget, and nearly everyone else \nwere predicting substantial budget deficits far into the next decade--\nas high as $159 billion in FY2000, $153 billion in FY2002 and \ncontinuing into the foreseeable future. Instead, the Nation is enjoying \nthe longest economic expansion in its history. Since 1993, 20.8 million \nnew jobs have been created, real wages have increased by 6.6 percent, \nthe median family's income has grown by 12 percent, and the \nunemployment rate is the lowest it has been in 30 years.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the effort in 1993 that helped to \ncreate this positive economic climate. Working together, the President \nand Congressional Democrats crafted a package that finally brought the \nFederal deficit under control. By making difficult but critical \ndecisions to cut Federal programs and raise revenues, we tamed the \ndeficits that plagued the Nation throughout the 1980's, placed enormous \npressure on important Federal initiatives, and hampered our economic \ngrowth. Most Republicans argued at the time that this responsible \npackage would ruin the economy and send markets tumbling. They were \ndead wrong.\n  When you look at the choice we face for our economic future, we are \nat a sort of fork in the road. We can continue down the path of fiscal \ndiscipline begun in 1993, shoring up Social Security and Medicare, \npaying down the debt, investing more in our people--or we can take the \nother fork in the road embodied by irresponsible and unrealistic tax \ncuts that have been passed by the Majority in the Budget Committee, a \npath that will eventually eliminate any projected surplus, cause deep \ncuts in funding for critical education, health care, environmental or \nother programs, and put us back on a path toward deficits.\n  In my view, we have a tremendous opportunity right now with the \nstrongest economy in history to move our country in the right \ndirection--to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, to shore up \neducation and address the issue of the digital divide, to expand access \nto health care and provide a meaningful prescription health benefit, to \nclean up the environment, to bring down the crime rate, and on and on. \nWe can build on this effort and use this opportunity to secure a bright \nand prosperous future for our Nation and its citizens, or we can \nsquander it with irresponsible decisions.\n  It is my strongly held view that any surplus realized in the near \nfuture should be seen as an opportunity to pay down the Nation's debt, \ninvest in our Nation's future, and shore up vital programs. I am deeply \nconcerned that much like the budget proposal put forward by the \nMajority last year, this year's budget resolution fails to take \nadvantage of an unprecedented opportunity to ensure that the Federal \ngovernment will meet its obligations after the baby boomers retire and \nbeyond.\n  I am also concerned because the budget resolution before us would \nendanger our hard-won progress and shortchange national priorities that \nthe American people want to see addressed. This is an opportunity for \nus to think seriously about our Nation's needs and priorities as we \nlook into the 21st century, and chart an appropriate course for the \nfuture. The Republican budget resolution is less a forward-looking \npolicy blueprint than a political document aimed at short-term gain. \nLet us take a balanced approach, and continue the fiscal discipline \nthat has allowed our Nation to prosper.\n  The Democrats proposed a responsible budget resolution to the \nCommittee. That alternative covered ten\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nyears and would have reduced $330 billion in debt over ten years, while \nproviding almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts. Unlike the \nRepublican budget resolution, it proposed realistic levels of \ndiscretionary spending, including the President's full requests for \neducation and defense spending. It also reserved funding for very \nimportant programs, such as health coverage for uninsured Americans. \nUnfortunately, the Democratic alternative was defeated on a party-line \nvote.\n  We have come far economically and must be very careful as we move \nforward about how we use any budget surplus. In my view, we must \nemphasize paying down the national debt, protecting Social Security and \nMedicare, increasing spending for programs important to our Nation's \nfuture, and providing targeted tax cuts for working Americans. The \nRepublican budget before us, in contrast, contains a $150 billion tax \ncut--enough to consume almost 98% of the non-Social Security surplus \nover the next 5 years. This leaves nothing for prescription drug \ncoverage, education increases, and other initiatives critical to the \nfuture well-being of our Nation.\n  Mr. President, the Republican priorities evident in this resolution \nsimply are not shared by most of the American people. The Majority's \nbudget proposal falls far short of the mark in almost every respect and \nwould take our country in the wrong direction. I strongly oppose this \nresolution, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am disappointed in this budget \nresolution, because it endangers our national security.\n  The budget resolution does so by reducing the President's request for \ninternational affairs by over 10 percent. This reduction may appear to \nbe a politically easy way to keep spending down. But mark my words: the \nreductions assumed by this budget resolution will end up costing us \nmore elsewhere in future budgets.\n  Literally speaking, our diplomats are on the front lines of our \nnational defense. They are out in force around the capitals of the \nworld, defending and protecting our national interests every day--\npreventing and mitigating conflicts, fighting drug trafficking, \npromoting U.S. exports, reducing environmental degradation, and \nadvancing American values and ideals. Most of them live and work under \nless than ideal circumstances. Many of them live in very dangerous \nplaces like Lebanon or Colombia. This budget breaks faith with those \npeople because it will not provide enough money for secure embassies to \nprotect them, and it does provide enough money for critical tools of \ndiplomacy--exchange and assistance programs--that will enable them to \nadequately perform their missions.\n  We are deluding ourselves as a nation into thinking that we can \nremain a great power while continuing to skimp on spending to maintain \na robust international presence.\n  We have made important progress in the past several years in \nrestoring funding for international affairs. Unfortunately, we haven't \nmade enough progress, and the budget remains below historical levels. \nAccording to a recent study by the Congressional Research Service \nprepared at my request, the discretionary budget authority for Function \n150 in Fiscal 2000, $22.264 billion in FY 2000 dollars, is 9.3 percent \nbelow the average of the past two decades, $24.56 billion. As a \npercentage of total budget authority, Function 150 funding in FY 2000 \nis 1.24 percent, nearly one-fifth below the annual average, 1.571 \npercent, for the past two decades.\n  Mr. President, I hope that as the budget process moves forward, the \nleadership on the other side will find a way to accommodate the \nlegitimate needs of our foreign policy and increase the allocations to \nthese accounts. I urge the Chairman to do everything possible in the \ncoming months to work toward to that objective.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the budget resolution \nwhich the majority has presented to the Senate. In my judgement, this \nbudget represents the wrong priorities. It places too much reliance on \nrisky estimates about the Federal surplus over the next five years and \nprovides for an unwise tax cut in lieu of greater reduction in the \nnational debt and emphasis on protecting Social Security and Medicare \nas well as investments in the future of young Americans through \neducation.\n  For the past several months we have heard a familiar refrain--that \nthe budget of the Federal Government will be in surplus over the next \nten years. In fact, all throughout the first session of this Congress, \nthe American people were told over and over again that, after years of \nrunning huge deficits, the Federal budget was about to start running \nenormous surpluses--tens, or even hundreds, of billions of dollars per \nyear. While these were only projections, they seem constantly to \nimprove, painting a very rosy scenario of America's fiscal future--that \nis until Congress passed the Fiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills. \nShortly after passage, the Congressional Budget Office, in its End of \nSession Summary, projected a $17 billion on-budget deficit for this \nyear--meaning $17 billion of the Social Security surplus would be \nused--the result of the tens of billions of dollars in so-called \n``emergency'' spending. In the intervening months, the CBO has revised \nits forecasts and now projects a $26 billion surplus for the current \nfiscal year, assuming no supplemental appropriations and no downturn in \nthe economy. But we won't really know whether we have a surplus or a \ndeficit for fiscal year 2000 until it ends in October. By the same \ntoken, we won't really know for sure whether we'll have a 10-year \nsurplus or deficit until fiscal year 2010 draws to a close.\n  With that in mind, I want to share a reality check on the projected \nten year budget surplus and on the tax cuts proposed by the Senate \nBudget Committee majority and by Governor George W. Bush. In January of \nthis year, the Congressional Budget Office released three surplus \nestimates, each based on a different assumption about the level of \ndiscretionary spending over the next ten years. These estimates were \nupdated by the CBO on March 9th. The largest non-Social Security \nsurplus estimate, $1.95 trillion, assumes that Congress will spend \ndecreasing amounts for discretionary spending through fiscal year 2002, \nas required by the existing budget caps created in law and that \ndiscretionary spending will then increase at the rate of inflation. But \nCongress basically ignored these caps for the fiscal year 2000 budget \npassed back in November. Almost nobody believes it is realistic to \nassume that they will be adhered to for the next two years.\n  The second surplus estimate, $1.89 trillion, assumes that we freeze \ndiscretionary spending for the next ten years at the fiscal year 2000 \nlevel. Freezing spending at this year's level for the next ten years \nmeans that we can't maintain Federal services at their current levels \nbecause we'd be ignoring the effect of inflation. So we'd be cutting \nfederal services from their current level for ten years in a row. Over \nten years this amounts to an $835 billion cut in current Federal \nservices or 12%. That's a totally unrealistic assumption on which to \nproject a surplus. Just look at the last ten years--an era supposedly \ncharacterized by fiscal restraint: Non-defense discretionary spending \ngrew at a nominal annual average rate of almost 5%--that's 2% above \ninflation. The last three years, during which the budget caps have \nsupposedly been in effect, total discretionary spending has outpaced \ninflation by 1.2%.\n  The third CBO surplus estimate, $893 billion, is by far the most \nrealistic--and indeed it too may be optimistic. This estimate assumes \nthat discretionary spending will keep pace with inflation for the next \nten years. If spending follows that path and if the economy performs \nreasonably well, the surplus, exclusive of Social Security revenues, \ncould amount to $171 billion over the next five years and $893 billion \nover the next ten years. I emphasize the words ``if'' and ``could.'' \nThis surplus estimate is just that--an estimate, far from certain, that \ndepends upon several assumptions about things like economic growth \nrates, interest rates, and discretionary spending. If any of these \nassumptions is off, even by just a little, the surplus could shrink \nconsiderably.\n  Obviously, Congress can't legislate economic growth or interest \nrates. But, Congress can and does have responsibility for discretionary \nspending, taxes, managing the National Debt and the continued strength \nof programs like Medicare and Social Security. So, we must carefully \nanalyze and try to\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nproject faithfully and fairly what happens to the surplus when we look \nat our promises and our responsibilities to the American people over \nthe next ten years: our responsibility to help provide seniors with \naccess to the prescription drugs they need to live, our responsibility \nto our children to pay down the publicly held National Debt, our \nresponsibility to protect Medicare, and our responsibility to stimulate \nthe research and development of new technologies necessary to continue \nto strengthen the economy in the new millennium.\n  Both parties seem to agree that the rising cost of prescription drugs \nmakes some type of prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries a \nnecessity. The President's plan would have no deductible and pay half \nof all beneficiaries' prescription drug costs up to $5,000 when fully \nphased in by 2009. If you subtract the plan's ten year cost of $98 \nbillion from the $893 billion surplus estimate of the CBO, the surplus \nshrinks to $795 billion.\n  The Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is estimated to encounter \nproblems beginning in 2010, when expenditures start to exceed income. \nThe difference will be made up by using the interest income on \nsecurities held by the Trust Fund. Beginning in 2015, the Trust Fund \nwill have to start drawing down principal to meet its obligations. And \nby 2023, the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be insolvent--with \nprincipal depleted and income able to meet only 80% of its obligations. \nIn any case, the Concord Coalition estimates that the entire Medicare \nprogram will suffer a huge cash deficit on the order of over $250 \nbillion over the next ten years, unless substantial changes are made \nand/or dollars infused into it. The President's plan calls for both and \nhe would provide $299 billion to extend Medicare's solvency beyond \n2030. When these dollars are allocated to the Medicare Hospital \nInsurance Trust Fund, they are not paid out immediately to \nbeneficiaries. And since current law requires that these dollars be \ninvested in government securities, this allocation would also reduce \nthe publicly held National Debt. So, if you subtract $299 billion from \nthe surplus for protecting Medicare which also helps pay down the Debt, \nthe surplus shrinks to $496 billion over the next ten years.\n  Given those other demands on the budget surplus, the President \nproposes tax cuts targeted toward low and moderate income Americans: \nincreasing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit, education incentives, \nhealth care incentives, encouraging charitable contributions. If we \nsubtract the net cost of these tax cuts, $256 billion, the surplus \nshrinks to $240 billion.\n\n  If we ignored these priorities and did nothing with the surplus, \nunder current law, it would automatically go toward debt reduction. \nWith the exception of programs such as Medicare and Social Security, \neach dollar of the surplus that gets allocated to one of these \nimportant domestic priorities cannot go toward reducing the publicly \nheld National Debt and that costs money because of the interest that \nmust be paid. While the exact amount of interest varies depending on \nhow the surplus is allocated, the Office of Management and Budget \nestimates this cost to be $64 billion. When we subtract this amount, \nthe surplus shrinks to $176 billion.\n  At this point, if the economy keeps up and projections are accurate, \nwe'll still have a surplus of $176 billion over ten years. But all this \nmath still doesn't take several things into account--things like a 3.2% \naverage annual increase in the rate of discretionary spending--which \nwas the annual average discretionary spending increase from FY97-FY00. \nIf we continued at that historic pace, that would decrease the surplus \nby another $107 billion. If we don't assume that increase, given the \nbudget committee action increasing defense spending, domestic \ndiscretionary spending for programs like Head Start, COPS, the \nSuperfund, and hiring new teachers would have to be cut very \nsubstantially. And what of the tax cuts that the Senate or the House \nhave already passed? Just one of these bills, the Bankruptcy Reform \nBill, contains tax cuts that would decrease the surplus by another $103 \nbillion over ten years. Also, over the next 10 years, up to 21 \ndifferent tax provisions, such as the Research and Experimentation Tax \nCredit, will need to be renewed by Congress or they will expire. \nCongress has routinely renewed these credits. This will cost another \n$100 billion over ten years. Finally, if Congress decides to provide \nrelief to farmers suffering from droughts and other disasters, as well \nas low prices, and to healthcare providers reeling from prior-year \nMedicare cuts, that could cost another $60 billion over ten years. And \nthe list goes on.\n  So, if we take into account certain important responsibilities over \nthe next ten years, the surplus could easily turn into a deficit. That \nis the sobering reality of the situation.\n  Some have suggested that Congress' first priority in reaction to \nbudget surpluses should be to cut taxes. Governor George W. Bush, has \nproposed such a plan.\n  Governor Bush proposes to cut taxes by roughly $483 billion over five \nyears and $1.2 trillion over the next ten years. Even before factoring \nin the interest costs that result from this tax cut, the surplus would \nevaporate completely under Governor Bush's plan.\n  Bad enough, his proposed tax cut leaves nothing to protect Medicare \nor extend its solvency by one day. Nothing to pay down the publicly \nheld National Debt. In fact, it would add hundreds of billions to the \nNational Debt and cut into the Social Security surplus. The reality of \nthe situation illustrated here is that, without spending a dime on any \nof America's other priorities, the Bush tax cut converts an $893 \nbillion surplus into an $572 billion deficit, and that means cutting \ninto the Social Security surplus by $572 billion.\n  Sinking back into the deficit ditch is the wrong direction for the \nbudget and for the economy. We ought not to go in that direction.\n  The Budget Resolution now before the Senate goes in that same \ndirection. The Budget Resolution contains $150 to $200 billion in tax \ncuts over five years. The Budget Resolution passed by House Republicans \ncontains tax cuts which eat up 98% of CBO's $171 billion, five-year \nnon-social security surplus. These tax cuts not only come at the \nexpense of other domestic priorities, they endanger the on-budget \nsurplus and threaten the Social Security surplus. To pay for this tax \ncut, Senate and House Republicans continue in the misguided direction \nof the Bush plan by proposing enormous cuts in domestic Federal \nservices while giving lip service to priorities such as a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. First, both the Senate and House Republican \nBudget Resolutions would cut many domestic Federal services by almost \n10 percent over the next five years. Second, the Resolutions create a \n``reserve fund'' of $40 billion that, in the Senate's version, could go \ntoward a prescription drug benefit if a Medicare reform bill is \nintroduced. I emphasize the words ``could'' and ``if.'' Unlike the tax \nprovisions in the Budget Resolution--that direct the Finance Committee \nto produce legislation cutting taxes--there are no enforceable \ninstructions compelling anyone in Congress to do anything when it comes \nto prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. So the reality of \nRepublican Budget is clearly a double standard: Serious action when it \ncomes to a large tax cut, and loose language when it comes to \nprescription drugs.\n  What is particularly disturbing is that the House and Senate \nRepublican budgets evade realistic scrutiny by producing only a 5-year \nplan. Last year, faced with the same situation, the Senate considered a \nten year plan. This year, the majority hides the explosive effect of \ntheir tax breaks over the next ten years that could plunge the federal \nbudget back into large deficits.\n  So, before we become too enchanted by the promise of huge surpluses \nin the hundreds of billions or trillions of dollars, before anyone \nwrites any checks on surplus dollars, or enacts large tax cuts which \nare also difficult to reverse, I wanted to offer this reality check to \nshow how, if Congress acts unwisely and with too little caution, the \nsurplus boom could too easily turn into a deficit bust.\n  Mr. President, the Budget Resolution the Senate considers today in my \njudgement takes such a risk. It is premised on the shaky foundation of \nsurplus projections reliant upon unrealistically large cuts in spending \nfor domestic programs like Head Start, programs to reduce class size in \nschools,\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\nclean up superfund pollution sites, and to hire new police officers. It \ndoes too little to protect Medicare and Social Security and to provide \nfor a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. And, it contains an \nunwise tax cut while hiding the exploding costs of that cut in future \nyears.\n  While a few changes which I have supported have been made over the \npast few days, such as increasing Pell grants and devoting more dollars \nto veterans' health care, I cannot support this Budget Resolution. This \nbudget emphaisizes the wrong priorities and runs the risk of heading \nback toward reliance on the Social Security surplus to keep us out of \nthe deficit ditch.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise in \nopposition to this Republican budget resolution.\n  It is with regret because I had sincerely hoped that this year, \nthanks to a booming economy and a federal budget surplus, Congress \nwould be able to approach the budget resolution in a bipartisan and \nresponsible manner, and do what is necessary to protect Social Security \nand Medicare, make sure we have adequate funds to meet important \ndomestic priorities like education and the environment, and provide \nfair tax cuts for working Americans.\n  Indeed, thanks to unprecedented economic growth, the tough choices we \nmade on the budget in 1993, and the discipline we have demonstrated \nsince passing the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997, this year we have \nan opportunity to structure a fiscally responsible budget that pays \ndown the national debt and makes important investments in America's \ndomestic priorities.\n  Unfortunately, this Republican budget resolution threatens to blow a \nhole in the budget by instituting irresponsibly large tax cuts. It does \nnot provide sufficient funding for important domestic priorities and \nthe long-term fiscal solvency of Social Security and Medicare.\n  When I first came to the Senate seven years ago, we faced $200 \nbillion annual federal deficits as far as the eye could see. Thanks to \nfiscal discipline and the current economic boom we are running \nsurpluses. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the non-\nSocial Security budget surplus over the next ten years will be over \n$890 billion.\n  Thanks to the size of the surplus we have a once in a lifetime \nopportunity to pay down our national debt and meet the challenges of \nthe future.\n  We have the opportunity to extend the solvency of Social Security and \nMedicare so that these programs are available for the next several \ngenerations of recipients.\n  We have the opportunity to invest in education, the environment, and \nhealth care. To reduce class size and increase Title I funding. To \nclean up our environmental treasures, including Lake Tahoe. To provide \nhealth care for all children.\n  We have the opportunity to provide prescription drugs for seniors who \ncurrently have to make the choice between paying for food or \nprescription drugs.\n  And we have the opportunity to provide fiscally responsible and \ntargeted tax cuts for working Americans.\n  Unfortunately, this budget resolution is not fiscally responsible, \nand it does not meet these needs.\n  The budget resolution calls for $150 to $200 billion in tax cuts over \nthe next five years. Who knows how much these cuts will cost over the \nnext ten years? Tax cuts that appear to be modest and reasonable at \nfirst will mushroom in years six to ten to something like $1 trillion. \nTo hide this the Republicans on the Budget Committee did not even try \nto estimate the size of these tax cuts in the so-called ``out'' years. \nThey did not even try because the reality is that these tax cuts will \nbe greater than the non-Social Security budget surplus over 10 years, \njust as they are over 5 years.\n  This budget resolution uses the surplus for tax cuts, not debt \nreduction. The non-Social Security budget surplus is expected to be \n$171 billion over the next five years, but this budget resolution calls \nfor $168 to $218 billion in tax cuts over the same period. Quite \nsimply, this resolution does not protect Social Security surpluses.\n  The Republican budget calls for increases in spending on defense, \neducation, veterans health care, and income support payments for \nfarmers. I applaud these increases. We need a strong defense. To take \ncare of veterans. To educate our children. To protect our farmers from \nincome fluctuations that are the result of weather, disease and market \nconditions.\n  Unfortunately, to increase funding for these priorities while \nproviding almost $1 trillion in tax breaks would result in a ten \npercent across-the-board cut in all other non-defense discretionary \nspending.\n  Let me tell you what this means for ordinary people. Over the next 5 \nyears a 10 percent across-the-board budget cut would cut: 750,000 low-\nincome women, infants and children from WIC; 1,100 FBI and 900 DEA \nagents; 316,000 Pell Grants for needy students; and 40,000 students \nfrom Head Start.\n\n  This budget resolution would leave the COPS program about 40,000 \npolice officers short of the goal of 150,000. It would prevent us from \nproviding urgent repairs for 5,000 schools. It could force us to \nabandon plans to put 100,000 new teachers in our classrooms and reduce \nclass sizes.\n  The reality is that even though this budget is predicated on slashing \nthese programs, and more, the Republican Congress has not been able to \nslash non-defense discretionary spending. Domestic spending grew in \n1997, 1998, 1999, and 2000. In fact, it grew by more than ten percent \nlast year.\n  So what are our options?\n  This budget resolution forces us to decide between an across-the-\nboard ten percent budget cut in domestic spending or dipping into the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. This is not fiscal discipline. This is not \nfiscally responsible.\n  We must extend the solvency of Social Security and Medicare. This \nbudget resolution opens the door to raiding the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds, thereby reducing the solvency of these \nentitlements.\n  We must take this once in a lifetime opportunity to provide \nprescription drugs for seniors that cannot afford them. This budget \nresolution will not do so.\n  We must take this opportunity to expand Title I, secure funding for \n100,000 new teachers, modernize schools, and increase Head Start \nfunding. To extend the 100,000 COPS program and protect our children \nfrom gun violence. To bolster the Immigration and Naturalization \nService's ability to protect our borders. To protect the environment \nand expand mass transit in California and other states.\n  Let me be clear: In addition to spending on these important domestic \npriorities, I also believe that we have a responsibility to provide tax \nrelief.\n  In fact, last year Senator Grassley and I introduced the Tax Relief \nfor Working Americans Act of 1999. This is legislation to provide tax \nrelief for working families in a fiscally responsible manner--$271 \nbillion over ten years--and in a budget framework which protects Social \nSecurity and Medicare. It includes provisions to eliminate the marriage \npenalty for 21 million working couples, provide for health insurance \nand child care, promote long-term care, create more affordable housing, \nmake education more affordable, and keep our economy strong through \nincentives such as the research and development tax credit.\n  We must provide targeted tax relief; Eliminate the marriage penalty; \nExpand the earned income tax credit; Establish a long-term care tax \ncredit; Establish educational savings accounts and Individual \nDevelopment Accounts; Permanently expand the research and \nexperimentation tax credit.\n  I believe that given the health of our economy and the Federal budget \nsurplus we can provide the American people with real tax relief, \nresponsible tax relief. But this Republican budget resolution does not \ndo so.\n  The current economic boom has presented us with a unique \nopportunity--we can save Social Security and Medicare, invest in \ndomestic priorities, provide for a strong national defense and give \nworking Americans targeted tax relief. All while paying down the \nnational debt.\n  Unfortunately, this budget resolution includes unrealistic tax cuts \nthat risk upsetting the current economic climate. This resolution may \nset us down a path of fiscal irresponsibility that will endanger all of \nour gains of the past few years.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this budget resolution.\n\n[[Page S2424]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, this Republican budget fails to reflect \nthe priorities of families across America.\n  If this budget were submitted in any math class--it would get an F--\nbecause the numbers just don't add up. The reality doesn't match the \nrhetoric.\n  And while Republicans are talking about how great their budget is, \nwhen you do the math the things Americans care about--improving \neducation, reducing the debt, saving Social Security, strengthening and \nmodernizing Medicare--have all been left behind.\n  The things that matter to families have been sacrificed in the name \nof an irresponsible tax cut.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that this budget abandons the \nprogress we have made since 1993. Since I first joined the Budget \nCommittee, our nation's financial strength has grown dramatically. \nThrough the hard work of the President, the Vice President, and others, \nwe have turned deficits into surpluses.\n  And we learned two important lessons. First, budgets must be \nrealistic--they have to take into account what our nation needs and \nwhat we are capable of providing.\n  Second, budgets must be responsible. A responsible budget meets our \nobligations. It makes sure that Social Security, Medicare and other \nexisting commitments aren't left hanging.\n  But, Mr. President, this budget fails both tests--it is neither \nrealistic nor responsible. This budget fails to provide the necessary \ninvestments in education, health care and prescription drug coverage. \nInstead, this Republican budget sacrifices our priorities for $200 \nbillion in tax cuts.\n  This tax cut could eat up all of the on-budget surplus. Given this \nCongress' track record on tax cuts, it is fair to assume when we see \nthe specifics they will be similar to Governor Bush's plan and to the \ntax bill Republicans tried to pass last year.\n  In both of those Republican plans, the top 10% of the people, get \nmore than 60% of the benefits. The President and the American people \nrejected that tax plan last year, and I expect they will reject it \nagain.\n  Mr. President, so far the majority has expressed interest in two \nspecific tax provisions. Unfortunately, their efforts have been \nmisguided.\n  First, the Majority has moved to repeal the marriage penalty. I \nsupport making sure that families in America are not penalized by our \ntax code. In fact, I am a cosponsor of S. 8, which would eliminate the \nmarriage penalty. Our bill addresses a real problem--too many lower and \nmiddle income families are penalized by the current system.\n  But the majority's proposal--by giving further tax relief to those \nwho already enjoy a marriage bonus--simply creates new inequities while \nstill burdening lower and middle income families with a marriage \npenalty.\n  Mr. President, the Republicans have a second proposal--related to \nsmall businesses. Democrats fought to pass a minimum wage increase, \nwhich some of America's hardest workers desperately need. But the \nmajority would only go along if their tax proposal was included.\n  What did we end up with? A minimum wage increase over 3 years instead \nof 2--so workers would have to wait an extra year to get the full \nbenefit--and a tax plan that kept growing. While I support targeted tax \ncuts that will really help small businesses, I do not support the \nmajority's approach, which abandons fiscal responsibility by the sheer \nsize of their combined proposals.\n  Mr. President, I do want to take just a moment to mention three \nimportant positive statements we were able to include in the budget \nresolution.\n  I am pleased that my amendment placing a high priority on the unique \nneeds of women in the Social Security debate was adopted in committee. \nThis amendment recognizes the economic safety net of social security \nfor women and puts the Senate on record in support of using the reform \nprocess to improve the economic condition of women.\n  This resolution also includes my amendment regarding the urgency of \nreauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act and the need to support \nfull funding for these programs. We are facing a deadline on \nreauthorization--I want to make it clear that we will not abandon \nbattered women and children during this short, legislative year. \nRegardless of the actions of Congress or the courts, we will work to \ncontinue funding for VAWA programs.\n  The third positive statement included in this budget resolution is my \namendment on pipeline safety--which was adopted unanimously by the \nBudget Committee. My amendment says that pipeline safety efforts should \nbe funded at the levels called for in my bill, S. 2004--the Pipeline \nSafety Act of 2000.\n  While I am proud that we were able to win concessions for these three \nimportant areas, overall this budget still puts tax cuts above vital \ninvestments.\n  Mr. President, while Republicans are saying that their budget funds \nkey priorities, their rhetoric doesn't match the reality of their \nbudget. The reality is that to make room for their tax cut, Republicans \nshortchange the investments that matter to the American people. In \nfact, in key areas, this budget doesn't even keep up with inflation.\n  Let me give you a few examples of how this misguided budget leaves \nAmerica's priorities behind. The bad decisions in this budget will be \nfelt in classrooms across America. This budget would decimate the \nprogress we have made reducing overcrowded classrooms. Over the past \ntwo years, we've hired 29,000 new, fully qualified teachers to reduce \nclass size. And today 1.7 million students are learning the basics in a \ndisciplined environment. We should be building on our progress, but \nthis Republican budget abandons our progress.\n  This budget tells students--``sorry, you'll have to sit in an \novercrowded classroom next year because under the Republican tax plan--\nyou are not a priority.''\n  Mr. President, it's a priority that we save Social Security while our \neconomy is so strong. We shouldn't wait until later to fix what we know \nneeds to be changed. But this budget tells every American who will rely \non Social Security in the years to come--``sorry, this budget won't \nsave Social Security for you because under the Republican tax plan--you \nare not a priority.''\n  Mr. President, it's a priority that we pay down our national debt--\ninstead of passing that burden along to our children. But this budget \ntells every young American--``sorry, you better start saving money now \nto pay off the national debt--because under the Republican plan--you \nare not a priority.''\n  Mr. President, it's a priority that we strengthen and modernize \nMedicare. It's a priority that seniors get help buying the medicine \nthey need--because no one should have to choose between buying medicine \nand buying food.\n  But this budget tells seniors--``sorry, you can't get the \nprescription drug coverage you need because under the Republican tax \nplan--you are not a priority.''\n  Mr. President, the American people want real budgets--not gimmicks. \nThey want to know that our nation's vital priorities are being treated \nlike priorities. They don't want the things that matter in their lives \nto be squeezed out by unbalanced tax cuts that would benefit only a few \npeople.\n  Unfortunately, the driving force of this resolution has been tax \ncuts--tax cuts that explode in the outer years and jeopardize our \nfiscal strength. We should be using the surplus to honor our \ncommitments to our children and our seniors. Now is the time to address \nthe long-term solvency of Social Security and Medicare and to provide \nresources to local communities to make our classrooms ready for the \n21st century. Those are the things a responsible budget does.\n  But as I look at this budget, the only priority I see is this \nexploding tax cut. Who gets left behind in this budget?\n  Students--who could lose the smaller classes they need; every \nAmerican who will depend on Social Security; young people--who will \nstill be burdened with our national debt; and seniors--who rely on \nMedicare and need prescription drug coverage.\n  They all get left behind, and that is wrong. I'm on the floor to say \nthat they are priorities, and we will fight for them.\n  Mr. President, we should pass a budget that reflects the priorities \nof the American people and one that is realistic. This budget fails the \nAmerican people on both counts, and therefore I must oppose it. Let's \ngive the people\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\nwe represent a responsible budget that meets their needs.\n\n\n          emergency agriculture assistance for seed producers\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Enzi, and myself, I wish to engage in a colloquy with \nthe Chairman of the Budget Committee regarding the reserve fund for \nagriculture contained in section 204.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will be pleased to speak with my colleagues regarding \nthis issue. I am very much aware that these are difficult times for \nmany farmers and ranchers across the Nation. For that reason, the \nBudget Committee set aside $5.5 billion in FY 2000 budget authority to \nprovide assistance for agriculture producers.\n  Mr. ENZI. We wanted to draw the Chairman's attention to a crisis \namongst farmers that produce forage grass seed and turf grass seed in a \nnumber of Western states. Due to the recent bankruptcy filing of \nAgriBioTech, one of the Nation's largest handlers of seed products, \nthousands of farmers are facing financial disaster.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. For a state like Oregon, whose grass seed \nfarmers are owned an estimated $40 million by AgriBioTech, the slow \nprogress of bankruptcy proceedings threatens the very future of our \ngrass seed industry, our third largest commodity. Many Oregon grass \nseed growers simply do not have the capital to keep their farms in \noperation without receiving payment for their product already delivered \nto, or stored under contract to, AgriBio Tech.\n  Mr. ENZI. Similarly, in my state of Wyoming, we have close to one \nhundred alfalfa seed growers who may lose their farms without timely \nassistance of some form. These growers are owed close to $4.5 million \non seed they have already delivered. Many of my growers have found that \nthe continuing uncertainty surrounding the bankruptcy case has made it \nimpossible to secure even the short-term credit needed to see them \nthrough another year.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Is it Mr. Chairman's understanding that the \nagriculture assistance levels in this resolution do not preclude \nassistance to agricultural producers adversely impacted by the AgriBio \nTech case?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct. The funding levels assumed for \nagriculture assistance in this resolution do not foreclose the \npossibility that assistance could be provided for that purpose.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the chairman for taking the time to clarify this \npoint for us. I can assure you that this issue is of paramount \nimportance for many small farmers in our states, and we look forward to \nworking with you and the rest of our colleagues to address their \nsituation in the near future.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to explain my opposition to the \nSenate Budget Committee's resolution for FY2001. How unfortunate that \nduring these great economic times, my Republican colleagues have \noutlined a fiscal policy that will squander our hard earned on-budget \nsurplus on misguided economic priorities. Instead of using our on-\nbudget surplus to make important investments for our economic future, \nthis plan calls for large tax cuts that will devour nearly all of our \non-budget surplus. Simply put, the budget we are considering today does \nnot reflect my economic priorities of fiscal discipline and wise \ninvestment in our people in order to ensure that all Americans \nparticipate in our history's greatest economic expansion.\n  The committee's budget makes unrealistic assumptions about the level \nof discretionary spending for the next five years and assumes that the \nprojected surplus will materialize to pay for a large tax cut. The \nBudget Resolution provides for FY2001 $596 billion for total \ndiscretionary spending. When defense discretionary spending is taken \nout, there is a ten percent across the board cut from FY2000 spending \nlevels. This means that important investments in our economic future \nwill not be made. For example, 20,000 new teachers will not be hired. \nSubsidies and grants for school construction to 5,000 schools would be \neliminated and 62,000 students will not be able to participate in Head \nStart.\n  Instead, the Republican budget calls for a $150 to $200 billion tax \ncut over five years. When an additional $17 billion is added for \nservicing the larger national debt created by the tax cut, the \nRepublican tax plan will consume at least $168 billion of the $170 \nbillion CBO projected on-budget surplus. Moreover, at a time when the \nFederal Reserve is already nervous about inflation and has been raising \ninterest rates to protect against higher inflation, a tax cut will only \nincrease inflationary pressure. At this time of strong growth I cannot \nsee a benefit to a tax cut other than that it serves as a consumption \nsubsidy.\n  By assuming unrealistic spending levels and using the surplus for a \nlarge tax cut, this budget leaves no funding for debt reduction. It \nonly dedicates $1 billion for debt reduction in FY2001. If the on-\nbudget surplus funds were used to service the debt, the result would be \nless inflationary pressure and lower interest rates--a de facto tax cut \nfor all Americans, not just the wealthiest Americans. Paying down the \ndebt would also reflect a commitment to fiscal discipline. After we \nhave worked so hard to balance the budget, it seems only reasonable \nthat it should stay balanced and that we use the surplus funds to \nbenefit our economy not hurt it.\n  This budget does not promote savings and reduce the growing income \nand wealth gaps in our economy. The budget proposed by the majority \nparty does not take advantage of our booming economy to rectify some of \nour greatest economic inequalities.\n\n  The economic expansion that began in April, 1991 is the longest in \nAmerican history. It is now more than 9 years old and shows few signs \nletting up. Both inflation and unemployment remain remarkably low. The \nkey to economic vitality, worker productivity, hit a 7 year high last \nyear. This expansion is being fueled by combination of new and old \neconomy fundamentals, technological innovation and fiscal discipline.\n  Along with this phenomenal economy we would expect to see the circle \nof opportunity expanding to include many more Americans. But we do not. \nDespite this historic era of growth, we are seeing the opposite--a \ngrowing gulf between the have and have nots, with more Americans \nfalling further behind and out of the economic mainstream. As we have \ncelebrated continued economic successes, we have scarcely noticed a \nswelling opportunity gap that is as much about wealth as it is about \nincome.\n  Several recent studies have documented a growing income gap in the \nU.S.--an increasing income disparity between the rich and poor with \ndeclining incomes for both poor and low-income families. In addition to \nthat income gap, a report released recently by the Federal Reserve \nBank, has identified a significant wealth gap in this country. A gap \nwhere the net worth--or assets--of the typical American family has \nrisen substantially since 1989, while the net worth--or assets--of \nlower income families has actually declined during the economic boom of \nrecent years.\n  According to the Fed report, families earning under $10,000 a year \nhad a median net worth of $1,900 in 1989. That climbed to $4,800 in \n1995, but had slipped back to $3,600 by 1998. Those families earning \n$10,000 to $25,000 saw their net worth drop from $31,000 in 1995 to \n$24,800 in 1998. More specifically, while the percent of all U.S. \nfamilies that own a home or business has risen during the boom years of \n1995-98, the percent among lower income families has decreased. For \nexample, in 1995, 36.1% of families earning under $10,000 annually \nowned their home. By 1998 the rate had dropped to 34.5%. The drop for \nfamilies earning $10,000 to $25,000 was from 54.9% to 51.7%. The same \nstory is true for the percent of lower income families owning a \nbusiness. Other recent studies show that this wealth gap is even more \nprofound in certain parts of our society. We also know that wealth \naccumulation is generational; it runs in families. According to some \nstudies, up to 50% of all household wealth is passed down from \ngeneration to generation.\n  If this trend is not corrected, we are putting at risk some of the \nvery fundamentals of the American Dream--essential values like home \nownership and the small, family-owned business. But closing the wealth \ngap is not just an issue of opportunity and fairness. If this trend is \nnot corrected, we also put at risk future economic growth. We must \nbegin to question how sustainable\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nis our economy if its growth continues to elude so many. How many \npotential entrepreneurs are we leaving behind and to what extent are we \nlimiting our future economic growth by doing so?\n  We can take steps to address this wealth gap and expand economic \nopportunity. One innovative and powerful approach to help low-income, \nworking families save and develop the assets they need to get ahead and \nthrive in the new economy is Individual Development Accounts, or IDAs. \nSimilar to Individual Retirement Accounts, IDAs are incentive-based \nsavings accounts that can be opened and used only for specific, \npredetermined purposes. Deposits into an IDA by an account holder are \nmatched dollar for dollar through public and private funding. The \nmatching funds are held in a parallel account until the account holder \ncompletes a financial education course and saves enough to purchase an \nasset. Low income individuals and families may use their IDA to \npurchase a home, start a small business, or seek postsecondary \neducation--to pursue the American Dream.\n\n  Currently, there are nearly 250 IDA programs across the country with \napproximately 5,000 account holders. The early evidence from these \nprograms is convincing. It shows that IDAs are highly effective in \npromoting savings and asset building among the working poor. In less \nthan two years, 1,300 account holders in the largest national IDA \nprogram saved more than $375,000 and leveraged an additional $740,000 \nin matching funds. Participants made an average deposit of just $33 a \nmonth. The majority of account holders are women. Twenty percent of \naccount holders had never even held a bank account before enrolling in \nthe IDA program.\n  In the new economy, where job churn is the norm and individuals are \nincreasingly responsible for funding their own retirements, wealth-\nbuilding assets are rapidly becoming the main source of economic \nsecurity. IDAs can give millions of low income working families, \nparents, their children, and future generations, an opportunity for \nupward mobility and economic stability.\n  By proposing such a large and unrealistic tax cut, the majority will \nmake it harder to resource our military at the level it will need to \nmaintain its battlefield capability today and begin the difficult and \ncostly process to transform the force into one that can counter the \nkinds of threats we are likely to see in the future. We have worked \nvery hard over several years to raise the defense budget to ensure our \nsoldiers, sailors, and airmen are fairly and adequately compensated for \ntheir unique and arduous sacrifices to protect our freedoms. The \nPresident has also proposed a budget that increases procurement \nspending to $60 billion, a level that the Quadrennial Defense Review \ndeemed necessary in 1997, but until this year was not achievable. \nIndeed, the President's proposed budget increases defense over the \nprevious years' budget in real terms for the first time since 1985, and \nkeeps us on a path to modernize our current force and transform it in \nlater years.\n  Although the rhetoric of this Resolution would increase spending over \nthe President's budget this year and in the immediate out years, we can \nonly hope that it will allow us to transform our military over the long \nterm because the huge tax cut that is being proposed will most likely \nsquash our superiority in readiness and technology in the long term. As \nmore than one military commander has noted, hope is not a method. The \nmajority wants to provide a large tax cut and talk the talk of strong \ndefense. Unfortunately, they will not be able to have it both ways, and \ngiven a choice, we should all vote against such a large tax cut, and \nwalk the walk with responsible defense spending now and in the future.\n  We are at a critical time in our society where more young people, \nparticularly minorities and low-income individuals, are being left \nbehind in the new economy because they are not learning the basic \nskills of reasoning, mathematics, and communication that provide the \nfoundation for higher education or entry-level jobs in high tech work. \nThe committee's budget fails to invest the level of resources necessary \nto ensure that all of our children are adequately prepared to compete \nin this challenging marketplace.\n  While more money alone won't solve our problems, we cannot honestly \nexpect to reinvent our schools without it either. The reality is that \nthere is a tremendous need for additional investment in our public \nschools, not just in urban areas but in every kind of community. Not \nonly are thousands of crumbling and overcrowded schools in need of \nmodernization, but a looming shortage of two million new teachers to \nhire and train lurks on the horizon. Add to this, billions in spiraling \nspecial education costs to meet.\n  During the upcoming debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct reauthorization, several of my colleagues and I will offer a reform \nproposal, which concentrates our national efforts on closing the \nachievement gap between the haves and have-nots, fostering English \nproficiency for immigrant children, improving the quality of teaching \nfor all children, promoting choice and competition within the public \nsystem, and stimulating innovative and high performance educational \ninitiatives. We would ask the states to set performance standards in \neach of these areas, and in exchange for the funding and flexibility, \nwe would--for the first time ever--hold states accountable for \ndelivering demonstrable results.\n  The Function 300 account of the budget--the function that funds core \nenvironmental and conservation projects--contains some important \nincreases in funding for particular programs, but suffers from the \noverall cuts in discretionary spending. While I support additional \nfunding for water infrastructure projects and land management, I remain \nconcerned that core programs of the Environmental Protection Agency are \nsuffering unjustified cuts. Discretionary decreases can substantially \nundermine clean-ups at Superfund sites, review of pesticide tolerances \nunder the Food Quality Protection Act, and ongoing work to identify air \ntoxics.\n  I am particularly concerned that the Senate mark includes $1.2 \nbillion in assumed revenues from oil drilling in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge. These revenues are fiscally irresponsible, as drilling \nis not in place to bring in net receipts over the five year time frame \nof the budget. More importantly, I, like the majority of the American \npublic, am opposed to drilling in the Refuge as it would irreversibly \ndamage a critical national ecological treasure. A responsible strategy \nwould be to set aside about one-third of the surplus during this period \nof growth to pay for a drug benefit, to strengthen Medicare against the \nfuture, and to address the desperate condition of many facilities in \nConnecticut and other states. The approach of the Republican majority \nsaves about 2% of the on-budget surplus, and uses the rest to fund new \ntax breaks.\n\n  If this budget passes, the Medicare program will have $331 billion \nless--$331 billion less to cover drug benefits for our seniors, $331 \nbillion less to keep hospitals and nursing homes open, and $331 billion \nthat our children will have to pay.\n  Our past investments in research, made in all scientific disciplines \nand supporting work performed in universities, industry, and government \nlabs, have been the driving force for creating the technologies that \nhave driven our high tech economic boom, preserved our national \nsecurity, and created fantastic new advances in medical care. Yet, this \nbudget resolution calls for only a small increase in federal \ninvestments in science and technology over last year's levels. This \nbudget resolution presents a timid and incremental approach to \ninnovation, even though the Senate has recognized the importance of \nresearch and development and last year passed the Federal Research \nInvestment Act unanimously--which called for a doubling of funding for \ncivilian science and technology over the next decade.\n  Unfortunately, the small increase in the budget resolution does not \nmatch the administration's aggressive program for civilian science \ninvestments, nor the spirit of the Senate's own legislation, for many \nkey agencies. In particular, I support the Administration's efforts to \nrestore balance to the federal research portfolio by aggressively \nfunding work in the physical sciences and engineering, through programs \nat the National Science Foundation and Department of Energy. A number \nof my colleagues and I are introducing a\n\n[[Page S2427]]\n\nSense of the Senate Resolution which calls for funding science at \nincreasing levels each year in order to achieve a goal of doubling the \nfederal investment in civilian R over an eleven year period, as well \nas for annually increasing funding of the Department of Defense's \nScience and Technology program--whose products are critical to the \nsafety of our nation's warfighters.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to support a budget \nresolution that more closely reflects sound budget and economic \npriorities. It should be a budget plan that follows the policy of \nfiscal discipline and strategic investment that achieved and has \nsustained our current economic expansion. Unfortunately, this \nresolution does not and it will only lead us back into deficit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to state for the record why I \nvoted against Senator Bond's amendment yesterday. The Bond amendment \nstates that ``It is the sense of the Senate that the budget levels in \nthis resolution assume that no Federal funds may be used by the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development to provide any grant or \nother assistance to construct, operate, or otherwise benefit a smoke \nshop or other tobacco outlet.'' The broad language of the amendment \ncould easily be interpreted to mean that the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development should not use federal funds to support any economic \ndevelopment project, including housing for senior citizens, which has a \nretail outlet that sells, among other things, cigarettes. To cut off \nfederal support for such projects that have a retail outlet that sells \ncigarettes as one of hundreds of other items, is too extreme. Instead, \nI support nondiscriminatory legislation that targets establishments \nwhose primary business is the sale of tobacco products.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, my amendment 2913 to the budget resolution \nexpresses the sense of the Senate that no Federal funds may be used by \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development to subsidize or \notherwise assist smoke shops or tobacco outlets. The amendment refers \nto those facilities or designated portions of facilities which focus \nalmost exclusively on cigarette and other tobacco product sales. Free \nstanding tobacco outlets funded by HUD in recent years devote nearly \nninety percent of their in-store inventory to cigarettes and other \ntobacco products. Larger HUD-funded facilities containing designated \ntobacco stores still devote as much as eighty percent of their total \nin-store inventory to cigarettes or other tobacco products. These \ncigarette and tobacco stores stand in contrast to convenience, grocery \nand general discount stores where cigarette and tobacco products \ngenerally account for no more than thirty percent of total in-store \nsales volume.\n  The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, American Lung Association, \nAmerican Heart Association, American Medical Association, American \nCancer Society and American Academy of Pediatrics supported this \namendment after agreement that HUD support of businesses that exist \nprimarily to sell tobacco products is totally inconsistent with the \nClinton Administration's efforts to curb youth smoking. The National \nCongress of American Indians agrees this amendment will treat Indian \nand non-Indian HUD grantees alike, and thus they also supported this \namendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the permanent \nprotection of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  I certainly understand the concerns raised by those calling for more \ndomestic energy production. I don't disagree that this nation should do \nmore to kick our addiction to foreign oil. I agree it's time to develop \nmore of our nation's clean, renewable energy resources. I urge my \ncolleagues to look carefully at creating incentives for clean, \ndomestically produced energy such as ethanol, methanol, natural gas, \nwind, solar and biomass power. However, we must withhold efforts to \ndrill in one of our nation's most pristine nature preserves and instead \nlook at alternatives.\n  It may be easy for some to look at maps of the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge and envision it as an empty expanse of land that should \nbe valued only for its small and scattered oil pockets. However, this \nis a beautiful stretch of land that contains an incredible variety of \nplant and animal life. This is the only national conservation area that \nprovides a complete range of arctic ecosystems, and it is home to two \nlarge caribou herds and 72 species of land mammals and fish. The \nfounders of the Refuge recognized the special characteristics of this \nland and its value to the American public as a wild and free land.\n  In the summer of 1997, I traveled to the Refuge and was able to see \nfirst hand how beautiful and important this land is to both Alaska and \nthe Nation. As part of a Senate delegation, I visited the Port of \nValdez, where oil is loaded onto tankers, and I traveled along the \npipeline that brings oil from the north. I also flew over the Refuge \nitself, getting a perfect birds-eye view of this quiet, peaceful \nlandscape. In particular, I was silenced by the beauty of the Mollie \nBeattie Wilderness. As my colleagues will remember, we dedicated a \nlarge portion of the refuge to Mollie Beattie, a friend and fellow \nVermonter.\n  Mollie oversaw all of Vermont's public lands as Commissioner of the \nVermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation, instituting \npolicies which today are a model of environmental protection. She then \nbrought her passion and extensive knowledge of the natural world to \nWashington to head the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I was astounded by the natural beauty of this area and proud as I \nreflected back on Mollie's contribution and dedication to preserving \nwildlife and wildlife habitat. I could not think of a better tribute \nthan to have named the eight million acres of wilderness in the Arctic \nRefuge after Mollie. It's been three years since she passed away and we \nmiss her dearly. Although I can no longer work by her side in common \ncause, her spirit and enthusiasm for preserving our nation's wildlife \nis always with me.\n  While in Alaska I also visited a number of native communities along \nthe North Slope and spoke to the inhabitants about their life in this \nunique environment, one that they depend on for both their cultural \nidentity and their survival. I understand the needs these people have \nand they must be addressed.\n  As a nation we must continue to protect this vital ecosystem while \nworking to bring good jobs, education, and health care to these native \ncommunities. Our nation's dependence on oil and its byproducts cannot \novershadow the importance of keeping ANWR free from the traditional \nimpacts of oil drilling and exploration. Drilling and exploration in \nthis gentle Arctic wilderness could have a lasting impact that would \nforever damage the environment of this region.\n  I applaud Senator Roth's commitment to permanent protection for this \nunique linkage of ecosystems upon which local communities depend, and \nthe American community as a whole should value as a national and \nnatural treasure.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few minutes to \ncomment about the status of the Medicare program and the more immediate \nissue of adding outpatient prescription drugs as a covered benefit.\n  First of all, I think we can be pleased with the news from the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Board of Trustees on March 31 regarding the \nfinancial status of the Medicare program. The Trustees' annual reports \non the financial status of Medicare and Social Security were, indeed, \nencouraging to the nearly 84 million Americans who rely on these two \ncritically important entitlement programs.\n  The news for the Medicare program was especially good. The Trustees' \nreported that Medicare's Part A Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which \npays for inpatient hospital expenses, is projected to remain solvent \nuntil the year 2023. Last year, the Trustees' reported the Part A Trust \nFund would remain solvent until 2015. Thus, we have gained an \nadditional eight years of solvency under the projections recently \nissued by the Trustees' report.\n  This is very welcome news. But we must recognize that the fiscal \nsoundness of the Medicare program cannot be attributed to the \nunderlying health of Medicare itself. Medicare's projected bankruptcy \nhas been extended eight years to 2023 because of the strong economy, \nand not because of the overall health of the Medicare program.\n\n[[Page S2428]]\n\n  As one witness before the Finance Committee testified last year, if \nthere is as much as a hiccup in the economy, that could translate into \nlowering the solvency date by as much as five to ten years. Medicare is \nnot solvent indefinitely.\n  In fact, beginning in 2010, the Part A Trust Fund will begin deficit \nspending taking in fewer dollars than it spends until 2023 when it is \nprojected to be bankrupt. That is why Medicare reform is needed, and \nwhy it is needed now.\n  The Finance Committee, on which I serve, is currently considering \nseveral proposals that, in addition to reforming Medicare, would also \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with a drug benefit. There is not one \nmember I am aware of on the committee who is opposed to adding \nprescription drugs as a Medicare benefit. And, I doubt there are many, \nif any, members in the Senate or House who do not believe prescription \ndrugs should be added as a covered benefit.\n  Prescription drugs are as much a part of modern medicine as is any \ncomponent of health care. In fact, drug therapy has often provided a \nsuccessful alternative to more extensive and expensive medical \ninterventions. To preclude prescription drugs from Medicare's benefit \npackage today is tantamount to precluding hospital care back in 1965 \nwhen the Medicare program was enacted.\n  Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle want to cast \nRepublicans as the barrier to a new drug benefit. That could not be \nfarther from the truth. In fact, I was one of the three sponsors of \nlegislation in 1997 along with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth, and the Ranking Minority Member, Senator Moynihan, that \ncreated the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare \nReform.\n  That Commission held great promise to identify and forge a bipartisan \nproposal to reform Medicare, including the development of a drug \nbenefit. But, by just one vote--which was cast by the President's own \ncommission appointee--the nearly two years of work by the seventeen \nmember commission failed to receive the necessary super majority vote \nto formally report recommendations to Congress.\n  In fact, all of the President's appointees voted against the \ncommission's recommendations. As a result, the commission was unable to \nformally recommend to Congress a strong bipartisan proposal that would \nclearly have helped provide the impetuous toward reforming Medicare and \nproviding a drug benefit.\n  The issue now before the Finance Committee is not so much should we \nhave a prescription drug benefit, but rather how a benefit would be \nstructured and how much a benefit would cost the Medicare program. \nThese are very real and complicated issues that will clearly need to be \nfully vented and addressed before any legislation can move forward.\n  For example, one of the key issues which will need to be addressed, \nbut on which there has been little discussion, is who will administer \nor manage the new drug benefit? This is not an insignificant decision, \nMr. President.\n  Under the President's program, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, along with pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, would be \nresponsible for administering the drug benefit. Another proposal by \nSenator Breaux and Senator Frist--who I would add is the only physician \nthat serves in the Senate--would create a new Medicare Board to be the \nadministering entity.\n  Now, I don't mean to be too critical of my friends at HCFA, but I do \nbelieve that involving the Health Care Financing Administration in the \nmanagement of the drug benefit is not the prudent course of action.\n  Moreover, HCFA has been besieged by complaints from providers over \nreimbursement policies and practices. Although, in all fairness to \nHCFA, it is not totally at fault. There are clearly management issues \ninvolving third-party fiscal intermediaries, or the insurance carriers, \nwhich actually administer the reimbursement component of the Medicare \nprogram.\n  I do not think the current structure is a good model on which to base \na new drug benefit. It seems to me we need to fix the current structure \nunder which HCFA and the fiscal intermediaries operate before we add-on \na whole new layer of responsibility which, in many respects, will be \none of the costliest benefits Medicare beneficiaries receive.\n  I believe we can fix the current administrative structure. There are \nmany good people at HCFA, including the administrator and the deputy \nadministrator, who are committed to improving program integrity and \naccountability by the carriers. But I simply do not believe that the \nkind of significant administrative reforms necessary to make the \nPresident's proposal work can be approved by Congress and implemented \nin time to make a drug benefit available within the foreseeable future.\n  A new Medicare Board as proposed under the Breaux/Frist legislation \nmakes inherently greater sense in the overall scheme of providing a \ndrug benefit. The proposal is modeled on the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program which has successfully served federal employees, \nincluding the President of the United States and each member of the \nU.S. Congress, for over 40 years. Moreover, the proposal promotes \nchoice by allowing seniors a voluntary option to either stay in the \ncurrent, traditional Medicare fee-for-service system, as run by HCFA, \nor enroll in a private plan, as run by the Medicare Board. Both options \nwould offer prescription drugs.\n  This is just one example of the numerous logistical and structural \nissues that must be addressed before a drug benefit can be implemented. \nEven under the Breaux/Frist proposal, there will need to be \nconsiderable lead time to get the Medicare Board up and running, and \nfully functional. So I am very pleased the Budget Committee has \nreported a budget resolution which provides $40 billion over five years \nfor this purpose. This is certainly an important first step.\n  The Finance Committee is now currently considering all options under \nthe very able leadership of our Chairman, Senator Roth. I would only \nreiterate the importance of fully addressing the critical management \nand administrative issues because they clearly will be instrumental in \nthe success of any new drug benefit Congress enacts. Once again, the \nprovisions in the Budget Resolution represent an important first step \nin moving forward.\n  But there remains a great deal of work on the details and little time \nin which to address them. Our work will have to be bipartisan and it \nwill require the support and leadership of President Clinton. \nOtherwise, we jeopardize the very real prospect of a drug benefit this \nyear.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues on the Finance Committee \nin the development of a drug proposal that meets the needs of Medicare \nbeneficiaries while preserving the underlying financial integrity of \nthe Medicare program.\n  We owe it to our seniors, and to those with disabilities, to do this \nthe right way.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to clarify the intent of a \nSense of the Senate amendment we passed earlier today regarding the \nCensus. That amendment, which we passed unanimously, expressed the \nsense of the Senate that Americans should not be prosecuted, fined or \nharassed for not answering certain Census questions. At the same time, \nthe amendment expresses our encouragement that all Americans should \nfill out and send back their Census forms.\n  I want to emphasize that there has not been a prosecution for failing \nto fill out the Census in decades. The American people should not fear \nthe Census; we should fear an incomplete or inaccurate count due to \nlack of participation. The Constitution requires an enumeration of our \npopulation every 10 years. While the data the Census Bureau collects \nare used for purposes of apportionment of the House and redistricting, \nthis information is also used to help determine funding for thousands \nof Federal, state and local programs that benefit all Americans. \nMoreover, the law requires Census forms to be kept confidential for 72 \nyears--not only from the public but from all other government agencies.\n  We should support the Census Bureau in its effort to carry out this \nmassive task. I encourage every resident to fill out and send back his \nor her census form and to cooperate with census-takers or enumerators \nwho will be in the neighborhoods in the coming weeks. I also want to \nmake clear that the amendment is not intended to impede\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\ncensus-takers or enumerators in appropriate followup actions they may \nneed to undertake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is on adoption \nof the concurrent resolution, as amended.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Con. Res. 290), as amended, was agreed \nto.\n  (The concurrent resolution will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss briefly the Fiscal Year 2001 Budget Resolution that was passed \nby the Senate this afternoon.\n  Regrettably, I was unable to support this budget resolution. I \nbelieve the focus of this resolution was skewed at best. Instead of \ninvesting critical dollars in modernizing our nation's aging schools, \nin providing a comprehensive prescription drug benefit for seniors, in \nprotecting our natural environment, or in reducing our national debt, \nthis resolution chose as its priority a set of risky and irresponsible \ntax cuts that our country cannot afford.\n  There are several reasons I feel compelled to oppose the resolution. \nFirst, this budget resolution calls for at least $150 billion in tax \ncuts over the next five years to be paid for out of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus. This substantial tax cut will result in increased \ninterest payments of nearly $18 billion dollars. So at a minimum, the \ntax provisions within the resolution have a real cost of $168 billion.\n  The CBO has estimated that the on-budget surplus for the next five \nyears will be $171 billion. The math here is simple, Mr. President. The \ntax cuts consume nearly 98 percent, at a minimum, of the projected on-\nbudget surplus and leave nothing for other crucial investments.\n  If these tax cuts reach $200 billion over five years--as they well \nmay--then they will exceed the on-budget surplus and eat into current \nprograms. There are only so many places to turn to for funding once the \non-budget surplus has been drained. One is the Social Security \nsurplus--a surplus we have committed to keeping off-limits to new \nspending or tax relief measures. Are our colleagues going to break that \ncommitment to pay for their tax cuts? I would hope not. Another is to \nsharply cut spending for priorities such as education and law \nenforcement. That option is also highly troubling.\n  Mr. President, I represent a state that has the highest per capita \nincome in the country. And on a per capita basis, my constituents would \nstand to benefit a great deal from the tax cuts proposed in this \nresolution. However, in my travels across Connecticut, not one of my \nconstituents has ask me to support the tax breaks in this resolution. \nOn the contrary, they have urged that the surplus be dedicated to \nlowering the debt, to strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and \nto improving the quality of education for America's schoolchildren.\n  Second, this resolution chips away at our fiscal discipline. By only \ncovering the next five years as opposed to the ten in last year's \nresolution, the exploding costs of the tax cuts in later years remain \nhidden. Furthermore, this tactic prevents any meaningful enforcement \nmechanisms that would serve to control these run-away costs. After all \nthe progress we have made over the past seven years in eliminating the \nbudget deficits, this resolution would take us back to those grim days \nof runaway deficits.\n  Third, I am also troubled by the deep cuts in discretionary spending \nproposed in this resolution. The use of the on-budget surplus for tax \ncuts would require that non-defense discretionary priorities be cut by \nnearly $105 billion, or 6.5 percent, over the next five years.\n  These cuts would therefore cause 62,000 fewer students would be \nserved by Head Start. Twenty-thousand new teachers could not be hired \nwhich would severely impede efforts to reduce class size. Significant \ncuts in new housing vouchers would threaten millions of low-income \nfamilies in tenuous living situations. Funding for the COPS Program \nwould be cut by 73 percent, making it impossible to meet the \nPresident's goal of hiring up to 150,000 new police officers. And \nfunding for the National Science Foundation would be cut by $500 \nmillion, preventing the training of 19,100 researchers and educators \nneeded to address our high-skilled worker shortage. Mr. President, \nthese are just some of the consequences of the risky tax scheme that is \nthe centerpiece of the resolution.\n\n  The resolution offered by my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle ignored these critical priorities, and when offered the chance to \naddress these important issues, they repeatedly failed to make a bad \nresolution better. Moreover, I was discouraged that\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\nDemocratic amendments were defeated to improve the resolution and \nredirect its priorities away from risky tax breaks and toward important \ncommitments like debt reduction, Medicare and education.\n  One such amendment, offered by Senators Kennedy and Bingaman, would \nhave bolstered our investment in education by $31.7 billion over the \nnext five years. It increased funding for the GEAR UP program, expanded \nafter-school opportunities for children, and provided $2 billion to \nrecruit and mentor qualified teachers.\n  Senator Robb offered an amendment, also defeated, that would have \nrequired that the surplus be spent on a prescription drug benefit \nbefore those funds could be used for a tax cut.\n  The Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, Senator Lautenberg, \noffered a Democratic alternative resolution that would have reduced the \ndebt by $330 billion while providing almost $300 billion in targeted \ntax cuts. The amendment fully funded education and defense and reserved \nfunding for important initiatives such as health coverage for the \nuninsured. Regrettably, it was defeated on a party-line vote.\n  Our Republican colleagues also failed to support a bipartisan \namendment that I was proud to offer with Senator Jeffords. It would \nhave reduced the size of the resolution's tax cut and directed \nresources to help families, schools, and local taxpayers bear the \nrising cost of special education. The National Governor's Association \ncalls special education their highest priority. Unfortunately, the \nSenate ignored their request for federal assistance.\n  Senator Voinovich offered an amendment that directed the $150 billion \nslated for tax cuts toward debt reduction. His proposal would have \nhelped ensure that future generations have the ability and resources to \nmake their own investments without also having to pay our bills. This \namendment drew support from both sides of the aisle, but this, too, was \ndefeated. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has stated on \nnumerous occasions, and even recently before Senate committees, that \ndebt reduction should be our number one priority. I regret that my \ncolleagues chose to ignore his recommendation to instead support tax \nbreaks over placing our country on sound financial footing.\n  In short, Mr. President, this resolution jeopardizes the prosperity \nthat so many have worked so hard to achieve. It mortgages our \nchildren's future, rather than helps them prepare for it. I regret that \nthe Senate could not fashion a resolution that protects our values and \nadvances our priorities--debt reduction, Social Security, Medicare, and \na better education for America's schoolchildren.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, does the minority leader wish to speak?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Yes, briefly. I appreciate that very much.\n  I compliment the distinguished chairman for his work. This is not \neasy. While we may have ended up at different places at the end of the \nresolution, I admire him for the work he has done and applaud him for \nthe way he did it.\n  Let me also thank and congratulate our ranking member, Senator \nLautenberg. This is the last time he will manage a budget. He has been \nan outstanding member of the Senate Budget Committee. I consider \nSenator Lautenberg a close personal friend. I have admired his work not \nonly on this committee but all of the work he does on appropriations \nand other issues he cares about.\n  Let me also thank our assistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid. He \nis the best. We could not have come to this point in the debate and \nconcluded this afternoon were it not for his work as well. A lot of \nwork has gone into the completion of the budget resolution. We are very \nfortunate to have the leadership and the extraordinary work done by our \nchair and our ranking member.\n  I wanted to take a moment to thank them both.\n  I want to thank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle for \njoining us in saying that the long delay over reasonable gun-safety \nmeasures must end. The Juvenile Justice conference committee must send \nus its report--with the Senate-passed gun safety measures included--no \nlater than the first anniversary of the Columbine tragedy, so we can \nvote on those measures.\n  I also want to congratulate my Republican colleagues on another \naccomplishment. The law says Congress must pass a budget resolution by \nApril 15. By passing this resolution today, you are well on your way to \nmeeting that deadline. Considering the difficulty you have had doing \nthat in the past, passing the calendar test is no mean feat.\n  On every other test that matters, however, this budget resolution--\nyour budget resolution--fails. This budget resolution does not continue \nthe fiscal discipline that is at the heart of today's unprecedented \neconomic prosperity. This budget resolution does not reflect the \npriorities of ordinary Americans. This budget resolution does not use \nhonest numbers. This budget resolution does not give priority to paying \ndown our national debt; in fact, if it were to become law, it would \nalmost certainly risk a return to the days where we relied on the \nSocial Security surplus to fund the rest of the government.\n  Despite all the assurances to the contrary, this budget resolution \ndoes not extend the solvency of Social Security or Medicare. This \nbudget resolution does not guarantee a real Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. This budget resolution does not allow us to increase our \ninvestments in education, the environment, or any other critical \nnational priority; in fact, if it were to pass, this budget resolution \nwould force deep cuts--of up to 12 percent--in many of these \npriorities.\n  So, this budget resolution passes the first test. It meets the \ncalendar deadline. But it fails all the tests that really matter.\n  It's worth reviewing what we tried to do this week.\n  First, Senator Robb offered an amendment that said simply: Before we \npass a huge tax cut, we ought to add an affordable, voluntary \nprescription drug benefit to Medicare. An overwhelming majority of \nAmericans agree with that statement. A majority of this Senate also \nagrees with it. Unfortunately, we were not able to clear the 60-vote \nhurdle erected by those who oppose it. So this budget resolution now \nputs tax cuts ahead of prescription drugs.\n  Senator Bingaman offered an amendment to reduce the Republican tax \ncut by $28 billion and use that money to improve America's public \nschools. We would have reduced the $150 billion Republican tax cut by \nless than 20 percent. And we would have used that money to do things \nlike reduce class size, improve teacher training, and help students pay \nfor college. That amendment, too, was defeated--largely along party \nlines.\n  Senator Conrad offered an amendment to reduce the Republican tax cut \nby $75 billion, and use that money to pay down the federal debt. This \nRepublican budget allows for $150 billion--or more--in tax cuts, but \nonly $19 billion in deficit reduction. We could have done better. \nInstead of a paltry down payment on the debt, we could have made a \nsignificant down payment. That amendment also was defeated.\n  Senator Robb offered a second school-related amendment--a plan to \nreduce the Republican tax cut by nearly $6 billion, and use that money \ninstead to modernize our children's public schools. To repair schools \nthat are in disrepair, replace schools that are too crowded, and make \nsure every school is connected to the Internet. Despite all of the talk \nwe hear about the importance of education, that amendment, too, was \ndefeated.\n  Senators Schumer and Durbin offered an amendment to reduce the \nRepublican tax cut by $284 million and use that money to hire 1,000 new \nlocal, state and federal law enforcement officers--to ensure better \nenforcement of existing gun laws. Given all the talk we've heard \nrecently on the need to enforce gun laws, you would have thought that \namendment would pass 100-0. Instead, it was rejected.\n  Finally, Senator Durbin offered as an amendment the Bush tax cut, the \nsame tax cut so many of our Republican colleagues have implicitly--and \nin some cases explicitly--endorsed. Four times previously--once in the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, once in the House Rules Committee, and \ntwice in the Senate Budget Committee, our Republican colleagues were \nasked to vote up or down on the Bush tax cut. Every time, they used \nsome parliamentary\n\n[[Page S2431]]\n\nprocedure to duck the vote. To borrow a phrase used by our old friend \nDale Bumpers and resurrected by our colleague Dick Durbin, they ran \nfrom the Bush tax cut like the devil runs from holy water. They tried \nto duck the vote again on the Senate floor during this debate. But they \nwere unable to do so.\n  So what did our Republican colleagues do when they were finally \nforced to take a stand on the Bush tax cut? Every single Republican \nSenator rejected the Bush tax cut. This Senate voted 99-0 vote to table \nthe plan.\n  The vote against the Bush tax cut was probably the most significant \nof all the votes we cast on this budget resolution--because tax policy \nisn't just the centerpiece of the Bush candidacy. Tax policy is the \ncenterpiece of any economic and fiscal program.\n  By repeatedly refusing to support the Bush tax plan, our Republican \ncolleagues have sent a very clear message. That message is: They know \nthe Bush tax cut will not work. They know we cannot afford the Bush tax \ncut. They know that, in order to pay for the Bush tax cut, we will have \nto raid Social Security, and cut critical programs deeply, and hurt \nworking families.\n  So, we are now about to vote on a budget that would end this economic \nexpansion by abdicating the fiscal discipline that has produced and \nnurtured it. A budget that blows the entire non-Social Security surplus \non risky, exploding tax cuts--leaving virtually nothing for Medicare, \nor prescription drugs. Nothing for debt reduction. And nothing for \nincreased investment in education, law enforcement, the environment and \nother urgent, national priorities.\n  If this budget were to become law, there are only three ways we could \npay for those tax cuts and still make essential investments in \neducation and other priorities: We could make massive cuts in the rest \nof the budget. We could raid Social Security. Or, we could drive up the \ndeficit, and the debt. At a time when we could have so many good \nchoices before us, it is astounding that this budget presents us only \nwith bad choices.\n  The next step is for our colleagues to reconcile their budget with \nthe plan passed by House Republicans--a plan that contains even bigger \ntax cuts, and even deeper budget cuts in key priorities. I have no \ndoubt they will reconcile their plans. And this budget will go from bad \nto worse. The real test, though, is not in reconciling the House plan \nand the Senate plan. The real test is in trying to reconcile either \nplan with reality. Frankly, there is no way they can meet that test. \nThe numbers simply do not add up.\n  Our colleagues did everything they could this week to limit debate on \ntheir plan. Right out of the box, they yielded back over 20 hours of \ndebate time on their budget. That's how determined they were to limit \ndebate on their plan. That's how desperate they were to avoid any \ndiscussion of their priorities, versus our priorities, and the \npriorities of the American people.\n  I would remind our friends across the aisle, though, that this debate \nhas only begun. We have months to go before this budget is finished. We \nwill raise these issues again and again and again so that every \nAmerican knows the choices facing our nation, and the consequences of \nthose choices. We will make the improvements in this budget that we \nsought to make this week, or the proposals contained in this budget \nwill not become law.\n  So I say again to our colleagues across the aisle, congratulations on \nmeeting this first test of your budget. We look forward to working with \nyou in coming months to produce a budget that passes the tests that \ntruly matter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There are a lot of people I am certain I should thank, \nbut I think they all know how much I appreciate their efforts--the \nmajority staff, the minority staff--and hard work and long hours on a \ndifficult product with very difficult procedures.\n  I hope before too long we will find a way to have these procedures \nstreamlined so it is not so difficult and it is easier to understand \nand so we are not burdened by scores upon scores of sense-of-the-Senate \nresolutions when we are talking about numbers in a basic budget.\n  I thank by name Senator Lautenberg, who will not be here when we do a \nbudget resolution in the future because he will be leaving the Senate. \nI thank him again for the way he conducts himself and the way he asks \nhis staff to conduct themselves in relationship to the majority and in \nrelationship to his duties.\n  I believe this was a pretty rare achievement, a very hard budget, \nwith very different philosophical and ideological points of view. I \nthink we accomplished on our side what we wanted to do. It does not \ntake a long explanation.\n  We did protect Social Security. We did strengthen Medicare by putting \n$40 billion in a reserve fund for Medicare, including prescription \ndrugs. We reduced the national debt substantially. We provided some tax \nfairness for the American people. For those who are very worried about \nputting enough money toward the national debt, this will be the largest \ninstallment against the national debt in the history of the Republic; \n$177 billion will go to the debt. Most of that is by not using the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  I am very grateful it has finally come to pass that the ideal which I \nconceived immediately after the President suggested 62 percent of \nSocial Security should be saved, and I said why not 100 percent, looks \nas if it is going to come to pass. We are locking up 100 percent of the \nSocial Security trust fund. That means there will not be big swings in \nexpenditures in our Government, there will not be huge swings in tax \nreform, because we are setting aside for the senior citizens what is \ntheirs and not spending a nickel of it.\n  Overall, this is a good budget for this year. We are in a \nPresidential election, and somebody next year, a new President, will \ntell us what changes they want. If it is a President of the Republican \nParty and his name is Bush, he will recommend a brand-new budget that \nwill be very different, in which case the tax reform we seek and the \ntax relief we seek will be part of his budget. He did not seek any tax \nrelief until 1 full year from now, so that it would be time for him to \nbe in office and work on things.\n  Having said that, let me close saying to all the Senators who worked \nwith Senator Lautenberg, Senator Reid of Nevada, myself, and our \nrespective staffs to get on that long list of agreed-upon amendments, \nsome Members have hard feelings tonight because they agreed and worked \nwith us; having done that, Members did not get an opportunity to offer \ntheir amendments.\n  I don't think we had any other way to do it tonight. We would not \nhave finished this budget resolution for a very long time had the \nmajority leader not suggested the regular order following the objection \nof Senator Byrd to our agreed-upon list.\n  My last praise goes to Senator Reid, the minority whip, for spending \na lot of time on the floor on every bill. He was tremendously helpful \nand instrumental in getting the Senate where we are.\n\n  Obviously, on my side, I thank the majority leader for helping get \nthe budget resolution completed and all the others who helped. A hearty \nthanks from this Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before Senator Domenici leaves the \nfloor, I wish to thank him.\n  I know the public may wonder why it is that Democrats all voted one \nway yet we say a consensus has been arrived at. I will take a minute to \nexplain it.\n  Yes, the Democrats voted against this budget resolution. It wasn't so \nmuch on the issues we wanted to have taken care of. It is fair to say, \nif one listened to the debate, one could determine that each side wants \nto protect Social Security in different degrees and in different ways. \nOne could observe we both want to do something about Medicare but, once \nagain, in different degrees and in different ways. The list goes on.\n  There are many things on which we purely disagree. But the fact is, \nthough I am disappointed in the outcome and I prefer the budget \nresolution to be done differently, I cannot say there weren't times \nwhen we agreed we wanted to get to point A, B, or C on things that \naffect the public generally.\n  We agreed on strengthening defense. We agreed on taking better care \nof our\n\n[[Page S2432]]\n\nveterans. We agreed on raising the minimum wage against the objections \nof most of our friends on the other side.\n  The budget is passed. It is a consensus in a peculiar way. It is not \na consensus arrived at necessarily by Democrats and Republicans, but \nhere I have to commend Senator Domenici. He has a rare touch. He knows \nhis business. He understands the budget thoroughly. There isn't anybody \nI know here who would say he isn't a good, decent guy.\n  He deals with the differences of view that perhaps are the result of \nbeing in the majority. People want to make sure their views are taken \ncare of.\n\n  The minority finds it a little easier to unite, perhaps, because we \nunite behind issues we think are important, that we realize will not be \ntypically dealt with in the fashion we would like. We are not in the \nmajority.\n  By structure of the branches of Government, we have a President. The \nPresident can only lay down his recommendations; he cannot necessarily \nget them through. There is no veto right in this process. So it makes \nit a different structure.\n  The public may be scratching their heads as they look at this and \nsaying: What do they agree on? Senator Domenici said something that is \nso true: much of what we did will not have ultimately the effect of \nbecoming law. Why did we do it? We did it because each Member of this \nbody has a right to express themselves about issues. We are concerned \nabout the relevance of a lot of the resolutions that were presented.\n  I hope we will do something about organizing the process, though I \nwill not be here to do it, for the public interest. Before this budget \nresolution has the effect of turning into appropriations bills that \nwill fund these programs, there is a fairly long way to go. For me, it \nis the last time I will have a role in passing a budget resolution. I \narrive at this point with some wistfulness and anticipation that in \nyears ahead I will be arriving at this time of the year with a degree \nof nostalgia.\n  It is hard to imagine one could miss this kind of exercise after \nwitnessing the process we just completed. But I must confess, the \nchallenge of arriving at the resolution, as I see it, produces a debate \nthat does raise a conscientious review of the issues, even though we \ndisagree on the paths to get to places we want to be. But each of us, \nagain, has the right to express himself or herself as this process \nevolves.\n  I am certain the public views some of the antics we have gone through \nhere as curious, to say the least. We heard Senator Byrd, the \ndistinguished Senator Byrd, the historian of the Senate among Members, \nsay he was disappointed in some things. I hope, therefore, a review of \nthe process will take place so we can have a more concise, more orderly \nprogram for getting to a budget resolution.\n  In the process, however, of this year 2001 budget resolution, I have \nto say thank you to Senator Domenici, to his chief of staff, now loaded \ndown with the product of his work, Bill Hoagland. I thank Bill, who \nworked arduously to make sure we had the information we needed, even \nthough we disagreed on some of the process to get to the end of the \ngame.\n  I am grateful to Harry Reid, the Democratic whip, for the role he \nplayed in getting this year's budget resolution passed. He was part of \na support team for me and left me with time to do some of the things \nfor which I am responsible. He did a wonderful job as a friend and as a \nleader on the Democratic side, helping us get done.\n  I thank Leader Daschle for his faith and support of me throughout the \nbudget resolution negotiations.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Budget Committee, the Republicans, but I \nam particularly obliged to my Democratic friends and colleagues because \nof the unity we had through the process.\n  I cannot conclude my remarks without saying the staff support was \nreally special.\n  No. 1 on my team is Bruce King, who is the chief of staff of the \nBudget Committee, the Democratic staff on the Budget Committee. Sue \nNelson is an expert on so many areas, particularly in the health area, \non whom lots of the Senators called; Lisa Konwinski and Mitch Warren, \nwho used to work on my personal staff as well; Marty Morris, Nisha \nAntony, Claudia Arko, Frederic Baron, Gabrielle Batkin, Steve Benson, \nMaggie Bierwirth, Pat Bogenberger, Rok Chung, and Jim Esquea.\n  I want to thank Randy DeValk, who is part of Senator Daschle's team, \nthe person who works on budget for Senator Daschle. He was very helpful \nthroughout.\n  I thank our floor staff. They were diligent and always there for \ninformation and for support, defining the process so we did not step on \ntoo many toes. I think I might have stepped on a couple along the way, \nbut it was not cataclysmic. The process takes a long time to learn. \nSenator Domenici has been doing it for a long time. He is one of the \nbest experts we have.\n  So I thank everyone for their work, some of our Republican friends \nwho voted with us on occasion, and even those Senators with whom I had \ndisagreements on occasion.\n  I want to say--maybe as part of a swan song because come next January \nI will be doing other things--that even those with whom I most ardently \ndisagreed still earned my respect as Senators, though I could \nvehemently disagree with their point of view. These are people who are \nsent here by a constituency we have to recognize. The majority is what \nit is because the American people sent them here to be a majority. I \nwish it were otherwise, make no mistake about that. I wish we were in \nthe majority and I had my last year as chairman of the committee. But \nnext best to the chairman on the other side is to be the ranking member \nand work with a good and decent manager.\n\n  With that, I say, this is a conclusion of part No. 1 of Frank \nLautenberg's retirement from the Senate, an experience which I shall \ntreasure and remember fondly, forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me acknowledge the remarks of the \nSenator from New Jersey. I suspect this time next year the Senator from \nNew Jersey will be looking fondly at us from the ski slopes of Utah, \nwishing us well but being very happy with his fondness for skiing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2432-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2432-S2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 INSTITUTING A FEDERAL FUEL TAX HOLIDAY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nonce again remind my colleagues of the very precarious financial \ncondition of the entire Social Security system and the urgent need for \na serious, bipartisan effort to reform and revitalize this cornerstone \nof many Americans' retirement planning.\n  The only way to achieve real reform of the Social Security system is \nto work together in a bipartisan manner. It's time to abandon the \nirresponsible game of playing partisan politics with Social Security. \nDemocrats will have to stop using the issue to scare seniors into \nvoting against Republicans. Republicans will have to resist using \nSocial Security revenues to finance tax cuts. And both parties must \nstop raiding the Trust Funds to waste retirement dollars on more \ngovernment spending. We must face up to our responsibilities, not as \nRepublicans or Democrats, but as elected representatives of the \nAmerican people with a common obligation to protect their interests.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that Social Security benefits are \npaid as promised, without putting an unfair burden on today's workers.\n  We also have an obligation to talk straight with working Americans \nabout the true financial status of the Social Security program. This \nmeans providing each worker with honest information about the financial \nstatus of the Social Security program including the real value of their \npersonal retirement benefits.\n  Under the current system, hard working Americans--young and old--are \nnot receiving straight, honest information regarding the actual \nfinancial status of the Social Security program including how much it \nis receiving in payroll taxes and how much is needed to give promised \nbenefits to seniors. This includes clearly telling Americans exactly \nwhen the program will no longer have sufficient funds for paying full \nbenefits.\n  Furthermore, we must begin providing working Americans with accurate, \neasy to understand information regarding the average rate of return \nthey can expect to receive from Social Security as compared to the \namount of taxes an individual pays into the program. It is only fair to \nbe straight with everyone and let them know the true facts about how \nmuch they will pay in payroll taxes and what the limited return will be \non their contributions.\n  It is time for us to talk straight to Americans about Social Security \nand begin working together in a bipartisan fashion to make the \nnecessary changes to strengthen and save the nation's retirement \nprogram for the seniors of today and tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2433-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2433-S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on March 18th the people of Taiwan elected \nDemocratic Progressive Party (DPP) leaders Chen Shui-bian, former mayor \nof Taipei, to be President, and Annette Lu to be Vice-President of \nTaiwan.\n  This was an historic vote, representing the first recorded, peaceful \ntransfer of power in any Chinese political system in 5,000 years. A \nfree and fair vote by 80 percent of the electorate occurred without \nviolence with a military that remained in the barracks.\n  It was a vote with implications not only for the people on Taiwan but \nalso for China and the United States.\n  First, the vote represented a rejection by a majority of the voters \nof the traditional ruling Kuomintang Party (KMT) and a vote in favor of \npolitical reform and change in Taiwan. There was a clear desire by the \npeople to cleanse the political system that they viewed as corrupt. \nThat the DPP could win a national election after having only been \nformed in 1986 indicates the maturity of the political system, as well \nas the deep desire for change.\n  The first steps by President-elect Chen Shui-bian indicate the \npolitical sophistication of Taiwan's future leaders. He made \nconciliatory statements towards China, stating that he would avoid \ndeclaring independence and emphasizing that ``the people's top priority \nis peaceful cross-strait relations'' while declaring his willingness to \n``negotiate cross-strait air travel, trade and investment, peace \nagreements, and military conference-building measures with the \nmainland.'' He has offered to meet with China's leaders, even to travel \nto Beijing. His party is now considering dropping its pro-independence \npolicy in its party platform.\n  He has nominated the current Kuomintang Defense Minister, Tang Fei, \nto be his Premier. General Tang was born in China. And in another step \ntowards reform both major parties have reached an agreement to reduce \nthe powers of the National Assembly and to strengthen those of the \nLegislative Yuan, the nation's parliament.\n  The breath of fresh air blowing through Taiwan has not been matched \nin Beijing. In the run-up to the election the only wind out of China \nwas the fierce breath of threats. Central Military Commission Vice-\nChairman General Zhang and Vice Premier Qian Qichen both declared that \n``Taiwan independence means war.'' A People's Liberation Army \npublication stated that ``the PLA is determined to liberate Taiwan. If \nthey meet hard resistance, then they can choose to use weapons of mass \ndestruction, like neutron bombs.''\n  Since the election, there has been some diminishment of the intensity \nof the attacks but Beijing remains consistent in its criticism and \ninsistence on Taiwanese concessions. Last week, at a conference on \nTaiwan in Washington organized by the Center for Strategic and \nInternational Studies, PLA Senior Colonel Luo Yuan observed that ``if \nyou no longer acknowledge you are Chinese and sell off Chinese national \ninterests, the Chinese government will definitely punish this national \ntraitor. [. . .] Once the Taiwan independence provokes an impasse, then \nwe have no choice but the use of blood to uphold the authority.'' \nChina's official Xinhua News Agency has commented that ``Lee Teng-hui's \nignominious fate proves that all those who engage in `Taiwan \nindependence' and splittism and try resorting to trickery to hoodwink \nthe world will come to no good end. The wages of sin is death.'' Vice \nPremier Qian has insisted that there can be no negotiations with Chen \nor his envoys unless he accepts the principle that Taiwan is part of \nChina and commits to negotiating only over the modalities of \nreunification.\n  The quandary China finds itself now in is typified by the Beijing \nwaiter, quoted in a recent Washington Post article, who commented as he \nwatched news of the Taiwan elections, ``their lives are better than \nours, economically and politically. They have more freedom. They can \nelect their leaders.''\n  One of the first actions by the Taiwanese political parties was to \nreform its political structure by reducing the role of the National \nAssembly sending another powerful signal to the Mainland where its \nhand-picked, 2,978 strong, National People's Congress delegate just met \nfor stage-managed debates.\n  China's leaders have been struggling to earn the degree of legitimacy \nthrough economic reform alone and through the continued use of force to \nsuppress dissent that Taiwan's leaders have earned at the ballot box \nthrough the exercise of free speech and free trade. No longer can \nChina's leaders look across the Straits and see a mirror of themselves \nin Taiwan's former exiled rulers.\n  Instead they see an example of a political system which evolved in a \nfew short years from totalitarian rule to a democracy. Martial law rule \nended in Taiwan in 1987. A new legislature was elected in 1992. There \nwere presidential elections in 1996, local elections in 1997 and 1998, \nand a second presidential election in 2000.\n\n[[Page S2434]]\n\n  China's Deputy Chief of Mission in Washington Liu Xiaoming described \nTaiwan's presidential election as ``a local election in an area of \nChina.'' Yet, even if his description is accepted, it demonstrates how \nfar the rest of China has to go: in China, a germinating democracy has \nnot progressed beyond the stage of local village elections. Municipal \nor national elections have yet to be held.\n  As President Clinton so succinctly observed, ``the election provides \na fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and resolve their \ndifferences through dialogue.''\n  Ironically, it is China, which had urged Taiwan to adopt direct \ntrade, postal, and telecommunications links while Taiwan under \nPresident Lee rejected such direct ties, that now rejects President-\nelect Chen's offers to institute direct contacts.\n  There apparently is the perception even inside China that their \npolicy needs to be changed. One official was quoted over the weekend as \nsaying, ``we are painting ourselves into a corner. We are tough when we \nshould be soft and passive when we should be taking the initiative.''\n  Yet, even as Taiwan has grown apart from China, it has also grown \ncloser. It has invested $24 billion in China and China now accounts for \n23 percent of all Taiwanese exports. Taiwan's and China's economic \nprogress have become mutually self-sustaining.\n  As a result, we should not be painting China into a corner now. As it \nattempts to come to terms with the new realities in Taiwan, we should \nbe taking steps to welcome China into a greater, more responsible role \nin the international system. A critical step in that regard is granting \nChina Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR). This critical vote in \nthe U.S. Congress promises to open up China's markets to greater \ncompetition and more goods from the West. PNTR does not mean that China \nwill be a democracy, nor does it mean instant benefits for the American \neconomy, but it is a step towards integrating China into the new world \ncommunity.\n  Shortly after China joins the World Trade Organization, Taiwan will \njoin. This is the third new reality with which American policymakers \nmust contend. Taiwan has changed. It is not the single-party \ndictatorship which it was when the Taiwan Relations Act or the three \ncommuniques were promulgated. It is a vibrant democracy with a strong \neconomy. It has long clamored to be allowed to play a more active role \nin the world community by providing assistance to international aid \norganizations or in UN Specialized Agencies. Can a new role be found \nfor the Taiwan of today in tomorrow's world? Finding one may well be \nthe key if China and Taiwan are to resolve their differences and \nachieve conciliation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2434-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to add my name as a co-sponsor \nof Senate Bill 1810, ``Veterans Claims and Appeals Procedures \nClarification and Improvement Act.''\n  Recent court decisions have made it more difficult for veterans to \nget their rightful assistance from the Veterans Administration, VA, and \nto develop their claims. This bill will clearly lay out the rules of \nhow the VA will assist veterans with these claims. This bill will \nremove many of the barriers now standing in the way of veterans \ngathering information from many different sources to make their claim \n``well-grounded.''\n  Right now, many veterans who have filed claims with the Department of \nVeterans Affairs must wait for months and, in some cases, even years \nfor the claims to be decided. This creates a hardship on our veterans \nwho have served our country with pride. In my state of Montana, I have \nseen veterans wait five to 10 years for their claim and the necessary \nappeals to make it through this bureaucratic system. Over the past few \nyears, I have seen my veterans' casework increase due to veterans \nhaving problems in obtaining information that the VA previously \nprovided.\n  My President, can you imagine a homeless veteran finding out that \nthey must call this federal agency or write to this private hospital to \nobtain his or her own information for a claim? Often, many veterans \njust give up when they face these many bureaucratic obstacles. They \nfall though the cracks of a system that is fast becoming a legal \nnightmare and a system that was supposed to be there for them when they \ncame home. Why? It is because the Department of Veterans Affairs has \nceased being helpful to the veterans in the development of their \nclaims.\n  We must honor our commitment to our veterans and ensure the VA is \nbeing as helpful as possible to all veterans. This bill will do just \nthat. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and bring an end to the \nnightmare that America's veterans are having with the present system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2434-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

BIFFERATO\n\n Mr. BIDEN. On March 31st, hundreds of people gathered in a \nlobby of the courthouse in Wilmington, Delaware. The focal point of the \ndignified but unassuming room is an information desk, with a big board \nbehind it that's used to post the daily schedule for Delaware's \nSuperior Court. It is, quite literally, where the Court meets the \npublic, and it was the ideal--and perhaps the only--place for this \nparticular occasion, a reception honoring Judge Vincent A. Bifferato as \nhe retired following 32 years on Superior Court, a total of 36 years of \npublic service.\n  ``Biff,'' as Judge Bifferato is universally known outside of the \ncourtroom, is not the type for a country-club send-off. Part of it is \nroots. His father, born in Italy and never having had an education \nhimself, always said he knew his son would go to college, and got to \nsee his son sworn in as a member of the Delaware Bar. Biff remembers \nhis father on that day, sitting in the front row, crying; ``To him,'' \nBiff says, ``it was the American dream.''\n  And Biff knew, as his life since he became a lawyer has proved, that \nthere is a second chapter to any true American dream story. It's the \nchapter written after you get there, the story of what you do with \npower and status once you've got them. And the truth is, it's the part \nof the story that matters most.\n  What Biff has done in his position as a judge is to combine the \nforceful exercise of authority and the vigorous application of the law \nwith an uncommon sense of compassion for and responsibility to the \npeople he was there to serve. He had never forgotten what drew him to \npublic service in the first place--the opportunity to help people who \nneed government, people who need someone on their side in order to have \na chance. And he has never let those of us around him forget it either, \nalways reminding colleagues and students--and anyone else who might \nneed to be reminded--of our particular obligation to the least powerful \nof our fellow citizens.\n  Biff's concern for how people treat each other is, in fact, the \nhallmark of his character. In his courtroom, small-town lawyers from \none-person firms knew they stood on equal footing with heavy-hitters \nfrom the big city. Litigants and witnesses were treated with\n\n[[Page S2435]]\n\nfairness and respect. Decorum and civility were not ideals but \npracticed standards.\n  Biff initiated a monthly forum for lawyers because he saw that solo \npractitioners and young attorneys from small firms were not getting the \nmentoring they needed, and also, as he said, that ``[t]here was a need \nfor people to be nice to each other.'' That effort to promote \nprofessionalism and ethics--one lawyer described it as a ``blue-collar \nInn of Court''--is now called the Judge Bifferato Superior Court Trial \nPractice Forum. And for his leadership in that undertaking and in \ncountless others, formal and informal, Biff received the inaugural \nDistinguished Mentoring Award from the Delaware State Bar Association.\n\n  As Resident Judge for New Castle County, Biff also made it his \nmission to ensure that the courthouse staff was appreciated as it \nshould be. His emphasis was never on hierarchy but always on the common \neffort, never on the power or prestige of his office but on the \ncontribution of each person who helped make the justice system work. It \nwas the Court's staff Biff talked about most at his retirement \nreception, concluding simply, ``I love them all.''\n  ``Love'' is a word heard often in relation to Vincent A. Bifferato. \nIt was striking how often it was used at his retirement. Alongside \nwords more expected at such occasions, like respect and esteem, \n``love'' for Judge Biff was expressed by almost every speaker, \nincluding the Governor, the Mayor and the President Judge of the Court. \nNo amount of ability, no standard of professionalism earns that kind of \naffection; it is, rather, a response to this man's grace of spirit, to \nthe warmth and sincerity he brings to relationships, to the openness of \nhis heart.\n  That heart was on generous loan to the Superior Court and to the \npeople of Delaware, but it belongs, first and always, to Biff's \nfamily--to his wife, Marie, to his children and grandchildren, to his \nsister and to his mother, who was there, sitting in the front row, 37 \nyears after that first swearing-in ceremony. She had always been proud \nof him, she said, long before any of his public accomplishments and \ncontributions, because he was always ``a nice, young boy.''\n  Biff remarked at his send-off that it was ``a hell of a tribute for \njust doing your job.'' But it was, of course, much more a tribute to \nwho he is, a ``nice, young boy'' who made the most of his opportunities \nand then sought relentlessly to open opportunity for others; a leader \nwho not only recognizes but genuinely feels his common humanity with \nthose in need of help; a man who fulfilled and enriched his father's \ndream--for his family and for all of us.\n  Biff will have a successor but never a replacement. As he begins to \nwrite the next chapter of his life, he has our immeasurable thanks and, \nindeed, our love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        QUINCY MINE HOIST ASSOCIATION HONORS MR. BURTON H. BOYUM\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nBurton H. Boyum, who on April 13, 2000, is being honored by the Board \nof Directors of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association. Mr. Boyum is being \nrecognized for his many contributions to the history and preservation \nof the iron and copper mining heritage in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.\n  Mr. Boyum was born in Minnesota in 1919. In 1941, he came to the \nUpper Peninsula, and from that time until his retirement in 1984, he \nserved Cleveland Cliffs International as a Mining Engineer. Mr. Boyum \nis considered the foremost expert on the geology, mineralogy, and \nmining heritage of the Upper Peninsula. He has published two books and \ntwo historical videos on the subject, and has also provided many \nfortunate citizens with free tours of the area.\n  In his time there, Mr. Boyum has been an active member of many groups \nthat help to preserve not only the history, but also the pure natural \nbeauty, of Michigan's Upper Peninsula. What is important to note, I \nbelieve, is not only Mr. Boyum's involvement in these organizations, \nbut his leadership within them. In 1957, he served as Chairman of the \nU.P. Section of the American Institute of Mining Engineers, and worked \nto preserve the World's largest steam hoist. He is the only serving \nmember of the Board of the Quincy Mine Hoist Association who took part \nin its foundation in 1961, and thus has played a pivotal role in making \nthe Association the premier preserved mine site in the State of \nMichigan. He hosted the first Michigan State Historical Society Annual \nMeeting in Marquette. He organized the first Marquette County \nHistorical Society county-wide conference. He led the charge in forming \nthe Michigan Iron Industry Museum; the Marquette Range Iron Mining \nHeritage Theme Park; the National Ski Hall of Fame, located in \nIshpeming, Michigan; and the Great Lakes Olympic Training Center, \nlocated in Marquette, Michigan. And in 1996, under President Boyum's \nleadership, the Quincy Mine Hoist Association built the first Cog \nRailroad in the Midwest.\n  In 1998, due to his incredible efforts for the organization, Mr. \nBoyum was named the Quincy Mine Hoist Association's first Chairman of \nthe Board. He was also recognized in perpetuity by his peers, who \ncreated the Burton H. Boyum Award in his honor. On behalf of the entire \nSenate, I extend a much deserved thank you to Mr. Boyum for all of his \nincredible work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2435-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2435-S2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        KELLOGG-HUBBARD LIBRARY\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Montpelier, Vermont is a very \nspecial city. It is our state's capital, but it is also one with a \ngreat sense of community. Much of that community pride comes from the \nKellogg-Hubbard Library.\n  The happiest memories of my childhood in Montpelier revolve around my \nfamily and the Children's Library in the Kellogg-Hubbard Library.\n  I ask that an article I wrote for our local newspaper, The Times \nArgus, about the Kellogg-Hubbard Library, its children's wing and its \nformer librarian, Mrs. Holbrook, be printed in the Record.\n\n                 [From the Times Argus, June 13, 1996]\n\n            Montpelier Boy Realizes Miss Holbrook Was Right\n\n                           (By Patrick Leahy)\n\n       The 100th anniversary of the Kellogg-Hubbard Library \n     triggers memories for all of us who have lived in Montpelier. \n     And they are great memories.\n       While I was growing up, Montpelier did not have television. \n     We children did not have the advantage of cable TV with 10 \n     channels giving us the opportunity to buy things we didn't \n     need and would never use or another 10 offering blessings or \n     redemptions for an adequate contribution.\n       Deprived as we were, we made do with the Lone Ranger and \n     Inner Sanctum on the radio and Saturday's serials at the \n     Strand Theater on Main Street. For a few minutes on Saturday \n     afternoon, we could watch Hopalong Cassidy, Tarzan, Flash \n     Gordon, Jungle Jim or Batman face death-defying predicaments \n     that would guarantee you would be back the next Saturday, 14 \n     cents in hand, to see how they survived (and I recall they \n     always did).\n       Having exhausted radio, Saturday matinees, the latest comic \n     books (I had a favorite) and childhood games and chores, we \n     were left to our own imagination.\n       That was the best part.\n       We were a generation who let the genies of our imagination \n     out of the bottle by reading. Then, as now, reading was one \n     of my greatest pleasures.\n       My parents had owned the Waterbury Record Weekly newspaper \n     and then started the Leahy Press in Montpelier, which they \n     ran until selling it at their retirement. The Leahy family \n     was at home with the printed word and I learned to read early \n     in life.\n       At 5 years old I went down the stairs of the Kellogg-\n     Hubbard Children's Library, and the years that followed \n     provided some of the most important experiences of my life.\n       In the '40s and '50s, the Kellogg-Hubbard was blessed with \n     a white-haired children's librarian named Miss Holbrook. Her \n     vocation in life had to be to help children read and to make \n     reading enjoyable. She succeeded more than even she might \n     have dreamed.\n       She had the key to unlocking our imagination.\n       With my parents' encouragement, the Kellogg-Hubbard was a \n     regular stop every afternoon as I left school. On any day I \n     had two or three books checked out. My sister Mary, brother \n     John and I read constantly.\n       In my years as U.S. senator, it seems I never traveled so \n     far or experienced so much as I did as a child in Montpelier \n     with daily visits to the library. With Miss Holbrook's \n     encouragement I had read most of Dickens and Robert Louis \n     Stevenson in the early part of grade school.\n       To this day, I remember sitting in our home at 136 State \n     St. reading Treasure Island on a Saturday afternoon filled \n     with summer storms. I knew I heard the tap, tap, tap of the \n     blind man's stick coming down State Street and I remember the \n     great relief of seeing my mother and father returning from \n     visiting my grandparents in South Ryegate.\n\n[[Page S2436]]\n\n       Miss Holbrook was right. A good and an active imagination \n     creates its own reality.\n       In my profession, I read computer messages, briefing \n     papers, constituent letters, legislation and briefings, the \n     Congressional Record--and an occasional book for pleasure--in \n     all, the equivalent of a full-length book each day.\n       Interesting as all this is, and owing much of my life to \n     those earlier experiences at the library, the truest reading \n     pleasure was then. I worry that so many children today miss \n     what our libraries offer.\n       During the past few years I have had many of my photographs \n     published. DC Comics and Warner Brothers have also asked me \n     to write for Batman or do voice-overs on their TV series. In \n     each case, I have asked them to send my payment to the \n     Kellogg-Hubbard Library to buy books for the Children's \n     Library.\n       It is my way of saying: ``Thank you, Miss \n     Holbrook.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2436-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF YMCA HEALTHY KIDS DAY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the YMCA \norganization and Ys across America as they celebrate Healthy Kids Day \nthis April 8.\n  Every year on Healthy Kids Day, Ys focus their attention on children \nas they organize and provide an opportunity for the whole family to \nspend time together while improving their health. Last year, more than \n1,200 YMCAs participated in Healthy Kids Day events. In Minnesota, some \n100 Ys have developed their own activities for this year's Healthy Kids \nDay to serve their local needs. From cookouts to mentoring programs, \nthis Saturday is for the children's benefit as well as their families.\n  Of course, the good work of the nation's YMCAs extends beyond Healthy \nKids Day and into every day of the year. YMCAs promote healthy living \nhabits and provide Americans of all ages with the tools to develop good \ncharacter, empathizing respect and responsibility. Ys are for people of \nall faiths, races, abilities, and incomes. No one is turned away for \ninability to pay, as YMCA is the largest not-for-profit community \nservice organization in America. The strength of America's YMCAs is in \nthe people they bring together.\n  More than half of YMCA members are under the age of 18. Ys involve \nmore than 8 million children in programs to help them build lasting \nhabits of good health, including regular exercise, healthy eating and \navoidance of substance abuse. YMCA volunteers and staff act as role \nmodels for these children to expose them to all facets of life. Local \nYs allow kids to have a place to call their own, and the programs they \ntake part in allow them to develop a community with their peers.\n  Instead of taking a cookie-cutter approach to community service, \nYMCAs adjust their programs to fit the needs of their local \ncommunities. Whether through day camps, the Black Achievers Program, \nswimming lessons, family literacy programs, job training, transitional \nhousing, or any number of other important efforts, the nation's YMCAs \nare reaching out to our communities and offering individualized \nservice.\n  Not merely an American institution, YMCAs stretch around the globe, \nserving more than 30 million people in 120 countries and helping to \nfoster strong kids, families and communities world-wide.\n  Mr. President, this April 8 will build on that impressive record of \nservice. I commend those involved in this year's celebration of YMCA \nHealthy Kids Day for their tireless efforts and wish continued success \nto every YMCA for making a difference in not only a child's life, but \nthe lives of people of all ages.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2436-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO NATIVE HAWAIIAN MASTER ARTIST ROCKY KA'IOLIOKAHIHIKOLO'EHU \n                                 JENSEN\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a Native \nHawaiian Master Artist Rocky Ka'ioliokahihikolo'Ehu Jensen. \nKa'ioliokahihikolo'Ehu, ``The black-hawk-striving-towards-the-source-\nchild-of-the-Ehu,'' is the descendant of High Chief Iwikauikau; \nHawaiian warrior chiefs from the islands of Hawai'i \n(Keli'iwaiho'ikeone); Kaua'i (Kahihikolo); Moloka'i (Keka' alauniu); \nand O'ahu (Ka'io); and Kahuna (Shaman) from Ko'olaupoko, O'ahu (Mamaki) \nand Manoa, O'ahu (Papanu' umealani). Rocky is one of Hawai'i's \nbrightest local talents who has dedicated his life to the perpetuation \nof Hawaiian culture through his powerful artistry. He is recognized by \nour State Foundation on Culture and the Arts as a master sculptor and \nis talented in other media as well.\n  Born in Honolulu on April 8, 1944, Rocky Jensen absorbed cultural \ntraditions from his grandparents with whom he spent his summers. His \nartistic talents were recognized at an early age when he won his first \nart scholarship from the Honolulu Academy of Arts at the age of nine. \nHe was educated in Hawai'i and the mainland where he graduated from \njunior college. This talented artist continued his post-secondary \neducation in Hawai'i and was tutored by renown artists. He has in turn \nlectured, conducted seminars, advised and served as a consultant on \nHawaiian issues, and written magazine and newspaper articles on \nHawaiian history and art. He continues to do so.\n  Rocky Jensen has held numerous exhibitions in leading museums of the \nworld, including several first such as the organizing Hale Naua III, \nthe first native art society and the first contemporary native Hawaiian \nare exhibit at Honolulu Hale as well as the Bishop Museum. He has been \nrecognized in American Artists of Renown: 1981-1982, Crafts of America \n(1987-1989), and the California Art Review: 1990.\n  Rocky Jensen's better known works include his 1970 illustration of \n``twenty men'' for ``Men of Ancient Hawai'i,'' in which he set a \nprecedent for proper historical attire and artifacts. To this day, this \nillustration stands as testimony to meticulous research and artistry. \nMore recently, Rocky has been acclaimed for Na Lehua Helele'i, a \nmemorial which honors pre-contact Hawaiian warriors. Lehua greets \nvisitors at the entrance of the U.S. Army Museum of Hawaii at Fort \nDeRussy, the most visited Army Museum.\n  Na Lehua Helele'i, ``the scattered lehua blossoms,'' an ancient \nHawaiian phrase that equates the red petals with the blood of fallen \nwarriors, is one of his major works and perhaps his most heroic, \nsculptured with great force and expression. Lehua, a memorial to pre-\ncontact Hawaiian warriors, consists of five eight-foot-tall images of \nKu, the god of war, carved out of native ohi'a logs and ensconced in a \nsemi-circle fronting the museum. Each image is similar but depicts the \ndifferent faces of Ku, his benign, healing qualities as well as warlike \naspects. Na Lehua Helele'i was a twenty-year labor of love and \ncommitment at great personal sacrifice. Since its unveiling a year ago, \nsome have proclaimed it to be one of the best works in the state.\n  Mr. President, I salute the talent and generosity of Native Hawaiian \nMaster Artist Rocky Ka'ioliokahihikolo' Ehu Jensen. To Lucia, wife and \npartner, mahalo from the bottom of my heart for sharing Rocky with us. \nAnd, taking advantage of a fortuitous and joyful coincidence, happy \nbirthday, Rocky, and many, many more years of outstanding artistry. I \nalso want to take this opportunity to wish you and Lucia every success \nas you launch Makaku or ``inner Eye,'' your studio/school.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2436-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2436-S2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE 85TH ANNIVERSARY OF MONROE COUNTY AMERICAN RED CROSS\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 85th \nAnniversary of the Monroe County Chapter of the American Red Cross. \nSince April 30, 1915, this chapter has faithfully served the citizens \nof Monroe County, Michigan, providing aid and comfort in times when it \nis needed most.\n  The Monroe County Chapter was founded by several prominent citizens \nof the community, many of whom were members of the National American \nRed Cross. During that first year, the founders conducted a membership \ndrive, recruited an anti-tuberculosis visiting nurse, provided funds to \naid the starving in Mexico and began a Red Cross Christmas Stamp \ncampaign. These activities were just the beginning of an 85-year \ntradition of services that have carried the generosity of Monroe \nCounty's residents to people in need in all parts of the world.\n  In addition to its emergency disaster relief efforts to residents \ncountywide, the Monroe County Chapter has demonstrated remarkable \nadaptability, enabling it to continue to meet both changing local and \nglobal needs. Since the inception of the chapter's annual\n\n[[Page S2437]]\n\nblood drive, Monroe County donors have generously given over 4,000 \nunits of blood each year. The chapter offers courses in cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation, first aid, water safety, babysitting and HIV/AIDS \neducation, and remains the primary link between U.S. armed forces \npersonnel and their families in Monroe County.\n  Mr. President, as I was preparing this statement I was reminded once \nagain of the essential role the American Red Cross plays in our \ncommunities. Born from the mythic efforts of Clara Barton during the \nCivil War, the organization currently has more than 1.3 million \nvolunteers working under its banner, providing disaster relief services \nfor victims of more than 66,000 disasters per year. More importantly, \nthe American Red Cross still holds firm to the principles it was \nfounded upon. The mission remains to prevent and alleviate human \nsuffering wherever it may be found. That is why, when things are at \ntheir worst, it continues to be the American Red Cross and its \nvolunteers that are there to make them better.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the Monroe County Chapter of the American \nRed Cross on eighty-five years of successful service to the Monroe \nCommunity, and I extend a much deserved thank you to the many staff and \nvolunteers whose efforts throughout the years have made this event \npossible. On behalf of the entire Senate, I wish them continued success \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2437-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MICHAEL DOBMEIER\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Michael \nDobmeier and to recognize him as a member of a distinguished group of \nNorth Dakotans who have demonstrated extraordinary leadership in their \nmilitary careers and civilian life.\n  Michael was recently elected National Commander of the million-member \nDisabled American Veterans, a group with a historic tradition of \nadvocating responsible legislation to assist disabled veterans, their \nfamilies and survivors. Speaking of the DAV recently Michael said, ``I \nsoon discovered the critical role the DAV serves in the lives of \ndisabled veterans and their families in my community and communities \nnationwide.'' I wholeheartedly agree with this statement and attest to \nthe fact that Michael has exemplified through his many significant \nachievements the great importance of the Disabled American Veterans.\n  Michael Dobmeier is a native of Grand Forks, North Dakota. After \ngraduating from high-school, he enlisted in the navy in 1969. Following \nboot camp in San Diego, he trained as an engine man in Great Lakes, \nIllinois, attended Submarine School in New London, Connecticut, and, \nlater Diver's School in San Diego.\n  While serving off the coast of Washington in April 1972 aboard the \nU.S.S. Trigger, Michael was severely burned when an engine crankcase \noil heater exploded. It sprayed him with flaming oil and caused him 2nd \nand 3rd degree burns over more than 30% of his body.\n  Following this accident, Michael received a military discharge and \njoined the Grand Forks' Disabled American Veterans Chapter 2. Since \nthen, he has held almost every local, state, and national leadership \nposition in the organization and has held all chapter and department \nleadership positions. At the 1994 DAV National Convention, Michael was \nchosen to serve on the National Executive and Finance Committee, was \nelected 4th and 3rd Junior Vice Commander consecutively at the 1995 and \n1996 DAV National Conventions, and at the 1997 National Convention was \nelected 1st Junior Vice Commander. In 1998, Michael was elected Senior \nVice Commander at the National Convention in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was \nalso the president of the North Dakota Veterans Home Foundation and was \nchosen the 1985 DAV Outstanding Member of the Department of North \nDakota.\n  Michael Dobmeier resides in Grand Forks with his wife Sandra Jo and \ntheir two children. As owner and President of Dobmeier, Inc., an \nindependent insurance company, Michael has also found success in the \nbusiness world.\n  I am proud to honor Michael Dobmeier as a person who has served his \ncountry with distinction and accepted the challenges and risks \nassociated with this service. As Michael recently stated, ``taking \nrisks means moving forward while others are waiting for better times, \nwhile others are waiting for proven results, and while others are \nwaiting for applause for their past performance. The greatest risk of \nall, however, is to take no risks . . . make no changes.'' We thank Mr. \nDobmeier today for taking those risks. The world is truly a better \nplace because of him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2437-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2437-S2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL ASTRONOMY DAY\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nInternational Astronomy Day. This event seeks ``to promote the \nforerunner of all scientific endeavors and to provide information, \nresources, and encouragement in all facets of astronomy.''\n  Astronomy has played a central role in human history and development. \nIt was somewhere around 4000 B.C. when the first astronomical \nobservations were recorded, and what has followed has been nothing \nshort of amazing. In 240 B.C., Eratosthenes of Cyrene used the stars to \ncalculate the circumference of the earth. Astronomy as we know it today \ncertainly owes Galileo a debt of gratitude for being the first to use a \ntelescope to view the stars, bringing an end to naked-eye astronomy and \nadvancing the science of optics. More recent astronomers include Edwin \nP. Hubble and Jocelyn Bell. The collective work of the world's \nastronomers has brought the heavens closer, while offering us great \ninsights into our own life on Earth.\n  To continue these advances of science, it is vital that we encourage \nour nation's youth to pursue careers in the fields of astronomy, \nastrophysics, and mathematics. I look upon the success of the NASA \nspace camps and how they have encouraged our youth to pursue careers in \nthe sciences. Since 1989, NASA has administered the ``Space Grant'' \nprogram to enhance aerospace research and education in the United \nStates. This program is an effective partnership among universities, \nthe aerospace industry, and federal, state, and local government that \nassists in the recruitment and training of professionals in aerospace \nscience, engineering, and technology.\n  In my home state, the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium is comprised \nof 13 academic institutions along with the Minnesota Department of \nTransportation, Honeywell, Boeing, and three community-based entities: \nThe Bakken, Science Museum of Minnesota, and SciMathMN. The 13 academic \ninstitutions are: Augsburg College, Bemidji State University, Bethel \nCollege, Carleton College, College of St. Catherine, Fond du Lac \nCommunity College, Leech Lake Tribal College, Macalester College, \nNormandale Community College, Southwest State University, University of \nMinnesota-Duluth, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and the \nUniversity of St. Thomas.\n  For the last several years, this consortium of local talents has \nworked effectively to promote aerospace science through fellowships and \nscholarships, the development of new courses in Physics and Geology, \nthe establishment of a new Space Studies minor among the members, and \npublic lectures relating to space science and engineering.\n  The scientists, engineers, administrators, and astronauts of NASA \nhave guided this nation to the forefront of aeronautical expertise. I \nam proud that Minnesotans have been central to NASA's achievements \nthroughout its history. My state has a well-deserved reputation as a \nhigh-technology giant, making our job creators a perfect match with \nNASA, and the space agency has come to depend upon Minnesota ingenuity \nand expertise. Dozens of Minnesota firms currently work under NASA's \nspace shuttle program; I was honored to witness their accomplishments \nfirst-hand in 1997 when I toured NASA's Florida facilities and viewed \nthe launch of the space shuttle Columbia.\n  None of these achievements would have been possible without modern \nastronomy, and our astronomers will no doubt be at the center of space \nresearch for years to come. In Minnesota, we are fortunate to have many \ngroups that are determined to keep the interest in astronomy high for \nall generations. I would like to draw your attention to the Minnesota \nAstronomical Society, whose members are active in the growing movement \nto generate interest in astronomy. I commend them\n\n[[Page S2438]]\n\nfor their enthusiasm and their success in turning our attention to the \nskies.\n  Mr. President, I would be remiss if I neglected to note the great \nwork being done at the University of Minnesota Department of Astronomy. \nDepartment Head Leonard Kuhi directs a staff of more than 30 scientists \nand professors busy working on a wide variety of research projects that \nare at the cutting edge of astronomic research. These include projects \nin space physics, cosmology, computational astrophysics, and others.\n  We in Minnesota also have the distinct pleasure and privilege of \nbeing home to the great Minneapolis Planetarium, a top-rate facility \nthat provides an avenue of discovery for everyone who comes to visit. \nThe Minneapolis Planetarium offers visitors a wide variety of programs \nfor all to enjoy.\n  I again recognize International Astronomy Day and commend all those \nin my state--the backyard astronomy clubs that offer many their first \nglimpse into the cosmos; the planetariums, observatories, and museums \nthat bring the richness of space down to Earth for all; and the \nMinnesota organizations and companies that are putting our fascination \nwith space to practical use--who are helping to keep the interest in \nastronomy running high.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2438-1", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2438-2", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:18 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1776.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING ENFORCEMENT OF FEDERAL \n                   FIREARMS LAWS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Clinton Administration has failed to adequately \n     enforce Federal firearms laws. Between 1992 and 1998, \n     Triggerlock gun prosecutions--prosecutions of defendants who \n     use a firearm in the commission of a felony--dropped nearly \n     50 percent, from 7,045 to approximately 3,800.\n       (2) The decline in Federal firearms prosecutions was not \n     due to a lack of adequate resources. During the period when \n     Federal firearms prosecutions decreased nearly 50 percent, \n     the overall budget of the Department of Justice increased 54 \n     percent.\n       (3) It is a Federal crime to possess a firearm on school \n     grounds under section 922(q) of title 18, United States Code. \n     The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 8 cases \n     under this provision of law during 1998, even though more \n     than 6,000 students brought firearms to school that year. The \n     Clinton Administration prosecuted only 5 such cases during \n     1997.\n       (4) It is a Federal crime to transfer a firearm to a \n     juvenile under section 922(x) of title 18, United States \n     Code. The Clinton Department of Justice prosecuted only 6 \n     cases under this provision of law during 1998 and only 5 \n     during 1997.\n       (5) It is a Federal crime to transfer or possess a \n     semiautomatic assault weapon under section 922(v) of title \n     18, United States Code. The Clinton Department of Justice \n     prosecuted only 4 cases under this provision of law during \n     1998 and only 4 during 1997.\n       (6) It is a Federal crime for any person ``who has been \n     adjudicated as a mental defective or who has been committed \n     to a mental institution'' to possess or purchase a firearm \n     under section 922(g) of title 18, United States Code. Despite \n     this Federal law, mental health adjudications are not placed \n     on the national instant criminal background system \n     established under section 103(b) of the Brady Handgun \n     Violence Prevention Act (18 U.S.C. 922 note).\n       (7) It is a Federal crime for any person knowingly to make \n     any false statement in the attempted purchase of a firearm \n     under section 922(a)(6) of title 18, United States Code.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 478, S.J. Res. \n43.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 43) expressing the sense of \n     Congress that the President of the United States should \n     encourage free and fair elections and respect for democracy \n     in Peru.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint \nresolution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask consent that an amendment to the resolution, \nwhich is at the desk, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3080) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       On page 2, beginning on line 7, strike the word ``modify'' \n     and all through the word ``Peru'' on line 9, and insert the \n     following: ``review and modify as appropriate its political, \n     economic, and military relations with Peru''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to especially thank Senator \nCoverdell, the resolution's chief sponsor, and Senator Helms, Senator \nDeWine, Senator Chafee, and Senator McConnell for their leadership and \nsupport.\n  This is an extremely timely resolution which should send a clear \nmessage to the Peruvian Government and the Peruvian people that the \nUnited States cares deeply about the future of democracy in that \ncountry. It is my fervent hope that next week's presidential election \nin Peru is free and fair, but all indications from independent \nmonitoring groups are that President Fujimori and his supporters have \nused every possible means to manipulate the electoral process. If the \nelection is not deemed to be free and fair by independent observers, \nthis resolution calls on the administration to review U.S. policy \ntoward Peru and modify our political, economic and military relations \naccordingly.\n  We have changed slightly the resolved clause in the resolution from \nthe language that was originally introduced on March 28. Originally, \nthe resolution stated that the U.S. should modify its relations with \nPeru, ``including its support for international financial institution \nloans to Peru,'' if the election is deemed to have been unfair. That \nlanguage has been replaced with language calling on the U.S. to modify \nour ``political, economic and military relations'' with Peru.\n  However, I want to emphasize that the phrase ``economic relations'' \nincludes loans from the international financial institutions. I want to \nbe sure that there is no misunderstanding or suggestion that by \nchanging this language we have precluded the administration from \nmodifying U.S. support for international loans, if the election is \ndeemed to have been unfair and such action would be appropriate.\n  I agreed to this change, both to include the phrase ``military \nrelations'' since our military relations should also be reexamined and \nmodified if appropriate, but also with the understanding that the \nphrase ``economic relations'' includes the entire spectrum of economic \nassistance, both from the United States directly and through the \ninternational financial institutions.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I further ask unanimous consent an amendment to the \npreamble, which is at the desk, be agreed to, and the preamble, as \namended, be agreed to, the joint resolution be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to this resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3081) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n       In the preamble, in the second whereas clause, insert ``, \n     including the Organization of American States, the National \n     Democratic Institute, and the Carter Center,'' after \n     ``Whereas independent election monitors''.\n\n  The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 43), as amended, was read the third \ntime and passed, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 43\n\n       Whereas presidential and congressional elections are \n     scheduled to occur in Peru on April 9, 2000;\n       Whereas independent election monitors, including the \n     Organization of American States, the National Democratic \n     Institute, and the Carter Center, have expressed grave doubts \n     about the fairness of the electoral process due to the \n     Peruvian Government's control of key official electoral \n     agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of the press, \n     manipulation of the judicial processes to stifle independent \n     reporting on radio, television, and newspaper outlets, and \n     harassment and intimidation of opposition politicians, which \n     have greatly limited the ability of opposing candidates to \n     campaign freely; and\n       Whereas the absence of free and fair elections in Peru \n     would constitute a major setback for the Peruvian people and \n     for democracy in the hemisphere, could result in instability \n     in Peru, and could jeopardize United States antinarcotics \n     objectives in Peru and the region: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That it is \n     the sense of Congress that the President of the United States \n     should promptly convey to the President of Peru that if the \n     April 9, 2000, elections are not deemed by the international \n     community to have been free and fair, the United States will \n     review and modify as appropriate its political, economic, and \n     military relations with Peru, and will work with other \n     democracies in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a \n     restoration of democracy in Peru.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/04/07/senate-section/article/S2444-3", "month": "04", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2444-S2445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DIRECTING SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 283, submitted \nearlier by Senator Lott and Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 283) to direct the Senate Legal \n     Counsel to intervene in the name of the Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in \n     United States of America v. Northwest Airlines Corporation, \n     et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Northwest Airlines, one of the defendants in \na civil antitrust action brought by the Department of Justice on behalf \nof the United States in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Michigan, has subpoenaed the General Accounting Office to \nproduce documents that GAO collected or generated in the course of its \npreparation of testimony or reports for several Senate committees, \nincluding the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on \nTransportation and the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nAntitrust, Business Rights, and Competition.\n  GAO advised Northwest's counsel that the documents sought were \nunavailable because they are protected by\n\n[[Page S2445]]\n\nboth the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution, which is \nCongress's legislative privilege, and GAO's own deliberative process \nprivilege. Northwest Airlines has chosen to contest GAO's assertion of \nprivilege by moving in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia to compel GAO to produce the documents.\n  The records that Northwest Airlines is seeking were records that GAO, \nwhich is an investigative agency of Congress, collected or created \nwhile preparing testimony or reports in response to requests from \ncommittees and subcommittees of the Senate. Northwest has not given \nGAO, the Senate, or the Court any explanation for why it may defeat the \nprivileges inhering in GAO internal work product and deliberative \ndocuments, including drafts of proposed testimony, to defend itself in \nthis antitrust action. None of these internal records at issue in this \nmatter has been provided to Northwest's adversary, the Justice \nDepartment. Nor are the final reports issued by GAO or GAO's \ncongressional testimony at issue in this matter, as all parties to the \nlitigation, including Northwest Airlines, have been given full access \nto these materials.\n  GAO is opposing Northwest's motion to compel, invoking its \ndeliberative process privilege. But the legislative privilege that is \ngrounded on the Constitution's Speech or Debate Clause belongs to the \nCongress. In order to ensure congressional independence from the other \nbranches of the government, the Constitution affords Congress with an \nabsolute privilege from compelled questioning through the courts about \nthe performance of its legislative responsibilities, such as the \ngathering of information and preparation of hearings, the conduct of \nadministrative oversight, and the consideration of legislation.\n  The Senate has a strong interest in the ability of its committees to \nreceive testimony and analysis from GAO, which serves as its \ninvestigative arm, without fear that entities whose activities are the \nsubject of that testimony and analysis will be allowed to root around \nin GAO's internal work papers, drafts, and deliberative documents \nseeking something of possible help to them in unrelated litigation. \nThat kind of intrusion into the legislation process is precisely what \nthe Speech or Debate Clause was intended to foreclose.\n  Because the Speech or Debate Clause privilege belongs to the Congress \nand because it is the committee of Congress that are the direct \nbeneficiaries of GAO's contributions to their legislative work, it is \nappropriate that the court hear directly from those Senate committees \nfor which GAO was providing analysis how Northwest's attempt to compel \nproduction of GAO's internal work product threatens their autonomous \nperformance of legislative duties entrusted to them under the \nConstitution. Accordingly, this resolution authorizes the Senate Legal \nCounsel to intervene in this matter in the name of the Committee on the \nJudiciary and the Committee on Appropriations to assert the Speech or \nDebate Clause as protection against compelled questioning of GAO, \nthrough compelled production of GAO's internal work product when \nresponding to requests from Congress.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
