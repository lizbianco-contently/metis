Mr. President, Senator Reid and I would like to offer a \nfew observations at this point. I thank my colleagues for allowing us \nto proceed before them regarding the general order.\n  We want to offer a few observations with respect to what I understand \nis a proposal to remove Federal Judges and Justices from the \nprohibition on honoraria, a proposal that would also remove the \nhonoraria from the limitation on outside earned income. I strongly \noppose that effort.\n\n  This seems manifestly a very wrong approach to what may be a very \nreal problem. The alternative offered in this proposal of having the \nNation's most esteemed jurists turn to the lecture circuit to \nsupplement their salary, I believe, is simply unacceptable. The cost, \nit seems to me, would be too high. It would be measured in the further \nloss of confidence in the integrity of this Government's officials. \nCongress took an important step in trying to restore public confidence \nin the institutions of Government when it enacted\n\n[[Page S8872]]\n\nthe honoraria ban as part of the ethics reform package way back in \n1989. I remember the discussion of it and the debate well in the House \nof Representatives, as I served in the House at that time. We should \nnot backtrack on that effort. If our Federal Judges and Justices need a \npay raise, then by all means let's provide for one, but let's not \nretreat to the discredited practices of the past.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Roberts for his comments \nand also for the work he does on a daily basis for the Ethics \nCommittee. He works tirelessly, without complaint, and does an \noutstanding job for the Senate and the people of this country. Again, I \nthank the chairman for his comments regarding this matter. I have the \ngreatest respect for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He has rendered great \nservice to the country. I think he has been a good Justice. For \nexample, almost 2 years ago now, he was the Presiding Officer in this \nbody in one of the most difficult situations we have had in this \ncountry, dealing with the impeachment of the President. He did an \nexemplary job. I thought he was outstanding. But I believe on this \nissue he is wrong. He spoke out that the Judges should have honoraria. \nThey don't need honoraria. I believe there is a great deal of truth in \nthe observation that there was little honor in the honoraria practices \nof years ago.\n  Although a portion of the honoraria ban was declared unconstitutional \nby the Supreme Court, after which the Department of Justice Office of \nLegal Counsel indicated that they would not enforce the ban in any part \nof government, notwithstanding these actions, the honoraria ban has \ncontinued in force by rule of the Senate, and for Members and highly \npaid staff in the House as well. It also appears that the judicial \nbranch has continued to recognize and abide by the ban. I think it is \nwonderful that they have done so. So there is much to be preserved \nhere, and let's not undo what has already set a pattern for good \ngovernment.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, my \ngood friend, for his very kind remarks in reference to my service on \nthe Ethics Committee. I repeat the same basic substance of what he said \non his behalf as well. It is a thankless and tireless but a very \nimportant job. I thank him for his comments.\n  As chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee, we \nobviously and naturally have discussed this. So I know the strength of \nhis views on this matter as well. Not only do I think this would be a \nvery dramatic step backwards for us in terms of the public's perception \nof integrity of its Government, but I think it would be terribly unfair \nto the most conscientious Judges and Justices. Because a Judge's income \nfrom honoraria would depend on how often appearances and speeches were \nmade, those who dedicate the most time and attention to their job as a \njudge would end up benefiting the least.\n  As I have indicated before, if we have a problem--and I think we do--\nregarding salaries for Judges, we ought to address the problem in that \nway.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. REID. I will only add, Mr. President, because the proposal allows \nfor but does not guarantee limits--for example, there are no \nlimitations on the amount of the honoraria or the number of honoraria \nreceived--there is always the potential for many other problems. The \nSenator from Kansas and I agree that the problem with this proposal is \nnot that it needs to be tinkered with or fine-tuned; the problem is \nthat it takes us in the wrong direction. If the Judges need more \ncompensation, we should address that in Congress and pay them more \nmoney.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, we do agree. As a proposed cure for \nlagging judicial salaries, my colleague and friend, the vice chairman \nof the committee, and I believe that this is not the proper step. It \nwould set a dangerous precedent in regards to the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, yesterday I took the floor and \ndiscussed the problems associated with the price of oil and our \nincreased dependence on imports from Iraq and the regime of Saddam \nHussein.\n  Yesterday, I told this body that oil had peaked at its highest price \nin 10 years. I am here today to tell you that oil has peaked for the \nsecond time in 2 days with the highest point in 10 years--$37.86 a \nbarrel.\n  There is a reaction occurring. It is rather interesting. I am going \nto discuss it briefly because my intention today was to talk about \nnatural gas.\n  Natural gas, as many of us will remember, 9 months ago was about \n$2.16. Deliveries in October are in the area of $5.40, a 44-percent \nincrease in a relatively short period of time. The administration is \nreacting.\n  The news today tells us that there is going to be a recommendation \nfrom the Vice President to open up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to \nset up a heating oil reserve. There are a couple of things that are \npending. One is the reauthorization of SPR in the EPCA bill, which is \ncurrently being held by a Member on the other side of the aisle. The \nadministration is asking us to release the authority by passing EPCA. \nWe are going to have to take care of that little matter first. But \nlet's talk a little bit about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because \nit is probably the most misunderstood issue on the burner today.\n  SPR was created back in 1973 during the era of the Arab oil embargo \nat a time when this Nation was 35-percent dependent on imported oil. \nToday we are 56-percent--nearly 58-percent dependent on imported oil. \nWe swore back in 1973 we would never be held hostage and would never \nhave such exposure to the national energy security of this country. So \nwe created the salt caverns in the gulf for storage.\n  The question of the conceptual purpose behind this was the Mideast \ncartel was holding us hostage and, by having a reserve, it would act as \na protection if our supplies were cut off. Congress dictated that we \nhave a 90-day supply of oil in the reserve to offset the amount of oil \nwe might import should it be needed if the supply were to be disrupted \nfrom the Mideast.\n  It is kind of interesting to go back and look at the arithmetic.\n  When the Clinton administration came in, in 1992, we had an 86-day \nsupply in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Today, we have a 50-day \nsupply. What has the Clinton administration done with that difference? \nThey sold some of the SPR to meet their budget requirements. I think \nthis is a dangerous level--50 days. I think it is inadequate to respond \nto any severe disruption that might occur.\n  The Mideast has always been a hot spot with the possibility of a \nconflict at any time and cutting off supplies. We are seeing Saddam \nHussein now threaten the U.N. as the U.N. attempts to hold Saddam \nHussein financially responsible for damages associated with the Kuwaiti \ninvasion. They are asking for compensation. But yesterday Saddam \nHussein told the U.N. where to go. He said: No, I am not paying \nretribution. If you make me pay retribution, I will cut my supply and \nmy production. Then what are you going to do? We know what the U.N. \ndid. They backed off and said: We will take it up later. He is \ndictating the crucial supply of oil.\n  As the administration talks about the merits of opening up the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, I think we have to reflect on what it was \ndesigned to do. It was to be used to give us the timeframe of ensuring \nthat if the supply were cut off, we would have a buffer by having a \nsupply on which we could call.\n  But make no mistake about it. The media completely misses this point. \nSPR does not contain refined product. It contains crude oil. You have \nto take it out of the reserve. You have to move it to a refinery and \nthen refine it. Our refineries are virtually at full capacity now. If \nyou take the oil out of SPR and take it to a refinery, you are going to \noffset other oil that that refinery would cut. As a consequence, how \nmuch more refined product have you put on the market? I think the \nadministration owes us an explanation as they contemplate, if you will, \ntaking oil out of SPR.\n  Mind you, the emergency we have is supply and demand. We are \nproducing much less than we used to produce. Our demand is up 14 \npercent. Our product\n\n[[Page S8873]]\n\nhas fallen 17 percent. We are in a supply and demand crunch. As a \nconsequence of that, we have a third factor many people overlook, and \nthat is, we haven't built a new refinery in this country in 25 years. \nNobody wants to build them. The reason is the permitting time, the \ncomplexity, and the Superfund exposure. And the industry simply isn't \nbuilding them. We are almost up to our maximum capacity of refining. \nNow we are going to take oil out of SPR. We are going to displace other \noil. We don't have any significant unused refining capacity.\n  There is another factor in this consideration. What kind of signal \ndoes this send to Saddam Hussein? What kind of signal does it send to \nOPEC? It sends a signal that we are now dipping into our emergency \nsupply. As we do, what does that do to our vulnerability? The Senator \nfrom Alaska believes it increases our vulnerability. It gives them more \nleverage. What are we going to fall back on then? What happens if we \npull oil out of SPR and Iraq reduces production? We have a calamity.\n  This isn't just something that is happening in the United States. If \nthere is any question about the severity, ask Tony Blair. The \nGovernment of Great Britain is teetering on the issue of oil. Germany, \nPoland, and many areas of Europe are coming to the United States. There \nis absolutely no question about it.\n  High oil prices have caused many Members, therefore, of this body to \ncall for the release of SPR in a way to manipulate the price of crude. \nSome suggest as much as 30,000 barrels. One Senator was saying this \naction would bring OPEC to its knees. I think it will bring OPEC to its \nfeet. They will say: Hey, there goes the United States; they are \ndipping into their reserve; now we've got them; we've have got the \nleverage.\n  I think it is highly unlikely that this action is well thought out. \nThis is not what the reserve was intended for. It is not what the \nreserve is to be used for. I hope the administration will not weaken \nour national security by releasing oil to drive down prices because it \nwon't necessarily drive down prices.\n  You are saying, well, the Senator from Alaska is from an oil-\nproducing State, and he is just one man's opinion.\n  Let me for the record submit an article from the Wall Street Journal \nof September 21. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 21, 2000]\n\n             Summers Slams Plan to Sell Oil In U.S. Reserve\n\n                (By Bob Davis and Jacob M. Schlesinger)\n\n       Washington.--Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers advised \n     President Clinton in a harshly worded memo that an \n     administration proposal to drive down energy prices by \n     opening the government's emergency oil reserve ``would be a \n     major and substantial policy mistake.''\n       Mr. Summers' vehement objection--which, he wrote, is shared \n     by influential Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan--\n     doesn't mean the prospect of using the Strategic Petroleum \n     Reserve is dead, as the White House scrambles to contain the \n     economic and political fallout from oil prices that yesterday \n     neared $38 a barrel for the first time in a decade.\n       Indeed, today Vice President Al Gore--in his role as \n     Democratic presidential candidate--plans to call on the \n     administration to conduct ``test sales'' from the SPR as part \n     of what he called ``a major policy speech . . . outlining a \n     specific course of action'' to address what could become a \n     serious threat to his campaign.\n       Yesterday, a week after the Summers memo was dated, White \n     House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters ``all options \n     remain on the table'' to address energy prices, the SPR \n     ``being one of them.''\n\n\n                           signal to markets\n\n       In continuing White House deliberations on the matter, two \n     of Mr. Gore's top aides have backed serious consideration of \n     test sales as a way to signal markets that the government is \n     willing to act, one administration official said.\n       Along with Mr. Summers, the official said, other economic \n     and diplomatic cabinet members were reluctant to tap the SPR, \n     a buffer created after the 1973 oil embargo that has been \n     used only once during the Gulf War in 1991. But this official \n     added that many of those advisers, including Mr. Summers, \n     have grown more sympathetic to that option during the past \n     week as oil prices have continued to climb.\n       Mr. Summers' Sept. 13 memo did leave open the possibility \n     of accepting a limited test sale, which could involve selling \n     as much as five million barrels from the 570 million-barrel \n     supply--far less than the 60 million barrels the memo said \n     the Department of Energy advocated. ``There are alternatives \n     available involving the SPR that are focused and targeted,'' \n     he conceded.\n       Neither Mr. Summers nor his office would cooperate for this \n     story or discuss his memo.\n\n\n                         candidates' scapegoats\n\n       Yesterday, Candidate Gore gave several interviews to the \n     major television networks to preview today's address, \n     blasting the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries \n     and what he called the profiteering of ``big oil''--the \n     latter a not-so-subtle swipe at the Republican ticket of \n     George W. Bush and Dick Cheney, both of whom have ties to the \n     oil industry.\n       Mr. Bush yesterday tried to turn the tables on his rival, \n     saying the Clinton-Gore administration ``needs to be held \n     accountable for a failed energy policy.'' In an interview \n     with MSNBC, Mr. Bush also said he would do more to encourage \n     domestic oil exploration, and he chided the White House for \n     failing to use American ``diplomatic leverage'' more \n     effectively to get Persian Gulf allies to increase \n     production.\n       Yet there is no clear, quick answer to the problem, as Mr. \n     Summers's two-page memo argued. He wrote that using the SPR \n     would have, at best, ``a modest effect'' on prices, and would \n     have ``downsides . . . that would outweigh the limited \n     benefits.''\n\n\n                        ``dangerous precedent''\n\n       He warned that the DOE's 60 million-barrel proposal would \n     ``set a dangerous precedent'' by using the SPR to \n     ``manipulate prices'' rather than adhering to its original \n     purpose of responding to a supply disruption, and added that \n     the move ``would expose us to valid charges of naivete'' for \n     using ``a very blunt tool'' to address heating-oil prices.\n       Noting the potential sale's ``proximity to both [an \n     upcoming] OPEC meeting and the November election,'' the \n     Treasury Secretary also said it ``would simply not be \n     credible'' to claim, as some proponents have, that an oil \n     sale could be portrayed as a technical inventory management \n     of the reserve.\n       Such a move, Mr. Summers argued, also would hurt the tool's \n     effectiveness in the event of a real oil-supply crisis, \n     diminish the ``psychological value'' of using the SPR again \n     if Iraq makes good on implied threats to cut oil output, and \n     undercut Saudi Arabian cooperation with the U.S.\n\n\n                           greenspan's clout\n\n       And he took the unusual step of invoking Mr. Greenspan, \n     whose prestige has increasingly been used to influence \n     economic-policy issues far beyond his purview of monetary \n     policy. The letter begins: ``Chairman Greenspan and I believe \n     that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as \n     proposed by DOE, would be a major and substantial policy \n     mistake.''\n       Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has staked out the \n     opposite side of the debate from Mr. Summers, and prepared \n     his own two-page memo urging use of the SPR. Both letters \n     were presented to Mr. Clinton along with a brief summarizing \n     the pros and cons of the issue prepared by Gene Sperling, \n     head of the National Economic Council.\n       Spokespersons for Messrs. Greenspan, Richardson, and \n     Sperling declined to comment on the memos.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this article is entitled ``Summers \nSlams Plan to Sell Oil In U.S. Reserve.'' ``Treasury Secretary's Memo \nSays Greenspan Agrees It Would Be a Mistake.''\n  The Washington by-line of the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers advised President \n     Clinton in a harshly worded memo that an administration \n     proposal to drive down energy prices by opening the \n     government's emergency oil reserve ``would be a major and \n     substantial policy mistake.''\n\n  This isn't the Senator from Alaska. This is our Treasury Secretary.\n\n       Mr. Summers's vehement objection--which, he wrote, is \n     shared by influential Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \n     . . .\n       Indeed, today Vice President Al Gore--in his role as \n     Democratic presidential candidate--plans to call on the \n     administration to conduct ``test sales'' from the SPR as part \n     of what he called ``a major policy speech . . .''\n\n  We have had a tradition of test sales from SPR under this \nadministration.\n  In 1991, we offered 32 million barrels; in 1996, decommissioning \nWeeks Island, 5 million; 1996, the recession bill, 12 million. We had \nswaps, appropriations in 1997. What we did is we bought high and sold \nlow. We lost hundreds of millions of dollars on our sale. I only assume \nthe government figured they would make up the difference on the volume.\n  Our experience hasn't been very good. Let me get back to the other \nsale. Summers says it is a dangerous precedent.\n\n       He warned that the DOE's 60 million-barrel proposal would \n     ``set a dangerous precedent'' by using the SPR to \n     ``manipulate prices'' rather than adhering to its original \n     purpose of responding to a supply disruption, and added that \n     the move ``would expose us to valid charges of naivete'' for \n     using ``a very blunt tool'' to address heating-oil prices.\n       Such a move, Mr. Summers argued, also would hurt the \n     effectiveness of SPR in the\n\n[[Page S8874]]\n\n     event of a real oil-supply crisis, diminishing the \n     ``psychological value'' of using the SPR again if Iraq makes \n     good on implied threats to cut oil output, and undercut Saudi \n     Arabia's cooperation with the U.S.\n\n\n                           Greenspan's Clout\n\n       And he took the unusual step of invoking Mr. Greenspan, \n     whose prestige has increasingly been used to influence \n     economic-policy issues far beyond his purview of monetary \n     policy. The letter begins: ``Chairman Greenspan and I believe \n     that using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve at this time, as \n     proposed by DOE, would be a major and substantial policy \n     mistake.''\n\n  I ask Members to consider the mechanical function of what has to take \nplace. There are some people in this body who just assume you pull it \nout of SPR and, bang, it is there for the heating oil requirements of \nthe Northeast Corridor, or it is there to relieve our pricing. It \nisn't. It is not a refined product. It has to be refined. It has to go \nto refineries. The refineries are operating at nearly full capacity, \nand when you pull it out of your reserve, it is like taking it out of \nyour savings account. What do you do for an encore when the savings \naccount is gone? We are certainly not going to replace SPR during this \ntimeframe when oil prices are at an all-time high. We increase the \nvulnerability of the United States; we increase the potential for \nfurther increases in the price of oil.\n  There is one other point I want to make. The idea of a government-\noperated heating oil reserve, we don't really know what it means. But \nif I am in the business of storing heating oil, if I am a jobber in the \nNortheast and I know the government is going to store, I am not going \nto build up my reserve. Why should I? The government is going to take \ncare of that. What does that do to the incentive of the private sector \nto build up reserves?\n  We have to think this thing through. I hope that the press will \nquestion the Vice President a little bit on the mechanics of what the \nnet gain is. What does it do to our national security? Does it make us \nmore vulnerable to OPEC? I also request the media to check on whether \nwe have the authority or not--because the administration is begging us \nto pass EPCA, which gives us the authority, allegedly, to reauthorize \nthe Strategic Petroleum Reserve. We have a lot of bits and pieces that \nwe haven't taken care of.\n  It will be interesting to see what kind of explanation the American \npublic is given because so often it is very easy to spin the story that \nthe answer is SPR. Do you know what the administration is doing? They \nare buying more time, hopefully, to get through this election because \nthat is the bottom line. We are heading for a train wreck on energy.\n  I will throw a little bit more water in my remaining 2 minutes, not \non SPR but on the realization of what is coming in the second show. The \nsecond show is natural gas; $5.35 per thousand cubic feet, October, \nnext month. It was $2.16 6 months ago. Inventories are 15 percent below \nlast winter's level. We will not have any new supply this winter. Fifty \npercent of American homes rely on natural gas and nearly 18 percent of \nthe Nation's electric power.\n  There we have it. The administration doesn't have a plan. We have \nintroduced legislation to get this matter back on course, the bottom \nline, as Senator Lott and a number of us have joined together in coming \ndown with what we think is a responsible energy plan that would \nincrease the domestic supply. It would increase certain tax benefits \nthat would ensure that we have the incentive in order to relieve the \nsupplies associated with the realization that the next crash is coming \non natural gas.\n  I wanted to identify the specific mechanics associated with the issue \nof opening up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and remind my colleagues \nthat gas is right behind us in the crisis area, and the American \ntaxpayer will bear the brunt of this. I hope the administration will \nrise to the occasion with some real relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 3086 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator Biden \nhas time reserved to speak. He is not here.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have been advised that Senator Biden's \nschedule will not permit his arrival at this time, so I suggest holding \nhis time in abeyance. I have no objection to the request by the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Texas \nfor arranging the time this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8874-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8874-S8877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOME HEALTH CARE SERVICES\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, Senate Republicans are committed to \nenacting legislation to preserve, strengthen, and save Medicare for \ncurrent and future generations. It is also critical that Congress take \naction this year to address some of the unintended consequences of the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 which has been exacerbated by a host of \nill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by the Clinton \nadministration. The combination of regulatory overkill and budget cuts \nis jeopardizing access to critical home health care services for \nmillions of our Nation's seniors.\n  If one thinks about it, health care has really come full circle. \nPatients are spending less time in the hospital, more and more \nprocedures are being done on an outpatient basis, and recovery and care \nfor patients with chronic diseases and conditions increasingly takes \nplace at home. Moreover, the number of older Americans who are \nchronically ill or disabled in some way continues to grow each year.\n  As a consequence, home health care has been an increasingly important \npart of our health care system, and I know the Senator from Kansas has \nbeen a very strong supporter of ensuring that these vital services are \nprovided for our senior citizens. The kind of highly skilled and often \ntechnically complex services our Nation's home health care agencies \nprovide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and receive care right \nwhere they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  In 1996, however, home health care was the fastest growing component \nof Medicare spending. This understandably prompted consideration of \nsome changes as part of the Balanced Budget Act that were intended to \nslow the growth in spending to make the program more cost-effective and \nefficient.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator from Maine \nyield for a question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. First off, I thank the Senator so much for taking this \ntime to draw attention to a very serious problem. I know the Senator \nfrom Maine is experiencing the same thing I am experiencing in Kansas \nand all Senators are experiencing when they go back home. Every \nhospital board--beleagured hospital boards--every hospital \nadministrator, all of the rural health care delivery system--it is not \nonly applicable to rural areas but all over--have been questioning me \nand our colleagues about when are we going to do something with regard \nto the Medicare reimbursement.\n  The Senator has indicated--I underlined it in the Senator's remarks:\n\n       It is also critical that Congress take action this year to \n     address some of the unintended consequences of the Balanced \n     Budget Act of 1997. . . .\n\n  We should have done it this spring. The Senator from Maine and I \ntalked about it. We should have done it last year. We did certainly \nprovide that assistance. I wish we could have done that earlier. We are \ngoing to do that.\n  Then the Senator also said:\n\n       . . . [and also some problems] which have been exacerbated \n     by a host of ill-conceived regulatory requirements imposed by \n     the Clinton administration--\n\n  And the folks at HCFA.\n\n[[Page S8875]]\n\n  That is a marvelous acronym, HCFA. I will tell you what, if that is \nnot a four-letter word in the minds and eyes of people who have to \nprovide health care services throughout our country, I do not know what \nis. Asking HCFA for help, if you are a hospital board or a hospital \nadministrator, is like asking the Boston strangler for a neck massage. \nIt just does not work.\n  My question is this: as I recall, there was strong bipartisan support \nfor these provisions, but haven't they produced cuts in home health \ncare spending far beyond what Congress ever intended? It is my \nunderstanding--and I want people to understand this--home health care \nspending dropped $9.7 billion in fiscal year 1999, just about half of \nthe 1997 amount; is that correct?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator, as always, is entirely correct. I know how \nconcerned he has been that inadequate reimbursements under Medicare, \nplus regulatory overkill by HCFA, are really jeopardizing the provision \nof care in our rural hospitals and our home health care agencies.\n  In fact, we know the Balanced Budget Act is already producing--or \nexpected to produce--four times the savings that we intended when the \n1997 Balanced Budget Act was passed. Moreover--and I know the Senator \nfrom Kansas shares my deep concern about this--looming on the horizon, \nbelieve it or not, is an additional 15-percent cutback in home health \ncare reimbursements. That will put our already struggling home health \nagencies at risk. I know the Senator from Kansas shares my belief that \nit would, if allowed to go into effect, seriously jeopardize access to \ncare for millions of our Nation's seniors.\n  The effects of these home health care cuts have been particularly \ndevastating to the State of Maine. In Maine, I would inform my \ncolleague from Kansas, nearly 7,500 Maine seniors have lost access to \nhome health care due to the cutbacks and the regulatory overkill by \nHCFA.\n  Those 7,500 seniors did not get well. That is not why they lost their \naccess to home health care. In fact, what has happened is some of them \nhave been forced prematurely into nursing homes or they are at risk of \nincreased hospitalization, which ironically costs the Medicare trust \nfund more money than if they were still receiving home health care. \nSome of them--and this is most tragic of all--are going without care \naltogether.\n  Cuts of this magnitude, particularly for the home health agencies in \nyour section of the country and mine, which were historically low cost \nto begin with, cannot be sustained without ultimately adversely \naffecting patient care.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The same complaints are made in Kansas. The same \ncomplaints are made throughout the country. The home health care \nagencies in my State--in fact, since January of about 2 years ago, 68 \nMedicare-certified agencies in Kansas have closed their doors, more \nthan a 25-percent drop, more than a quarter drop.\n  These were not the ``fly-by-night'' agencies that some in the Federal \nGovernment and others in regards to various inspections--and you have \ntalked about that we have heard about so much--many of these agencies \nhad been in existence for 20 years.\n  The latest numbers from HCFA show that the total home health care \nvisits are down by over 45 percent--almost half. The losers of this \nsituation are not just numbers. It is just not accounting in regards \nto, say, HCFA. These are our Nation's seniors; in particular, those who \nare really sick. We are talking about the Medicare patients who are \nsuffering through complex and chronic care needs who are already \nexperiencing a lot of difficulty in the home care services they need.\n  So the same thing is true in Kansas as the Senator has pointed out in \nMaine. I, obviously, think it is true in every State.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator has, as always, summarized the situation \nexactly right. The real losers are the sickest seniors because what is \nhappening is, because they are more expensive to treat, our home health \nagencies are turning away some of the more expensive patients because \nthey simply cannot afford to provide them care.\n  I met recently with a group of very dedicated and highly skilled, \ncompassionate home health nurses from the Visiting Nurse Service in \nSaco, ME. That is southern Maine's largest independent, not-for-profit \nhome health agency. It performs more than 250,000 home visits per year.\n\n  During my discussions with these nurses, I heard absolutely hard-\nbreaking stories of how recent cutbacks and regulatory restrictions \nhave affected both the quality and the availability of home health \nservices.\n  Let me tell my colleague of just one example the nurses related to \nme. Consider this case. It involves an elderly Maine woman who suffered \nfrom advanced Alzheimer's disease, pneumonia, and hypertension, among \nmany other illnesses. She was bedbound, verbally nonresponsive, and had \na series of serious health issues, including serious infections.\n  This woman had been receiving home health care for approximately 2 \nyears, and that had allowed her condition to stabilize through the care \nand coordination of a skilled nurse. Unfortunately, the care provided \nto this patient abruptly came to an end when HCFA'S intermediary sent \nout a notice denying further home health care for this woman.\n  That is an example of the kinds of regulatory problems that the \nSenator was talking about.\n  Let's look at what happened in this case.\n  The fact is, it produced a tragedy. Less than 3 months later, this \nwoman died. She died as a result of a wound on her foot that went \nuntreated. Undoubtedly, the home health nurse would have caught that \nproblem before it got out of control.\n  That is just one of the heart-wrenching stories that I have heard not \nonly during that visit but in discussions with patients and health care \nproviders throughout my State.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The home health care agencies in my State, as I have \nindicated, also complain about their exacerbating financial problems. \nThat is a very fancy word to say it has been made a whole lot worse by \na host of the new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including \nthe implementation of another marvelous acronym called OASIS. The \nthought occurs to me, if there is an ``oasis'' that is proposed by \nHCFA--we all remember the ``Survivor'' show that was so popular--there \nwould be no survivors in regards to this OASIS, I can tell you.\n  OASIS stands for the new outcome and assessment information data \nset--new outcome and assessment information data set--new requirements \nfor surety bonds, new requirements for sequential billing, new \nrequirements for overpayment recoupment, new requirements on a 15-\nminute reporting requirement. And all of this adds up.\n  I just concluded a 40-county tour in my State. I will go on another \n65-county tour. At every stop was a hospital administrator. They said: \nI don't know who reads this stuff. I think they must weigh it somewhere \nin Kansas City--which is the regional center.\n  I am not trying to deprive from the purpose and the intent and \nresponsibility that HHS and HCFA and OASIS have here, but it just seems \nto me that just about the time you have one requirement promulgated--\nthere is another fancy word--then it is changed, and it is changed \novernight. This is the kind of thing that a small rural hospital, or \nany hospital, just cannot put up with, with that very tight margin. We \nare down to the morrow of the bone.\n  Naturally, we are going to put in some money in regards to Medicare \nreimbursement, but this regulatory overkill is something that just has \nto stop.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator is entirely correct. I could not agree with \nhis point more.\n  What I heard from the home health nurses is not only do all these \nexcessive regulatory requirements and paperwork cost a lot of money to \nthe agency, but they detract from the time that otherwise would be \nspent caring for patients. Instead of focusing on patients, they have \nto complete paperwork. Indeed, at that visit in Saco, ME, that I \nmentioned, the nurses--to illustrate the OASIS paperwork which the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas has\n\n[[Page S8876]]\n\njust talked about--put it up all over the room. It covered the walls of \nthe entire room. That was just one OASIS questionnaire.\n  Last year, I chaired a subcommittee hearing of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations. We heard about the problems that \nexcessive regulation was imposing. We heard about the cash-flow \nproblems that agencies across the country are experiencing.\n  One nurse from Maine, who runs a home health agency, terms HCFA's \napproach as being one of ``implement and suspend.'' In other words, \nHCFA requires these agencies to go through all these regulatory hoops \nto fill out all this paperwork and then says: Never mind. This really \nisn't what we meant.\n  Meanwhile, tremendous cost and energy has gone into complying with \nthese burdensome regulations.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield again, please?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. This OASIS business, in regard to all the complaints we \nhave heard, as I have indicated--I think I ought to go into that a \nlittle bit more than explaining what the acronym is. OASIS is a system \nof records containing data on the physical, mental, and functional \nstatus of Medicare and Medicaid patients receiving care from home \nhealth agencies.\n  HCFA tried to implement OASIS as a tool to help the agency improve \nthe quality of care and form the basis for a new home health care \nprospective payment system. The problem is--and my colleague chaired \nthe subcommittee and asked all the very pertinent questions--the \ncollection of data is so burdensome and expensive for agencies, it \ninvades the personal privacy of the patients. It must be collected for \nnon-Medicare patients as well as those served by Medicare.\n  Just yesterday, I learned that the whole OASIS information system in \nKansas is not working; the computer system has failed. Agencies across \nthe State are having a lot of difficulty in transmitting any kind of \ndata. This burden is being felt by agencies all over the country. The \nquestion I have for the Senator is, Does she have any idea how long it \ntakes? She has already spoken about this to some degree. Can we put a \ntimeframe on it? Can we get more specific as to how long it takes for \nnurses to collect this information for HCFA? What does it cost in terms \nof nurse time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I inform the Senator from Kansas that the testimony at \nmy hearing indicated that it generally takes a nurse as long as 2 hours \nto complete these forms with one patient. The patients do not welcome \nthis intrusive questionnaire in any way.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I certainly agree with that. Will the Senator yield for \nanother question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The OASIS document includes an 18-page initial \nassessment that must be completed by a registered nurse and a 13-page \nfollowup assessment that is required every 60 days. This reminds me of \na situation quite a few years ago, when the Department came out with a \nrequirement that all Medicare patients would have to be reviewed by a \ndoctor every 24 hours. At the time I said I was for that, stunning all \nof the health care folks in my district. I was in the House of \nRepresentatives then. I said: Surely, if they are going to require a \n24-hour reporting requirement by a doctor, they will furnish us the \ndoctor. There was sort of a method to the madness.\n  At any rate, as I have indicated, there is an 18-page initial \nassessment that must be completed by a registered nurse. A 13-page \nfollowup assessment is required every 60 days. This is on top of \nassessments already required by the State. That is very important. It \nisn't as if there is no regulatory function to safeguard the interests \nof the patients and the taxpayer. The paperwork burden is immense. I am \ncurious about what is included in this assessment. Is the Senator aware \nof the nature of the questions?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, this is one of the problems. The Senator \nfrom Kansas has put his finger right on it. OASIS collects information \nnot only about the patient's medical condition or history, but about \nliving arrangements, medications, sensory status--I am not even sure \nwhat that means--and emotional status as well. That raises a host of \nproblems.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Emotional status? I see that patients must answer \nquestions about their feelings. Have they ever been depressed? Have \nthey ever had trouble sleeping? Have they ever attempted suicide? In \nsome cases, that might be necessary, but do we really think we need a \nnurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so that \nhe or she can send the answers over computer to someplace in \nBaltimore--hopefully Kansas City, but probably in Baltimore?\n\n  Does the Senator from Maine have any idea how patients have reacted \nto this survey? Talk about emotional distress, if somebody were to ask \nme in a hospital what I felt or how would I feel, do I feel depressed, \nI think they would learn pretty doggone quick.\n  Ms. COLLINS. That has been the experience of the nurses in Maine, \nthat the patients believe this is unnecessarily intrusive. We are not \ntalking about patients, in these cases, who are receiving home health \nbecause of emotional problems. Obviously, those questions might be \nappropriate in some cases, but they are clearly not in these cases.\n  What the nurses explained to me is that the patients say: What does \nthis have to do with what you are treating me for? The nurses expressed \nconcern that this ``exercise of Olympian endurance'' inevitably elicits \na negative response from their patients. That is a problem because that \npatient-nurse relationship is very important. It is a relationship that \nrespects the confidentiality and the privacy of patients, or it should.\n  Unfortunately, the OASIS information mandated by HCFA immediately \nerects a barrier that is often difficult to overcome. There is one \nexample I want to share with my colleague from Kansas, one 76-year-old \nMedicare patient about whom I was told was being treated for a wound to \nhis left shoulder. The wound care and teaching provided by the home \nhealth nurse took approximately 30 minutes. Completing the OASIS form \ntook an hour and a half. The patient understandably asked: What does \nall this have to do with my shoulder? A very common response.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I agree with my colleague. That is too much to ask. That \nis ridiculous. I also point out that the time filling out the forms \nwould be much better used actually caring for the patients. There is an \nhour and a half that the nurse could have been doing that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for an additional \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not object, but with the \nindulgence of my colleagues, I ask unanimous consent to then be allowed \nto speak for 15 minutes of the Democrats' time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. I will try to keep \nmy remarks certainly more brief and more pertinent.\n  The point I was trying to make--I know that the same is true with \nregard to Texas--the Senator from Texas is here--and also Minnesota and \nMaine--is the time to travel great distances, many miles. Our health \ncare providers spend an awful lot of time traveling from one patient's \nhome to another. What happens is that the first patient may be located \nmany miles away from the next patient. It requires the home health care \nnurse to work virtually nonstop to meet the deadlines required for the \nsubmission of the data to HCFA, which interferes with the personal care \nand the travel time. This is like 24-hour duty that is exacerbated by \nall of the data requirements.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Yes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator has spent a lot of time understanding OASIS. \nOne of the complaints I have heard is that OASIS even requires, in some \ncases, the collection of data for non-Medicare patients; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I tell my distinguished friend that unfortunately that \nis correct. Any Medicare-approved home health agency must comply with \nall Medicare conditions of participation, including the collection of\n\n[[Page S8877]]\n\nOASIS. This means that patients who do not participate in Medicare are \nstill subject to the Medicare assessment. That is exactly correct.\n  Last year, HCFA amended this regulation to say that these agencies \ndon't have to transmit the data on non-Medicare patients for the time \nbeing. However, the agency still must spend the time making the \nassessment. So it is sort of a Catch-22. I am certainly sympathetic to \nthe concerns raised by my constituents that these new regulations and \nspending cuts will harm, again, the senior. But aren't these policy \nchanges necessary to achieve the Medicare saving goals established by \nthe Balanced Budget Act, I ask my colleague?\n  Ms. COLLINS. As the Senator's rhetorical question implies, these are \nnot necessary. The fact is that it now appears the savings goals set \nfor home health have not only been met but far exceeded.\n  According to CBO, spending for home health care fell by 35 percent in \n1999, and CBO cites the larger-than-anticipated drop in the use of home \nhealth services as the primary reason that total Medicare spending \nactually dropped, overall Medicare spending, by 1 percent last year. \nThe CBO now projects that the post Balanced Budget Act reductions in \nhome health care will be approximately $69 billion. That is over four \ntimes the $16 billion Congress expected to save. It is a clear \nindication that the cutbacks have been far deeper and far more wide \nreaching than Congress ever intended.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will my distinguished colleague yield for another \nquestion?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. My colleague referred to--and I referred to it in my \nopening comments--the additional 15-percent cut across the board in \nthese payments to go into effect on October 1, 2001. With regard to \nwhat she has just related to the Senate, given the savings that have \nalready been achieved, the question is obvious, is this additional cut \nnecessary?\n  I tell my colleagues and all those interested in this particular \nissue that last year we had to come up with an emergency bill. Nobody \nlikes to do that.\n  We would prefer it to go through authorization and appropriations. \nNobody likes to be faced with an emergency bill. This year is the same \nway. We are wrestling with that in terms of the budget caps we should \nlive with. We are trying to figure that out. Here we are willing to \nprovide more emergency money and we turn around and go through another \n15-percent cut. It seems to me that is not conducive to what we are \nabout with regard to consistency. What effect would that have with \nregard to home health care agencies?\n  Ms. COLLINS. A further 15-percent cut would be devastating. It would \nsound the death knell for those low-cost, nonprofit agencies in our \nStates, which are currently struggling to hang on. It would further \nreduce our seniors' access to critical home care services. As we have \ndiscussed, we don't need to do it. We already have more than achieved \nthe savings goals that were put forth in 1997.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If the Senator will yield for an additional question, \nwhat are we going to do to help remedy this serious problem? I know the \nSenator has legislation, but would she summarize what she thinks is the \nanswer to that.\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator from Kansas has been a strong supporter \nalong with my colleagues, Senators Bond and Ashcroft from Missouri, as \nwell as many colleagues, in cosponsoring legislation introduced to \neliminate the automatic 15-percent reduction in Medicare payments that \nwould otherwise occur. It would provide a measure of financial relief \nfor those home health agencies that already are cost-efficient and \ndoing a good job. That is what we need to do--to pass that legislation \nbefore we adjourn.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. If I may ask one additional question, what kind of \nsupport do we have in the Senate? I think the magic number is 55. I \nwould like for the Senator to tell our colleagues.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am pleased to confirm to the Senator from Kansas that \nmy legislation has strong support not only from the Senator from Kansas \nbut many of our colleagues. It has 55 Senate cosponsors, including 32 \nRepublicans and 23 Democrats, showing that this is a nationwide \nproblem. It also has strong backing of many consumer and patient \ngroups, including the American Diabetes Association, American Nurses \nAssociation, National Council on Aging, and the American Hospital \nAssociation. All of these groups have come together because they know \nthat an additional 15-percent cutback would be absolutely devastating \nto American seniors and people with disabilities.\n  So if we allow this to go into effect, any of our other efforts to \nstrengthen Medicare and home health, to help improve that benefit will \nreally be meaningless.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I have one final question. First, I thank the Senator \nfrom Maine for all her leadership and her hard work in this effort, for \ntapping not so gently on the shoulders of the leadership and, in a \nbipartisan way, attracting all sorts of support for this bill. I \nbelieve it is possible for Congress to bring this much needed relief to \nthe home health care industry, as well as to the small rural hospitals \nand the teaching hospitals that are feeling the pinch of all these \nregulatory and legislative changes made in the last few years--with \nevery good intent.\n  But this is the law of unintended consequences personified. We must \nwork quickly. Time is of the essence for many of our home health \nagencies and hospitals, especially the small rural providers. I don't \nwant to have to go out again on a 105-county listening tour in Kansas \nand have people come and say; Senator Roberts, thank you so much for \nyour past help on a whole litany of things we have gone through \nregarding the home health care delivery system, only to find out that \ntheir doors may close.\n\n  I will continue to work with my colleague from Maine to pass \nlegislation before Congress adjourns this year. We have a good team and \nwe have good support. We cannot go home without providing help. I thank \nthe distinguished Senator for her leadership in heading up a home \nhealth care posse for fairness and justice.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his kind comments \nand his strong support and leadership. He clearly understands the \nissues involved. Time is of the essence. I appreciate the opportunity \nto discuss this issue this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after my 5 \nminutes of remarks Senator Wellstone and Senator Harkin be recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, does that reserve my 20 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 20 minutes is not affected by \nthis request.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Is it the understanding of the Senator from Texas that \nafter I speak Senator Harkin and Senator Wellstone will speak \nimmediately after me? I am under the impression that we have about 20 \nor 30 minutes on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The total is 25 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. As I understand the schedule of the Senate, I think there \nwould be no problem, as long as it didn't exceed 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I will \nbe very brief, and then Senator Wellstone will need about 10 minutes.\n  I thank my colleagues from Maine and Kansas for taking time to speak \non the floor about such an important issue as health care. As we wrap \nup this session, I am very hopeful, in a bipartisan way, we can address \nspecifically many of the questions that were raised in terms of the \ntough situation facing our home health care agencies and hospitals, our \nrural health clinics. It is something this Congress must address in the \nlast few weeks. I thank them for their leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8877-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8877-S8878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONSERVATION AND REINVESTMENT ACT\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to say a brief word \nabout an extraordinary and very positive statement that the President \nof the United States made in the last 45\n\n[[Page S8878]]\n\nminutes as he gathered on the south lawn of the White House with a \ngroup of supporters of another very important bill--an issue we have \nactually debated for many hours and helped to usher through called the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act.\n  The President, just this morning, called on us, in a bipartisan \nfashion, not to miss the opportunity to push forward on this very \nimportant piece of legislation--one which his administration has \nsupported and helped to design. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act \nis really Congress's way of responding to a need that the American \npeople have and have expressed themselves clearly on over and over, \nfrom the South to the North, from the East to the West, in meetings, \nthrough polling information that we have, through calls made to this \nCongress, through letters written, through e-mails sent--to say to us \nthat now is the time to set aside a small but significant portion of \nthe surplus that we have to invest--not for 1 year, or 6 months, not \noccasionally when we can, but to invest permanently a stream of revenue \nfor conservation programs in our Nation.\n  I guess I can speak so passionately about this issue because the \nmoney we are speaking about investing is coming from offshore oil and \ngas revenues, 85 percent of which are produced off of the coast of \nLouisiana. We are proud of that production. We are doing it in a much \nmore environmentally sensitive way and have been doing it for 50 years. \nBut all of the revenue generated off of that oil and gas production has \ngone to the Federal Treasury. It is hard to account for how they have \nbeen spent, and they have not been spent for environmental investments \nfor our Nation--a promise that was made 30 years ago but not kept.\n  So the Conservation and Reinvestment Act, which the President spoke \nabout and continues to urge us to move forward on, is a way for us to \nredirect appropriately and in a very fiscally responsible way some of \nthose revenues back to our States and local governments to help with \nthe expansion of our parks and recreation areas in both rural and urban \nareas, for the preservation and restoration of our coastlines.\n  We in Louisiana feel strongly about getting some help from Washington \nto restore an eroding coastline, helping us to invest in wildlife \nconservation and preservation and, in many ways, including historic \npreservation. I will give to the staff a list of the 63 Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats, who are supporting this legislation, to \nacknowledge again in the Record the great work that the House \nleadership did--Congressman Don Young, Congressman John Dingell, and \nCongressman George Miller, leaders in the House.\n  It has truly been a bipartisan-bicameral effort.\n  I will submit for the Record the names of 63 Senators who the \nPresident mentioned in his remarks this morning, thanking us for our \nsupport and joining with him in this effort, and finally shaping this \nbill in such a way that both parties can be proud, for which we in \nLouisiana can be grateful, and that Governors and mayors and elected \nofficials and leaders all across our Nation can be happy to work on in \npartnership with the Federal Government to make a significant, \nmeaningful, reliable investment now as we begin this century--something \nour children and our grandchildren can count on for a more beautiful \nnation in 2025 or 2050. We can't wait. This is the year to make it a \nreality.\n  I thank the Chair. Again, I thank Senator Lott and Senator Daschle \nfor their excellent leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Louisiana \nfor her excellent work. I just had three members of the department of \nnatural resources of Minnesota in my office today encouraging me to \nsupport this measure. It is very important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8878-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8878-S8879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL HISTORICAL BLACK COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY WEEK\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this week is a week that we take out to \ncelebrate, to honor, and to acknowledge the great contributions that \n105 Historically Black Colleges and Universities have made to our \nNation.\n  In Louisiana, I am very proud to represent four of the greatest of \nthese institutions--Grambling State University, Southern University \nSystem, Xavier University, and Dillard University--and to recognize \ntheir great contributions in making our Nation stronger, and as we \nenter the new century to reassert my commitment and to acknowledge \ntheir great and significant place in the educational framework of our \nNation.\n  On September 14, 2000, President Clinton proclaimed this week as \nNational Historical Black Colleges Week and asked the country to join \nhim in honoring the tremendous contributions these institutions have \nmade not only to the lives of the students they serve but also to the \nhistory of this country. As a Senator from Louisiana, I am proud to \nhave four HBCUs in the State of Louisiana: Dillard University, \nGrambling State University, Southern University System, and Xavier \nUniversity.\n  For too many years in our Nation's history--HBCUs were the sole \nsource of higher education for African Americans. Today, HBCUs confer \nthe majority of the bachelor's and advanced degrees awarded to African \nAmerican students in physical science, mathematics, computer science, \nengineering, and education. There are now 105 HBCUs in existence, \nproviding an array of disciplines at both public and private medical \nschools, four-year institutions, community and junior colleges. Without \ntheir courage and commitment, this country would have been deprived of \ngenerations of African American educators, physicians, lawyers, \nscientists, and other professionals. In fact, a few of this country's \ncabinet members are alumni of HBCUs: Secretary of Labor, Alexis \nHerman--Xavier University; Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Togo West--\nHoward University; Former Secretary of Energy, Hazel O'Leary--Fisk \nUniversity; and Former Secretary of Agriculture, Mike Espy--Howard \nUniversity.\n  Like the President, I am proud to say that several members of my \nstaff are graduates of historically black colleges and universities. \nAlicia Williams, Grambling State University; Tari Bradford, Southern \nUniversity; Tony Eason, Grambling State University; Former Legislative \nDirector, Ben Cannon, Xavier University and Southern University Law \nSchool; Kaira Stelly, Southern University at New Orleans; and Roderick \nScott, Southern University.\n  In addition to educating many of our Nation's most distinguished \nAfrican American professionals, HBCUs have remained steadfast to their \ncommitment to improving the communities in which they reside and \npreserving America's history. Through countless forms of community \nservice, including tutoring programs, head start, senior citizen \nprograms, they teach their students to use their education to be men \nand women for others. Their libraries and colleges continue to serve as \nliving repositories for the writings, artifacts, and photographs \nrepresenting generations of African American history.\n  If one wants to estimate the effect that the Historically Black \nColleges and Universities have had on the history of America, ask \nyourself what would the field of education be without the contributions \nof Booker T. Washington, or science without George Washington Carver, \nor Mathematics without Dr. Nan P. Manuel, or Engineering without Dr. \nLonnie Sharp. This list is endless. Each year hundreds and thousands of \nstudents graduate from these vital institutions and are helping to \nshape the new century.\n  HBCUs have accomplished this enviable record of achievement despite \nnumerous challenges. Even with limited financial resources and serving \na relatively high number of disadvantaged students, they have kept \ntheir fees low so that no student is prohibited from accessing a \nquality education. For years, the faculty and staff have worked hard to \nprovide a nurturing and accepting environment for their students, \nencouraging them to grow challenging them to meet the highest of \nacademic standards.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in taking this \nopportunity to salute the founders, faculty, staff, and students of \nAmerica's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n  Former President Lyndon B. Johnson once said, ``Until justice is \nblind to\n\n[[Page S8879]]\n\ncolor, until education is unaware of race, until opportunity is \nunconcerned with the color of men's skins . . . emancipation will be a \nproclamation but not a fact.'' For well over a century, Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities have led the way, opened the doors and \nprovided the tools for a quality education for all.\n  I yield any time I might have remaining. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8879-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wish to announce on the floor of the \nSenator that 34 colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--join me in \na letter to the White House today.\n  We are talking about what is going on with oil prices and what is \ngoing on with home heating costs. The projections are very frightening.\n  We see home heating oil costs up 30 percent and natural gas costs up \n40 percent. For many of us in cold-weather States, this is a crisis \nissue. Specifically, we are talking about the Low-Income Energy \nAssistance Program.\n  My colleague, Senator Harkin, has been a leader in this fight for a \nlong, long time.\n  The point is that the President has about $500 million right now in \nLIHEAP emergency funding that we could get back to the cold-weather \nStates. LIHEAP is a terribly important addition to the negotiations on \nthe appropriations bill this year. Also, for funding next year, we are \nsaying add an additional $500 million. Otherwise, I think probably \nmaybe 15 percent of the people who are eligible for LIHEAP funding will \nnot get any.\n  In the State of Minnesota, you are talking about, roughly speaking, \n90,000 households. About a third of them are elderly. This is a \nlifeline program. It is not a lot--maybe $350 a year. But it helps \npeople with their heating costs.\n  What is going on now means that the heating costs are going to go way \nup. If we don't add some funding to this program, we are going to have \npeople who are cold, or they will not buy prescription drugs, or they \nwill not have food on the table. This is a huge issue.\n  I urge the President and the White House in negotiations to be strong \non funding for LIHEAP. We need the additional $500 million now and an \nadditional $500 million next year. We have to make sure this important \nlifeline program is funded.\n  I visited a lot of people in their homes. Many of them are elderly \npeople. This makes a huge difference to them. I am really worried about \nwhat is going to happen.\n  By the way, for the information of colleagues, it is interesting to \nme that we have focused on OPEC countries. An interesting story came \nout in the past couple of days that the non-OPEC oil countries, that \ncollectively produce more than half the world's crude oil, rather than \nproducing more to meet the additional demands, are producing less.\n  Exxon-Mobil--we have these mergers, acquisitions. We have monopolies \nand a cartel. I think they are in a position to fix prices. If there \never was a case to be made for antitrust action, this is a pretty \ndecisive area in the economy where we ought to be looking at these \nconglomerates and holding them accountable for putting more competition \ninto this industry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8879-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8879-S8881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     APPROPRIATIONS AND HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, Senator Moynihan, Senator Daschle, and \nothers have introduced a bill of which I am a cosponsor. It is really \nimportant. I didn't support the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I thought \nit was a mistake. I didn't understand how this projected $116 billion \nin Medicare cuts was actually going to work on the ground with our \nhospitals, HMOs, and nursing homes--you name it. The projected cost is \nactually $200 million less by way of funding.\n  Last year, we did a ``fix.'' We restored approximately an additional \n$16 billion or $17 billion. It did not solve the problem. We now have a \nbill and a request of $8 billion over the next 10 years. This is \ncritically important. In Minnesota, in 1999, 54 of our 139 hospitals \noperated with less than a 2-percent margin, and 27 percent of them are \nin the red.\n  Whether it is an inner-city hospital, such as Hennepin County \nGeneral, or rural hospitals, I tell Senators--Democrats and Republicans \nalike--that we made a huge mistake. We should have never voted for \nthese draconian cuts in Medicare reimbursements. I don't know what is \nin the world we were thinking. I didn't vote for it. But I say ``we'' \nbecause I am a Member of the Senate, and proud to be a Member of the \nSenate.\n  But we have to restore a significant amount of this funding because \nboth in the inner city and in the rural areas where there is a \ndisproportionate number of elderly and low-income people, these \nproviders are not making it. Rural hospitals will shut down. This is \nnot just a crisis for rural communities. Employers lack health care for \npeople. And Hennepin County General, which is, I think, a sacred place, \nis such an important hospital. They are struggling because of what we \ndid in 1997.\n  This piece of legislation we have introduced will call for $80 \nbillion to be restored for this funding. It is critically important if \nwe care about the care for the elderly, low-income, rural, and inner-\ncity communities.\n  I hope Democrats and Republicans alike in this final week of \nnegotiations will come together and support not only our providers but \nalso support the people in our State who really count on this care.\n  As long as we are talking about the last couple of weeks, I want to \nask Senator Harkin to share with me his reaction.\n  We had a vote yesterday. We had two appropriations bills, Postal-\nTreasury and legislative branch appropriations, which were merged \ntogether. Legislative branch got through and Postal-Treasury never came \nto the floor of the Senate. It was put into the conference report. Part \nof the idea was that you could have a salary increase, which may be \nfine, but of course we don't raise the minimum wage for people. The \nidea would be then we would have an opportunity to have up-or-down \namendments and a vote on the minimum wage. If we can raise the salaries \nabove $140,000, we ought to be able to vote for the minimum wage for \nthe working poor people of the country. Senators voted against that \nbill.\n  Now I hear that the majority leader is talking about a lame duck \nsession. Am I correct? I ask my colleague from Iowa. I would like to go \nback and forth in some discussion with my colleague from Iowa about \nthis.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Minnesota for \nbringing this up, and for his earlier statement on the plight of our \nsmall rural hospitals and relief for them. He was talking about the \nsmaller hospitals, but it is really the people in our small towns and \ncommunities who need the relief. I thank him for bringing that up.\n  I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I have been on it now for 15 \nyears. I am ranking member on the Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Subcommittee I also serve on a number of others--Agriculture, \nForeign Operations, and others.\n  I was disturbed, I say to my friend, to read in Congress Daily this \nmorning that Senate Majority Leader Lott said our failure to pass these \ntwo bills yesterday ``increases the possibility of a lame duck session \nafter the November elections.'' He told reporters: I always thought \nthat was a possibility anyway. Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman \nStevens told reporters: In my opinion, now we are ready for a \npostelection session. We just don't have time to get 11 bills through \nin 9 days.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, we have been here for 9 months, \nhaven't we? What have we been doing? What has happened to the 9 months? \nWe've done nothing. Eleven out of thirteen appropriations bills have \nnot been passed--11. Here is what's going on: The Republicans in charge \ndon't want to vote on a Patients' Bill of Rights. They don't want to \nvote on it. They don't want to vote on prescription drugs for the \nelderly. They don't want to vote on increasing the minimum wage. What \ndo they want to do? Put it off until after the election, have a lame \nduck session.\n  I don't understand how this complies with what our responsibilities \nare, what the people elected us for, what we get paid to do around \nhere. That is, to\n\n[[Page S8880]]\n\nenact legislation, to take the tough votes.\n  They don't want to do that. They want to put it off until after the \nelection, for a lame duck session. What kind of sense does that make? \nWhat kind of a statement does that make to the people of this country? \nNine months we have been here. This morning we are doing nothing. The \nChamber is empty. Yet we could be bringing these bills on the floor \nright now. We are doing nothing around here.\n  I ask my friend from Minnesota, who gains the most from the lame duck \nsession? Who gains the most by not having the votes now, but putting \nthem off until after the election? HMOs, the gun lobby, the big drug \ncompanies. I bet they are just as happy as they can be after reading \nthis morning that a lame duck session is likely because they know they \ncan come in and control a lame duck.\n  I meant to engage in a colloquy with my friend from Minnesota, but I \nam so disturbed by this, I think this needs a complete airing.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I hope other Senators will come to the \nfloor and speak on this question, including members of the majority \nparty, the majority leader included.\n  The way I look at it, you cannot help but smile with a twinkle in \nyour eye. We have had plenty of time to do the work of the people, and \nnow to say we can't get this done. Part of the proposal is that maybe a \nfew appropriators would stay here with the White House and the rest of \nus would go home and campaign. I have heard that being discussed, which \nmeans we are not here doing the work. Then the other part of it is the \nlame duck session.\n  I think this is a breakdown of representative democracy. Basically, I \nthink the majority party is trying to have it a couple of different \nways. On the one hand, as a special favor to the insurance industry, \nthey block sensible patient protection legislation. As a special favor \nto some of the bottom dwellers of commerce, they block raising the \nminimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 over 2 years. And as a special favor \nto the pharmaceutical industry, they don't want to extend prescription \ndrug benefits as a part of the Medicare program for elderly people. And \nas a special favor to some of the big packers and conglomerates, they \npass Freedom to Farm, which we call the ``freedom to fail'' bill. But \nat the same time, they don't want to be held accountable for any of \nthis. They don't want to have amendments on the floor. They don't want \nto have any votes. They don't want any accountability.\n  What they would like to do--I think the actual meaning of this \nproposal, which we are going to raise some Cain about because we are \nhere to work, about coming back for a lame duck session is that our \nRepublican colleagues want to vote on prescription drug costs after the \nelection. They want to vote on patient protection after the election. \nThey want to vote on minimum wage after the election. They want to vote \non whether we should have more teachers in schools and smaller class \nsize, and something you have been working on, some funding for \nrebuilding crumbling schools, after the election.\n\n  I don't think people in the country are going to go for that. I say \nto my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that is not the way \nrepresentative democracy works.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And we had the juvenile justice bill that included the \nschool safety provision, the child safety gun locks and included a fix \nto close the gunshow loophole. Why are they only willing to vote on \nthis important legislation after the election?\n  We have been denied--I don't want to say the Senator from Minnesota \nand I have been denied; the people of this country have been denied the \nright to have their Senators come on this floor and vote on these \nissues, denied because the majority leader won't bring it up. That is \nwhy they keep putting these conference committee bills together. They \nnow want to put together the Commerce-State-Justice bill. I wanted to \noffer an amendment to restore funding to the Byrne grants for local law \nenforcement. The Byrne grant is $100 million short from last year's \nfunding level. But I'm not allowed to do that because they want to skip \nthe process and attach to another bill.\n  The VA-HUD and Transportation--again, we haven't voted on VA and HUD. \nDo you want to know why? Because we want to do something about \nveterans' health benefits. They want to vote on that after the \nelection, too. They don't want the veterans of this country to know \nexactly how they vote on veterans' health benefits, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I may interrupt my colleague, the Senator is \nabsolutely right. This is just an extension of what has been going on. \nThe Senate is an institution where we should have the debate, the \ndeliberation. That is what this is about. By filing cloture on bills, \nby not allowing debate, by putting unrelated provisions into a \nconference report, the majority party has decided they will not allow \ndebate. The logical extension of this is, let's get out of town; let's \nnot be held accountable.\n  Regarding veterans, the veterans organizations, many of them put \ntogether what they call an independent budget. Senator Johnson of South \nDakota and I have had amendments where we get a 99-0 vote that we \ndefinitely want to add an additional $500 million because we know \nveterans have fallen between the cracks. Every time, in some conference \ncommittee or now in some omnibus appropriations bill, they never \nactually vote to put the appropriations into veterans' health care.\n  I think the Senator is right. Whether it is veterans, farmers, people \nin the country caring about education--this is all the people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. And child safety locks on guns.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. And prescription drugs.\n  So am I correct that the lame duck proposal basically adds up to \nthis: What some Republicans seem to be suggesting is, let's get out of \nhere; let's not have to vote on any of this; let's come back after the \nelection and then we will vote?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That's it. That's what they're saying. Speaker Hastert, \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, at the beginning of this year \npromised we would have all of the appropriations bills to the President \nbefore the August recess. We are at the end of September and we have \nonly 2 out of 13 through.\n  I say to my friend from Minnesota, this is the first time--and I know \nhow much he cares about education--this is the first time since 1965, \nwhen we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that we have \nfailed to reauthorize. Because of time? No, we had plenty of time. Look \nat the Chamber this morning. The Senator from Minnesota, the Senator \nfrom Iowa are here. We are doing nothing out here.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Don't say that. We are speaking. Don't say that. We \nare speaking.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What I am saying is we are not doing anything to get the \nbills through.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I'm kidding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I point out to my friend from Minnesota, in contrast, \nSenator Daschle from South Dakota, the Democrat leader, said:\n\n       Let's take them up. Let's have a debate. Don't let anybody \n     say with a straight face or with any credibility that it's \n     the Democrats holding things up. Let's get to the bills. \n     Let's get them done. Let's offer the amendments and move it \n     along.\n\n  We are ready to debate. We are ready to offer amendments. We are \nready to move the process--but we are denied. And again I say, the \npeople of this country are denied the opportunity to have us vote on \nthese measures.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I can say to my colleague, some of what I said--\neverything I said I meant, and it is meant to challenge the majority \nparty and the majority leader. But in a very serious way--the Senator \nmentioned education; it really breaks your heart, too, if you want to \ntry to the best of your ability to represent people--on the Elementary \nand Secondary Act, between myself and staff, we were in 100 schools \njust meeting with people, getting their ideas about how we could best \nhelp them. We took all their ideas. Then we worked on amendments. I was \nso excited to come on the floor and have amendments representing what \npeople said. The whole idea was to try to do good for people.\n  You cannot represent the people in your State; you cannot do good for \npeople; you cannot be a good Senator unless the Senate becomes the \nSenate again. I think it is just outrageous that\n\n[[Page S8881]]\n\nthe majority party just does not want to have the discussion, does not \nwant to have the debate, does not want to vote--apparently doesn't want \nto vote. I just think that is not the way the Senate should operate, \nand it makes it very difficult to do good for people.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, it seems to me what we are facing is \nthat the majority party, in charge of the Senate, in charge of the \nHouse, they want to replace the tough votes we have to take around \nhere, that we should be taking around here--they want to replace the \ntough votes with slick 30-second TV ads to try to get through this \nelection. That is breaking down, I think, the people's respect for the \nSenate.\n  How can you have respect for an institution when we don't get \nanything done around here? When we say the only time we want to take up \nthe tough issues is after the election, when there will be people here \nvoting on these issues who may have been defeated or maybe not running \nagain, what kind of responsibility, I ask the Senator from Minnesota, \nis that? We are shirking our responsibility. I hear more and more \npeople saying they are getting dismayed with how the Congress is \noperating. People ought to be dismayed with the way this place is \nrunning right now. We are shirking our responsibilities around here in \nthis regard.\n  As I said, I have been on this Appropriations Committee for 15 years. \nI have been in the Senate for 15 years. I say to my friend from \nMinnesota, this is the most do-nothing Congress, the most do-nothing \nSenate I have seen in 15 years. It is really sad.\n  The Senator talked about visiting schools. I spent all my summer \ngoing around visiting elderly people in the State of Iowa and getting \nstory after story about their costs of prescription drugs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is not something they need help with 10 years from \nnow. They need it now. That is why we need to bring that legislation \nout here and vote on prescription drugs, helping those people out. But \nwe are precluded from doing so. I am hopeful perhaps--maybe we ought to \nstart, I say to my friend from Minnesota, maybe we ought to start \nasking unanimous consent to bring some of these bills out here. Let's \nbring them up. Let's see if the majority party will object to bringing \nup the bills on prescription drugs, on the juvenile justice bill, on \nminimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights, Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. Let's spend the next 9 days or whatever we have working \non some of this legislation.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from Iowa, that \nmay very well be what we do. I hope this suggestion of a possible lame \nduck session is an idea that will last about 1 hour and that will be \nthe end of it. And I hope our discussion on the floor will be part of \nputting an end to it. But I am pleased to join with my colleague. I am \npleased to start asking unanimous consent to bring up this legislation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. We ought to think about some way. Thinking about ``lame \nduck,'' I don't know where that term ever came from. I have to look it \nup. I am sure there is some history around here about what a lame duck \nsession means, where that name came from. But it seems to me that a \nlame duck is a sick duck by definition. We don't need a sick duck \naround here doing the people's business. We don't need a lame duck \nsession around here to be taking these tough votes. We ought to be \nstanding up and doing it right now, not waiting for a sick duck to do \nit.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. I think we will be back on the \nfloor and we may very well be trying our level best to put these issues \nback on the floor. I will be proud to do it with my colleague from \nIowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8881-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8881-S8882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ACTIONS\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand another disturbing event has \nhappened this morning. I am informed that the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has met this morning and has refused to report out any more \njudges--refused to do so; just stopped. Again, this flies in the face \nof what our responsibilities are supposed to be around here. If someone \ndoesn't like a person, or they don't think they are qualified--I should \nnot say ``doesn't like''--if they don't think they are qualified to \nassume a judgeship, let them vote against that person. But that doesn't \ngive them a reason to hold someone up in committee.\n  I am speaking specifically of my Iowa constituent, Bonnie Campbell, \nformer attorney general with the State of Iowa who is now pending in \nthe Judiciary Committee for a vacancy on the Court of Appeals for the \nEighth Circuit.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for just a second? I just want \nto make sure, I just want to ask the Senator, Bonnie Campbell has \ndirected all of the work against violence against women; is that \ncorrect? My wife Sheila works closely with her. She has done phenomenal \nwork, has just a great reputation; am I correct?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Exactly; the Senator is exactly correct. Bonnie Campbell \nhas, for the last 4 years, directed the Office of Violence Against \nWomen in the Department of Justice. I can't find one person on either \nside of the aisle who says she hasn't done a superb job.\n  She has received accolades from all over this country about guiding \nand directing that office. She is widely supported by the American Bar \nAssociation, by people on both sides of the aisle, the party in her \nhome State of Iowa who know the kind of outstanding person she is, how \nbright she is, how capable she is, what a great job she did as attorney \ngeneral in the State of Iowa, and now in the Violence Against Women \nOffice in the Department of Justice.\n  People on both sides of the aisle support her nomination, and yet the \nSenate Judiciary Committee refuses to report her out of committee. She \nhas had her hearing. That has all been taken care of. All the paperwork \nis done. She has answered all the questions.\n  I say to the Judiciary Committee: Report her nomination out. If for \nsome reason you think she is unqualified--I cannot imagine why--then \nyou can cast your vote, but at least let's bring the nominee to the \nfloor.\n  There are 22 vacancies on the appeals court. That is nearly half the \nemergency vacancies in the Federal court system. With the growing \nnumber of vacancies in the Federal courts, these positions should be \nfilled as soon as possible with qualified people. Yet the Judiciary \nCommittee refuses to move.\n  Ms. Campbell received a hearing this summer. She would serve this \nposition on the Eighth Circuit with honor, fairness, and distinction. \nShe has the solid support from me and my Iowa colleague, Senator \nGrassley. Her nomination should be sent to the Senate floor.\n  Bonnie Campbell has had a long history in law, starting in 1984 with \nher private practice in Des Moines where she worked on cases involving \nmedical malpractice, employment discrimination, personal injury, real \nestate, family law--a broadly based legal practice. She was then \nelected attorney general of Iowa in 1990, the first woman to hold that \noffice in our State. She managed an office of 200 people, including 120 \nattorneys, again, handling a wide variety of criminal and civil matters \nfor State agencies and officers. As attorney general, she gained high \nmarks from all ends of the political spectrum as someone who was \ncommitted to enforcing the law, reducing crime, and protecting our \nconsumers.\n  In 1995, she was appointed director of the Violence Against Women \nOffice in the Department of Justice. In that position, she has played a \ncritical role in the implementation of the violence against women \nprovisions of the 1994 Crime Act. Again, she has won the respect from a \nwide range of interests with different points of views on this issue. \nShe has been and is today responsible for the overall coordination and \nagenda of the Department of Justice efforts to combat violence against \nwomen.\n\n[[Page S8882]]\n\n  I have known Bonnie Campbell for many years. She is a person of \nunquestioned integrity, keen intellect, and outstanding judgment. She \nhas a great sense of fairness and evenhandedness. These qualities and \nher significant experience make her an ideal candidate for this circuit \ncourt position. Her nomination has been strongly supported by many of \nher colleagues, including the present Iowa attorney general, the \npresident of the Iowa State Police Association and, of course, the \nAmerican Bar Association.\n  Finally, we need a judicial system that reflects the diversity of \nthis Nation. We need more women and people of color on the bench. Only \n20 percent of all federal judge position in the country are filled by \nwomen, according to the Justice Department.\n  We have a backlog of judicial vacancies. It is only fair to move \nthem, and we ought to move all of them out, especially Bonnie Campbell. \nShe has had her hearing. Her nomination is sitting in the Judiciary \nCommittee. If the reports I just heard are correct, the Judiciary \nCommittee is stonewalling, refusing to move her name out to the floor \nof the Senate.\n  As I said earlier, this is another indication of how the leadership \nin this Senate is shirking its responsibilities to the people of this \ncountry--to put it off, delay, stonewall, don't do anything--when we \nhave a crying need to fill these vacancies.\n\n  I am very dismayed. I had talked with the majority leader and the \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and others about \nthis. And, Senator Grassley and I had remained hopeful that her name \nwould be reported out so the Senate could act on it, but it seems we \nhave been led astray, that it is the intention of the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to lock up this nomination and not report out \nBonnie Campbell.\n  The women of this country ought to know that. The women of this \ncountry ought to know that a uniquely qualified, eminently qualified \nindividual to take a vacant position on the Eighth Circuit Court of \nAppeals is being denied by the Judiciary Committee her right to have a \nvote. Is that what the Judiciary Committee is telling the women of this \ncountry--that they need to take a back seat, that they will not act on \nthese judicial nominees if you are a woman, qualified as Bonnie \nCampbell is?\n  I am very upset about this. I had in good faith been reluctant to \nexercise my rights as a Senator to in any way inhibit or do anything \nthat would stop the flow of legislation or anything on the Senate floor \nbecause I had, I guess mistakenly, been of the opinion, or at least \nadvised, if we just waited a due length of time, Bonnie Campbell's name \nwould be reported out. Again, I think I was obviously mistaken, that my \nfaith--my good faith--was not responded to in kind.\n  This is not right. It is not right to treat a person like this. It is \nnot right to block someone who has had their hearing and is widely \nsupported on both sides of the aisle. It might be a different story if \nthere were a lot of controversy about Bonnie Campbell, but there is \nnone. As I said, Senator Grassley, a conservative Republican, is openly \nsupporting her. Republicans in my State have been supportive of her \ngetting on the Eighth Circuit.\n  This is, I think, a black mark on the operations of the Senate, \nanother indication of how the leadership of this Senate refuses to do \nthe people's business, to let things come out on the floor so we can \nvote up or down. Bonnie Campbell is being denied her right, I believe, \nas a citizen of this country to have her nomination acted upon by the \nfull Senate, and it is a bad mark on the Senate.\n  I am hopeful the Judiciary Committee will reconsider its action--\nrather, its inaction. The Judiciary Committee can meet tomorrow, they \ncan meet Monday, they can meet any day the chairman wants them to meet \nand report out this nominee. I was under the impression that was going \nto happen today, but obviously I had the wrong impression of what the \nSenate Judiciary Committee was going to do.\n  I urge the chairman to convene the Judiciary Committee and report \nBonnie Campbell's name out before this session is over.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 \nminutes before those who have time reserved come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8882-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8882-S8883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REFORMS VERSUS ROADBLOCKS\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been in some meetings this morning. \nOf course, we do not have any more committee hearings going on because \nthe other side has objected to that. I haven't listened to everything, \nbut I heard enough to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle \ncomplaining about not moving forward.\n  So I just believe it is really important to talk a little bit about \nthe whole idea of what has been going on here now for several months, \nwhere we have been seeking to make some reforms and seeking to move \nforward, moving a number of bills, and finding nothing but roadblocks \nfrom the other side of the aisle. It is almost hilarious to hear that \nkind of conversation when the facts are that we have had nothing but \nroadblocks coming from the other side of the aisle. And it is too bad.\n  We are down to where we don't have a great deal of time, and the \nnotion that we continue to bring up the same topics, over and over and \nover again, simply because these folks want to make it an issue as \nopposed to a solution, frankly, gets pretty redundant and tiresome.\n  Let me just mention a few of the things specifically that have been \ntroublesome.\n\n  S. 2045, amending the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to \nH-1B nonimmigrant aliens: Senator Lott offered, on the 15th of \nSeptember, a UC for both sides to bring the bill to the floor; objected \nto by Democrats.\n  S. 2497, the McCain-Lieberman bill dealing with the entertainment \nindustry's marketing of inappropriate R-rated videos: In response to \nthe FTC report, Senator Santorum offered a UC to bring it to the floor. \nThe other side objected.\n  Four district judges in Illinois and Arizona: Asked to be brought to \nthe floor; the minority leader objected.\n  S. 2507, the intelligence authorization: We tried to bring that to \nthe floor and get a UC; no response from the minority leader.\n  H.R. 1776, the housing construction bill, with 32 cosponsors, \nincluding a dozen Democrats: The leader requested UC to go to \nconference; objected to by that side of the aisle.\n  H.R. 3615, the Rural Local Broadcast Signal Act, a satellite bill so \nwe can have local-to-local broadcasting in rural areas: The leader \nasked for a UC to go to conference; objected to by the Democrats on \nthat side of the aisle.\n  The Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Act, which the \nPresident and the other side of the aisle, along with Vice President \nGore, claim they support: The leader asked for a UC September 7 to call \nit up. It was the sixth time in the 106th Congress that the Democrats \nhave blocked the lockbox from coming up.\n  It takes a lot of nerve to get up and talk about not moving forward \nwhen these are the kinds of things that have actually taken place.\n  S. 2, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act: We spent 2 weeks of \nfloor time this spring and summer--2 weeks--debating and voting on \namendments. The other side of the aisle has blocked two UCs--including \n20 additional amendments--which have kept us from finishing this \nmeasure.\n  It is really almost laughable to talk about that. What we need to do \nis to move forward. What we need to do is get these bills out, have our \ndisagreements, vote on them, and get the job done that we are here to \ndo. We tried to do that yesterday; we couldn't get it done.\n  Let me share with you another batch of information. So far in the \n106th Congress well over half the votes cast on amendments are \ninitiatives from the other side of the aisle; that is, 231 out of 403 \nrollcall votes. Many of these votes are repetitive votes on their \nfavorite agenda items which are out\n\n[[Page S8883]]\n\nthere more to create an issue than they are to create a solution. And \nthey say they don't have a voice.\n  Further, they have continued to block action on important issues for \nAmericans, including education reform, meaningful tax relief, \nprotecting Social Security, Medicare. We have pushed for effective \nreforms. That side of the aisle has continued to throw up roadblocks. \nWe are continuing to look to the future and getting these items \naccomplished. Unfortunately, our friends continue with the roadblocks.\n  Total rollcall votes during the 106th Congress, through September 11, \n611; rollcall votes on amendments, 403. Those asked for on Democrat-\nsponsored amendments, 231; Republican-sponsored amendments, 172.\n  Votes on the Democrat agenda: Votes to raise taxes or to reduce tax \nrelief, 55; votes to increase Federal education spending, 35; Federal \nfunds to hire new teachers as opposed to having local decisions, 9; \nFederal funds for school construction as opposed to letting people \ndecide for themselves, 5; Federal funds for afterschool, 6; votes to \nfurther regulate gun owners, 13. Now, that is an issue that people \ndisagree on, but how many times can we continue to bring it up? How \nmany times can we have votes on it? How many times can it be used to \nslow down the progress toward getting our job done? Minimum wage \npackage, 5; the minimum wage package is in a bill they have held up.\n  This idea of our friends on the other side getting up and talking \nabout things not happening here is ludicrous, absolutely ludicrous, in \nterms of the kinds of issues that have been put up over there as \nroadblocks. It is time for us to get on with it. Let's take a look at \nwhat we have before us. Let's have our debate; Let's have our exchange; \nand let's vote and move forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the pending question before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed \nnot to exceed 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the end of the 106th Congress is fast \napproaching, I am deeply dismayed about the prospects of completing \naction on the thirteen annual appropriations bills for Fiscal Year \n2001, which begins October 1st. Unfortunately, as has happened far too \noften in recent years, much of the work on appropriations bills remains \nto be done. There is really no valid excuse for the Senate's failure to \ndo its appropriations work. The House has done its work in a timely \nfashion.\n  Yet, to date, only two of the Fiscal Year 2001 appropriations bills \nhave been signed into law--Military Construction and Defense. Of the \nremaining eleven bills, four have yet to even be brought up for debate \nin the full Senate. Those bills are Treasury, Commerce-Justice-State, \nVA-HUD, and The District of Columbia. As Members are aware, the \nconference report on H.R. 4516, the Fiscal Year 2001 Legislative Branch \nAppropriations is divided--broken into two divisions. Division A \ncontains the conference agreement for the Legislative Branch bill. \nDivision B, which was inserted into the Legislative Branch Bill without \nany input by Democratic Members of either the House or Senate, contains \nthe entire Treasury-General Government Appropriations Act for Fiscal \nYear 2001. This was done despite the fact that the Senate has never \ntaken up the Treasury-General Government Appropriations bill at all. In \naddition, again without any input from the Democratic Members of the \nHouse or Senate, a tax measure to repeal the telephone excise tax was \ninserted in this same conference report. The measure was soundly \ndefeated in this body yesterday, as I believe it should have been.\n  Here we are with only nine calendar days left before the beginning of \nFiscal Year 2001, and we have enacted only two of the thirteen annual \nappropriations bills and had them signed into law; two more were \ncontained in the conference report on H.R. 4516, namely the Legislative \nBranch and Treasury-General Government bills. That leaves nine fiscal \nyear 2001 appropriations bills remaining. Since, on yesterday, we did \ndefeat the conference report, actually the Legislative Branch and \nTreasury-General Government bills have not been acted on, we have \neleven bills remaining.\n  To conform with the Constitutionally envisioned process, all four of \nthese bills should be passed in the Senate before being taken up in \nconferences with the other body. To shortcut that process means that \nthe full Senate never has an opportunity to amend these bills or debate \nprovisions in them. Especially when it comes to bills which spend the \ntaxpayers' money, we ought to take the time to allow debate and \namendment by the full membership of this body. I hear all of this talk \nabout tax cuts and giving the people back their hard-earned money. How \ndoes that square with the rather cavalier attitude we sometimes exhibit \nhere when it comes to appropriations bills? Do we forget, that when it \ncomes to appropriations bills, we are spending the people's money? \nDon't Members of the Senate feel an obligation to let the full Senate \nscrutinize, debate, and, if necessary, amend, bills that allocate those \nhard-earned tax dollars? No public debate by the Senate on the billions \nof dollars contained in these bills for programs and projects means \nthat the public is denied critical information about the use of the \npublic's money. In a body formulated to foster debate and to protect \nthe rights of the minority view, it is especially irresponsible to \nabdicate those functions when it comes to spending the people's tax \ndollars.\n  There is plenty of blame to go around as to why the Commerce-Justice-\nState, VA-HUD, and DC bills have not been brought up, as well as the \nTreasury bill. I do not seek to point the finger at anybody.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the members of the \nAppropriations Committee have done their very best to work on these \nbills, to report them. The Commerce-Justice-State bill has been before \nthe Senate long enough that we could have passed it, we could have \nstayed in on Fridays and, if need be, on some Saturdays. We have done \nthat before, and we could have gotten that bill passed and, at the same \ntime, let Senators have the chance to offer amendments to it. That is \nwhat the process is all about.\n  The leadership too often files cloture on appropriations bills and \nother matters, in order to limit the number of controversial and \npolitically loaded amendments that can be offered by Senators on the \nminority side of the aisle. Democratic Members too often bring up \n``message'' amendments over and over again on appropriations bills \nbecause they find little opportunity to have those matters debated by \nthe Senate on other bills.\n  I have to say that the authorization committees, some of them at \nleast, do not do their work and, as a consequence, the action and the \nresponsibility then falls upon the Appropriations Committee. Members do \nnot have an opportunity to offer amendments to authorization bills that \nought to have been reported and brought to the floor. When those \nauthorization committees do not act, naturally appropriations bills are \nthe only vehicles to which Members can offer amendments that they would \notherwise offer to the authorization bill.\n  Every action has a reaction. Polarization breeds polarization. \nNevertheless, we must find a way to accommodate the needs of all \nSenators, as well as fulfill the responsibility of the leadership to \nmove must-pass legislation.\n  This is not the first year that the regular appropriations process \nhas broken down, but I urge us all to work on a bipartisan basis to \nensure that it will be the last. Let us call a truce to the perennial \nwarfare that we fight over these appropriations bills. Let us stop the \ndrift that leads us to short cut the deliberative function of this \nSenate and all too often produces mammoth omnibus bills with everything \nbut grandpa's false teeth thrown in. This\n\n[[Page S8884]]\n\none grandpa who does not have false teeth. Mine would not go in.\n  Huge omnibus appropriations bills make a mockery of the legislative \nprocess, and sending appropriations bills direct to conference without \nSenate action on them also makes a mockery of the legislative process. \nFor FY 1997, 1999, and 2000, Congress resorted to the adoption of \nomnibus appropriations acts which contained a number of appropriations \nbills, some of which had never been brought up in the Senate. Those \nomnibus acts also contained massive amounts of legislative matter, as \nwell as tax cuts--legislative matter that never saw the light of day on \nthe Senate floor.\n  For fiscal year 1999, the omnibus appropriations package enacted at \nthe end of the session contained eight appropriations bills, as well as \na tax bill totaling some $9.2 billion, and more than 60 major \nlegislative proposals. Appropriations subcommittee chairmen and ranking \nmembers were not involved in a number of major decisions in their areas \nof jurisdiction, nor were the full committee chairmen and ranking \nmembers included in the decisions regarding the tax bill or the major \nlegislative proposals. In all, that FY 1999 omnibus package totaled \nsome 3,980 pages. It was wrapped together and run off on copy machines \nand presented to the two Houses as an unamendable conference report. \nThat measure provided funding of nearly $500 billion and more than half \nof 3,980 pages contained legislative provisions. No one could possibly \nhave known everything that was included in that omnibus monstrosity, \njust as no Member could have known what was in the omnibus bill for FY \n1997, or for that of FY 2000. But we are headed in that direction \nagain.\n  When we wait until the end of a session to take action on the \noverwhelming majority of appropriations bills, when we allow ourselves \nto be pressured by time, when we are forced to hurry because we are \nabout to adjourn, it is an open invitation to the executive branch to \nsit down at the legislative table.\n  The Constitution vests the power of the purse in the legislative \nbranch. That is the House and Senate. That is where the Constitution \nvests the power of the purse. Yet the way we are acting, the way we \ndelay and the results that come from such delay in the end constitute \nan open invitation for the executive branch to come to the tables.\n  In that environment, most Senators are not in the room when the \ndecisions are made. The President's men and the President's priorities \ncarry great weight. It is late. The President's signature is needed, so \nthe White House has the trump hand. Having squandered the whole year on \nmeaningless posturing and bickering back and forth--\n  I say back and forth. That means both sides. I do not stand here and \naccuse either side of having a monopoly on the bickering. We are all \ninvolved. But we are much more likely to yield to the administration's \nevery demand then to complete our work.\n  I am hopeful we can avoid such a process for fiscal year 2001. I am \nencouraged by the fact that a number of conferences are either under \nway or soon will begin. I was in one yesterday afternoon, last evening, \nand this morning.\n  I urge the leadership to find a way to bring up the appropriations \nbills which have not seen Senate action for debate and amendment in the \nSenate. I think it would be useful for both leaders, if I might presume \nto make a suggestion, to appoint a group of Senators to discuss these \nremaining appropriations bills, and what amendments our colleagues deem \nmost important to be offered. Let us reach out across our respective \naisles and find a way to do our business without resorting to an always \ncontentious, usually counterproductive, lame-duck session. That would \nbe the responsible way to do business. That is the fair way to do \nbusiness. That would be the right way to conduct the people's affairs.\n  The American public is disenchanted with politics as usual and with \nthe constant warfare that seems to continually be waged in Washington. \nWe must recommit ourselves to working together in the spirit of \ncooperation to ensure that we find a way to fulfill our duties and our \noaths of office as U.S. Senators.\n  Nobody looks good in this annual mad dash to complete work on \nspending bills that should have been done months before. There are no \nwinners here.\n  The Republicans don't win; the Democrats don't win. The people lose. \nThe result is an institutional erosion that we see going on. The Senate \nis losing its powers, it is losing its prerogatives, they are being \ntaken from us, when we do not let bills come up and be debated and be \namended by Senators. There are no winners.\n  There are no gold, silver, or even bronze medalists. When we engage \nin this sloppy, annual relay race to get the job done at all costs, the \nbaton always gets dropped, and the losers, once again, are the people \nwe represent and the trust they have in us.\n  The Senate--the institution, the one place in which the people's \ninterests can be debated at length, and where bills can be amended, and \nwhere a check can be made on the House of Representatives, as the \nframers intended, and where a check can be exercised against an \noverreaching executive branch, when that is short circuited--the Senate \nloses its powers, its prerogatives go by the wayside, and the \ninterests, the freedoms, and the liberties of the American people \nsuffer.\n  It is time that we talk about these things. I am the ranking member \non the Appropriations Committee. I am very, very, very concerned. I was \nup at 3 o'clock this morning working on a speech, not this one, but one \nthat I still intend to make about this very subject.\n  Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire \nfor his consideration and courtesy in allowing me to go forward. I hope \nI have not kept him waiting unduly.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend from New Hampshire allow me to enter into a \nbrief dialog with the Senator from West Virginia? It will be very \nbrief.\n  I say, through the Chair to my friend from West Virginia, that I do \nnot believe the minority got us in this situation we are in. But I do \nsay that we will do everything within our power to try to get ourselves \nout of the hole that we are in.\n  It is certainly not the intention of the minority to hold up \nCongress, to hold up these appropriations bills. As a longtime member \nof the Appropriations Committee, and someone who has the greatest \nrespect and admiration for the ranking member on the Appropriations \nCommittee, I think it is important we work with the majority in trying \nto figure out a way out of this. Certainly we are willing to do that.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Democratic whip. I know he is willing to do \njust what he says. He wants to cooperate.\n  We have to save this institution. There are Senators in this body who \nhave never seen the institution work as it was meant to work. I will \nhave more to say about that later. But there are Members in this \ninstitution who think that this is the way the Senate has always \nworked. It is not. And I am not pointing fingers at anybody. I like \nboth leaders. But we have to do something. We just must avoid coming \nback after the election. That is a disservice to the Members of the \nother body. They have done their work on these appropriations bills and \nsent them over here. Now we ought to do ours. And it is a disservice to \nthe American people.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I spent all morning with you in a \nconference on the Interior appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. It was a difficult bill. But that is the way things are \nsupposed to be done around here.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is the process.\n  Mr. REID. The process. And now, sometime today, there is going to be \na bill reported out of that conference committee that will be brought \nto the respective bodies that will be approved.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. It is a nice piece of work. If the White House does not \nlike it, they can do whatever they want with it, but the legislative \nbodies have spoken. It will pass overwhelming, that bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes. We have a duty. We have a responsibility.\n  Now, I have been leader. I have been the majority leader, and I have \nbeen the minority leader, and I have been the majority leader again. I \nknow what the problems and the pressures and the travails and the \ntribulations are of a majority leader. And I know what the\n\n[[Page S8885]]\n\ntribulations and trials of a minority leader are. So I am well \nacquainted with their problems. I have had them all. I have been there. \nMy footprints are still there. It isn't the quality of our life--that \nthe people send us here for. It is the quality of our work on behalf of \nthe people who send us here.\n\n  I had bed check votes at 10 o'clock on Monday mornings. There are \npeople who sit at the desk in front of me and there are some few \nSenators still in this body who will remember that: Bed check votes at \n10 o'clock on Monday mornings. But I alerted my colleagues: That is \nwhat we are going to have. And we are going to have votes on Fridays. \nWe are not quitting at 12. Now, in return for that, we are going to \nwork 3 weeks, and then we are going to be out 1 week. So you can go \nhome and see your constituents and get an understanding of what their \nneeds are. But 3 weeks we are going to be here. You are off 1 week. We \nare going to be here 3 weeks.\n  And they loved it. Senators loved it. They knew I meant business. And \nI took the attitude: If you don't like me as leader--you voted me in--\nthen you can vote me out. But as long as I am leader, I am going to \nlead. I may not have many who will follow me, but I will do what I \nthink is right for this institution.\n  Well, my speech did not go over well with a few, but take a look at \nthe record of that 100th Congress. That was a great Congress. That is \nthe way we worked it.\n  I understand--as I say, I like both of our leaders. I personally have \ngreat admiration for Mr. Lott and for Mr. Daschle. They have their \nproblems. And we have to help them. But let's draw back here and think \nof the institution. The most important thing in the world is not for me \nto be reelected. That is not the most important. The most important \nthing is for me to do my duty to this Senate--to the Senate, to the \nConstitution, and to the people who send me here. And if it means I \nhave to work early and late, so be it.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator, and thank the Senator from New \nHampshire again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It was Senator Lincoln from \nArkansas.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. All right. I think the issue with Senator \nLincoln, to the best of my knowledge, has been resolved satisfactorily. \nIf that is not the case, then we can delay action.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have spent \napproximately an hour on this matter. We have had a number of \nconversations. I appreciate the work of the chairman and the \nsubcommittee chair, Senator Voinovich. I have been assured by the \nSenator from Arkansas that if there is a problem in the underlying \nappropriations process, they will work with the people in the House to \nalleviate that problem to the best of their ability.

Mr. President, I say to my colleagues \nthat there are amendments under the unanimous-consent agreement by \nSenators Torricelli, Warner, Voinovich, and Feingold.\n  I say to my colleagues who have those amendments, if they could \nproceed to the floor, the intention would be to try to get these \namendments offered as soon as possible, knowing that Members do have \nairplanes to catch. We are hoping to yield back some of the debate time \nin order to get out a bit earlier. That will take the cooperation of \nall Members, especially those Members who are offering amendments or \nwho have asked for time to debate other matters within this timeframe.\n  With the cooperation of Members, we could wrap it up hopefully by 6 \no'clock or 7 o'clock. Without the cooperation of Members, it will go \nlonger. It will be up to the leader as to how he will proceed with any \nvotes.\n  I am very pleased to bring before the Senate the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2000.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4164\n\n              (Purpose: To provide a complete substitute)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent we move to the \nmanagers' amendment, accept it, and it be considered original text for \nthe purpose of further amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] for himself and \n     Mr. Baucus, proposes an amendment numbered 4164.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The committee has worked very diligently \nto reach this point. It was quite a challenge: 99 Senators and me. We \nhad a lot of projects. We had a lot of differences of opinion and a lot \nof things to work through. We worked very hard personally, wherever \npossible, wherever I needed to, with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, to try to get accommodation for this bill. As it has been done \nsince the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, the committee used a \nstrict set of criteria to determine whether or not these projects would \nbe included. Only those projects that met those criteria were included \nin this bill. As we know from many of the\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\nhearings we had over the last year or so, there is a backlog of Corps \nprojects which, with the help of Senator Voinovich, Senator Baucus, and \nothers, we are trying to clear. We stuck to our criteria.\n  We received over 300 requests on harbor dredging, environmental \nrestoration, flood control, a number of items in which the Army Corps \nwould be involved. My colleagues and I drafted a bill that authorizes \n22 new projects, containing 65 project-related provisions or \nmodifications, and authorizes 40 feasibility studies--very complex, \ntime consuming, a lot of detail, a lot of work at the staff and Member \nlevel to get there.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of Senator Baucus and his staff \nthroughout this process, as well as Senator Voinovich on our side. Not \neven one-third of those 300 projects made the cut. I am proud of that. \nIt is a reflection of the strength of the criteria that we worked so \nhard to keep in the bill and include in the bill, to stick to those \ncriteria, trying not to make exceptions, because once you make \nexceptions, it opens the door to more and more projects which are not \nsignificant or important.\n  Our bill does not contain cost share waivers, environmental \ninfrastructure projects, or authorized projects that are not \ntechnically sound, environmentally acceptable, or economically \njustified. Those are the criteria. I am very proud of that. We stuck to \nthose criteria. We took some heat from some Members, but we thought we \nwere fair to everyone by sticking to the criteria.\n  I commend Senators Voinovich and Baucus for their hard work, and \ntheir staffs, and, in addition to Senators Voinovich and Baucus, \nSenator Mack and Senator Graham. Senator Graham, of course, is a member \nof our committee. Senator Mack is not. But we treated Senator Mack as \nif he were a member of the committee. They had full input because of \nthe Everglades issue which is such an important part of this bill. It \nwas a pleasure to work with all of them in putting this bill together. \nIt was very, very difficult.\n  This was a freestanding bill, the water 2000 provision, to restore \nAmerica's Everglades. I introduced it with my colleagues, Senators \nBaucus, Voinovich, Graham, and Mack, on June 27, 2000. The committee \nfavorably reported out our Everglades bill by a bipartisan vote of 17-\n1, with an amendment to include the Everglades. It was an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan vote. I think we worked through this process \nin a bipartisan manner both at the staff level and at the Member level.\n  In January of this year in south Florida at the Everglades, I made a \npromise to the people of that State and to the Nation, with Senator \nGraham by my side, as well as Senator Voinovich, that Everglades \nrestoration would be the top priority of this committee. Speaking for \nmyself, it would be my top priority as the chairman. It certainly has \nbeen Senator Baucus' top priority as he has worked with me throughout \nthis process.\n\n  Since that markup, the committee, the State of Florida, the \nadministration, industry groups, environmental groups, and two Indian \ntribes impacted by the Everglades restoration have all worked \ndiligently on the managers' amendment that we all can support. I am \npleased to report that S. 2796 with the managers' amendment is strongly \nsupported by all vital interests. It is truly bipartisan. It is truly \nhistoric.\n  A few moments ago, Senator Byrd spoke on the floor about some of the \npartisanship. It is out there. We all do it. There is a time and place \nfor it. But we didn't have it in this bill. Whatever differences we had \nwith individual Members, they had nothing to do with what somebody had \nnext to their name.\n  I will briefly comment on the Everglades issue and then turn it over \nto my ranking member, Senator Baucus.\n  We might ask, Why is Everglades restoration necessary? The Everglades \nis the biggest part of this water resources development bill, and that \nhas been controversial because other Members did not get as much as \nFlorida. But Florida has a special issue. The Everglades are very \nspecial. It is a very environmentally sensitive region of the country. \nIt clearly is a treasure. I want my colleagues to understand why we \nbelieve time is of the essence.\n  This is a national treasure. It is a vast freshwater marsh which once \nwas connected by the flow of water, a sheet of water, a river of water, \nflowing south from Lake Okeechobee all the way into the Gulf of Mexico, \nand once covered 18,000 square miles. It is the heart of a unique \nbiologically productive ecosystem.\n  But now the Everglades is in peril. It is half the size it used to \nbe. What happened? In 1948, we had a Federal flood control project, and \n1.7 billion gallons of water a day as a result of that project are now \nflowing into the sea, totally lost. We asked the Army Corps to do this \nbecause we had flooding. We basically created a dam. On one side of \nthat dam is the dammed-up water; on the other side essentially is a \ndesert. That is not what the Everglades ecosystem was designed to be. \nSo we needed to correct it. The Federal Government, the Congress, and \nthe administration's direction at the time, in 1948, urged us to do it. \nThey spent the money to do it. Now I think it is the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility, in conjunction with Florida, to correct \nit. That is exactly what this bill does. The original Central and \nSouthern Florida Project was done with the best of intentions--the \nFederal Government simply had to act when devastating floods took \nthousand of lives prior to the project's construction. Unfortunately, \nthe very success of the Central and Southern Florida Project disrupted \nthe natural sheet flow of water through the so-called ``River of \nGrass,'' altering or destroying the habitat for many species of native \nplants, mammals, reptiles, fish, and wading birds.\n\n  We are going to recapture that wasted water, store it, and redirect \nit, when needed, to the natural system in the South Florida ecosystem. \nOn July 1, 1999, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers submitted to Congress \na ``Restudy'' of the Central and Southern Florida Project. Called the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, this blueprint provides the \ndetails and layout of the 30-year restoration project.\n  The bipartisan Everglades legislation approves the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan as the overall framework to restore the \necological health of the Florida Everglades. The bill also includes \nauthorization of the initial projects necessary to get restoration \nunderway. Specifically, the bill includes authorization of 10 \nconstruction projects. These projects, which employ already proven, \nstandard technologies, were carefully selected by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the South Florida Water Management District and included \nin the plan as the projects that would, once constructed, have \nimmediate benefits to the natural system. Almost right away, the plan \ngets at restoring the natural sheet flow that years of human \ninterference has interrupted.\n  If anybody has been in south Florida, been to the Everglades, you \nknow what the Tamiami Trail is. Basically, that is a dam that blocks \nthe flow of that water. We will begin the process of punching holes in \nthat dam and allowing that sheet of water to flow once again.\n  The bill includes authorization of four pilot projects to test new \nand innovative technologies that may be employed in future restoration \nprojects.\n  There is a requirement that future components of the plan must have a \nfavorable Project Implementation Reports [PIR] from the Secretary of \nthe Army, similar to a Chief of Engineer's report. Future projects will \nbe authorized through the biennial Water Resources Development Act.\n  Adaptive management and assessment. One of my favorite aspects of the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is its inherent flexibility. \nIf we learn something new about the ecosystem, perfect our modeling \ntechniques, or just plain see that something is not working right, \nthrough the concept of adaptive management and assessment, we can \nmodify the plan as new technologies and new methods become \navailable. Much is made of this and much more will be made of this \nissue in the debate. This is a 36-year plan. This is a risk. It is not \na sure thing. We take risks all the time in the money we spend, whether \nit is for a weapons system or cancer research. I am sure we would not \nsay we haven't found a cure for cancer so therefore let's not risk any \nmore money in research. We are saying if we do not do something to save \nthe Everglades, we will lose the Everglades. So we have to\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\ntry. We believe, on the best science we can find, that we have \nreasonable expectations here to invest approximately $4 billion over 36 \nyears. That is a can of Coke a year for every American. That is not a \nlot of investment. I think we would be willing to do that so our \ngrandchildren can see alligators and wading birds and enjoy the \nEverglades as I have with my children on many, many occasions.\n\n  So we have adaptive management. It is a great concept. If it doesn't \nwork, we stop and we try something else. We are not locked into \nsomething for the next 36 years. We are going to perfect our \ntechniques. If something isn't working right, we are going to modify \nit.\n  We have ``assurances'' that the environment will be the primary \nbeneficiary of the water made available through CERP. The overarching \nobject of the Plan is to restore, preserve, and protect the south \nFlorida ecosystem, while meeting the water supply, flood protection, \nand agricultural needs of the region. These assurances also protect \nexisting water users, such as the Seminole Tribe of Florida's water \ncompact.\n  This bill has unprecedented broad, bipartisan support. My colleague \nSenator Graham has compared our feat to achieving peace between the \nHatfields and the McCoys. This truly is a remarkable accomplishment \nthat deserves recognition by the Senate in the form of swift passage.\n  Every major constituency involved in Everglades restoration has \nwritten us a letter of support and I will later ask unanimous consent \nthat these letters be printed in the Record. Also, in addition to the \nbipartisanship, I think we should give a lot of credit to the State of \nFlorida. The State of Florida certainly, along with the legislature, in \na bipartisan unanimous vote set aside money for this project. Gov. Jeb \nBush has been fantastic in his support, as has Senator Graham and \nSenator Mack, and the entire congressional delegation. Presidential \ncandidates Gore and Bush have also been supportive and expressed their \nsupport.\n\n  I think there is an understanding here, that this is a huge treasure \nthat we must do something quickly to protect and preserve.\n  In addition to Senators Voinovich, Baucus, Graham, and Mack; the \nadministration; Florida Gov. Jeb Bush--I already mentioned them--the \nSeminole Tribe of Florida and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians support \nthis, as do Industry Groups: Florida Citrus Mutual; Florida Farm \nBureau; Florida Home Builders; The American Water Works Association; \nFlorida Chamber; Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association; Southeast \nFlorida Utility Council; Gulf Citrus Growers Association; Florida Sugar \nCane League; Florida Water Environmental Utility Council; Sugar Cane \nGrowers Cooperative of Florida; Florida Fertilizer and Agri-chemical \nAssociation; and Environmental Groups: National Audubon Society; \nNational Wildlife Federation; World Wildlife Fund; Center for Marine \nConservation; Defenders of Wildlife; National Parks Conservation \nAssociation; the Everglades Foundation; the Everglades Trust; Audubon \nof Florida; 1000 Friends of Florida; Natural Resources Defense Council; \nEnvironmental Defense; and the Sierra Club.\n  I also have a set of colloquies and I will later ask unanimous \nconsent that these colloquies be printed in the Record.\n  Garnering the support of these vast interests was not easy. Long \nhours of intense negotiations since the time the committee reported \nthis bill has resulted in this broad coalition of supporters. They are \nnot the only ones who recognize a good, effective bill when they see \nit. Newspaper editorial boards across the country have called for \nCongress to swiftly enact Everglades restoration legislation this year.\n  On September 13, the New York Times ran an editorial, ``Congress's \nObligation to Nature.'' This editorial calls on Congress to approve two \nvital conservation bills, one of those being the Everglades bill. The \nNew York Times had run an initial editorial in support of our \nEverglades bill on July 13, 2000.\n  On July 7, 2000, the Washington Post ran an editorial lauding \nrestoration of the Everglades.\n  Just last week, on September 6, the Baltimore Sun ran an editorial, \nas well which summed up what we face now: absent action, the unique \necosystem will be lost.\n  Numerous Florida-based papers have also voiced strong support for the \nEverglades bill. On September 7, a Miami Herald editorial, ``Pass the \n`glades bill,'' so correctly states:\n\n       more delay serves no interest--not federal, state, tribal, \n     regional, or local. Let this Congress authorize restoration . \n     . .''\n\n  On July 23, a Tampa Tribune-Times editorial titled, ``Noble effort to \nrescue Everglades'' recognizes that:\n\n       the long-term survival of the Everglades National Park, \n     which belongs to all Americans, depends upon restoring a \n     natural flow to the Glades . . . Congress should adopt this \n     noble plan to rescue one of the nation's genuine natural \n     wonders.\n\n  On June 30, the Sun Sentinel ran an editorial, ``Restoring the \nEverglades: Bill on the right track'' which stated that:\n\n       Everglades restoration will require a massive, sustained \n     commitment . . . but it is worth it.\n\n  And if I could indulge in one more, on June 28th, the Palm Beach Post \neditorial, ``Give Florida a lifeline'' summed it up:\n\n       Florida and the feds need to get started.\n\n  It is clear that these major national and Florida newspapers agree: \nthe bill is strong and the time is now. This Senate, this Congress and \nthis administration must pass Everglades restoration before the \nconclusion of the 106th Congress.\n  If you care about the environment, if you care about this national \ntreasure, you must join me, Senators Voinovich, Baucus, Mack, and \nGraham, and help us move WRDA, with Everglades, forward. The Everglades \ncannot afford to wait. We have worked too hard to build this coalition \nof support and the Everglades has waited too long for Congress to \nnotice and act upon its demise. Each day that we are delayed, we \njeopardize the chances of realizing restoration. Each day that we are \ndelayed, we come closer to losing this unique ecosystem. Each day that \nwe are delayed, vital habitat is lost and we threaten the species that \nare already in peril. Each day that we are delayed, the Everglades come \ncloser to sure extinction.\n  I am afraid too often people forget that the Everglades is a national \nenvironmental treasure. We need to view our efforts as our legacy to \nfuture generations. Many years from now, I hope that this Congress will \nbe remembered for answering the call and saving the Everglades while we \nstill had the chance. Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues \nto support passage of the WRDA, with the Everglades title intact. With \nthat, I will only add that I hope we can finish this bill \nexpeditiously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the managers' amendment is \nagreed to and the committee substitute is agreed to. The bill as thus \namended is the original text now for the purpose of further amendment.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join my good friend and chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Smith, in \nsupporting S. 2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. I will \nsay a few words about the bill and a couple of words about some \nprojects in Montana, and finally wrap up with further comments about \nthe Everglades restoration.\n  This bill authorizes projects for a lot of different areas. It is \nreally quite a sweeping bill: flood control, for one, navigation, shore \nprotection, environmental restoration, water supply storage, and \nrecreation.\n  It also modifies some existing projects and directs the Corps to \nstudy other proposed projects. All projects in this bill have the \nsupport of a local sponsor, somebody at home willing to share the cost \nof the project.\n  Even a brief review of the projects will demonstrate the importance \nof passing this bill. A number of the projects are needed to protect \nshorelines along oceans, lakes, and rivers.\n  Several of the navigation projects will ensure that our ports remain \ncompetitive in an increasingly global marketplace. The studies \nauthorized in the bill will help us make informed decisions about the \nfuture use and management of our water resources.\n  Each project in this bill has been reviewed by the Army Corps of \nEngineers and has been found to be in the Federal\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\ninterest, technologically feasible, economically justified, and \nenvironmentally sound. These projects have also been reviewed in \naccordance with applicable standards and also with our own committee \ncriteria; in other words, they are worthy of support.\n  Let me mention two that are very important to my State of Montana. \nFirst is the authorization for a fish hatchery at Fort Peck. This fish \nhatchery will make good on a long-awaited promise on the Fort Peck \nproject; namely, to create more opportunities for people in communities \nlike Sidney, Malta, Lewistown, Billings, and, of course, Glasgow, and \nall across Montana.\n  Fort Peck Lake, one of the greatest resources that exists in our \nState, not only plays a major role in power production, water supply, \nbut it is an increasingly important center for recreation. Not just for \nMontanans; people from all around the world--believe me, that is true, \nall around the world--come to Fort Peck Lake, MT, for our annual \nwalleye tournaments. Hundreds of boats and probably 1,000 or more \nanglers participate in these events. It is amazing. I was there last \nsummer. It is truly a sight to behold, all these boats taking off for a \nmajor national fishing tournament. The local community really puts its \nheart and soul into these tournaments.\n  Local folks have also collaborated on raising a lot of money for the \nmatching share of the feasibility study for the fish hatchery, from \nSidney, Malta, Glasgow, all across northeastern Montana. There are not \na lot of people in northeastern Montana, but there is a lot of spirit \nand spunk and a lot of wide open spaces.\n  Fort Peck Lake is very important to these communities, in some sense \nit is almost the heart and soul of the northeastern part of our State. \nSo, these communities have come together, they have raised the funds, \nand they have pitched in to support the fish hatchery project.\n  The State legislature also passed a special warm water fishery stamp \nto help provide additional financial support for the hatchery.\n  This hatchery will help ensure the continued development of \nopportunities at Fort Peck Lake, and it will represent a major source \nof jobs and economic development for that part of our State.\n  Another provision of the bill that affects my State of Montana is the \none that affects cabin sites that are leased by private individuals on \nFederal land at Fort Peck Lake. The lake is huge. It is surrounded by \nthe Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, but there are a lot of \nprivate in-holdings in this refuge.\n  This provision will allow cabin leases to be exchanged for other \nprivate land within the refuge that has higher value for, say, fish, \nwildlife, and recreation. By consolidating management of the refuge \nlands, the provision will reduce the cost to the Corps associated with \nmanaging these cabin sites. It will also enhance public access to the \nrefuge lands.\n  This exchange is modeled on a similar project, of which I am very \nproud, near Helena, MT, which Congress authorized in 1998. It \nrepresents a win-win-win solution--a win for the public, a win for the \nwildlife, and a win for the cabin site owners.\n  I also want to mention another landmark provision in this bill \nreferred to at some length by my good friend, Senator Smith, chairman \nof the committee. In addition to the usual project authorizations \ncontained in the water resources bill, this bill also affords a \nhistoric opportunity. Title 6 of the bill is known as the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan.\n  Restoration of the Everglades has been many years in the making. For \nexample, in the 1970s, the State of Florida became concerned that the \npreviously authorized central and south Florida water project was doing \ntoo good a job. Why? Because it was draining the swampy areas of the \nState and was, in fact, draining the life out of the Everglades.\n  Under the leadership of our current colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, who was then Governor Graham, the State recognized that the \nhealth of the entire south Florida ecosystem, including the Everglades, \nwas in serious jeopardy and that a major effort was needed to restore \nit.\n  Ever since, Senator Graham has worked tirelessly to achieve that \ngoal. I can testify to that personally. The comprehensive plan to \nrestore this valuable ecosystem that is contained in the bill before us \nis the culmination of his work.\n  The Everglades is clearly a national treasure. I know it holds a \nparticularly special place in the hearts of Senator Graham and Senator \nMack. Senator Mack joined Senator Graham to make Everglades restoration \na key part of their agenda for the State of Florida. Both of them \nworked very hard in a bipartisan way to make this provision a reality.\n  The administration, under the leadership of the Corps of Engineers \nand Army Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Joe Westphal, with the \ncooperation of the Department of Interior and the Environmental \nProtection Agency, are also committed to bringing all the affected \nparties together to develop a plan that will work for the State of \nFlorida, the ecosystem, and the Everglades.\n  The committee has worked with all the stakeholders in South Florida \nand with the administration to develop the consensus contained in this \nbill. There are provisions to review the progress of the plan, to make \nsure it is working, to require Congress to approve steps along the way, \nand to assure the water will be where it is needed, when it is needed.\n  We cannot wait for the Everglades to die. We have to begin now to \nrestore it. This project is the largest environmental restoration \nproject in the Corps' history, and it will reverse the decline of the \nEverglades. It is the right thing to do. I know my colleagues will join \nus with in supporting this section of the bill and the Water Resources \nDevelopment bill generally.\n  I have one final point. I pay special commendation to the chairman of \nour committee, Senator Smith. The first committee hearing he held as \nchairman of the committee was in Florida on the Everglades. It was \nthere he saw the need to restore the Everglades, and it was there he \nmade his pledge to the people of Florida, and to the Nation, to restore \nthe Everglades. That is the hallmark of the very balanced, solid, far-\nreaching, and perceptive way in which he has handled the chairmanship \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee.\n  We are here today, in many respects, not only because of the Senators \nfrom Florida, Senators Graham and Mack, and others, but also because of \nSenator Smith's farsighted work as chairman of the committee. I thank \nhim, as well as the others, for what they have done for a true national \ntreasure.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleague for those remarks.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield whatever time he \nmay consume to my colleague, the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nVoinovich.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee and his staff, and the ranking \nmember and members of his staff for their terrific work. I also thank \nSenator Graham and Senator Mack for their patience as we worked through \nsome of the problems we had with the Florida Everglades restoration \nproject.\n  This Water Resources Development Act of 2000 is a product of months \nof hard work by the Environment and Public Works Committee. The bill \nprovides authority for the Secretary of the Army to carry out 24 \nprojects for water resources development, conservation, and other \npurposes, substantially in accordance with the Chief of Engineer \nreports referenced in the bill language.\n  In addition to the projects authorized by WRDA 2000, there are a \nnumber of significant policy provisions in the bill, including a \nprovision to enhance the Corps' ability to accomplish multiple \njurisdiction watershed studies, a provision to extend the ability-to-\npay provisions to all types of projects, and a provision to accelerate \nproject deauthorizations, which is very important.\n  The bill also provides for a facilitated role for the Corps to \npartner with non-Federal interests in implementing\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\nsmall environmental restoration projects on a regional basis including \nthe Ohio River, the Puget Sound region, New England, the Great Lakes \nregion, Chesapeake Bay, and the Illinois River.\n  There are some who may question the need for a WRDA bill this year \nsince Congress passed a WRDA bill just last year. In reality, last \nyear's bill was actually unfinished business from 1998, and if Congress \nis to get back on its 2-year cycle for passage of WRDA legislation, we \nneed to act on a bill this year. The 2-year cycle is important to avoid \nlong delays between the planning and the execution of projects, and \nalso to meet Federal commitments to State and local government partners \nwho share the costs with the Federal Government.\n  While the 2-year authorization cycle is extremely important in \nmaintain efficient schedules for completions of important water \nresources projects--as I explored in a hearing I conducted in May of \nthis year--efficient schedules also depend on adequate levels of \nfunding. Unfortunately the appropriations for the Corps; program have \nnot been adequate to meet the needs that have been identified.\n  I would like to direct my colleagues' attention to Chart No. 1. This \nchart dramatically illustrates what has occurred. Chart No. 1 shows our \ncapital investment in water resources infrastructure since the 1930s, \nshown in constant 1999 dollars, as measured by the Corps of Engineers \nCivil Works construction appropriations. You can see the sharp decline \nfrom the peak in 1966 of a $5 billion appropriation, and appropriations \nthrough the 1970s in the $4 billion level, to the 1980s, and then to \nthe 1990s, where as you can see, the annual Corps construction \nappropriations have dropped substantially. Corps projects have averaged \nonly around $1.6 billion during this period of time.\n  Another dramatic thing has happened, as illustrated in the next two \ncharts. We are asking the Corps of Engineers to do more with less. \nThese two charts show the breakdown by mission area for the Corps' \nconstruction appropriation in FY 1965 and FY 1999.\n  If we look at the FY 1965 chart, you will see that in FY 1965, most \nof the money went for flood control, navigation, and hydropower.\n  Then we come to 1999. We find that the Corps' mission has expanded \ninto many, many other areas: Shore protection, environmental \ninfrastructure. So we have asked the Corps to take on a lot more \nresponsibility than it ever had before.\n  As the FY 1999 chart shows, there is a dramatic mission increase with \nenvironmental restoration as a significant mission area, and two new \nmission areas: environmental infrastructure, and remediation of \nformerly used Government nuclear sites. Environmental infrastructure, \nas contrasted with environmental restoration, includes such work as \nconstruction of drinking water facilities and sewage treatment plants.\n  What is the point of all this?\n  If you recall the chart, the Corps construction appropriations have \nbeen falling since 1965, and its falls sharply in the 1990s. At the \nsame time, the Corps' mission has been growing.\n  The result is today's huge backlog of over 500 active projects that \nwill cost the Federal Government some $38 billion to complete. Think \nabout it--$38 billion.\n  These are worthy projects with positive benefit-to-cost ratios and \ncapable non-Federal sponsors. The projects in the backlog that are \nbeing funded for construction are being funded under spread out \nschedules that result in increased construction costs and delays in \nachieving project benefits.\n  I recognize that budget allocations and Corps appropriations are \nbeyond the purview of this Water Resources Development Act. But the \nbacklog issue impacted very fundamentally the way we approached WRDA \n2000 by highlighting the importance of adhering to three important \ncriteria in putting together the bill.\n  We adhered to these criteria which made many of our colleagues \nunhappy because many of the projects they wanted did not fit into the \ncriteria we laid down.\n  First, we controlled the mission creep of the Corps of Engineers. \nWRDA 2000 addresses national needs within the traditional Corps mission \nareas: needs such as flood control, navigation shore protection, and \nthe emerging mission area of restoration of nationally significant \nenvironmental resources such as the Florida Everglades.\n  The second thing we did in WRDA 2000 is make sure that the projects \nwe are authorizing meet the highest standard of engineering, economic \nand environmental analysis.\n  We can only assure that projects meet these high standards if \nprojects have received adequate study and evaluation to establish \nproject costs, benefits, and environmental impacts to an appropriate \nlevel of confidence. This means that a feasibility report must be \ncompleted this calendar year before projects are authorized for \nconstruction. That is a requirement.\n  Finally, we have to preserve the partnerships and cost-sharing \nprinciples of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986. WRDA 1986 \nestablished the principle that water resources projects should be \naccomplished in partnerships with State and local governments and that \nthis partnership would involve significant financial participation by \nthe non-Federal partners.\n  My experience as mayor of Cleveland and Governor of Ohio convinced me \nthat the requirement for local funding to match Federal dollars results \nin much better projects than where Federal funds are simply handed out. \nIt doesn't matter if it is parks, housing, highways, or water resources \nprojects, the requirement for a local cost share provides a level of \naccountability that is essential to a quality project. Cost sharing \nprinciples were enforced in this WRDA bill.\n  I am very proud of the discipline that the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee exercised in putting together this bill Chairman Smith \nshould be congratulated. I recognize, though, that not everyone, as he \nsaid has been satisfied, but I believe that our authorization actions \nmust reflect the fiscal realities of the Corps national program.\n  Without a doubt, the centerpiece of WRDA is the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan. I want you to know, I have spent a lot of \ntime in the Everglades on a number of different occasions. I want my \ngrandchildren and their grandchildren to have the same experience as I \nhave had in enjoying this wonderful national treasure.\n  Our Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman Bob Smith and his \nstaff deserve enormous credit for making this Everglades provision a \nreality, particularly in the very difficult area of assuring that the \nbenefits to the natural system are realized while the interests of \nother water users are adequately protected.\n  As Senator Baucus said, this is not only the largest restoration \nproject the Corps has undertaken, but it is the largest restoration \nproject ever undertaken in the world. So this is really quite an \nundertaking.\n  My role in putting together the Everglades title has been to assure \nthat we moved the Everglades Restoration Plan forward while achieving \nconsistency with the criteria that applied to all the projects in this \nWRDA bill. The Everglades Restoration Plan is extremely important but \nthere are other critical water resources needs reflected in this WRDA \nbill. I believe the playing field should be level for the consideration \nof all projects.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we spent a great deal of time \nmaking sure that the Florida Everglades restoration plan does fit into \nthe criteria we have establishes for other projects.\n  Originally, the administration's Everglades legislative proposal \ndeviated substantially from Corps of Engineers and Environmental and \nPublic Works Committee policies for other water resources projects, and \nwould have set precedents which would have been very damaging to \npreserving effective Congressional oversight of the Corps of Engineers \nprogram. Our goal was to hold the Everglades project to the same \nstandards that apply to other projects. This is really important.\n  We have accomplished a great deal in meeting this objective. I would \njust like to mention a few of them to give comfort to my colleagues.\n  First, we have reduced the level of programmatic authority for \nrestoration projects that can be accomplished without congressional \nreview. That is very, very important. The levels we have set are \napplicable to other parts of the Corps program.\n  We have required that two primarily land acquisition projects have \nbeen\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\nearmarked to be accomplished under other programs. That was in this. We \nare saying, No. Those will be done someplace else.\n  We have expressed concerns about advanced wastewater treatment and \nindicated that more effective ways of providing additional water must \nbe explored.\n  We have eliminated the provision that would have allowed \nreimbursement to the State of Florida for the Federal share of work \naccomplished by the State. However, we have retained the ability of the \nState to receive credit for work in-kind for up to 50 percent of the \nwork but only as this work is accomplished proportionate to Federal \nexpenditures based on appropriations. In other words, they cannot move \nahead of Federal appropriations.\n  We have added an incentive to encourage the completion of the \nmodified water deliveries to the Everglades project which is essential \nto many aspects of Everglades restoration.\n  I think our most important accomplishment was in assuming that \nindividual Everglades projects receive the same level of congressional \nreview as other water resources projects. The administration \nrecommended 10 projects for authorization at a total cost of $1.1 \nbillion without a traditional feasibility report level of detail and \nwithout individual project justification.\n  These projects would have been authorized without congressional \nreview of the detailed information normally associated with a Corps \nfeasibility report and required of every other large Corps of Engineers \nproject as a condition of authorization.\n  I am pleased to have been able to add a requirement to the Everglades \nsection of the bill that no appropriation shall be made to construct \nany of the 10 projects until the Secretary submits the Project \nImplementation Report on the individual projects. Such reports will be \npresented to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the \nSenate and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the \nHouse of Representatives, and each committee will be able to approve \nthe projects by resolution.\n  This assures that the Everglades projects will get a similar level of \ncongressional oversight as other Corps projects.\n  I believe we have accomplished a great deal in making this Everglades \nPlan acceptable to all parties. The only question I have is the \nquestion of the operation and maintenance costs. I will be discussing \nthat later in an amendment.\n  As a final item, let me turn to the redevelopment of the former \nHomestead Air Force Base and its relationship to the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan.\n  In December of 1999, the U.S. Air Force and the Federal Aviation \nAdministration released a draft supplemental environmental impact \nstatement, EIS on the disposal of 1,632 acres of the former Homestead \nAir Force Base. About 870 acres of the Homestead Air Force Base has \nbeen retained as the Homestead Air Reserve Station.\n  This draft supplemental EIS presents as its proposed action the \nredevelopment of portions of the Homestead Air Force Base as a regional \nairport with a projected 150,000 annual air operations by 2015, and an \nestimated 231,000 air operations at maximum use. As a point of \ncomparison, Reagan National Airport has about 300,000 air operations \nand Miami International Airport has over 500,000 air operations.\n  The draft supplemental EIS presents three mixed use development plans \nand a commercial spaceport as alternatives to the regional airport. The \ndraft supplemental EIS was circulated for public comment in December \n1999. The Air Force is currently evaluating the comments on the EIS and \nplans to make a final decision on conveying the property later this \nyear.\n  If we look at this map, here is the Homestead Air Force Base in \nHomestead, FL. Ten miles away is the Everglades National Park, 2 miles \naway from that is Biscayne National Park, and about 10 miles away is \nthe National Marine Sanctuary. This is the Everglades project. We can \nsee that the use of this base will have a large impact on this very \nfragile area of Florida we are trying to restore.\n  I agree with the assessment of the Natural Resources Defense Council \nand eight other national and local environmental groups, that the \ninformation generated in preparing the draft supplemental EIS does not \nsupport the proposed action of regional airport development.\n  This information reinforces what common sense would dictate: the \nHomestead base is an inappropriate site for the proposed commercial \nairport. Indeed airport development would have a number of different \nadverse impacts:\n  It would significantly increase the noise in Everglades and Biscayne \nParks, potentially affecting wildlife and detracting from the \nexperience of visitors. At places within Everglades Park, the amount of \ntime that aircraft noise would be above the ambient sound levels would \nincrease more than two hours. Portions of Biscayne Park would \nexperience similar increases up to 2 hours.\n  The proposed airport would be an air pollution source equivalent to a \nlarge power plant, with increases of emissions to about 392 tons per \nyear in nitrogen oxides by 2015.\n  The secondary and cumulative impacts of commercial airport \ndevelopment would result in residential and commercial growth in the \nsurrounding area that would frustrate planned Everglades restoration \nactivities, specifically, the Biscayne Coastal Wetland feature of the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.\n  Private environmental groups are not alone in raising objections to \nthe commercial airport development. Federal and State environmental \nagencies have also raised strong objections.\n  The Department of the Interior, commenting on the EIS, indicated that \nthe development of a commercial airport near Biscayne and Everglades \nNational Parks could have a series of negative consequences on these \nnationally and internationally recognized resources including \nsignificant noise impacts, increased contaminants in Biscayne Bay and \nimpacts on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. Secretary of \nthe Interior Bruce Babbitt also has publicly expressed his personal \nopposition to the airport development.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency has serious environmental \nobjections to the airport proposal.\n  The National Marine Fisheries Service does not recommend the \ncommercial airport development because of the loss of buffer areas \nbetween the airport and Biscayne Bay.\n  The Florida Department of Environmental Protection is opposed to this \ndevelopment. They say it poses a threat to the protected terrestrial \nand marine environment within the Florida Keys' Area of Critical State \nConcern.\n  The South Florida Water Management District is concerned about the \nimpacts of off-site growth generated by the airport redevelopment plan \non 40,000 acres of wetlands owned and managed by the Management \nDistrict.\n  I recognize the argument that the City of Homestead has made \nregarding the economic boost that the airport would provide to the city \nand surrounding area. When I was a member of the Ohio legislature, \nthese same kinds of economic arguments were advanced in pressing for my \nsupport of oil and gas exploration leases in Lake Erie.\n  However, I believed that the environmental health of Lake Erie was \nmore important in the long run to the economic health of Ohio than the \nshort term revenue from oil and gas exploration.\n  I believe the same is true of redevelopment of Homestead Air Force \nBase. The environmental health of Biscayne Bay, the Everglades National \nPark and the Florida Keys are much more important to the long term \neconomic future of Homestead than any airport proposal. There are \nalternative uses of the base property that are compatible with South \nFlorida environmental restoration--uses that would also make \nsignificant contributions to the economy of the region.\n  Clearly if it was my decision to make, I would not redevelop the \nHomestead Air Force Base as a commercial airport. We are approving a \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan which will involve Federal \nand State expenditures of $7.8 billion. I believe it would be \nirresponsible to approve an investment of billions of dollars in the \nrestoration of the south Florida ecosystem, while at the same time \nignoring a re-use plan for Homestead Air Force Base that is \nincompatible with the restoration objectives.\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\n  My preference would have been to elevate the decision on Homestead \nredevelopment from the Secretary of the Air Force to the Secretary of \nDefense to make the decision in conjunction with the Department of \nInterior, the EPA, and the Department of Commerce.\n  This approach was not acceptable because of perceptions that it would \ninterfere with the process and cause a delay in the decision. I have \nagreed instead--and it is in this bill--to a sense-of-the-Senate \nprovision that conveys the concern of the Senate about potential \nadverse impacts of Homestead redevelopment and about the need for \nconsistency in redevelopment and restoration goals. This approach was \nendorsed by environmental interests, and it is my hope that it will \nmake a difference in the ultimate decision on Homestead.\n  I know that through all of this I have been sometimes categorized as \nan opponent of Everglades Restoration. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I believe my efforts have helped assure that this effort can \nmove forward. I look forward to passage of WRDA 2000 and the \nopportunity to get started on the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration \nPlan and the other critical water resources projects contained in the \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I recognize that the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts is going to address the Senate for about an hour. It is \nmy understanding, with his courtesy, that he will allow the Senator \nfrom Virginia to send to the desk an amendment and ask for its \nconsideration, with the understanding that it will be laid aside for \nsuch period of time as the senior Senator from Massachusetts desires. \nAm I correct in that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Massachusetts.\n  I send to the desk, on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator \nVoinovich, an amendment. In two or three sentences, the amendment \nsimply does the following: Since 1986, the Senate has operated under a \nlaw whereby projects built by the Corps of Engineers, pursuant to the \nprocess of authorizing projects, are then, upon completion, carried by \nthe States--the financial burden of the operation and maintenance of \nthose projects.\n  The current legislation along the Everglades--and I am going to vote \nfor the Everglades provision--changes that law by virtue of setting a \nprecedent whereby the Federal taxpayer will pay half the cost of \noperation and maintenance for the life of the project.\n  Now, with due respect to my distinguished chairman and good friend, \nSenator Smith, and others, who have written this legislation, I cannot \nunderstand any valid reason for changing a law that has been in effect \nfor 14 years and served this Nation so well for this single project. My \ncolleague from Ohio shares these concerns. That is the purpose of this \namendment--to strike only a few words, providing the exception for this \nparticular Florida project, and saying the Florida project will be \ntreated just as all the other projects that have been authorized by the \nCongress in the past 14 years and presumably in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I understand that under the agreement I have up to an \nhour, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                   ISSUES THE SENATE SHOULD CONSIDER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this afternoon we are considering \nlegislation on the preservation of our water resources. That is an \nimportant issue and it should be debated, but in the short time \nremaining in this session, we also must answer the call of the American \npeople for real action on key issues of main concern to working \nfamilies. We still must raise the minimum wage. We must pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights--a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We must \nenact a prescription drug benefit as a part of Medicare. We must invest \nin education in ways to make a real difference to our children. We must \nstrengthen our laws against hate crimes. We must adopt sensible gun \ncontrol to keep our communities and our schools safe.\n  But the Congress has done little more than pay lip service to these \nconcerns of working families. In fact, this year, we have done little \nwork at all. By the time this Congress is scheduled to adjourn only 2 \nweeks from now, the Senate will have met for only 115 days. That is the \nlowest number since 1956. It is only 2 days shy of the record set by \nthe famous do-nothing Congress in 1948.\n  We know what the Senate leader has said about how he wanted to spend \nthe last few weeks of this Congress, and that we would work day and \nnight to get the business done. We were supposed to work on legislation \nby day and on appropriations bills by night. Specifically, Senator Lott \nsaid, on September 6:\n\n       We will focus the greatest time commitment on four other \n     priorities. The four worthy are the permanent trade relations \n     with China, completion of the 11 remaining appropriations \n     bills for the fiscal year that begins October 1, raising the \n     annual limits for protected savings in 401(k), individual \n     retirement accounts, and the elimination of some unfair taxes \n     like the telephone tax.\n\n  In a letter to GOP Senators, Senator Lott wrote:\n\n       The Senate will focus on the completion of the remaining \n     appropriations, the China trade bill, and on the votes to \n     override the President's vetoes of our bipartisan bills to \n     end the marriage penalty and the death tax.\n\n  There was no mention of key priorities such as prescription drugs, \nPatients' Bill of Rights, or the minimum wage.\n  Senator Lott said:\n\n       When we return to session after Labor Day, there will be \n     long days, but we will do our best to keep Senators advised, \n     after communicating with leadership on both sides of the \n     aisle, on what the schedule will be.\n\n  The Senate is still waiting for an answer to our unmet priorities, \nand so are the American people.\n\n\n                       H-1B High-Tech Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is finally taking steps to \ndebate and vote on the H-1B high tech visa legislation. Our nation's \neconomy is experiencing a time of unprecedented growth and prosperity. \nThe strong economic growth can, in large measure, be traced to the \nvitality of the highly competitive and rapidly growing high technology \nindustry.\n  I'm proud to say that Massachusetts is leading the nation in the new \nhigh tech economy, according to a recent study by the Progressive \nPolicy Institute. Thanks to our world-class universities and research \nfacilities, Massachusetts is a pioneer in the global economy of the \ninformation age. We are home to nearly 3,000 information technology \ncompanies, employing 170,000 people, and generating $8 billion in \nannual revenues.\n  With such rapid change, the nation is stretched thin to support these \nnew businesses and their opportunities for growth. Nationally, the \ndemand for employees with training in computer science, electrical \nengineering, software, and communications is very high.\n  In 1998, in an effort to find a stop-gap solution to this labor \nshortage, we enacted the American Competitiveness and Workforce \nImprovement Act, which increased the number of temporary visas \navailable to skilled foreign workers. Despite the availability of \nadditional H-1B visas, we have reached the cap before the end of the \nyear in the last two fiscal years.\n\n  We need to be responsive to the nation's need for high tech workers. \nWe know that unless we take steps now to address this growing workforce \ngap, America's technological and economic leadership will be \njeopardized. I believe that the H-1B visa cap should be increased, but \nin a way that better addresses the fundamental needs of the American \neconomy. Raising the cap without addressing our long-term labor needs \nwould be a serious mistake. We cannot count on foreign sources of labor \nas a long-term solution.\n  These are solid, middle class jobs that Americans deserve under the \nH-1B program. The median salary for H-1B high tech workers is $45,000. \nApproximately 57 percent of H-1B workers have earned only a bachelor's \ndegree. More than half of these workers will be\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\nemployed as computer programmers and systems analysts. These are not \nhighly specialized jobs. They do not require advanced degrees or years \nof training. American workers are the most productive workers in the \nworld. It makes sense to demand that more of our workers be recruited \nand trained for these jobs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for the comments he is \nmaking. I ask him if he would draw a historical parallel to the \nsituation we faced in the late fifties, when the Russians launched \nSputnik and we, as a nation, decided to devote resources into a \nNational Defense Education Act, so that we would have the scientists \nand engineers to be able to compete then with the Russians in the space \nrace. President Kennedy followed on with our exploration into space.\n  Aren't we facing a similar challenge today regarding whether we will \nbe able to compete in the 21st century with the scientists and \nengineers and skilled employees with all the other nations competing \nfor the very best jobs?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly right. That is why, when we do \nhave the measure before us, we will offer amendments to try to develop \nthe support in the Senate, and also in the House, for the funding of a \nprogram that will help ensure that this deficit, in terms of the highly \nskilled who are being addressed by the H-1B visa, will be eased. We \nwill utilize very effective services. For example, the National Science \nFoundation, which has a good deal of skill and understanding and \nawareness in giving focus and attention to encouraging highly \nspecialized vocations and support for these types of programs.\n  We will welcome the opportunity to join with my friend from Illinois \nin bringing this to the attention of the Senate when we actually have \nthe measure before us. We are very hopeful that we will have the \nopportunity to address it and not have steps taken in the Senate that \nwill foreclose both the debate and discussion on this issue.\n  The fact is that the great majority of these H-1B jobs have good, \nmiddle-income salaries, and they are the kinds of jobs that would \nbenefit any family in America. For a number of reasons, which I think \nmany of us are familiar with, we have not developed the kinds of \ntraining programs and support programs for the development of the \nskills in these areas that we need. But the question that will be \nbefore us is, Should we throw up our hands and say we won't do that and \nwe will depend upon a foreign supply of these workers in the future?\n  I think not. I think we should take the steps now to make sure this \nprovision actually becomes an anachronism.\n  Perhaps we will also need opportunities for those who have the very \nhighly specialized skills to come here and to benefit and fit into some \naspect of either industry or academia. We ought to recognize that. But \nto rely on the kind of jobs where only 57 percent of H-1Bs earned a \nbachelor's degree and the average income is only $45,000--this is a \nlong way from those. I think most Members of the Senate and I certainly \nthink most Americans would say H-1B is a superscientist that is going \nto go to a very specialized company or that will generate thousands of \njobs. That may be true for very few that are included. But the fact is, \nfor the most part, these are the kinds of jobs that can be filled with \nAmerican labor if they have the right kind of skills, and we ought to \nbe able to develop that effort as we go into this program.\n  We also hear countless reports of age and race discrimination as \nrampant problems in the IT industry. The rate of unemployment for the \naverage IT worker over age 40 is more than 5 times that of other \nworkers. Just when we should be doing more to bring minorities into \ntechnology careers, we hear that organizations in Silicon Valley cannot \nget companies to recruit from minority colleges and universities, or \nhire skilled, educated minorities from neighboring Oakland. The number \nof women entering the IT field has also dramatically decreased since \nthe mid-1980s. If the skill shortage is as dire as the IT industry \nreports, we can clearly do more to increase the number of minorities, \nwomen and older workers in the IT workforce.\n  Any credible legislative proposal to increase the number of foreign \nhigh tech workers available to American businesses must begin with the \nexpansion of high-skill career training opportunities for American \nworkers.\n  Now more than ever, employer demand for high-tech foreign workers \nshows that there is an even greater need to train American workers and \nprepare U.S. students for careers in information technology. As \nChairman Alan Greenspan recently stated,\n  The rapidity of innovation and the unpredictability of the directions \nit may take imply a need for considerable investment in human capital . \n. . The pressure to enlarge the pool of skilled workers also requires \nthat we strengthen the significant contributions of other types of \ntraining and educational programs, especially for those with lesser \nskills.\n  When we expanded the number of H-1B visas in 1998, we created a \ntraining initiative funded by a visa fee in recognition of the need to \ntrain and update the skills of members of our workforce. Today, as we \nseek to nearly double the number of high tech workers, we must ensure \nthat legislation signed into law includes a significant expansion of \ncareer training and educational opportunities for American workers and \nstudents.\n  I propose that we build on the priorities in current H-1B law. The \nDepartment of Labor, in consultation with the Department of Commerce, \nwill provide grants to local workforce investment boards in areas with \nsubstantial shortages of high tech workers. Grants will be awarded on a \ncompetitive basis for innovative high tech training proposals developed \nby workforce boards collaboratively with area employers, unions, and \nhigher education institutions. Annually, this program will provide \nstate-of-the-art high tech training for approximately 50,000 workers in \nprimarily high tech, information technology, and biotechnology skills.\n  More than ever, today's jobs require advanced degrees, especially in \nmath, science, engineering, and computer sciences. We must encourage \nstudents, including minorities to pursue degrees in these fields. We \nmust also increase scholarship opportunities for talented minority and \nlow-income students whose families cannot afford today's tuition costs. \nWe must also expand the National Science Foundation's merit-based, \ncompetitive grants to partnership programs with an educational mission. \nEqually important, closing the digital divide must be a part of our \neffort to meet the growing demand for high skilled workers.\n  The only effective way for Congress to responsibly ensure more high \nskill training and scholarships for students is to increase the H-1B \nvisa user fees. High tech companies are producing record profits. They \ncan afford to pay a higher application fee. According to public \nfinancial information, for the top twenty companies that received the \nmost H-1B workers this year, a $2,000 fee would cost between .002% and \n.5% of their net worth. A $1,000 fee would cost them very little. \nImmigrant families with very modest incomes were able to pay a $1,000 \nfee to allow family members to obtain green cards.\n  The H-1B debate should not focus solely on the number of visas \navailable to skilled workers. It should also deal with the professional \ncredentials of the workers being admitted. It makes sense to expand the \nnumber of H-1B visas to fill the shortage of masters and doctoral level \nprofessionals with specialized skills that cannot be easily and quickly \nproduced domestically. We should insist that a significant percentage \nof the H-1B visa cap be carved out and reserved for individuals with \nmasters or higher degrees.\n\n  In the days to come, we will have the opportunity to debate these \nissues and pass legislation that meets the needs of the high technology \nindustry by raising the visa cap and also by ensuring state-of-the-art \nskills training for American workers. Clearly, however, the immigration \nagenda is not just an H-1B high-tech visa agenda. Congress also has a \nresponsibility to deal with the critical issues facing Latino and other \nimmigrant families in our country. To meet the needs of these \nimmigrants, my colleagues and I have introduced the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act.\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\n  The immigrants who will benefit from this legislation should have \nreceived permanent status from the INS long ago. These issues are not \nnew to Congress. The Latino community has been seeking legislation to \nresolve these issues for many years. The immigrant community--\nparticularly the Latino community--has waited far too long for the \nfundamental fairness that this legislation will provide.\n  This measure is also critical for businesses. All sectors of the \neconomy are experiencing unprecedented economic growth, but this growth \ncannot be sustained without additional workers. With unemployment \nlevels at 4 percent or even lower, many businesses find themselves \nunable to fill job openings. The shortages of highly skilled, semi-\nskilled and low-skilled workers are becoming a serious impediment to \ncontinuing growth.\n  Information technology companies are not the only firms urging \nCongress to provide additional workers. An equally important voice is \nthat of the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of \nbusinesses and trade associations, and other organizations, including \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce, health care and home care associations, \nhotel, motel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and \nretail concerns, and the construction and transportation industries.\n  These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition \nof business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations \nin support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. Conservative \nsupporters of the Act include Americans for Tax Reform and Empower \nAmerica. Labor supporters include the AFL-CIO, the Union of Neeletrades \nand Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees \nInternational Union.\n  All of the major Latino organizations support the bill, including the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and \nthe National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. \nReligious organizations include a broad array of American Jewish \ngroups, the U.S. Catholic Conference, and Lutheran Immigration and \nRefugee Services.\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central \nAmericans and Haitians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan \nAdjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted permanent \nresidence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive \ngovernments. The act provided other similarly situated Central \nAmericans and Haitians with the opportunity to apply for green cards \nunder more difficult and narrower standards and more cumbersome \nprocedures.\n  It is unfair not to provide the same relief for all immigrants \nseeking safe haven in the United States. Fairness requires that we \naddress this grave injustice. As Congresswoman Carrie Meek said on the \nfloor of the House of Representatives ``Nicaraguans, Cubans, \nGuatemalans, and Salvadorans . . . live next door to each other in some \nof our communities [but] one will get a green card and the others \ncannot. One could seek citizenship after 4 to 5 years; the others \ncannot. Is that fair? My answer is no, it is not fair.''\n  Senator Mack, Senator Abraham, and others said, ``Last year, we \nadopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans. But Haitians \nwere unfairly excluded from that bill. The time has come for Congress \nto end the bigotry. We must remedy this flagrant omission and add \nHaitians to the list of deserving refugees.''\n  There it is, Mr. President, those who have reasonable access: Cubans \nand Nicaraguans; those who have unreasonable access, Salvadorans, \nGuatemalans, Haitians, Hondurans, and immigrants from Eastern European \ncountries. We have the support from the Chamber of Commerce and from \nthe AFL-CIO to bring this in. With H-1B legislation we are looking out \nfor the high tech industry; why not look out for other industries, as \nwell? We had a strong indication of support by two Republican Senators \nlast year when this was passed. Yet we are being denied the opportunity \nby the Republican leadership to bring this matter before the Senate. We \nare being denied the opportunity by the Republican leadership to have a \nvote on it. We will agree to a time limit. They are denying even the \nchance to bring it up. That is wrong. That is unfair. It is unjust.\n  We are going to do everything we possibly can to remedy that through \nother parliamentary means. The idea that we are bringing up one \nparticular proposal to look at high tech--and I am all for those \nprovisions, and stated my support for them--and saying we should be \nable to deal with this issue and expand the job opportunities for other \nAmericans, while on the other hand, saying absolutely no, we are going \nto set up a parliamentary situation where we are absolutely denied the \nopportunity to bring that up. It is supported by the religious and \nbusiness communities, and has had the support of Republican Senators, \nbut we are being denied the opportunity to bring it to the floor for a \nvote. It is wrong. It is unfair. The American people ought to \nunderstand it.\n  Not only are we failing to deal with some of the key issues which are \nat the heart of the American families' concerns, but we are refusing to \nbe fair on this issue with regard to the Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nprovisions. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will create a fair \nand uniform set of procedures for all the immigrants from the region \nwho have been in this country since 1995.\n  It is important to remember the recent history of why people in \nCentral America and Haiti fled from their homes. In Guatemala, hundreds \nof so-called ``extra-judicial'' killings occurred every year between \n1990 and 1995. Entire villages ``disappeared.'' Most of the villages \nwere probably massacred. In El Salvador, an end to 12 years of civil \nwar has not meant an end to violent internal strife. Ironically, the \ndeath toll in 1994 was higher than during the war. In Honduras, the \nDepartment of State's Human Rights Report cites ``serious problems,'' \nincluding extra-judicial killings, beatings and a civilian and military \nelite that has long operated with impunity. Haiti has been ruled by \ndictators for decades. In September 1991, Haiti's first democratically-\nelected government was overthrown in a violent military coup that was \nresponsible for thousands of extra-judicial killings over a three-year \nperiod.\n\n  The idea that we have discriminatory provisions in our immigration \nlaws is nothing new. I remember in 1965 when we passed the Immigration \nAct, which eliminated the Asian Pacific triangle, a provision that went \nback to the old Yellow Peril days. In 1965, we permitted only 125 \nAsians to come into the United States. We effectively excluded Asians \nfrom their ability to immigrate here. We gave preferences to others. \nWho did we give preference to? To those who qualified under the \nnational origin quota system that was based upon the ethnic \nrequirements.\n  The immigration laws in our country historically have been filled \nwith these inequities, and we have been battling to try and make them \nfair and just. Now we are refusing to eliminate one of the most glaring \ndiscriminatory aspects that has ever existed in our immigration laws, \nand we are being denied that opportunity on the floor of the Senate by \nthe Republican leadership. That is fundamentally wrong.\n  Providing parity for immigrants from countries in Central America and \nHaiti will help individuals such as Ericka and her family. In 1986, \nwhen Guatemala was in the midst of a civil war, Ericka's father was \nabducted and disappeared. He is presumed dead. The rest of the family \nfled to the United States for safety. When Ericka joined her mother in \n1993, she was a minor and could be included in the family's asylum \napplication. Her family now qualifies for permanent residence under \nNACARA. However, because Ericka is 21, she no longer qualifies under \nthis law and will therefore remain in legal limbo--or worse, be \ndeported back to Guatemala.\n  This is happening every single day. She lives in fear of being sent \nback to the country where her father was killed. Her life here is in \nlimbo. She graduated from high school and has dreams of going on to \ncollege. But without permanent residence, she cannot qualify for \nscholarships. Passage of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will \nenable her to remain in the United States with her family and continue \nher education.\n\n[[Page S8910]]\n\n  The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue \nrelief to immigrants, who because of bureaucratic mistakes, were \nprevented from receiving green cards long ago. That is one aspect of \nthe bill. Listen to this and wonder why we can't address this aspect of \nthe law.\n  In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, \ncalled IRCA, which included legalization for persons who could \ndemonstrate that they had been present illegally in the United States \nsince before 1982. There is a one-year period to file. However, INS \nmisinterpreted the provisions in IRCA, and thousands of otherwise \nqualified immigrants were denied the opportunity to make timely \napplications.\n  Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of \nindividuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of law. The \ncourts required the INS to accept filings for these individuals. One \ncourt decision stated:\n\n       The evidence is clear that the INS' . . . regulations \n     deterred many aliens who would otherwise qualify for \n     legalization from applying.\n\n  They went to court. The court found for them. We are talking about \n300,000 individuals. The court found for them and said: You are \nqualified, you got misinformation from the agency that was supposed to \nadminister this. We apologize. Go ahead and apply.\n  Then what happened? The ink was not even dry and in 1996, the \nimmigration law stripped the courts of the jurisdiction. The Attorney \nGeneral ruled that the law superseded the court cases. As a result of \nthese actions, this group of immigrants have been in legal limbo and \nfighting government bureaucracy over 14 years.\n  We are denying them the opportunity to make the adjustment of their \nstatus. Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all \nindividuals who have resided in the United States prior to 1986 to \nobtain permanent residency, including those who were denied \nlegalization because of INS' misinterpretation, or who were turned away \nby the INS before applying.\n  Consider Maria. Maria, who came to the United States 18 years ago, \nhas been living in legal limbo with temporary permission to work, while \ncourts determine whether she should have received permanent residence \nunder the 1986 legalization law. Maria now has a U.S. citizen son who \nsuffers from a rare bone disease that confines him to a wheel chair. As \na result of the changes in the 1996 immigration law, Maria has now lost \nher work permit. Her father recently passed away in El Salvador, but \nher tenuous legal status did not permit her to return there to pay her \nlast respects. All Maria wants to do is legalize her status and \ncontinue to work legally to support her family and pay her son's \nmedical bills. Without the passage of this legislation, Maria faces an \nuncertain future.\n  This bill will also restore section 245(i), a vital provision of the \nimmigration law that permitted immigrants about to become permanent \nresidents to apply for green cards while still in the U.S. for a $1,000 \nfee, rather than returning to their home countries to apply.\n  Section 245(i) was pro-family, pro-business, fiscally prudent, and a \nmatter of common sense. Under it, immigrants with close family members \nin the U.S. are able to remain here with their families while applying \nfor legal permanent residence. The section also allows businesses to \nretain valuable employees, while providing INS with millions of dollars \nin annual revenue, at no cost to taxpayers. Restoring Section 245(i) \nwill keep thousands of immigrants from being separated from their \nfamilies and jobs for as long as ten years.\n  America has historically been open and welcoming to immigrant \npopulations seeking to build new lives, free from the fear of \npersecution and tyranny. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act builds \non that tradition, by restoring fairness to the immigrant community and \nfairness in the American legislative process. This legislation will \nregularize the status of thousands of workers already in the U.S., \nauthorize them to work --that is what this is all about, obtaining a \nGreen Card so they can work, pay taxes--and create a policy that is \ngood for families and good for this country. It will correct past \ngovernment mistakes and misdeeds that have kept hard-working immigrant \nfamilies in bureaucratic limbo for far too long.\n  This is legislation that cannot wait. Families are being torn apart \nbecause we have failed to take the necessary steps to pass the Latino \nand Immigrant Fairness Act. Before the August recess, Democrats \nattempted to bring this legislation before the Senate, but the \nRepublican leadership objected. Just last week, Democrats were prepared \nto debate and vote on this legislation as part of the high-tech visa \nbill, but our Republican colleagues were unwilling to bring this \nmeasure to the floor and take a vote. They prefer to talk about their \nsupport for the Latino community, rather than take tangible steps to \nbenefit immigrant workers and their families.\n  Few days remain in this Congress, but we are committed to doing all \nwe can to see that this legislation becomes law this year. Passage of \nthis bill will be a victory for all who believe in justice, fairness, \nand the American dream.\n  There may be individuals who want to take issue with those \nobservations I have made. We would be glad to debate them. We had, \nunder the Democratic leader's proposal, indicated a willingness to \nlimit amendments to, I believe, five amendments and to have short time \nagreements on all of those. We could have disposed of this whole \nlegislation and done it in a way that would have expressed the will of \nthe Senate. Instead, we are spending all week on it. We are spending \nvirtually the whole week. With 3 weeks left, we are spending a whole \nweek on this legislation and are still failing to deal with the \nfundamental issues of fairness which are within the legislation, \nalthough we will have an opportunity to deal with it, and that is the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act.\n  I hope we will have that chance. I am confident Senator Daschle will \ngive us that opportunity. We look forward to debating these issues. But \nwe ought to be able to do that in the sunshine on the open floor of the \nSenate. Maybe there are those who differ, who believe this is not an \nissue of fairness. Maybe there are those who say we ought to have a \ndual standard, one standard for the high-tech industry and a different \nstandard for those who basically track their heritage to Spanish \ntradition.\n  I cannot speak about what the reservation is, but I fail to be \npersuaded by any of the arguments I have seen so far about why we \nshould not have fairness, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, as we \nare having fairness in the H-1B. Maybe there are those who will want to \nengage in that discussion and debate. I will look forward to \nparticipating in that as well.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments now of the remaining \ntime--I will only take 15 more minutes.\n  In addition, I want to mention briefly my sense of what, we ought to \nbe addressing in the Senate. We are constantly reminded that we do not \nset the agenda, that it is the other side that sets the agenda. We have \ncertainly learned that over the period of this year. But we want to let \nthe millions of Americans who are out there, who care about these \nissues, know that there are Members in the Senate who are deeply \ncommitted to these areas of public policy and who want to take action \nand think action can be taken in the areas of education, education \nreform; in the area of prescription drug and prescription drug reform; \nin the area of patients' rights and patients' rights reform. I spoke \nyesterday about the importance of the minimum wage.\n  On the issues of education, what is of enormous concern to me is--I \nread earlier, into the Record, what was going to be the calendar \nestablished by the Republican leader. But I also want to read this, so \nwe have a good idea of what the Republican leader has said on other \noccasions about education. This is the majority leader's promises on \neducation.\n  On January 6, 1999:\n\n       Education is going to be a central issue this year. . . . \n     For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. That is important.\n\n  It is important for this reason: This will be the first time in 35 \nyears--the first time in 35 years, if we do not reauthorize the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, that we have failed to do so.\n  Maybe there is a good reason for that. Maybe there are other higher \npriorities. But when the Senate spends 16\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\ndays debating the issue of bankruptcy, with 55 amendments, and then has \na 6-day debate on education, and of the seven rollcall votes, three of \nthem were virtually unanimous--we have not had the real debate and \ndiscussion the American people want.\n  Nonetheless, we have these promises, promises on education. This is \nwhat was said:\n       Remarks to U.S. Conference of Mayors Luncheon, January 29, \n     1999--But education is going to have a lot of attention, and \n     it's not going to just be words. . . .\n       Press conference, June 22, 1999--Education is number one on \n     the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year.\n       Remarks to U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000--\n     We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized \n     that every year I've been majority leader. . . . And \n     Republicans are committed to doing that.\n       Speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, \n     February 3, 2000--We must reauthorize the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act. . . . Education will be a high \n     priority in this Congress.\n       Congress Daily, April 20, 2000--. . . Lott said last week \n     his top priorities in May include an agriculture sanctions \n     bill, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, \n     and passage of four appropriations bills.\n       Senate, May 1, 2000--This is very important legislation. I \n     hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the \n     education area. Let's talk education.\n       Press Stakeout, May 2, 2000--\n       Question: Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture \n     vote on that?\n       Senator Lott. No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. . . . \n     But education is number one in the minds of the American \n     people all across this country and every state, including my \n     own state. For us to have a good healthy, and even a \n     protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the \n     way to go.\n       Senate, May 9, 2000--\n       Senator Kennedy: As I understand, . . . we will have an \n     opportunity to come back to [ESEA] next week. Is that the \n     leader's plan?\n       Senator Lott: That is my hope and intent.\n\n  Then on July 10:\n\n       I, too, would very much like to see us complete the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I feel very strongly \n     about getting it done. We can work day and night for the next \n     3 weeks.\n\n  Then finally, July 25:\n\n       We will keep trying to find a way to get back to the \n     legislation and get it completed.\n\n  The reason we are not having a debate is because the majority thought \nthere might be an amendment dealing with limiting the opportunity for \nchildren to obtain guns in school areas. That kind of outrageous \nquestion, about whether we were going to try to make our schools safer \nand more secure, once that was even mentioned, the word went out and we \neffectively found there was not going to be any more debate and \ndiscussion.\n  However, in 1994, under Republican leadership, the Republican leader \nactually cosponsored a weapons amendment. At that time, no one on that \nside of the aisle said: Oh, no, we are not going to consider it. That \nis not relevant to education. We want to make sure we are not only \ngoing to have smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, afterschool \nprograms, modernization of schools, more technology available, greater \naccountability, preschool help and assistance for our children, but we \nwant our children to be safe and we want them to be secure.\n  I think parents understand that and support it.\n  We are denied the opportunity to even vote on that. It used to be \naround here, years ago in the Senate--and also not that long ago--when \npeople had differences, you settled them through debates and by votes. \nNow you settle them by not even bringing them up.\n  That is where we are: Nowhere, on the issues of education.\n  This is in spite of the fact we know that student enrollment will \ncontinue to rise in the foreseeable future. According to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education's 2000 Baby Boom Echo Report, between 1990 and \nthe year 2000, growth in the K-12 student population has gone up by 6.6 \nmillion students, from 46.4 million to 53 million. And, even beyond the \nnext ten years, the number of school-age children will continue to \nincrease steadily. Between the year 2000 and the year 2100, the total \nwill rise from 53 million to 94 million children, 41 million more \nchildren are going to be going to schools in this country.\n  Does anyone believe the education issue is going to go away? Does \nanyone think by not calling it up or giving it attention it is going to \ndisappear? We used to debate these issues and then have resolution.\n  This is against the background that in more recent times, since 1980 \nto 1999, the Federal share of education funding has declined from 11 \npercent to 7.7 percent for elementary and secondary education, and 15 \npercent to 10 percent for higher education. I know there are Members \nwho do not want any funding in elementary and secondary education.\n  I was here in 1994 when the new Republican leadership took over. The \nfirst thing they did was decrease funding for programs under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. That was the first major \ndebate. I know they have been in favor of abolishing the Department of \nEducation. I am aware of that. Most parents think we ought to have a \npartnership and that we ought to move ahead.\n  I would like to mention just one other fact. More students today are \ntaking advanced math and science courses. This is very encouraging \nsince these rigorous classes provide the foundation that students need \nto acquire solid math knowledge. In precalculus, the percent who are \ntaking advanced placement courses has increased from 31 percent to 44 \npercent; calculus, 19 percent to 24 percent; physics, 44 percent to 49 \npercent.\n  SAT math scores are the highest in 30 years. Modest, gains have been \nmade, but the upward trend lines are very important, and they have \nconsistently flowed upwards. This is important. We ought to be debating \nthis. We ought to know what schools are doing to achieve that success. \nWe ought to benefit from those schools' successes. We ought to give our \nsupport to those successful efforts. We ought to give flexibility to \nthe local community to make sure their schools are successful.\n  Why can't we debate this? We have more children taking the SATs than \nhave ever taken them before. All of these SAT math scores--for males \nand females--are following an upward trend.\n  But, our work is far from over. In spite of this promising news, the \nresults so far are not enough. Now is not the time to be complacent. We \nstill have enormous problems. We have them in my State and in many of \nour largest cities. In so many of these areas, we have teachers, \nparents, communities, business leaders, and workers who are prepared to \ndo something. In my city of Boston, we had a net day. We were 48th out \nof 50 States in terms of access to the Internet. We had net days around \nour State. Now we are tenth, and it was all done voluntarily.\n  The IDEW in Boston laid 450 miles of cable and did it voluntarily. We \nhad contributions from the software industries of tens of millions of \ndollars. Many helped the teachers in training programs. They were \ndelighted to do it. They wanted to work on it. Things are happening. We \nare not saying we are the only solution, but what we are saying is \nlet's find ways we can be supportive. We are not given that \nopportunity.\n  Finally, I want to mention two other areas. One is on the issue of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. It has been just over a year since the \nHouse passed good Patients' Bill of Rights legislation--the bipartisan \nNorwood-Dingell bill. The Senate passed another bill that failed to \nmeet these requirements.\n  I remind the American people, there is not a single medical \norganization that supports the Republican proposal. Not one. I have \nsaid that a dozen times. I have challenged the other side to come up \nwith a single medical organization in this country that supports their \nproposal. There isn't any. Three hundred support ours. Every children's \ngroup, every women's group, every group representing the disabled, \nevery medical group of every stripe has supported ours--North, South, \nEast, and West. We still cannot get it. If the Republicans would let us \nvote on this again, we would have a majority of the Members of this \nbody support the bipartisan proposal that passed the House of \nRepresentatives. The American people ought to know that the Senate \nleadership is keeping this bottled up.\n  This chart shows the particular protections and where they came from. \nI am not going to take the Senate's time now to read all of them. If \none is looking at where these protections came from, access to \nemergency care was recommended by the Committee on the\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nPatient's Quality Commission, based of Democrats and Republicans. It \nwas a unanimous recommendation. It is also from the insurance \ncommissioners, the Association of Health Providers, plus it is already \nin Medicare. Every one of these protections has been out there one way \nor the other. We should be about the business of ensuring that the \nAmerican people are going to get all the protections.\n  I see my good friend from the State of Florida who is doing such an \nimportant service to the Senate in bringing a historic perspective to \nthe importance of a prescription drug bill, and the emotional and day-\nto-day reality that exists without these protections.\n  We still have a chance to vote on these issues. We have two different \nproposals that are basically before us. The one that Senator Graham \nwill introduce and support and that has broad support will ensure that \nindividuals benefit from a prescription drug benefit program that lets \ndoctors decide what is in their best interest. It can go into effect a \nyear from now. That is enormously important.\n  The proposal that has been recommended on the other side consists of \nblock grants that go to the States, in which 28 million American \nseniors will not participate because they will not be eligible. We will \nalso have to wait until the money is actually appropriated by the \nCongress to those States.\n  States will need enabling legislation to provide those prescription \ndrugs, and then sometime after 4 years, if there is a modernization \nprogram under Medicare, there can be a prescription drug benefit. If my \ncolleagues want to take their chances and roll the dice, that is the \nway to go. If they want to have a dependable, reliable, stable, \npredictable benefit program, it should be under Medicare. The seniors \nunderstand that. They have confidence in it. They want it strengthened. \nWe have a responsibility to do that. We can build on that program for a \nsound and effective future.\n  I will be glad to yield the remaining time to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Massachusetts \nwanted to be notified when he had 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is an hour \nreserved under the control of Senator Thomas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding further, Mr. President, and I \ninform the Chair, that with Senator Thomas' permission, I am here to \nclaim that time. Is there objection to my doing that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). Without objection, the Senator \nhas the time.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Florida, I want \nto respond briefly to the comments of the Senator from Massachusetts \nand then perhaps respond to the Senator from Florida.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has touched a number of issues in this \ndebate. I am not sure I can keep up with him in terms of the volume of \nsubjects he has brought before us, but I will try to respond to some \nthat I think need response.\n  I will start with the H-1B issue, which is the issue with which he \nstarted. He told us at great length how much he supports the H-1B \nprogram and described the high-tech activity in Massachusetts, his home \nState, which is dependent on our doing something about the H-1B \nproblem. He did not tell us that he was one of two Senators--and there \nwere only two--in the committee who voted against reporting out the H-\n1B visa bill about which we are talking. So it is clear his support is \nconditional on a number of things.\n  He outlined those on the floor. And he is certainly entitled to his \nconditions and to his attitude with respect to them. But I will point \nout a few things with respect to H-1B which those Senators who are \nprimarily responsible to the AFL-CIO, in their political lives, do not \nseem to talk about.\n  We talk about jobs. The Senator from Massachusetts said: Many of the \njobs for H-1B visas are filled by people who do not require very high \nacademic standards, so those can be filled by Americans. We should only \nhave the H-1B visas for people with master's degrees and doctorates. He \ntalked about a screening program that would be set up by the Federal \nGovernment to determine, on the basis of academic credentials, who \ncould get in and who could not get in on the H-1B system.\n  I spent a good portion of my life in the private sector. I found that \nexperience to be tremendously valuable to me when I came to the Senate. \nAt one point in my young life, I fantasized about the possibility of \ncoming here as a very young Senator, taking a seat maybe in my thirties \nor even forties. Now I am very glad that I did not do that because that \nwould have meant I would have spent all of that time in the \ngovernmental orbit and not learning some very fundamental lessons in \nthe private community.\n  The first lesson I learned in the private community--and learned it \nagain and again and again whenever the situation came up--was that the \nmarketplace rules. I have said here before that if I could control what \nwe carve in marble around here, along with the Latin phrases, which are \ninspiring and wonderful and historic, I would carve another slightly \nmore practical phrase in marble, to keep it before us so we never \nforget it, and it would be: ``You cannot repeal the law of supply and \ndemand.'' We try that every once in a while. We try to repeal the law \nof supply and demand with congressional mandates. This is what, \nfrankly, the Senator from Massachusetts would be up to if he had his \nway on the H-1B visa issue.\n  Why is there an H-1B visa issue? Because there is a gap between \nsupply and demand. It is as simple as that. There is an enormous demand \nfor certain kinds of jobs in this country. Currently it is running \nsomewhere between 350,000 and 400,000. That is the demand. For whatever \nreason, the American educational system cannot supply the workers to \nfill that demand. There is a pool of skilled workers who can fill that \ndemand worldwide, and that pool of supply will meet that level of \ndemand. The only question is: Where?\n  We held a high-tech summit in the Joint Economic Committee, of which \nthe senior Senator from Massachusetts is a member. He came to that \nsummit and heard the executives of the high-tech companies speak to us. \nI am not sure whether he was there when one particular statement was \nmade, but it made a strong impression on my memory, and I would remind \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and others, of what one particular man \nsaid.\n  He said: ``Senators, understand, this work''--he was referring to the \ndemand--``will be done by these people''--referring to the supply. \n``The only question is, whether they will do it living in the United \nStates or living abroad.''\n  In today's high-tech world, in today's world of the Internet, the job \ncan be sent electronically to the worker living in India, or Pakistan, \nor some other country; and the results of the work can be sent \nelectronically back to the corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley, or \nRoute 128 in Massachusetts, or Utah Valley, or Salt Lake Valley, or the \nDulles Corridor, or any other high-tech center you might want to \nidentify.\n  I cannot understand why it is not recognized in this Chamber almost \nuniversally that it would be better for the United States to have \nhighly skilled, highly motivated, immediately qualified individuals \nliving in the United States, paying taxes in the United States, adding \nto the economic activity of the United States, while they do this work, \ninstead of having them live abroad and paying their taxes and making \ntheir contributions to the economy of other countries.\n\n  Yet the restrictions that would be put on H-1B visas, primarily at \nthe behest of the AFL-CIO, would have the effect of saying, you can't \ndo this work in the United States. And to have the Government screen \nthose who can get H-1B visas on the basis of the Government's criteria \nof what constitutes the appropriate educational level, is to deny \nclearly the impact of the market.\n  No one is going to hire someone on the basis of anything other than \nthat person's ability to do the work. I do not want to say to Hewlett-\nPackard or Intel or Novell, or any other high-tech\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\ncompany you can name: You can't hire this worker because we in the \nGovernment have decided that he does not have the appropriate \neducational credentials.\n  I want Hewlett-Packard to make that decision. They might not make it \nright. But it is the shareholders of Hewlett-Packard who pay the price \nif they make a mistake. That is the way the entire American economy has \nbeen built from the very beginning, and that is the way it will \nflourish in the future.\n  But no, we have from the Senator from Massachusetts an outline of the \nrestrictions that the Government should put on the hiring practices of \nAmerican companies. And we have from the Senator the statement that the \nGovernment should decide who is qualified to come in under an H-1B visa \nto fill one of these high-tech jobs.\n  Whenever the Government gets involved in trying to change the law of \nsupply and demand, you get one of two things--I said this yesterday \nwhen we were in the debate on the minimum wage; I repeat it today--\nwhenever the Government interferes with the law of supply and demand, \nyou either get a shortage or you get a surplus.\n  Let me expand on that a little. As I reread my remarks from \nyesterday, I was not as clear as I usually like to be.\n  Right now, we have an example of the Government dictating how many \nforeign nationals can come in to work in the high-tech industry. They \nset the amount below that for which there is demand. What is the \nresult? A shortage. Interfering with the law of supply and demand, the \nGovernment says, we will only allow this many, when, in fact, the \nrequirement is for that many; and the result is we have a shortage of \nthese workers.\n  A flip side of this, where surpluses are created, is where the \nGovernment sets a price higher than the market would. If I can go back \nhistorically to a time that is impressive to the Western U.S., the \nGovernment said: We will buy silver at a set price for our coinage. \nThey set the price of silver higher than the market price. What \nhappened? Everybody went out to find any kind of silver in their \nmountains, or any sort of mining operation, and the Government acquired \na huge surplus of silver. The price was set higher than the market \nwould set and it created a surplus.\n  In the case of skilled workers, the quantity is set lower than market \ndemands, and we get a shortage.\n  So once again, engraved in marble on the walls: ``You cannot repeal \nthe law of supply and demand''--and recognize that every time you try, \nall you do is create either an artificial surplus or an artificial \nshortage.\n  As I said, with respect to H-1B visas, the work will get done either \nin the United States or abroad; and it will get done by the same people \neither in the United States or abroad. The only question we have to ask \nourselves is, Do we want the people who are doing this work, getting \npaid by American corporations, drawing salaries with which they support \ntheir families, to be living in the United States and spending those \nsalaries in the United States, contributing to the tax base of the \nUnited States, adding to the economic benefits of the United States, or \ndo we want them living abroad?\n  Obviously, the American companies that seek to hire these individuals \nwant them here because it is more efficient for them to be here. It \nwould mean higher costs for them if they had to do the work abroad, but \nthey will absorb those higher costs because they have to do the work. \nIf they don't, America will lose its technological lead. America will \nlose its edge over the rest of the world, and we will see the \ntechnology world begin to disappear.\n  We have recaptured it. There was a period of time when people said \nthe future lies in Japan, that America's great day of technological \nadvance is behind us, that the Japanese have taken over. I remember \nthose debates. I remember those speeches. It is not true. There is no \ncountry in the world that is close to the United States in our \ntechnological edge.\n  But to maintain that technological edge, not rest on our oars and \ncoast into the future, we have to have a skilled workforce that can \nkeep things moving forward. It is not available in this country. We \nhave to let those companies hire on a worldwide basis so that the edge \ncan be maintained here.\n  People say, well, they are taking jobs from Americans. Again, Mr. \nPresident, the statistics are clear. There are 350,000 to 400,000 high-\ntech jobs going begging right now because there are not people \nqualified to fill them. Companies are paying bounties to their \nemployees who bring in a potential employee. In many companies in \nSilicon Valley, an existing employee will be paid thousands of dollars \nif he can introduce another prospective employee to his company who \ngets hired. Bounties are being paid to find people with these skills so \nthat the companies can maintain their technological skills.\n  It is not a matter of saying, well, there are Americans who will be \nshut out if the H-1B visa program passes. It is not a matter of saying \nthere are American graduates from American universities who will be \ndenied jobs if we let these other people in. No. It is a matter of jobs \ngoing begging, jobs that have to be performed if this country is to \nmaintain its technological edge, people who are capable of filling \nthose jobs being allowed to come into this country and perform them.\n  Now there is one other aspect to this that I will highlight and \ndiscuss. That is the importance of maintaining America's edge. I have \nreferred to it already, but I want to expand on it a little bit.\n  It used to be that in the industrial age, when a company was \nestablished and momentum was created in the marketplace, you could \nexpect the momentum of that company to carry it forward not only for \nyears but probably for decades. In today's world, a technology company \ncan disappear virtually overnight if somebody else gets the edge on \nthem and produces something better quickly. The most important factor \nin today's economy is speed, the speed with which you get your product \nto market, the speed with which you move ahead of your competitor. That \nmeans, once again, qualified people. That means, once again, being able \nto fill those particular assignments.\n  Now the Senator from Massachusetts says, well, what we really need to \ndo is spend money increasing training. We look at the bills that are \nbefore the Appropriations Committee, and there is an enormous amount of \nmoney being spent to increase training in the United States to try to \nclose this educational gap. I would be more than thrilled if we could \nsay that there were already 400,000 American graduates from American \nuniversities ready to fill these jobs, that we don't need any visas for \nhigh-tech people abroad.\n  One of the ironies of that, however, that applies to the H-1B visa \nissue, is this: a large percentage--indeed, in some universities it is \nclose to 50 percent--of the high-tech graduates of these universities \nare foreign born. They hold foreign passports. We give them visas to \ncome to this country to gain the best education that is available \nanywhere in the world in these high-tech skills. Then when they \ngraduate, we say to them: Thank you very much; you cannot stay because \nwe can't give you an H-1B visa.\n\n  The American taxpayers--in the State of Utah, it is my State \ntaxpayers--are subsidizing those universities. Why? Because we want the \nproduct that comes out of them in the form of qualified graduates. So \nwe have ourselves in the interesting and ironic situation of saying, \nbecause we believe in education, we will appropriate money for higher \neducation on both a Federal and State level; because we believe in \neducation, we will do everything to make the American university system \nthe very best in the world, which it is; and because we believe in \nopportunity, we will allow students from all over the world to come to \nthese schools.\n  But when they have been here and partaken of that tax subsidy and \nhave obtained that education, we say to them: Now you can't work here. \nYou have lived here for 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, with a graduate \ndegree, maybe you have been here 7 or 8 years. You have become \nassimilated into American culture. You have become comfortable with \nhamburgers and pizza (which is more of an American food than it is \nItalian food, I have discovered). You feel comfortable in all of this. \nYou are ready to find a job. You can't find a job in the hotbed of \ntechnological advancement, which is the United States of America. You \nhave to go home. We won't give you an H-1B\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\nvisa after we have subsidized your education at taxpayer expense.\n  I have a hard time understanding how that makes any sense, that these \nstudents from our best universities, who have received the taxpayer \nsubsidy giving them the best degrees, then have to leave because of the \nartificial barriers created by the attempt, once again, of Government \nto try to repeal the law of supply and demand.\n  When we talk about Americans filling these jobs, talk about graduates \nof American universities filling these jobs, let us understand that \nmany of those graduates are themselves the very people who will benefit \nfrom the H-1B visa program that is included in this bill.\n  Now a few other comments, and then I will yield the floor.\n  I was interested to hear the Senator from Massachusetts talk about \nthe fact that there are jobs going begging in this good economy and how \ndifficult it is for employers to fill jobs. He was speaking at this \ntime not about the H-1B visa and the high-tech kind of jobs, he was \nspeaking about very ordinary jobs. He was speaking on behalf, he said, \nof immigrants who he wanted to come in to fill these jobs. He said \nthese jobs are going begging and we need to pass his particular bill in \norder to make it possible for these immigrants to take these jobs.\n  I am not a member of the appropriate committee, so I cannot comment \nin detail on the bill he was pressing, but I would like to go back to \nour debate of yesterday when the senior Senator from Massachusetts was \ndemanding that we raise the minimum wage. We have raised the minimum \nwage. We do that periodically. But he is demanding that we raise the \nminimum wage again.\n  To me, there is an interesting gap between the rhetoric of yesterday \nthat says these people cannot support themselves on their wage and the \nGovernment must interfere, once again, with market forces that set \ntheir wages, to push those wages up, and then the rhetoric of today \nthat says there are a bunch of low-level jobs going unfilled.\n  If the jobs are going unfilled, why is it? It is, once again, because \nthere are not people qualified to take them. I told the Senate \nyesterday about the experience I have in my home State. When I talk to \nemployers, they say their biggest problem is finding workers. They \ncan't get anybody to fill the jobs.\n  I ask them: Do you offer more than the minimum wage?\n  The answer is always: Yes, we are offering more than the minimum \nwage.\n  The problem is not that the Government hasn't mandated a high enough \nwage in order for these people who are just subsisting at minimum wage \nto get by; the problem is they do not have the skills that will allow \nthem to return enough value to the employer so they can command the \njobs that are open in this economy.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts answered his rhetoric of yesterday \nwith his rhetoric of today. I hope he can connect the two so that we \ncan realize that the challenge for people who are living at poverty's \nedge, the working poor who are getting by on just the minimum wage, is \nnot Government intervention to artificially demand that they be paid \nmore and, thereby, in some cases, run the risk of being priced out of \nthe market for the skills they have. The challenge is to see that their \nskills are improved. That is where training money should go. That is \nwhere many American corporations are spending their training money, and \nthat is where the educational challenge becomes most obvious.\n  American corporations are spending billions of dollars to teach \nemployees how to read and write. That is correct--billions of dollars \nto teach basic skills that should have been learned in public schools \nand were not.\n  Now we get to the next issue that the Senator from Massachusetts \ntalked about in his presentation, which is education. I was lured back \ninto public life by the issue of education. I was very happy being the \nCEO of a comfortable and profitable company.\n  I got a phone call one day saying: Would you be willing to serve as a \nmember of the strategic planning commission for the Utah State Board of \nEducation and address our education issue?\n  I said: Yes, that sounds like a proper kind of citizen thing to do.\n  Then I got a phone call a few days later and they said: By the way, \nwe want you to be the chairman of that commission.\n  Thus, I found myself dragged in a little further and a little deeper \nthan I had originally planned.\n  I immersed myself in education issues and came out of that experience \nabsolutely convinced of several things:\n  No. 1, education is our No. 1 survival issue. Now that the Soviet \nUnion is no more, nothing threatens the future of America, long term, \nso much as the educational challenge that we face. I am sure that the \nSenator from Massachusetts would agree with me on that.\n  No. 2, nothing is more high bound and determined not to change than \nthe educational institution in this country. And we have seen that in \nthe debate on this floor. We have seen that in the educational \ninitiatives that have been offered on this floor. The Republicans have \nbrought forth proposal after proposal after proposal that would bring \nfresh air, new opportunities, new experimentation into the educational \nestablishment. Some of them passed, some of them were filibustered. \nThose that were passed were vetoed. And always we were told the \nsolution to education is to put more money into the present system.\n  Now, there is a cliche that we have in the business world that says, \n``If you want to keep getting the result you are getting, keep doing \nwhat you are doing.'' If we want to continue the educational crisis and \nchallenge that we have in this country, then we should keep funding \neducation as we are funding it. But when the Senator from Washington \nproposes allowing 10 States to experiment--if they want to--with a \ngreater degree of local control over Federal dollars, we are told: No, \nthat threatens public education as we know it. We can't do that. That \nis risky, that is dangerous.\n\n  We keep reminding our friends on the other side that if the State \ndoesn't want to do that, they don't have to. We are not mandating this \nkind of change. We are just making it an opportunity. No, they \nfilibuster against that. They say the President will veto that. They \nsay we can't consider that.\n  I am not one of those who thinks that a voucher program constitutes a \nsilver bullet that is going to solve every educational problem. I know \nsome on my side of the aisle do believe that. I don't; I think there \nare serious problems with vouchers. But I am willing to experiment with \nthem to find out whether or not in certain circumstances vouchers can \nhelp. I am willing to try and get a little data. The data we have with \nrespect to vouchers is quite encouraging--sufficiently encouraging that \nRobert Reich, a former Secretary of Labor in the Clinton \nadministration, a man not known for his right-wing proclivities, wrote \na piece in the Wall Street Journal that said that the data is in and \nvouchers work. I was stunned when I read that. I thought, gee, the \nexperiment is over and we know that it works. He had a most \ninteresting, most creative kind of further proposal to test the \nimplication of vouchers.\n  But, once again, we heard again and again: No, no, we can't \nexperiment with that. It will threaten public education as we know it. \nAnd here are their key words, which test very well in a poll, and they \nwork very well in a focus group: If you try the Republican experiment \nin education, you will drain money away from the public schools.\n  There is an answer to Robert Reich in the Wall Street Journal \nrecently, where Governor Hunt says: No, no, no; you can't do this \nbecause what you are doing is taking money away from the public \nschools.\n  Well, Mr. President, as I say, I spent most of my life in the private \nsector. I think I understand money and the movement of money. This is \nthe way I understand it. Let me walk through it and see if someone can \nhelp me realize how it takes money away from public schools to run one \nof these experiments.\n  Let's say that a school district is spending $7,000 per year on a \nchild. There are many public school districts in this country that \nspend more than that. We happen to spend less than that in Utah for a \nvariety of reasons. We spend considerably more than that here in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  Let's take that as a number, for the sake of this illustration. The \nschool district is spending $7,000 per child.\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\nAlong comes a Republican opportunity to try something with that child, \nand we follow the Robert Reich formula that says this is only with low-\nincome children. We will not subsidize a Member of Congress who wants \nto send his children to private schools, as many Members of Congress \nhave done--as the Vice President has done. No, we won't subsidize them. \nWe will say that only low-income people who otherwise could not even \nconceive of going anyplace else will be eligible for this program. That \nis Robert Reich's proposal. OK. Let's take $5,000 and say to this \nchild: You can take $5,000 and go someplace else.\n  As I say, in the private world where I have spent most of my time, \n$5,000 subtracted from $7,000 leaves $2,000. It seems to me that if you \ndo that, you are saying to that school district you have an extra \n$2,000 per child for every child to whom you give a voucher, and you \ncan use that $2,000 per child to spend on the children who stay. You \ncan increase spending per child in the public school system if you \nadopt a voucher program such as the one Robert Reich has endorsed.\n  I do not ever hear that when we hear the rhetoric about education. \nYou are taking money away from the public school system. In the \naggregate, yes; you probably are. But we don't teach in the aggregate. \nWe fund and we teach per child. If you are going to make your \ncalculation on the basis of the amount of money available per child, \nyou want as many children on vouchers as you can possibly get because \nyou are going to make an extra $2,000 for every two grand on every one \nof them. That extra $2,000 is available for the kids who stay in the \npublic system.\n  I would be very interested to have anyone on either side of the aisle \nexplain to me why that math doesn't work. Explain to me why the reality \nof those numbers doesn't add up because they always add up every time I \ndo the calculation. Every time I run through the examples, it always \nends up being more money per student less in public education if you \ntry one of these experiments.\n  I repeat again that I do not believe that vouchers represent a silver \nbullet. I have spent enough time examining them that I think there are \nsome serious problems with them. I think it needs to be checked and \nrechecked. We need to be very careful before we endorse any kind of \nmassive movement towards vouchers as some of my fellow Republicans have \ndone.\n  But I ask those who do not even want to experiment: What are you \nafraid of finding? Are you afraid of finding that it might work? I am \nnot afraid of finding that it fails. I am willing to admit that it was \nwrong, once we have some actual data. As I say, Robert Reich decided \nthe data demonstrates that it works. The city of Milwaukee has been \ndoing it longer than anyone else. They endorsed it and say it is \nworking there. The driving force behind it was an inner-city black \nsingle mother named Polly Williams who serves as a liberal member of \nthe Democratic State legislature. She says: The private system is \nfailing my child. It is failing our children.\n  Interestingly, when you do the polls, support for this kind of \nexperimentation is perhaps highest in the minority community--not the \nwhite, middle-class soccer moms in the school districts where the \nschools do a pretty good job, but in the inner-city minority schools \nwhere the children are being left behind,\n  Ultimately, this is the solution to the H-1B visa problem. It is \nfixing American education so that we have enough Americans to fill \nthose 400,000 high-tech jobs. But it will not be done in the way that \nthe Senator from Massachusetts wants to do it.\n  I repeat: If you want to keep getting the results you are getting, \nkeep doing what you are doing. That is basically what he has offered \nus--keep putting more and more money into the present system, and don't \neven think about experimenting with it. When the Republicans say, let's \ntry giving more control to the local school board, we are told, No. \nThat would threaten the present system. When the Republicans say, let's \nexperiment in the District of Columbia with some vouchers and see what \nhappens, we are told, No. That would threaten the present system.\n  I believe we are trying to act responsibly with respect to the \neducation situation. I am afraid there are some others who are trying \nto act politically and respond to the teachers union and other parts of \nthe educational establishment for whom the only thing better than \nthings the way they are is things the way they were. They don't want to \ntry anything different. They don't want to experiment in the way the \nlate Senator from Georgia tried--it was vetoed; the way the Senator \nfrom Washington tried, it was vetoed; the way Robert Reich suggested we \ntry, and it was filibustered.\n\n  I think we should say to the Senator from Massachusetts: What are you \nafraid of? What are you afraid of in terms of experimentation? Don't \nfilibuster; don't tell the President to veto. Let us have some of this \nexperience, and then we will see if we can't move in the direction \nwhich will give us the graduates from American universities who will \nfill the 400,000 high-tech jobs.\n  One final comment: The Senator from Massachusetts talked at great \nlength about problems with the INS and the problems with aliens here on \nan undocumented status who would like citizenship--that we must pass a \nlaw in order to solve their problems. Again, I am not a member of the \ncommittee, and I don't know the details of the law. I might very well \nend up in favor of it. But I would say this to the Senator from \nMassachusetts: If he makes a phone call to the White House, the chances \nare it will be returned more rapidly than if I do.\n  I will share with him my experience as a Senator, which I think is \nnot atypical. We spend more time in our offices in Utah dealing with \nINS problems than any other single issue. More people come in with \nheartrending stories about their difficulty in dealing with the INS.\n  I have ridden along with the Salt Lake Police Department. They told \nme their No. 1 problem has to do with the INS and the way the INS \nhandles undocumented aliens.\n  In the city of Salt Lake, 80 percent of our drug arrests and 50 \npercent of our murders are committed by undocumented aliens. They come \nacross the border, go past the border States, and come into Utah where \nthey think they are free from INS supervision because INS is located \nmost heavily in the border States. And they have set up the drug turf \nwars. They control the drug traffic. They fight to protect their turf. \nThe police tell me that 50 percent of the murders come from that.\n  Interestingly, once the cocaine is gone--they bring it with them--\nthey will go back for more, and then come back again with another \nstash. Interestingly, the chief of police told me that for some reason \nthere was a shortage of cocaine south of the border and that month all \nthey had in Salt Lake was heroin. They brought a different drug with \nthem, and they stayed until that shipment was gone. Then they went back \nand another group came--80 percent of the drug crimes; 50 percent of \nthe murders.\n  Naturally, I spend time with the INS trying to get their assistance \nto deal with this. My point is this: If the Senator from Massachusetts \nis concerned about INS problems, he is not alone. But the problems, it \nappears to me, lie with the administration of the INS in this \nadministration rather than with the underlying legislation that deals \nwith it.\n  I was stunned to discover that there are people in my State who have \nbeen waiting for a green card so long that their 5-year visa \nopportunity will expire before they get it. And the answer as to why \nthey are waiting so long has nothing to do with their qualifications \nbut with the backlog that has been built up in the way the INS \nprocesses applications for green cards. We are not going to solve that \nproblem by passing a visa piece of legislation that the Senator from \nMassachusetts wants.\n  But I think if he made a phone call to the President, if he made a \nphone call to the Attorney General, and he started with the same fervor \nand volume and excitement that he demonstrates from time to time on the \nSenate floor to berate them about the way the INS is administered and \nmanaged, those who need intelligent handling by the INS in my State \nwould start to get some relief. I don't think they will get relief with \nthe passage of this legislation. But I think they can get relief if we \ncan get the attention of the INS, and the managers, the bureaucrats, \nthe\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\npolitical appointees--call them what you will--in the Clinton \nadministration who have been handling this for the last 8 years.\n\n  I am one who would vote for increased appropriations for the INS if I \nwere confident the management of that agency were capable of handling \nit because I recognize the seriousness of the problem. I see day to \nday, from the people who come into my office, how wrenching it is in \nterms of their relationship with their families, but this is something \nthe executive branch should get together first and foremost before they \ncome to the legislative branch for the passing of a piece of \nlegislation that makes everybody feel good.\n  That is the best I can do on this short notice to respond to the \nissues the Senator from Massachusetts has raised. I enjoy the exchanges \nthat seem to come about now as the Senator from Massachusetts, the \nSenator from Minnesota, the Senator from Illinois, and others \nrepeatedly come to the floor to raise these issues. I and other \nSenators on this side will repeatedly come to the floor to respond. I \nam grateful to the Senator from Massachusetts for giving me the \nopportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my understanding is at this time the \nSenate will proceed with the matter before it relating to the Florida \nEverglades and the bill submitted by the distinguished chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee; am I not correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. The pending business is an amendment submitted by the \nSenator from Virginia with my principal cosponsor, the Senator from \nOhio; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment has not been recorded.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4165\n\n   (Purpose: To require payment by non-Federal interests of certain \n                    operation and maintenance costs)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, and \n     Mr. Voinovich and Mr. Inhofe, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4165.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 196, strike lines 1 through 7 and insert the \n     following:\n       (4) Operation and maintenance.--The operation, maintenance, \n     repair, replacement, and rehabilitation of projects and \n     activities carried out under this section shall be consistent \n     with section 528(e)(3) of the Water Resources Development Act \n     of 1996 (110 Stat. 3770).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. I asked the amendment \nbe read because this is a technical amendment. It clearly strikes the \nprovision which, if left, changes the law that the Congress and the \nexecutive branch have operated under for 14 consecutive years. It \nchanges it for this project, and it establishes a precedent that every \nMember of Congress in the future will have to grasp as he or she \nadvocates their next project in their State. I think that is ill \nadvised.\n  For 14 years, we have had a body of law that has served well \nregarding the most complicated and very expensive series of programs to \ntake care of needed situations in our country--floods, saving lives, \nnavigation, promoting commerce. We can go on and describe these many \nprojects that each year the Congress considers working with the Corps \nof Engineers and the executive branch to obtain.\n  All of a sudden, we are going to quietly, with one short sentence, \ntake off the law books the provision which has established that the \nStates have the responsibility for operation and maintenance when these \nprojects are completed with taxpayer money and some cost-sharing \nformula by the States. I think that is wrong. I see no justification.\n  I support this project. I will vote for it. It is a very important \npart of America. Indeed, it is shared, although in Florida the benefits \nare shared by all Americans. I point out regarding the Chesapeake Bay, \nfor years I have advocated, with some success, and with the help of \nmany colleagues, the cleanup and the restoration of that great national \nasset. That has been in progress for a dozen years. Each year, we get a \nfew million dollars to do it, just a few million here and there, to \nimprove this magnificent estuary serving a number of States on the east \ncoast.\n  All of a sudden, we come along with the romance of the Everglades, \nand the administration has some idea--and I cannot find any \njustification clearly in the Record--and says do away with 14 years of \npractice and legislation that has been in effect by the Congress.\n  I say to every Member voting, be prepared to go back home and explain \nto your constituents why they must continue to pay the full 100 percent \nO for their projects in the last 14 years, and all of a sudden \nFlorida gets a cost sharing of 50-50. Be prepared to go back home and \nanswer that question. My amendment simply restores, preserves, the law \nas it has been for 14 years.\n  Very interestingly, in 1996 I, as I have for 14 years, served on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. I happened to be subcommittee \nchairman when we considered the Florida Everglades and wrote the \ninitial legislation to get this project underway. I am addressing the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1996, Public Law 104-303, October \n12, 1996. I refer to the following, 110 Stat. 3770:\n\n       Operation and Maintenance.--The operation and maintenance \n     of projects carried out under this section shall be a non-\n     Federal responsibility.\n\n  So Congress, just 4 years ago, reiterated in this Everglades project \nthat it shall be non-Federal for operations and maintenance.\n  What is the mystery about this project that first induced the \nadministration, then the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nreporting this bill out--what induced them to change the law which was \nvery succinctly and expressly stated just 4 years ago, a law that had \nbeen in effect since 1986?\n  I will vote for this. It is a good project. However, I succinctly \nsay, let's adhere to the law that has served this Nation well. I \nguarantee no Member of this body or the other body can bring to the \nattention of their colleagues the need for something to be done in \ntheir State without having this same cost-sharing formula in the years \nto come.\n  To do otherwise would be unfair to your constituents. So all I am \ntrying to do is preserve equity and fairness--equity and fairness for \nwhat has been done in the past and what shall be done in the future.\n  By requiring the States under the 1986 law, and as repeated under the \n1996 law, to bear the burden of operation and maintenance puts a burden \non the States to examine the projects brought forth by the Members of \nCongress to determine is this worthy, in fact, of the support of the \ntaxpayers of that State for the life of the project. It is a joint \ndecision at that point.\n  Now with the stroke of a pen in this statute we are requiring the \nFederal taxpayers to pay 50 percent of the lifetime of this enormous \nproject. This is one big project.\n  You say, Senator, what do you mean such a big project? Look at the \nbudget. Just look at the budget of the Corps of Engineers for the past \nfew years. It has averaged around $1.4 billion for the whole of \nAmerica, for the 50 States--$1.4 billion. In this bill alone we are \nauthorizing $1.1 billion for 10 of perhaps 50 to 60 projects of this \none restoration of the Everglades.\n  Let me repeat that: $1.1 billion for Florida, and that is \nconstruction costs. The O costs for these first 10 is estimated, \ntotal for these 10 projects, somewhere between $10 and $40 million a \nyear. And as you look at the next 10 and the next 10 and the next 10 \nand the next 10, to where you get to the 50 or 60 total projects for \nthe restoration of the Everglades, that O figure becomes quite \nconsiderable. This project is going to suck the lifeblood out of \nprojects all across America, not only in terms of the construction \ncosts but, if the Congress were to adopt this, 50-50 cost sharing.\n  Paul Revere called out, ``The British are coming.'' I call out: \nFolks, this is coming. I forewarn you. This is coming. You better go \nback home and talk to your constituents and say this one is going to be \nin competition with what I had planned this year and next year, or next \nyear, for our State. Is the Congress ready to take the Corps of \nEngineers' budget averaging $1.4 billion and double it and triple it? \nIf you look at\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\nthe statistics, this budget of the Corps has been coming down through \nthe years. Today, the Corps has insufficient funds to meet the \nrequirements that existed prior to 1986.\n  Let me point that out. Prior to 1986, we did have a cost sharing on \nO for projects. It is still the obligation of the Federal Government \nto live up to the O expenses for the project prior to 1986. Yet the \nCorps is short funds to meet its obligations under law prior to 1986. \nSo I am anxious to hear from our distinguished chairman, a very valued \nand dear friend of mine of many years.\n  I see both the distinguished Senators from Florida are going to \nparticipate at some point in this debate. I just come back to something \nvery simple. What is it about the mystique and the romance of the \nFlorida Everglades that justifies changing a body of law that has \nserved this Nation well for some 14 years, and that was specifically \nreiterated and put into law in 1996 when we addressed the first, very \nfirst pillars, the foundation for the Everglades project which we \naddress here today?\n  Mr. President, I would like to return to this subject, but I know my \ncolleague from Ohio, who is joining with me on this, and my \ndistinguished colleague from Oklahoma--both of whom serve on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee--are desirous of speaking to \nthis issue. For the moment, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Warner amendment. \nIn my dissenting view on S. 2797, the ``Restoring the Everglades, An \nAmerican Legacy Act,'' I outlined my concerns with this legislation. I \nwould like to submit my dissenting view for the Record.\n  While I recognize the Everglades as a national treasure, S. 2797 sets \nprecedents, which I cannot, in good conscience, condone.\n  I would also like to reiterate my objection to the marriage of the \nEverglades and WRDA legislation. I know many advocates of this plan \nargue that the Everglades should be a part of WRDA 2000. However, the \nEverglades plan is hardly a typical WRDA project. Because of the scale \nand departure from existing law and policy of the Everglades \nlegislation, it should be considered as a stand alone bill--not a \nprovision in the Water Resources Development Act of 2000. This is a \nprecedent setting bill. With other plans of this nature in the works, \nthe Everglades will be a model for how we handle these enormous \necological restoration projects in the future. We are entering new and, \nin my opinion, dangerous territory.\n  No. 1. This legislation violates the committee policy concerning the \nneed for a Chief of the Army Corps of Engineer's report before project \nauthorization. This legislation authorizes 10 projects at a cost of \n$1.1 billion with no reports of the Chief of Engineers on these \nprojects. Since 1986, it has been the policy of the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works to require projects to have undergone full \nand final engineering, economic and environmental review by the Chief \nof Engineers prior to project approvals by the committee. This process \nwas established to protect taxpayer dollars by ensuring the soundness \nof all projects. While I understand that, under this legislation, no \nappropriation can be made until a ``Project Implementation Report'' is \nsubmitted by the Corps, this legislation is still breaking committee \npolicy--it is authorizing projects without a Chief's report.\n  No. 2. Everglades restoration is based on unproven technology. I have \nserious concerns about the wisdom of a federal investment in unproven \ntechnologies--particularly a $7.8 billion investment. The project \napproval process, described above, was established to prevent exactly \nwhat is happening with this legislation--a gamble with the American \ntaxpayers' money.\n  No. 3. The open-ended nature of costs of this project. The total cost \nof the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is estimated at $7.8 \nbillion over 38 years. This is the current estimate. I have serious \nconcerns about this potential for cost over runs associated with this \nproject. GAO agrees with me. In a report--released today--GAO stated, \n``Currently, there are too many uncertainties to estimate the number \nand costs of the Corps projects that will ultimately be needed . . .'' \nAs with almost all federal programs, this project will probably cost \nmuch more at the end of the day. For example, in 1967, when the \nMedicare program was passed by Congress, the program was estimated to \ncost $3.4 billion. In 2000, the costs of the program are estimated to \n$232 billion. No one could have foreseen this exponential growth! The \nfuture cost of projects of this magnitude must be taken into \nconsideration by Congress before we pass legislation. Once projects \nlike these get major investments, they are funded until the end--no \nmatter what the cost. There should be a cost cap on the entire \nEverglades project--not just on portions.\n  No. 4. This legislation sets a new precedent which requires the \nfederal government to pay for a major portion of operations and \nmaintenance costs. The Warner amendment will remedy this problem.\n  Since 1986, water resource projects, including environmental, \nnavigation, flood control, and hurricane restoration are financed \npartially by the federal government and partially by the local and \nstate governments. And all of the costs of operations and maintenance \nof the projects has been the non-federal entities--usually state or \nlocal governments responsibility. We should not forget that this \ncritical cost-share policy was a key factor in breaking a 16 year \nstalemate on water resources development authorization legislation.\n  This Everglades legislation splits the cost of operations and \nmaintenance of the Everglades--\\1/2\\ to the federal government and \\1/\n2\\ to the State of Florida. The O expenditures for these prematurely \nauthorized projects is expected to cost $20 million, and, according the \nCorp, when the Everglades project is completed, O costs are projected \nto be in excess of $170 million a year.\n  At the end of FY 2000, there will be a $1.6 billion backlog of \nfederal O costs nationwide of which $329 million is considered \n``critical'' because, if O is not performed on these facilities, they \nwill not be able to maintain current performance. In the Tulsa \ndistrict, which includes Oklahoma, there is a $80 million backlog in \nO The $170 million needed for O of the Everglades--which is almost \nhalf of the this year's critical backlog--will drain resources--\ncreating a larger backlog around the rest of the nation. How can we \nfund local O expenses when we can't fund federal O expenses.\n  States and localities have enormous backlogs of operations and \nmaintenance costs due to lack of funding. The precedent, which the \nEverglades legislation sets, could open a pandora's box--having the \nFederal Government take on expenses for the operations and maintenance \nof many projects. There are a number of Oklahoma projects that could \nuse federal funds for operations and maintenance costs. My hometown of \nTulsa pays in excess of $3 million a year in O costs.\n  The Everglades legislation is also unfair because the Corps will be \nconducting annual inspections on all flood control projects turned over \nto the local sponsors for 100 percent O Though they try very hard, \nmany localities, which cannot afford O costs, will not be able to \nkeep their projects properly maintained. When it comes time for more \nFederal projects, they will not be favorably looked upon. the Federal \nGovernment will say, well, if the local sponsor cannot afford the \ncurrent cost-share agreement, how could they afford a new one--even if \nthe community desperately needs the new project. How can the Federal \nGovernment fund Florida's Everglades O bill; while other community's \nprojects are denied because they can not afford proper O and we will \nnot help them? How is this fair?\n  Again, I recognize the Everglades as a national treasure--as I do \nmany treasures in Oklahoma. As Congress considers the Everglades \nrestoration legislation, all I ask is that Congress play by the rules.\n  Mr. President, to reiterate, I commend the Senator from Virginia for \nbringing to our attention what is happening here. I am concerned. This \nis a major piece of legislation. As I said yesterday in committee, it \nwould be my preference not to have it as part of the water bill but to \nhave it as a stand-alone bill. Because of the size, the magnitude, and \nnature of it, it should be. It is true what Senator Warner has said \nabout how this violates both the letter\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\nand the intent of what we decided in 1986. I remember when it happened. \nBut it is not just in this area. Let me mention briefly three other \nareas where we are having the same problem.\n  First of all, this legislation violates the committee policy \nconcerning the need for the Chief of the Army Corps of Engineer's \nreport before project authorization. This was decided back in 1986. To \nmy knowledge--and I had my staff research this--we have not gone \nforward with any other projects that have not had a recommendation and \na report completed by the Chief of the Corps of Engineers.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I checked that \nout. This is part of the statement I am putting in the Record. Clearly, \nit was not done. That is a second area where it is deviating from the \nlongstanding practice of the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I can see what is going to happen after this because \nevery time something comes up they are going to say: Wait a minute, you \ndidn't require it then. They are overworked. So why should we require \nit now?\n  We have two right now in the State of Oklahoma, in my State, awaiting \nthose reports.\n  The second thing is the unproven technology. If you go back to 1986, \nrepeated again in 1996, we said we will only use proven technology when \nthese projects are authorized. Admittedly, during the committee meeting \nthey said--in fact even the chairman of the committee said--we know a \nlot of this technology is not proven.\n  The third thing is it is open ended. I want to mention we are talking \nabout $7.8 billion over 38 years. Yesterday, the GAO came out, and \nafter pressing on this, said it could be higher. How much higher? It \ncould be as high as $14 billion. I am old enough to remember--I think \nthere are a couple of us in this Chamber who might remember, too--back \nin 1967 when we started out on the Medicare program. They said at that \ntime it was going to cost $3.4 billion. I suggest to you this year it \nis $232 billion. I do not like these open-ended things. They say we are \nonly talking about the first year. Once you start, you are committed.\n  The last thing, of course, is what this amendment addresses. I \nbelieve very strongly that when we open up the O accounts, the \noperation and maintenance costs will be borne by the Federal \nGovernment. It is not just going to be that on future projects that \ncome up we will say we don't have to worry about O accounts because \n50 percent of it can be provided by the Federal Government; there is \nnow a precedent for it. Not only that, I can see right now coming back \non existing projects and saying: Look, we are undergoing that as a \nState expense. Why should we do that when we are not doing it for this \nparticular project?\n  I think the amendment is very good, but I think the amendment should \nbe broadened to cover these other violations of both the intent and \nletter of the 1986 law.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator yields the floor--we \nserved on the Environment Committee for 14 years--I have to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate another project. It is called the Central \nArtery in Boston. There are those who affectionately refer to it as \n``the big ditch'' which our late, highly respected and beloved Speaker \nof the House, Tip O'Neill, initiated. I went back and checked the \nrecord, I say to my friend from Oklahoma. I bear some of the \nresponsibility because I was on this committee at this time.\n  The first estimate for the big ditch was $1 billion. It is still \nunfinished. We have expended about $7 or $8 billion and the GAO \nestimate to finish it is $13.5 billion, underlining the importance of \ngetting that chief engineer's report, which has been the law and the \nprecedent of our committee for these many years. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Senator. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise to support the Warner-Voinovich-\nInhofe amendment regarding operation and maintenance of the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan.\n  I join my colleagues in rejecting the current language contained in \nthe legislation which unfairly grants the State of Florida a 50-percent \nnon-Federal and 50-percent Federal cost share on the operation and \nmaintenance of the Everglades project. I note this is even more \ngenerous than the administration's bill which provided for a 40-percent \nFederal share.\n  This amendment is an issue of equity among all of the 50 States, \nwhere, to date, operation and maintenance has been a State and local \nresponsibility. I remind my colleagues that the recommendation of the \nChief of Engineers was that the operation and maintenance of the \nEverglades restoration project be 100-percent non-Federal, consistent \nwith WRDA 1986 and national policy, as pointed out by my colleague from \nVirginia.\n  The annual operation and maintenance costs for the construction \nfeatures of the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan currently \ncontained in S. 2796 are $172 million per year.\n  These operation and maintenance costs would be shared on a 50-50 \nbasis, which means the Federal share of these costs would be almost $90 \nmillion. The current operation and maintenance appropriation nationally \nis about $1.8 billion. This means the Everglades operation and \nmaintenance responsibility of the Corps could represent 5 percent of \nthe total current national appropriation for operation and maintenance.\n  The stark reality is that the Corps of Engineers is in no position to \nassume a large additional maintenance burden. By 2001, the Corps will \nhave a backlog of critical maintenance nationwide of $450 million.\n  Chart 1, which I have before the Senate, shows a breakdown of that \nbacklog by project purposes. As my colleagues will note, 61 percent of \nthe maintenance backlog is in navigation, both inland navigation on our \nrivers and maintenance dredging of our coastal harbors. The Corps is \nnot meeting its critical needs today for the infrastructure we depend \non for our increasingly trade-based economy.\n  My colleagues should realize these unmet needs are in each of our \nStates, not only in Florida but throughout the United States. Further, \nmy colleagues can also see that maintenance of the flood control \nprojects that are essential in protecting lives and property makes up a \nsignificant part of the backlog at 18 percent.\n  Finally, I want to highlight recreation which is especially important \nto my colleagues from the West. The Corps is second among Federal \nagencies in recreation visitation to the land and water resources it \nmanages. Many people associate the Corps with its lake projects, and \nyet the Corps does not have the resources it needs to meet its \nmaintenance responsibilities at these projects.\n  This next chart shows the maintenance shortfall by State as a \npercentage of the maintenance backlog. As one can see, California has \nthe largest, followed by Florida and Louisiana. It is ironic to me that \nFlorida is among the States already most severely impacted by the \nmaintenance backlog whose situation is likely to become much more \nsevere if the Corps takes on a larger portion of the operation and \nmaintenance responsibility for the Everglades. I ask my colleague, \nSenator Graham, how do you believe the Corps will be able to meet the \nmaintenance needs in Florida, such as dredging its harbors, maintaining \nits waterways, and operating portions of the central and south Florida \nproject while taking on this additional $90-million-a-year maintenance \nburden?\n\n  This last chart I have before the Senate shows a few examples of \nmaintenance needs that are not being addressed in some of the other 49 \nStates.\n  The reason I bring these charts to my colleagues' attention is that \nthis maintenance problem is not in a few States; it goes across the \nUnited States of America. Every Senator in some way is impacted because \nwe do not have enough money for paying for the operation and \nmaintenance on these projects.\n  Operation and maintenance activities to accommodate the large influx \nof recreation visitors to Corps projects along the route of the Lewis \nand Clark exploration during its bicentennial celebration is \nunderfunded. It deals with the Missouri River basin--the Dakotas, \nMontana, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska.\n  How about the dredging in New York Harbor? That needs to be done.\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\n  How about seismic studies on projects throughout the New England \nStates which are not able to be done because we do not have enough \nmoney?\n  How about recreation facilities in Oklahoma or flood protection in \nNorth and South Dakota?\n  The point is, it is not a Florida issue. Adding to a maintenance \nburden that the Corps already cannot meet will impact all of us who \nhave Corps-managed resources in our States.\n  This is a matter of equity. The Senator from Virginia has spoken to \nthat eloquently. We had it right in WRDA 1986. The operation and \nmaintenance responsibility for new Corps of Engineers investments must \nrest with the non-Federal sponsors. We cannot afford at this time to \ndeviate from principle.\n  This is my first term in the Senate, but I have been here long enough \nto know that if we begin to make exceptions, there will be no end to \nit. We must stick to our principles, and that is why I am asking my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a moment? I want to clarify, \nthe charts of the Senator from Ohio are pre-1986 projects done by the \nCorps.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the point. In other words, all of that magnitude \nof money, which was a $451 million shortfall last fiscal year, is for \nprojects done prior to 1986. Since 1986, the States have paid for it \nand that is existing law. If you fail to maintain a project, a dam or a \nwaterway, what happens? It deteriorates. The cement crumbles, the silt \nfills in, and it begins to degrade and begins to impact the safety of \nthe citizens who rely on those projects for protection or navigation.\n  This is a very serious program my distinguished colleague brings to \nthe attention of the Senate, and I am so glad that the Senator clearly \nreiterated my message: It is not a Florida situation; it is all 50 \nStates.\n  When my colleagues vote, bear in mind how that vote affects this year \nand for years to come your State projects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished Senator from Florida, Mr. Graham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank my colleague \nand chairman of Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, who \nhas given outstanding leadership to this entire legislation, the Water \nResources Development Act of 2000, and has been a particularly \nthoughtful student of the Everglades restoration.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the amendment proposed by my colleague \nfrom Virginia. To put what we are about in some context, we are talking \nabout a unique partnership between a State and the Federal Government \nfor the protection of one of the world's treasures. The Florida \nEverglades has been designated by the United Nations as a world \nheritage site, one of the few places on the planet that has been \ndesignated such because of its unique features, features that have a \nglobal importance.\n  Everglades National Park, which is just a small portion of the \noverall Everglades system, is the second largest national park in the \ncontinental United States. This restoration program will be the most \nsignificant and the most expensive environmental restoration project \never attempted anywhere in the world.\n  This is going to be a world laboratory for how we will restore \ndamaged environmental systems, both within the United States and \nelsewhere on the globe.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. It has been an effort that has now \nbeen underway for the better part of three decades --bipartisan in the \nsense that it has been supported by Republican Presidents and \nGovernors, Congresses, and State legislatures; and Democratic \nPresidents, Governors, Congresses, and State legislatures.\n  It is a proposal that is much in the nature of a marriage. It is a \nrelationship in which both partners must respect each other, pledge to \nwork through their challenges together, and, thus, build a strong and \nsustaining relationship.\n  The legislation before us today offers a balance between the partners \nof that marriage. It requires the State to pay 50 percent of the \nconstruction cost of this project. It requires the State to pay 50 \npercent of the $7.8 billion, which is the estimated cost of \nconstruction of this project over the next 30 to 40 years.\n  It requires the Federal Government to pay 50 percent of the operation \nand maintenance costs of the project as it is completed.\n  Cost sharing for operation and maintenance represents a responsible \naction by the Federal Government to protect the Federal taxpayers' \ninvestment in the restoration of the Everglades.\n  Why is this a responsible action? It is a responsible action and is \nalso a recognition of a reality which differentiates this project from \nother Federal public works projects; that the major beneficiary of this \nproject is the natural system, and the natural system is owned in large \npart by the Federal Government.\n  To repeat, the principal beneficiary of this project will be enormous \nFederal land tracts in the affected area. Thus, the Federal Government \nhas an ongoing interest; and we suggest, as does the committee of \njurisdiction, the administration, and the State of Florida, that that \nlarge Federal investment and responsibility warrants an ongoing \nFederal-State shared role in the operation and maintenance of the \nproject once it is completed.\n  Some of the projects that are in this plan, such as the wastewater \nreuse projects, which have some of the highest estimated cost of \noperation and maintenance, are included primarily for the benefit of \nBiscayne National Park, Florida Bay, a significant part of Everglades \nNational Park, and the National Marine Sanctuary. The perspective that \nI share is not mine alone or not parochially Florida's alone.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters on this topic \nbe printed in the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The first letter is signed by a broad coalition of \nnational environmental groups, including the National Audubon Society, \nthe National Parks Conservation Association, the Natural Resources \nDefense Council, the Sierra Club, the World Wildlife Fund, as well as \nenvironmental groups within Florida.\n  This letter states:\n\n       In addition, approval of the [Warner] amendment would . . . \nseverely jeopardize the likelihood of enacting Everglades Restoration \nlegislation this year. . . .\n\n  The second letter is from a broad coalition of agricultural and \nindustrial representatives. It states:\n\n       The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan is primarily \n     a plan to restore and protect Federal properties.\n\n  It also states:\n\n       The coalition of Florida agriculture, water utilities, and \n     homebuilders is convinced that without Federal participation \n     in the costs of operation, maintenance, repair, replacement, \n     and rehabilitation activities associated with the \n     Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, Everglades \n     restoration will never be implemented.\n\n  My colleague, Senator Mack, will soon be inserting into the Record a \nletter from Florida's Governor, Jeb Bush, which will state, in part:\n\n       Not only is this partnership formula fiscally and \n     politically prudent, it is also critical to maintaining the \n     diverse and broad-based support that the bill before you has \n     earned.\n\n  Mr. President, you and others in this body may ask why there is near \nunanimous agreement that operation and maintenance costs must be a \nshared cost of this project. What is it that differentiates this \nproject from other public works projects?\n  Let me suggest the following. First, to quote from the bill itself:\n\n       The overarching objective of the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan is the restoration, preservation, and \n     protection of the South Florida ecosystem while providing for \n     other water-related needs of the region.\n\n  Let me read a portion of that again:\n\n       The overarching objective of the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan is the restoration, preservation, and \n     protection of the South Florida ecosystem. . . .\n\n  What is that system that we are about to protect and preserve? It is \nessentially a Federal system.\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\n  First, it is an enormous marine sanctuary that runs from the lower \npart of the Florida peninsula to some 150 miles to the Dry Tortugas, an \narea with the only living corral reef area in the continental United \nStates.\n  It is also four units of the National Park System: The Everglades \nNational Park, which I indicated earlier is the second largest national \npark in the continental United States; Biscayne National Park; the Dry \nTortugas National Park; and the Big Cypress Natural Preserve. Those \ngreat Federal ownership areas are going to be primary beneficiaries of \nthe restoration of the Everglades; finally, 16 national wildlife \nrefuges in the area that will be affected by the Everglades \nrestoration, from those at the upper edges of the Everglades system to \nthose throughout the Florida Keys.\n  Once constructed, this project will be operating, in large part, for \nthe benefit of the natural system, which is in Federal ownership.\n  As the primary beneficiary of this project, the Federal Government \nshould have a continued interest and financial role in seeing that its \ngoals are achieved through appropriate implementation.\n  Once the Federal Government is a full and equal partner in the cost \nof operating this project, it will also be able to assure that the \nproject continues to be operated for the benefit of the natural system \nin Federal ownership.\n  Without this participation in operation and maintenance, the Federal \nGovernment would be, in effect, abdicating its responsibility to the \nAmerican taxpayers to protect the investment which they are going to \nmake in restoration of the Everglades, which they have already made in \nthe acquisition of these enormous Federal interests.\n  Another important fact, in reviewing Senator Warner's proposal, is \nthe cost-sharing for the Everglades restoration project. I did not hear \nthis very significant fact mentioned by any of the three previous \nspeakers.\n  The traditional Federal public works project is financed 65 percent \nby the Federal Government, 35 percent by the local sponsor, whoever \nthat might be.\n  There are several and significant environmental and ecosystem \nrestoration projects which contain that very cost sharing in the bill \nthat we have before us, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000.\n  I draw your attention to page 118, line 7: A project for \nenvironmental restoration at Upper Newport Bay Harbor in California; \n65-percent Federal, 35-percent local sponsor.\n  On page 121, line 23, there is a project for ecosystem restoration at \nWolf River in Memphis, TN; 65-percent Federal, 35-percent local \nsponsor.\n  On page 122, line 3, there is a project for environmental restoration \nat Jackson Hole, WY, 65-percent Federal, 35-percent local sponsor.\n  I point out these examples in this very bill that is before us today, \nnot because they are unusual but because in fact they are the norm. \nSixty-five percent is the normal share that the Federal Government pays \nfor a project in the Water Resources Development Act.\n  But for this project, one of the largest projects of its type in our \nNation's history, the State of Florida is paying 50 percent--not 35 \npercent, but 50 percent--of the cost of construction.\n  To my knowledge--and I ask the proponents of this amendment if they \nhave information to the contrary--I know of no other local sponsor for \nan environmental restoration project who is paying 50 percent of the \ncost of the project.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, I would be \nhappy to reply.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my amendment goes to the operation and \nmaintenance, which from 1986 on was 100-percent State responsibility. \nThat is the amendment. The Senator, of course, quite properly is \naddressing, by way of background, the construction. And there are \nvarious formulas for cost sharing on construction. But he points out \nthat they are paying 50 percent versus the 35 percent on the \nconstruction allocation of the State. But in fairness, the reason they \nare paying the higher is that there are some other than environmental \nprojects here. This whole thing goes from Orlando to the tip of \nFlorida. This is enormous. This is over half the State's length; is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That happens to be the size of the Everglades system. \nThis project encompasses the Everglades system, an integrated \nenvironmental system, the totality of which creates the environments \nthat sustain all of these great Federal investments.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am trying to draw some parallel for the average Member \nof Congress who deals with a dam or a waterway which is in a small \nportion, relatively speaking, of his or her State. This covers over \nhalf the State; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. No.\n  Mr. WARNER. All right. What percentage, from Orlando to the tip?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. From Orlando to the tip of Florida would be approximately \n35 to 40 percent.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thirty-five to forty. I was off 10 percent. I say to my \ngood friend, the reason you go to 50 percent and not 35 is you are \ncovering non-Federal and part of municipal water supplies. There are a \nwhole lot of municipal water supplies that are benefited.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would appreciate the opportunity to \ncomplete my remarks, and then I would like to respond specifically to \nthe statement relative to the nature of the projects, the Federal \npurposes that they will play, and the appropriateness of the overall \narrangement of a 50-percent State share in construction and then a 50-\npercent Federal share in operation and maintenance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Certainly, I did not wish to invade. But the Senator \ninvited questions: Does any other Senator know of projects other than \n35 percent? I am pointing out, yes, because he is including a lot of \nmunicipal water supply, treatment plants for runoff water, and a lot of \nother things that most States pay for back home.\n\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will return to discuss the specific issue of municipal \nwater. Let me complete the arithmetic of the analysis I was doing.\n  On an annual basis, the difference between the State of Florida \ncontributing 50 percent as opposed to the norm of 35 percent is \napproximately a $35-million-a-year savings during the construction \nperiod of this project, some 30 to 40 years, for the Federal \nGovernment. If the Federal Government were to take that $35-million-a-\nyear savings and invest it, even at a conservative rate of interest of \n5 percent, over the period of this project, that would produce a total \nof approximately $1.8 billion. That is the savings plus the interest \nearned on those savings to the Federal Government. That $1.8 billion \nwould pay the cost of operation and maintenance of this project to \napproximately the year 2050.\n  We are, for the first half century of the 21st century, going to be \nsaving the Federal Government an enormous amount of money by the State \npaying at the rate of 50 percent rather than 35 percent, and those \nfunds will go substantially towards meeting these ongoing operation and \nmaintenance costs that the Federal Government will share on a 50-50 \nbasis.\n  The amendment Senator Warner has offered fails to recognize any of \nthese distinct characteristics, the nature of the Federal interest to \nbe protected, the continuing interest of the Federal Government in how \nits capital investment is implemented, and, finally, the fact that \nbecause of a much more generous and forthcoming State share of the \nconstruction cost, the Federal Government is saved substantial funds.\n  The Senator from Virginia raised the question that there are other \nprojects. He specifically talked about wastewater projects. There are \nno wastewater projects in here. There are wastewater reuse projects \nwhich are one of the areas being done precisely to protect Federal \ninterests. They are not wastewater systems that are going to be serving \na local municipality. They are wastewater systems to purify the water \nbefore it goes into the Biscayne Bay National Park and before it goes \ninto the Florida Bay component of the Everglades National Park or \nbefore it goes into the National Marine Sanctuary in the Florida Keys.\n  This is not a wastewater treatment system that a municipality would \nhave. These are systems to protect the quality of water in order to \nprotect the quality of the Federal investment. As I said earlier, these \nare some of the most expensive of the operation and maintenance costs \nthis project will generate.\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\n  The amendment fails to reflect the fact that this is a marriage, a \nmarriage between the State and Federal Government, and that that \nmarriage is necessary to assure the plan's success, a true union where \neach partner respects the other and makes a commitment as equals. \nEverglades restoration won't work unless the executive branch, \nCongress, and the State government move forward hand in hand.\n  We are about to make one of the most important decisions that this \nCongress will make. Obviously, it is a project that has enormous \npersonal interest to me because of my personal long association with \nthe Everglades and my deep appreciation of the qualities it represents. \nBut this will be an opportunity for the Congress to commit itself to \none of the great ventures in terms of environmental restoration and \nprotection in our Nation's history. It is a project that I suggest \nMembers of Congress will look back upon later in their lives and \ncareers with pride that they were part of this effort.\n  It is a project in which we are asking that there be a long-term \ncommitment with the State of Florida. On the concerns that were \nexpressed about the possibility that additional changes might be called \nfor, or additional costs incurred, I underscore, every one of those \ncosts is going to be shared on a 50-50 basis. So we have a partner in \nthis project who is going to be just as concerned about achieving the \nresult and doing so in the most cost-effective way as we share those \nconcerns.\n  So this is legislation which is truly historic. It is legislation \nwhich will lead us down the path toward Everglades restoration--a goal \nwhich our Nation has shared for many decades, a goal in which we can \nplay an important role today in seeing that it becomes reality.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n         1000 Friends of Florida, Audubon of Florida, Center for \n           Marine Conservation, The Everglades Foundation, The \n           Everglades Trust, National Audubon Society, National \n           Parks Conservation Association, Natural Resource \n           Defense Council, Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund,\n                                               September 19, 2000.\n     Hon.

Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Environment and Public Works \n         Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Baucus: We are writing to \n     express our opposition to the Voinovich amendment to H.R. \n     2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, that would \n     eliminate the state-federal operations and maintenance (O) \n     cost share for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan \n     (CERP).\n       S. 2796 presently provides a 50-50 cost share between the \n     State and Federal government. The Voinovich amendment would \n     make the State of Florida pay the entire cost. The Voinovich \n     amendment ignores the fact that this is no ordinary water \n     project because the taxpayer is a primary beneficiary of the \n     project.\n       Within the project area there is a unique and compelling \n     federal interest that justifies a 50-50 state/federal cost \n     share for operations and maintenance. The project area \n     includes four National Parks, 16 National Wildlife Refuges, \n     and one National Marine Sanctuary that comprise five million \n     acres of federally owned and managed lands--50% of the \n     remaining Everglades.\n       In addition, approval of the Voinovich amendment would \n     likely yield two results; both of which would severely \n     jeopardize the likelihood of enacting Everglades Restoration \n     legislation this year: First, the State could withdraw its \n     support for the bill leaving this a project without a non-\n     federal sponsor. Or, the State could seek new modifications \n     to reflect the diminished federal commitment to restoration \n     of America's Everglades, a move that would send the \n     Everglades back to the drawing board with no time left on the \n     clock.\n       Therefore, we respectfully request that you vote against \n     the Voinovich Everglades cost share amendment to S. 2796.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n       Nathaniel Reed, Chairman, 1000 Friends of Florida.\n       David Guggenheim, Vice President for Conservation Policy, \n     Center for Marine Conservation.\n       Tom Rumberger, Chairman, The Everglades Trust.\n       Mary Munson, Director, South Florida Programs, National \n     Parks Conservation Association.\n       Frank Jackalone, Senior Field Representative, Sierra Club.\n       Stuart Strahl, Ph.D., Executive Director, Audubon of \n     Florida.\n       Mary Barley, Chair, The Everglades Foundation.\n       Tom Adams, Director of Government Affairs, National Audubon \n     Society.\n       Bradford H.

Governor \n     Bush's Commission for the Everglades has taken the position \n     that if the Federal government is to be a full and equal \n     partner in restoration, it should share in all of the \n     associated costs. Furthermore, it is certain that the Florida \n     Legislature will not supply the level of funding needed to \n     construct this plan if they are going to have to pay the full \n     cost of operation over the life of the project.\n       The CERP is primarily a plan to restore and protect Federal \n     properties, and the development of the plan has been \n     dominated by the federal agencies, especially the Department \n     of Interior. The restoration of a unique ecological system of \n     world significance dramatically and fundamentally \n     distinguishes the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan from \n     those of other Army Civil Works projects.\n       Furthermore, the Army Corps of Engineers indicated to \n     stakeholders throughout the planning process that it would \n     seek cost sharing for all modifications over their life \n     cycle. This commitment eliminated the biases in project \n     decision-making that result when all costs are not treated in \n     the same way. Affirming this commitment in the authorization \n     will ensure that project design decisions will continue to be \n     based on cost-effectiveness alone.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert K. Dawson,\n                                                        President.\n\n\n                           Coalition Members\n\n       Florida Citrus Mutual (Mr. Ken Keck, Director for \n     Government Affairs).\n       Florida Farm Bureau (Mr. Carl B.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack. And I thank him for \nhis help and cooperation on this legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to say to my dear friend, the Senator \nfrom Virginia, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to his presentation. And \nI say this with all good humor. It was a great performance. It reminded \nme a little of Chicken Little in ``The Sky is Falling'' when I listened \nto equating $86 million in operating expenses to a $1.4 billion budget. \nThe $86 million will be the cost of operating and maintaining this new \nsystem 25 or 30 years from now. I think it might be appropriate to try \nto figure out what the Corps' budget might be 25 or 30 years from now. \nI think that would bring a more significant understanding of the impact \nof the operating and maintenance costs to the Federal Government.\n  The second point I will make is that we are already spending more \nthan that now on the Everglades. I suggest that on this project we are \nproposing today--and I believe strongly that it will pass--we will \nprobably seek a reduction in the long run as a part of the Corps' \nbudget. But, again, I appreciate the fervor with which my colleague \npresented his argument.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his courtesy. We will have more \nto say.\n  Mr. MACK. I am sure we will.\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am in strong opposition to the amendment offered by \nmy friend from Virginia. This amendment, if passed, will put an end to \nthe unprecedented partnership developed between the Federal Government \nand the State of Florida in an effort to restore and protect America's \nEverglades. While I am sure my colleague from Virginia has the best of \nintentions in offering his amendment, I caution my colleagues that one-\nsize-fits-all solutions can be extremely harmful to something as \nsensitive and as difficult as Everglades restoration.\n\n  It may be useful to take a few minutes today to help highlight the \nEverglades provision in the water resources bill before us and explain \nhow the amendment of the Senator from Virginia will impact our \nlongstanding efforts to restore and protect this unique ecosystem.\n  Let me begin by stating that the legislation before us today is a \nconsensus product supported by a full spectrum of environmental groups \nand economic stakeholders. It is supported by Florida's two Indian \ntribes, Gov. Jeb Bush of the State of Florida, and it is supported by \nthe Clinton administration.\n  Nine months ago, my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, and I set \nout to write a balanced Everglades bill that addressed the needs of \nsouth Florida's environment and its citizens. This was no small task. \nWe asked individuals and groups who have long been divided to set aside \ntheir differences and work together with us. We asked them to help us \nrestore this vibrant, natural system to its former glory. With the \nsteady leadership of Chairman Bob Smith and Senator Baucus, we have \naccomplished our goal. The bill we bring to the floor today is \nsomething of which all Americans, and I believe all Senators, can be \nproud.\n  In the bill we are considering today, we authorize a comprehensive \nplan to undo the harm done by 50 years of Federal efforts to control \nflooding in south Florida, without consideration for damage done to \nsouth Florida's environment. This comprehensive plan was developed over \nthe past 8 years by the Corps of Engineers, with input from economic \nand environmental stakeholders, local governments, scientists, \nrestoration engineers, the people of south Florida, and the Congress. \nIt is recognized throughout south Florida and the Nation as a fair and \nbalanced plan to provide for the water-related needs of the region \nwhile, for the first time, ensuring that the needs of the Everglades \nwill be met as well.\n  It is terribly important that we do this. Without this plan, the \nEverglades will die and water, the lifeblood of south Florida's \neconomy, will continue to be siphoned off into the sea without \nbenefiting the environment or the people who live and work in the \nregion.\n  Let me take a moment to share with you some of the principles Senator \nGraham and I have used to guide our efforts this year in drafting this \nbill. We wanted to be sensitive to the legitimate concerns and needs of \nall citizens and interests who have a stake in how the plan is \nimplemented, we wanted to be true to the restoration mandate and ensure \nthat the Everglades got the first benefit of any new water generated by \nthe plan, and we wanted to affirm and establish in law the true \npartnership we share with the State of Florida in achieving the plan's \nrestoration goal.\n  The cooperation between the State agencies charged with managing this \neffort and the Federal Government over the years has been truly \nunprecedented. The State shared the cost of developing the plan we are \nconsidering today. The Corps of Engineers has benefited greatly from \nthe engineering talent at the South Florida Water Management District. \nFlorida has been our full partner in bearing half of the cost of the \nrestoration projects already underway in the Everglades. The State has \ncommitted to split evenly the cost of implementing the plan once it is \nauthorized. The reason for this partnership is simple. Both the State \nand Federal Government have a vital interest in the restoration of the \nEverglades. Both the State and the Federal Government should pay for \nthe cost of operating and maintaining the restoration project once it \nis built.\n\n  I say this to provide background for the debate on the amendment \nbefore us. This partnership we have established is vital to our \nefforts, and if this amendment passes, it will be very difficult to \naccomplish our restoration goals.\n  I have a letter from Gov. Jeb Bush expressing his opposition to the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia. I ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, a key part of this partnership has been the \ncommitment by the State of Florida--already enshrined in a bill \napproved by Governor Bush earlier this year--to pay fully half the $7.8 \nbillion cost of implementing the Everglades restoration plan. This is a \nsignificantly greater cost share than the local sponsor typically pays \nto construct a Corps project.\n  Many Corps projects have a local cost share of as little as 20 \npercent of the total project and few pay more than 35 percent. In fact, \nif the State were paying 35 percent, rather than the 50 percent it has \ncommitted to, it would increase the burden of the Federal taxpayer by \nalmost $1.2 billion. Let me repeat that. The State has committed to a \ngreater-than-average cost share for constructing the restoration \nproject and will save the Federal taxpayers almost $1.2 billion.\n  I believe the good faith demonstrated by the State's offer--not to \nmention the resulting savings of the Federal Government--clearly \nrefutes any argument that the State is somehow unduly benefiting from \nthe operation and maintenance cost share proposed in the bill before us \ntoday.\n  While I cannot stress enough the damage this amendment will do to our \nrelationship with the State of Florida, I remind my colleagues about \nthe significant Federal investment we are making in the Everglades and \nthe important Federal interest in ensuring this project is operated and \nmaintained properly.\n  Within the boundaries of the proposed restoration area, there are \nfour national parks, including Everglades National Park, one of the \ncrown jewels of our National Park System. There is a national marine \nsanctuary and many other national interests. All of these important \nenvironmental assets are dependent upon the successful operation of the \nrestoration plan.\n  If the project is not operated properly--if the water is not right--\nthese important Federal holdings in south Florida will continue to \nsuffer the same fate they are suffering today. If we and the State of \nFlorida are to come together behind a restoration plan and spend $7.8 \nbillion to implement that plan, it seems we also have the \nresponsibility and obligation to stay in Florida and help with the \nsuccessful operation and maintenance of the project. That is a \nreasonable position.\n  I add that the operation and maintenance cost share in this bill is \nfully consistent with prior central and southern Florida project \nauthorizations. In fact, the Federal Government pays the full cost of \noperating and maintaining the levees, channels, locks, and control \nworks of the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee \nRiver. The Federal Government pays the full cost--not 50-50, but the \nfull cost--of operating the levees, channels, locks, and control works \nof the St. Lucie Canal, Lake Okeechobee, and the Caloosahatchee River. \nAll of these areas that I have mentioned are in this restoration area. \nIt pays the full cost of operating and maintaining the main spillways \nin the system's water conservation area.\n  Further, the Flood Control Act of 1968 provided that the project \ncosts of providing water delivery to Everglades National Park is \nconsidered a federal responsibility and on that basis the federal \ngovernment would share in the operation and maintenance of projects \nthat serve that area of the system. The federal government is also \nrequired, under a 1989 law, to participate in the cost share for the \nmodified water deliveries project. And, finally, the water resources \nbill of 1996 provides that the cost of operating and maintaining water \ndeliveries to Taylor Slough and Everglades National Park be shared \nbetween the State and federal governments.\n  That is my argument to this constant mention of the fact that for 14 \nyears we have had this precedent.\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\n  I have just stated the whole series of issues related to the \nEverglades in which there is a whole range of the sharing of costs and \nmaintaining the Everglades system.\n  There appears to be ample precedent for a shared cost between the \nState and federal governments on projects related to the Everglades and \nEverglades restoration.\n  What the Senator from Virginia is advocating is something far \ndifferent. He would have the federal government pack up and leave when \nthe restoration project is completed--essentially abandoning precedent \nand abandoning a national treasure after an unprecedented effort to \nsave it. His amendment would have the federal government abdicate its \nresponsibility, to both the environment and the taxpayer, to protect \nthe substantial investment we're making on their behalf in the \nEverglades.\n  I would remind my colleagues, the Everglades is a dynamic system. It \nis dependent on the steady, reliable supply of fresh water this \nrestoration project will provide over the years.\n  It is not like a levee, or a bridge, which the federal government can \nconstruct and turn over to the local authorities. This is an enormously \ncomplex restoration project managing the water flow over and through \n18,000 square miles of subtropical uplands, wetlands and coral reefs. \nThe area covered by this project spans from Lake Okeechobee to Key \nWest; from Fort Myers on the gulf to Fort Pierce on the Atlantic.\n  This is not an investment we can afford to abandon, Mr. President. \nThe investment is too great and the stakes are too high. I would urge \nmy colleagues to defeat the amendment.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                             Governor of the State of Florida,\n\n                                               September 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: Florida awaits with much anticipation \n     Congress' authorization of the plan to restore America's \n     Everglades. Our optimism is derived in large measure from the \n     demonstrated leadership in the Senate, particularly your \n     efforts and those of Senator Smith and Senator Trent Lott and \n     his leadership team. We are also hopeful that, with time \n     running out, the White House will hold together the \n     bipartisan nature of this effort by encouraging minority \n     members to keep focused on the historic nature of the \n     opportunity before them.\n       Clearly, with just a few legislative days remaining, a key \n     to success will be limiting efforts to revisit some of the \n     fundamental agreements that have now carried us so far. Among \n     these agreements is the unprecedented equal cost sharing \n     arrangement between the federal government and our state.\n       This true and equal partnership creates all of the right \n     incentives for making wise, cost-effective decisions as the \n     project proceeds through construction, operation and \n     maintenance. An equal and shared interest between the state \n     and federal governments ensures that cost control remains a \n     shared goal, and that design and construction decisions are \n     made based on what will provide the greatest long-term \n     efficiencies. No party will benefit from attempting to shift \n     costs forwards or backward for short-term advantage. \n     Everybody, most importantly the taxpayers, wins if there is \n     mutual benefit in controlling overall costs for the life of \n     the project.\n       The current 50-50 cost sharing formula for construction, \n     operation and maintenance of the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan is far superior to the conventional funding \n     formulas used for more typical Water Resources Development \n     Act projects. Florida, by paying half of the project \n     construction costs, will save the federal treasury nearly $2 \n     billion. This up front savings to the federal government is \n     equivalent to more than 20 years of the projected operation \n     and maintenance costs.\n       Beyond the sound fiscal arguments for an equal partnership, \n     there are also important practical and management benefits.\n       All of the diverse interests that have rallied around the \n     bill that is now before the Congress recognize the delicate \n     political balance that has been struck regarding the \n     management and allocation of water resources in the South \n     Florida ecosystem after the construction project is complete. \n     Clearly the maintenance of this balance is best protected if \n     there are equal commitments from the state and the federal \n     government for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the \n     project.\n       I respectfully urge you to remain alert to the importance \n     of this full and equal partnership between the state and \n     federal governments. Not only is this partnership formula \n     fiscally and politically prudent, it is also critical to \n     maintaining the diverse and broad-based support that the bill \n     before you has earned. Please let me know if you believe that \n     this agreement is ever in jeopardy in the critical days ahead \n     as this Congress prepares to make environmental history.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jeb Bush.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I was much taken by my colleague's comment that this is a matter \nbetween the Federal Government and the State. Indeed, it is a marriage \nthat every Governor would dream about, and the wedding presents being \ngiven are astronomical. Look at the whole project. It is dotted with \nwastewater projects to clean up the water that comes from the \ncommunities before it goes to these estuaries. I can understand that. I \ncan understand that, I say to my other colleague from Florida. But how \ndoes that differ from the Chesapeake Bay which has been struggling over \na 10-year period to clean up the wastewater from their surrounding \ncommunities which goes into the Chesapeake Bay and which affects the \nstriped bass, crabs, and everything else? Who pays for that? The local \ncommunities do.\n  The wastewater comes from the various adjacent communities, and why \nshouldn't this cleanup project be paid for by the local communities \nrather than this massive public project?\n  I have looked at towns all over Virginia that are struggling to meet \nthe wastewater requirements and paying their local taxes to clean it up \nbefore it is distributed into the streams and rivers and lakes in my \nState. I say there is no difference between my streams and my lakes in \nthe Chesapeake Bay and the magnificence of the Florida Everglades. Yet \nthe Senator is asking the Federal taxpayer to pay for it and changing a \nlaw which has served this Nation for some 14 years.\n  That is why you do not have the 35-percent construction cost formula \nbut 50 percent, because of the many projects which are not related to \nthe magnificence of the flora, fauna, birds, alligators, snakes, and so \nforth, which indeed are very important. They are very important and \nessential to these projects.\n  Fine, clean up the water, but do it like every other municipality. \nHave the States pay for it with the local taxes before it is \ndistributed back into the various components of the Florida Everglades.\n  If there are any Senators who wish to reply during the course of the \ndebate, I would be glad to yield.\n  There is an abundance of wedding presents coming with this marriage, \nI say to my good friend from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I repeat what I said before. The purpose \nof these water reuse facilities, as I indicated earlier, and the nature \nof these reuse facilities is one of the areas on which we are going to \nbe doing some preliminary experimentation and demonstration before \ncommitting to what the ultimate formula will be.\n  The purpose of these is to take water which has been polluted in \nlarge part because of the Federal projects that have been in place \nsince it was authorized in 1948 and to clean that water to a point that \nit will no longer serve to damage the important Federal investment.\n  As an example, in the middle of the Everglades there will be a \nvariety of what are called stormwater treatment areas constructed. \nThese are not mechanical, but biological methods of cleaning the water \nthat comes off the middle part of the Everglades so that when it gets \ndown into the area of Everglades National Park, it will meet the \nstandards that will avoid the water-causing adverse effects in the \npark.\n  At the present time, the injection of inappropriate water quality \ninto Everglades National Park has contributed substantially to a \ndramatic fall in the natural wildlife, fisheries, and fauna of \nEverglades National Park, and it has contributed to the development of \nextensive exotic, nonnatural plants in the area.\n  The purpose of these water reuse and treatment areas--most of which \nare not the kind of sewage treatment plants we think about with \nconcrete in place where water comes and is mechanically treated and \nthen discharged--is to deal with natural water flow systems--not from \nmunicipal areas; they are largely going to be biological and not \nmechanical. And the purpose of all of this is to achieve a level of \nwater quality, the principal beneficiary of which will be these Federal \nlandowners.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, I accept\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\nwhat he is saying. It is just a question of who is going to pay for it.\n  Take, for example, the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay, which begins \nway up in Delaware, reaches Baltimore, MD, reaches Washington, DC, and \nreaches Norfolk, VA. All of the water runoff from those municipalities \nthe local people accept the cost of because it goes into the Chesapeake \nBay, which is, as any number of projects, a Federal investment. The \nFederal taxpayer has put money into cleaning up the Bay.\n  What is the distinction between the water runoff from municipalities \ninto the local streams or the Chesapeake Bay, which is just as \nimportant to the people of those communities as are the everglades to \nthe people of Florida?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The source of pollution is largely from a previously \nauthorized Federal project; two, the nature of the cleanup in Florida \nis not of the type that surrounds the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend, the time is under \nthe control of the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from New \nHampshire. At the present time, the Senator from Virginia has the time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you. I wish to share the time. I will accept the \ntime of my questioning to be charged to the time of the Senator from \nVirginia, and, of course, the reply would be charged to the chairman's \ntime.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I make my point, Mr. President. I see no distinction. \nWater is water. Cleanup is cleanup. The question is, Who is going to \npay for it? The question is, Who will pay for it?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire has time and the Senator from Virginia \nhas time.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the Senator from Ohio desires, but \nour colleague from Florida also seeks recognition.\n  Mr. MACK. I wanted to respond to the question.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida wishes to respond \nto a point I made. I suggest to the Chair we recognize our colleague \nfrom Florida. Of course, his time is under the control of the chairman \nof the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield such time as the Senator from \nFlorida may consume to respond to the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. MACK. This will be a brief response. I apologize to my colleagues \nfor trying to hop in here, but the Senator raised a question I thought \nshould be responded to: What makes us different?\n  In the State of Florida, in 1994, we passed the Everglades Forever \nAct which provides for local payment of water cleanup costs. The \nFederal Government's share in the cost of cleaning up the water that \ndirectly benefits Federal areas such as the Everglades National Park--\nthe fact is that the local communities are paying for the cleanup of \nthe waters that the Senator has suggested.\n  The second point I make, I think there is something unique about what \nwe have come up with. The Senator says the uniqueness is the 50-50 cost \nsharing. The uniqueness that I see--and I don't think there is a Member \nwho has traveled to the State of Florida and become involved and \nknowledgeable about the Everglades Project, who is not amazed by the \npartnerships that have been developed--is the various interests in our \nState that have come together and who have said not only do they \nsupport but they are willing to put money into it.\n  As the Senator knows, the State of Florida, during this past \nlegislative session, in fact, put up I believe almost $200 million \ntowards this project.\n  Again, to answer the question directly, the cities are, in fact, \npaying. The State of Florida anticipated that question in 1994 and \npassed the act that I referred to a few moments ago.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. WARNER. I want to reply to my colleague.\n  We love our States equally. I say to the Senator, the Chesapeake Bay \nis just as dear to our people as are the Everglades to Floridians. The \nChesapeake Bay is a national asset--maybe not of the proportions but \ncertainly of equal significance to the Everglades. All of this has been \ndone through the years at a minute fraction of the cost to clean up the \nbay. Striped bass and crabs are returning and are beginning to live and \nprosper. We are making some progress. Again, there has been a clear \ncost sharing by the local communities, which I do not find in this \nbill.\n  My question to the Senator is, Why did the Congress of the United \nStates in 1996, just 4 years ago almost to the day, October 12, pass a \nlaw saying ``operation and maintenance expenses of projects carried out \nunder this section shall be a non-Federal responsibility''?\n  That was 1996, 4 years ago. Why is this now being changed?\n  Mr. MACK. I believe, if I can respond, and perhaps I can find the \nlanguage, if you read further on in the act, you will find some \nlanguage that has to do with some cost sharing of the area that the \nSenator is referring to as identifying certain aspects of the bill, but \nthere are other references in there about following precedent with \nrespect to cost sharing. There is, as I read in my statement, a whole \nseries of things in which there is even 100-percent participation at \nthe Federal level for operation and maintenance.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I will pass this document to my good friend and we should \naddress that together before the vote.\n  My amendment simply says, leave in place the 1986 and the 1996 laws. \nThat is all.\n  I yield time to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I make it clear I am a supporter of this Florida \nrestoration plan.\n  Second, I point out there is this representation that we have all of \nthese Federal resources in Florida that are going to benefit from this \nbill. And the answer to that, yes, they are. On the other hand, as a \nformer Governor of Ohio, the Everglades are not only a tremendous \nresource for the United States, but they are also a tremendous resource \nfor the State of Florida because they bring tremendous numbers of \npeople to Florida from which the State benefits. We don't talk about \nthat, but that is the other side of the coin.\n  Senator Graham from Florida mentioned page 118 of the restoration \nprojects. I point out that none of the restoration projects mentioned \ninclude municipal water supply. This proposal benefits the municipal \nwater supply to the extent of 20 percent of the overall cost of the \nproject.\n  In my State, the municipal water supply is paid for 100 percent by \nthe people in the community. If we look at the numbers on this project \nand subtract the benefit to the State of Florida for the cost of paying \nfor this public water supply that they would have to pay for entirely \nthemselves, they are benefiting to the tune of $1.6 billion. If we take \nthe $1.6 billion the State of Florida is benefiting from, the $3.9 non-\nFederal share they are putting into it, it works out to be $2.3 billion \nas what they are really paying out because they are saving on the $1.6 \nbillion that they would have to spend on the public water supply.\n  Looking at those numbers, the relationship is basically 35 percent, \nthe State of Florida; 65 percent, the Federal Government. I want the \nSenators to look at the numbers: 20 percent of this overall project is \nfor the public water supply. Fine. But the fact is that if this project \nwasn't being undertaken, that public water supply would have to be \nsupplied by the State of Florida or the communities within the State of \nFlorida.\n\n  This argument that it is a 50-50 cost sharing on the construction \ncosts does not state the facts. It is more like 35-65. Therefore, to \nsay we are paying 50 percent of the construction costs; therefore, it \nshould be 50-50 in operations, I don't think is a proper argument on \ntheir part.\n  In addition, I conclude with reference to the equity to the rest of \nthe projects throughout the United States of America. In 1986 we \ndecided O would be taken care of by the restoration project \nbeneficiaries. I point out to the other Senator from Florida that as to \nthe St. Luci project and many others mentioned, the Federal Government \nis picking up 100 percent of the cost that took place before 1986. \nPerhaps maybe one of the reasons why the Federal\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\nGovernment decided not to pay 100 percent is because a lot of people \nthought that was not fair.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I respond to the question raised by the \nSenator from Virginia when we were talking about cost share. I \nsuggested to Senator Warner, if he looked in other places in Public Law \n104, which is referred to as the Water Resources Development Act of \n1996, he would find other language different from the language to which \nhe was referring. That is found in section 316, central and southern \nFlorida Canal, 111. Under ``Operation and Maintenance,'' it says:\n\n       The non-Federal share of operation and maintenance cost of \n     the improvements undertaken pursuant to this section shall be \n     100 percent;\n\n  However, if you go on, it says:\n\n       . . . except that the Federal Government shall reimburse \n     the non-Federal interest with respect to the project 60 \n     percent of the cost of operating and maintaining pump \n     stations that pump water into Taylor Slough and in the \n     Everglades National Park.\n\n  I wonder what the argument was 14 years ago about changing precedent. \nPeople want to refer to precedent. The reality is that Congress does \nwhat the Congress believes is necessary to carry out an important \nproject. I think it is pretty clear. In fact, my colleagues who oppose \nthis cost share have indicated they are going to support the \nresolution, or support the act; therefore, I think, accepting the \nnotion of the significance and importance of what we are doing. And \ntherefore it is reasonable for the Senate to determine on this \nparticular project because of its unusual, unique circumstances, that \nsomehow we should, in fact, have a 50-50 cost share.\n  I do not find that stunning, and I am not impressed with the fact \nthat for the last 14 years which some want to refer to that there has \nbeen a precedent established. There are all kinds of indications that \nwe have had different cost shares, to the extent that we find in some \nareas the Federal Government is picking up 100 percent of the cost of \noperation and maintenance.\n  I again say to my colleagues, I hope they will support Senator Graham \nand I and Senators Smith and Baucus and defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we all want to protect the Everglades. I \ndon't think there is a Senator here who does not want to substantially \nprotect and restore the Everglades.\n  How do we do it? What is the most fair, most equitable way to restore \nthe Everglades? I think it is important to remember we cannot let \nperfection be the enemy of the good. There is no perfect solution. But \nthere are good solutions. The committee has crafted a good solution.\n  It is true, as the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Ohio \nare pointing out, we are breaking precedent. It is true. The provisions \nof the bill do provide for Uncle Sam to pay 50 percent of the operation \nand maintenance cost of this very large and very important project. \nThat is true. I share many of the concerns of the Senators, the \npotential slippery slope; what is this going to lead to? Why are we \nbreaking precedent here? It is a 14-year precedent, I think. It has \nbeen some time. What is a Federal interest? Sometimes it is hard to \ndefine what a Federal interest is.\n  But just as there are more Federal dollars going in for operation and \nmaintenance, on the other side of the equation we are also breaking \nanother precedent; that is, the State is putting up more of the \nconstruction costs. Ordinarily the State would have to put up about 35 \npercent of the construction costs. It is a big project, about $8 \nbillion. Florida has decided to put up the full 50 percent. So they are \npaying more than they ordinarily would. The U.S. Government will be \npaying more than it ordinarily would in operation and maintenance \ncosts.\n  This arrangement may not be perfect. But we are dealing with an \nextraordinary, special situation, and that is the Everglades. All of us \nin America feel a part of the Everglades. Certainly, the Floridians \nfeel more closely attached to the Everglades, but I think the rest of \nus in this country have a feeling about it. It is part of America, a \nspecial part of America we want to protect and restore as best we can. \nSo I say we should stick with the approach the committee has come up \nwith after a lot of hard work, and a lot of give and take.\n  In addition, I might point out 50 percent of the benefits go to \nparks, Federal parks, Federal land. There are about 18,000 square miles \ninvolved in the Everglades restoration. About 9,000 square miles of \nthat is Federal lands; 9,000 is non-Federal lands. So it seems to me a \n50-50 operation and maintenance cost share--it is rough justice. It is \nabout right: 9,000 Federal, 9,000 non-Federal, 50-50; at a time when \nthe State of Florida also is putting up more than its usual share for \nconstruction.\n  So this has been a good debate. In future years, when we are faced \nwith similar questions, I know the Senator from Virginia and the \nSenator from Ohio are going to be front and center saying: Uh-oh, here \nwe go again. Remember that time in September 2000? And they will be \nmaking good points. But I believe one has to make a decision. The \ndecision is now before us to proceed with the bill and not adopt the \namendment offered by my good friend, recognizing they made good points, \nbut I do not agree those points are sufficiently valid to warrant \npassage of their amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a question on my time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. In those few moments when I am able to take a vacation, I \nlike to go to your State.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You go often and I appreciate it.\n  Mr. WARNER. I started there as a firefighter in 1943.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You did, and you told many stories about how proud you \nare of that.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I was a 15-year-old boy. But what are you going to tell \nthe people in Billings, Missoula, Livingston? There is lots of Federal \nland out there.\n  What percentage of your State is Federal land?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I tell you, we are very proud of it.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a high percentage.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will tell them this is a good precedent for Montana.\n  Mr. WARNER. You better go back and undo some of the things we have \ndone in the last 14 years and readjust the cost sharing.\n  I say to my friend, I don't understand it. The State of Florida has \nto pay 50 percent rather than 35 percent. I will tell you why. It is \nbecause you have so many collateral projects, wastewater and other \nthings. But if that was the problem, why didn't you stick in the \ncommittee to the 35 percent and leave the cost sharing as it was and \nnot change the law?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think the answer to that, if I might answer my friend, \nis, again, a sort of rough justice. The State of Florida wants to be a \npartner in this thing.\n  Mr. WARNER. We shifted from marriage to partner, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is not lopsided. There is a slight tilt in favor of \nthe State of Florida, and I mean it is slight. It is not really out of \nbounds. But the Everglades is really special. It is a national \ntreasure. I think we should help restore the Everglades.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. I wouldn't want to go back to Virginia \nand say to my community they are more special than they are.\n  But one of the interesting things, if I may add for a minute, where \nare the environmental organizations, the watchdogs who are the first to \ncome up? They are standing by in absolute silence as to the change of \nthis law which they helped us put in place in 1986, and again in 1996. \nIt is just silence across the land because of the romance and the \nmystique of this magnificent Everglades.\n  I say to those organizations: My little lakes, my little streams in \nVirginia are just as important. And the people of Virginia are paying \nto clean up the water going into those streams and lakes, rivers and \ndams, not the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield time to my friend from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Will the Senator from Montana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, on the Senator's time.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The cost sharing on municipal waters is 100 percent \nlocal. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That's correct, ordinarily.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I have many areas of my State that need to upgrade \ntheir water supply. They would love to have the Federal Government pick \nup the tab for part of it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct, as do all States.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. As mayor of Cleveland, we had to increase water rates \n300 percent in order to do the job we needed to do and we didn't get \nany money from the Federal Government. I think it is really important \nto recognize that 20 percent of this total cost is municipal water \nsupply. We are paying for the cost of the municipal water supply. They \nare avoiding some $1.6 billion of cost for this municipal water. That \nis an enormous contribution.\n  If you subtract out that $1.6 billion from Florida's share on it, it \nworks out to be about 35-65, so that the argument, 50-50, and therefore \nwe ought to do 50 percent of the operation and maintenance I do not \nthink is as relevant as it might be if it was really 50-50.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I respond to the Senator?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I heard what you are saying, but I think you heard the \nSenator from Florida, both Senators, very extensively explain how it is \nthe Corps project, the original Everglades project, which I think cost \nabout $3 billion in today's dollars to build, that caused a lot of the \npollution problems.\n  Here we are coming up with a restoration of the Everglades which \nincludes restoration of waters, municipal waters included, which \notherwise would be degraded because of the original Corps project or \nbecause of the costs and pollution problems associated with that \nproject.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. The point is, I am not referring to wastewater. I am \ntalking about public water supply which is very important to developing \nany State. You have people coming in, and you need a public water \nsupply. In order to provide it, you have to go to the local people, the \nratepayers, and say: Come up with the money. And the Federal Government \ndoes not participate.\n  In this project, we are saying to the State of Florida: If you have \nfuture municipal water needs, 20 percent of this project is for that. \nIt is an equivalent of $1.6 billion, and you are going to be saving \nthat cost in the future.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand that, but, again, the same principle applies \nto municipal water as I explained applies to wastewater.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. We do not agree on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time remains on \nour side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, during the course of the \ndebate on this amendment, I heard several statements made--I am sorry \nmy colleague from Virginia is not on the floor at the moment--about \nprecedent-breaking and about what the law says. We have heard all these \nrepresentations about the law.\n  I have the law in my hand, and I am going to read from it word for \nword. This is the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, which has \nbeen cited a number of times, that somehow we are breaking precedent, \nviolating law, or not maintaining the law with what we are doing in the \nEverglades.\n  Section 906(e). There are three criteria mentioned here in terms of \nconstruction, and then I will go to O:\n\n       (e) In those cases when the Secretary, as part of any \n     report to Congress, recommends activities to enhance fish and \n     wildlife resources, the first costs of such enhancement--\n\n  In this case construction--\n\n     shall be a Federal cost when--\n       (1) such enhancement provides benefits that are determined \n     to be national. . . .\n\n  Everybody in this Chamber today has called the Everglades a national \ntreasure, including those proponents of this amendment.\n\n       (2) such enhancement is designed to benefit species that \n     have been listed as threatened or endangered by the Secretary \n     of Interior. . . .\n\n  We have 68 endangered or threatened species in the Everglades.\n\n       (3) such activities are located on lands managed as a \n     national wildlife refuge.\n\n  We have 16 national wildlife refuges in the Everglades ecosystem.\n  Here is the line which is absolutely the opposite of what has been \nsaid on the Senate floor all afternoon on this amendment. Listen \ncarefully. This is the O portion:\n\n       When benefits of enhancement do not qualify under the \n     preceding sentence, 25 percent of such first costs of \n     enhancement shall be provided by non-Federal interests under \n     a schedule of reimbursement. . . . The non-Federal share of \n     operation, maintenance . . . of activities to enhance fish \n     and wildlife resources shall be 25 percent.\n\n  If the non-Federal portion is 25 percent, the Federal portion should \nbe 75 percent. All we are asking for in this legislation is a 50 \npercent Federal portion. We are not violating any law. We are \nabsolutely following, to Florida's detriment, if one wants to take that \nposition since they could do 75-25; we are doing 50-50.\n  It is very important my colleagues understand. No precedent is being \nbroken. No law is being ignored or violated. We are working within the \nlaw under this provision, up to 75 percent Federal share when those \nthree criteria of construction I just mentioned are met. We have met \nall three of those. We do not even have to meet them all. It is ``or.'' \nWe met all three. As a result of that, we can go up to 75 percent. We \nhave gone to 50 percent in the Federal share. There is a compelling \nreason to do this. It is fair, and it is within the law.\n  I will conclude with a few more points. If one looks at the so-called \nnormal WRDA legislation, 65 percent Federal--35 percent State on \nconstruction--we are doing 50-50 with the Everglades--that is a 15-\npercent reduction in the Federal cost. If we take that 15-percent \nreduction--Senator Mack referred to this already--that is about $1.2 \nbillion the Federal Government is saving on the construction portion.\n\n  The question is, If we take that $1.2 billion and offset it, how much \nO can we get out of that? Senator Mack thought it was around 20 \nyears. So there are 20 years of O just from the savings on that \nparticular part of the construction.\n  All my colleagues need to understand, this is a deal-breaking \namendment. This amendment would basically take down the entire \nEverglades proposal, in my view, and WRDA, because to go from the 50-50 \nposition, which has been delicately negotiated and has stayed within \nthe law and stayed within the precedent, contrary to what has been \nsaid, would be a deal breaker. That would be a tragedy, in my view, \nwith the greatest respect for the proponents because they feel strongly \nabout this. I do not want to be breaking precedent or violating law and \nwill not.\n  I want, first, my colleagues to know after this project is \nconstructed, it is the responsibility of the non-Federal interests to \noperate and maintain it. In the Everglades provision, 50-50 O do \nnot think that is out of the ordinary; it is within the law, as I said.\n  The Federal Government owns and manages about 50 percent of the lands \nthat will benefit from this restoration project. Fifty percent is \nfederally owned. For realizing 50 percent of the benefits, it is not \nunreasonable we should put up 50 percent of the costs. We could do 75 \nunder the law; we are doing 50. There are four national parks, as I \nindicated before, 16 national wildlife refuges, 1 national marine \nsanctuary, and 21 federally managed properties, or 5 million acres of \nfederally owned and managed lands all in the south Florida ecosystem.\n  I do not mean to imply that other projects are not important, but \nthis project has plenty of Federal interest.\n  The level of the investment being put forth by the State is \nunprecedented, and they put it up early, to their credit. They put \nmoney aside right from\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\nthe beginning. We asked Governor Bush and the legislature to do that. \nThey did it and did it quickly and willingly.\n  The Federal Government was responsible for damaging the Everglades, \nas has been pointed out. We did it. The Federal Government did it in \n1948. That is another aspect of this that needs to be considered. We \nmust look at what we did. We did the damage, not knowingly or not \nknowing how badly it was going to affect the Everglades, but we did it, \nand therefore we have an obligation to correct it. That should impact \nthat figure of 50-50.\n  Do we want to ensure our investment in the restoration effort is \npreserved for future generations? The answer is unequivocally yes.\n  Do we believe the restoration project is an equal partnership between \nthe Federal Government and the State of Florida? The answer is yes, \nabsolutely. Florida does, too.\n  Do we want to impose on Florida the burden for maintaining fresh \nflows of water in the quality and quantity needed by our Federal trust \nresources? I do not think so. Our properties are our responsibility, \nand we should maintain them. That is not unreasonable.\n  The Everglades provision in the managers' amendment is supported by \nthe administration, supported by the State of Florida, supported by two \nNative American tribes impacted by the restoration, and supported by \nindustry groups and environmentalists, and they do not want to risk \nfracturing that delicate coalition of support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Governor \nBush of Florida in opposition to this amendment and a letter from \nseveral environmental groups in opposition, and also a letter from \nDawson Associates, which represents a number of industries, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Governor of the State of Florida,\n\n                              Tallahassee, FL, September 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Chairman, Environment and Public Works Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Florida awaits with much anticipation \n     Congress' authorization of the plan to restore America's \n     Everglades. Our optimism is derived in large measure from the \n     demonstrated leadership in the Senate, particularly your \n     efforts and those of Senator Mack and Senator Trent Lott and \n     his leadership team. We are also hopeful that, with time \n     running out, the White House will hold together the \n     bipartisan nature of this effort by encouraging minority \n     members to keep focused on the historic nature of the \n     opportunity before them.\n       Clearly, with just a few legislative days remaining, a key \n     to success will be limiting efforts to revisit some of the \n     fundamental agreements that have now carried us so far. Among \n     these agreements is the unprecedented equal cost sharing \n     arrangement between the federal government and our state.\n       This true and equal partnership creates all of the right \n     incentive for making wise, cost-effective decisions as the \n     project proceeds through construction, operation and \n     maintenance. An equal and shared interest between the state \n     and federal governments ensures that cost control remains a \n     shared goal, and that design and construction decisions are \n     made based on what will provide the greatest long-term \n     efficiencies. No party will benefit from attempting to shift \n     costs forward or backward for short-term advantage. \n     Everybody, most importantly the taxpayers, wins if there is \n     mutual benefit in controlling overall costs for the life of \n     the project.\n       The current 50-50 cost sharing formula for construction, \n     operation and maintenance of the Comprehensive Everglades \n     Restoration Plan is far superior to the conventional funding \n     formulas used for more typical Water Resource Development Act \n     projects. Florida, by paying half of the project construction \n     costs, will save the federal treasury nearly $2 billion. This \n     up front savings to the federal government is equivalent to \n     more than 20 years of the projected operation and maintenance \n     costs.\n       Beyond the sound fiscal arguments for an equal partnership, \n     there are also important practical and management benefits. \n     All of the diverse interest that have rallied around the bill \n     that is now before the Congress recognize the delicate \n     political balance that has been a struck regarding the \n     management and allocation of water resources in the South \n     Florida ecosystem after the construction project is complete. \n     Clearly the maintenance of this balance is best protected if \n     there are equal commitments from the state and the federal \n     government for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the \n     project.\n       I respectfully urge you to remain alert to the importance \n     of this full and equal partnership between the state and \n     federal governments. Not only is this partnership formula \n     fiscally and politically prudent, it is also critical to \n     maintenance to maintaining the diverse and broad-based \n     support that the bill before you has earned. Please let me \n     know if you believe that this agreement is ever in jeopardy \n     in the critical days ahead as this Congress prepares to make \n     environmental history.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeb Bush.\n                                  ____\n\n         1000 Friends of Florida, Audubon of Florida, Center for \n           Marine Conservation, The Everglades Foundation, The \n           Everglades Trust, National Audubon Society, National \n           Parks Conservation Association, Natural Resource \n           Defense Council, Sierra Club, World Wildlife Fund,\n                                               September 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     Chairman, Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Environmental and Public Works \n         Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith and Senator Baucus: We are writing to \n     express our opposition to the Voinovich amendment to H.R. \n     2796, the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, that would \n     eliminate the state-federal operations and maintenance (O) \n     cost share for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan \n     (CERP).\n       S. 2796 presently provides a 50-50 cost share between the \n     State and Federal government. The Voinovich amendment would \n     make the State of Florida pay the entire cost. The Voinovich \n     amendment ignores the fact that this is no ordinary water \n     project because the taxpayer is a primary beneficiary of the \n     project.\n       Within the project area there is a unique and compelling \n     federal interest that justifies a 50-50 state/federal cost \n     share for operations and maintenance. The project area \n     includes four National Parks, 16 National Wildlife Refuges, \n     and one National Marine Sanctuary that comprise five million \n     acres of federally owned and managed lands--50% of the \n     remaining Everglades.\n       In addition, approval of the Voinovich amendment would \n     likely yield two results; both of which would severely \n     jeopardize the likelihood of enacting Everglades Restoration \n     legislation this year: First, the State could withdraw its \n     support for the bill leaving this a project without a non-\n     federal sponsor. Or, the State could seek new modifications \n     to reflect the diminished federal commitment to restoration \n     of America's Everglades, a move that would send the \n     Everglades back to the drawing board with no time left on the \n     clock.\n       Therefore, we respectfully request that you vote against \n     the Voinovich Everglades cost share amendment to S. 2796.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n       Nathaniel Reed, Chairman, 1000 Friends of Florida.\n       David Guggenheim, Vice President for Conservation Policy, \n     Center for Marine Conservation.\n       Tom Rumberger, Chairman, The Everglades Trust.\n       Mary Munson, Director, South Florida Programs, National \n     Parks Conservation Association.\n       Frank Jackalone, Senior Field Representative, Sierra Club.\n       Stuart Strahl, Ph.D., Executive Director, Audubon of \n     Florida.\n       Mary Barley, Chair, The Everglades Foundation.\n       Tom Adams, Director of Government Affairs, National Audubon \n     Society.\n       Bradford H.

Governor \n     Bush's Commission for the Everglades has taken the position \n     that if the Federal government is to be a full and equal \n     partner in restoration, it should share in all of the \n     associated costs. Furthermore, it is certain that the Florida \n     Legislature will not supply the level of funding needed to \n     construct this plan if they are going to have to pay the full \n     cost of operation over the life of the project.\n       The CERP is primarily a plan to restore and protect Federal \n     properties, and the development of the plan has been \n     dominated by the federal agencies, especially the Department \n     of Interior. The restoration of a unique ecological system of \n     world significance dramatically and fundamentally \n     distinguished the purposes of the Comprehensive Plan from \n     those of other Army Civil Works projects.\n       Furthermore, the Army Corps of Engineers indicated to \n     stakeholders throughout the planning process that it would \n     seek cost sharing for all modification over their life cycle. \n     This commitment eliminated the biases in project decision-\n     making that result when all costs are not treated in the same \n     way. Affirming this commitment in the authorization will \n     ensure that project design\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\n     decisions will continue to be based on cost-effectiveness \n     alone.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Robert K.

Mr. President, in conclusion, we have an \nopportunity to rectify a terrible mistake we made. We did it with good \nintentions. But we made a mistake. This is what we need to do. It is \nour responsibility now to do that. The Everglades provision in the \nmanagers' amendment is supported by these groups.\n  I urge my colleagues to preserve that Federal-State partnership in \nthe Everglades restoration, to preserve this 50-50 O, and to reject \nthis amendment because, again, I believe to pass this amendment would \nbreak the deal that we have already worked out so delicately among so \nmany groups, No. 1, and, No. 2, it would be unfair. It would not be \nconsistent with the law, WRDA 86, and it would not, in my view, be \nconsistent with the precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield such time as the Senator from Ohio may require. \nBut before doing so, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Warner \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to comment on the remarks \nof the chairman of my committee for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect. I would beg to differ in terms of the interpretation of what \nthis water restoration project comes under.\n  This is not a fish and wildlife enhancement under 906(e). This is an \nenvironmental restoration under section 103 of WRDA 1986, as amended, \nwhich basically calls for: 100 percent of the operation, maintenance, \nreplacement and rehabilitation costs for projects are to be paid by the \nlocal participant in the project.\n  Last, but not least--and, again, with all due respect to my \nchairman--as a former Governor of Ohio, I can tell you that if this \namendment is adopted, the Governor of Florida is not going to walk away \nfrom this wonderful legislation that is going to help restore the \nEverglades and commit the Federal Government to--based on our hearing \nthis week--half of some $14 billion.\n\n  If anyone is going to vote against this amendment because they think \nit is a deal breaker, in my opinion, it is not a deal breaker. This \nbill will pass. If this amendment is adopted, the bill is still going \nto pass, and we will move on with this project.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to accommodate the distinguished \nchairman of our committee to facilitate the vote, which would also \naccommodate a number of our colleagues.\n  We have had a very good debate. The issue before the Senate is very \nsuccinct and simple. We have had a body of law for 14 years. That law, \nwith reference to this specific project, was reviewed in 1996. And \nexplicitly, the Congress, after reviewing it, stated the following: \n``The operation and maintenance of projects carried out under this \nsection''--and that section dealt with the Florida Everglades--``shall \nbe a non-Federal responsibility.'' So we are now about to vitiate 14 \nyears of law.\n  I say to my colleagues, you will have to go back and explain to your \nconstituents how all the projects in that 14-year period are now \noperation and maintenance being funded by the States, and that the \nbudget for the projects prior to 1986 is underfunded by $440 million in \nthis one fiscal year.\n  So I think it is a very bad precedent for this Congress to vitiate 14 \nyears of law, and particularly when it was reviewed specifically with \nregard to this project just 4 years ago and explicitly written into law \nthat the operation and maintenance would be entirely the responsibility \nof the State of Florida.\n  I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I am prepared to yield that back, but \nSenator Levin has asked for time to make a comment.\n  I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand that there is a managers' package of \namendments which have been cleared, and that one of those amendments \nwas that of my colleague from Michigan, Senator Abraham.\n  I had some concerns about that, which I have not had a chance yet to \nshare with Senator Abraham. I think I will be able to work this out \nwith him, but I have not yet had the opportunity.\n  I understand now that amendment would be withheld from the managers' \npackage until we can get back with the managers about that subject.\n  So if there is a managers' package that is offered tonight, it would \nnot include that amendment?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. The Senator is correct. We are going to \ntry to offer a managers' package tonight. It will not include that \namendment, to give the two Senators from Michigan the opportunity to \nwork that out.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for that. I will be in touch with \nSenator Abraham in the hopes and belief, too, we will be able to work \nsomething out on it.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I now yield back all time \non my side on the pending amendment.\n  Before the vote begins, I announce, on behalf of the majority leader, \nthat following this vote on this amendment, there will be no further \nvotes this evening.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final passage vote \nfor WRDA occur at 4:50 p.m. on Monday, and that paragraph 4 of rule XII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to Warner amendment No. 4165. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Idaho (Mr. Crapo) is \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. REID.

My amendment is needed to allow the Army Corps \nof Engineers to continue to work on a feasibility study to alleviate \nthe chronic flooding in the Southwest Valley of Albuquerque, New \nMexico.\n  First, I want to thank the committee chairman, Senator Smith, the \ndistinguished ranking member, Senator Baucus, and Chairman Voinovich, \nas well as their fine staffs for all their good work on WRDA2000 (S. \n2796).\n  For a number of years the Southwest Valley area of Albuquerque in my \nstate has been prone to flooding after major rainstorms. The flooding \nhas caused damage to irrigation and drainage structures, erosion of \nroadways, pavement, telephone and electrical transmission conduits, \ncontaminated water and soil due to overflowing septic tanks, damaged \nhomes, businesses, and farms, and presented hazards to automobile \ntraffic. In 1997, Bernalillo County approached the Army Corps of \nEngineers to request a reconnaissance study of the chronic flooding \nproblems.\n  The study area encompassed 17.8 square miles of mostly residential \nneighborhoods along the banks of the Rio Grande in the Southwest Valley \nand the 50 square miles on the West Mesa, including the Isleta Pueblo, \nthat drain into the valley. The reconnaissance study began in March \n1998 and is now completed.\n  The conclusions of the reconnaissance study define the magnitude of \nthe continuing flooding problem in the Southwest Valley. The study also \nestablished a clear federal interest in the drainage project, found a \npositive cost to benefit ratio for the project, and identified work \nitems necessary to begin designing a range of solutions to alleviate \nthe chronic flooding problems in the valley.\n  In 1999, based on the positive findings of the reconnaissance study, \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee authorized the Army Corps of \nEngineers to conduct a full study to determine the feasibility of a \nproject for flood damage reduction in Albuquerque's Southwest Valley. \nThe authorization is contained in section 433 of the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 1999 (P.L. 106-53). I want to thank the EPW \ncommittee for authorizing this much needed feasibility study. The study \nbegan in March 1999 and is expected to be completed in February 2002.\n  Currently, Bernalillo County, the Albuquerque Metropolitan Arroyo \nFlood Control Authority and the Corps are working cooperatively on the \nfeasibility study. Last year, the administration requested, and the \nCongress appropriated, $250,000 in Federal funding for the feasibility \nstudy. This year, the request was for $330,000. I want to thank the \nAppropriations Committees in the House and Senate for again providing \nthe full amount requested.\n  Last July I had an opportunity to meet with the engineers from the \nCorps, the County, and AMAFCA to get an update on the study and to tour \nthe areas in the Southwest Valley that are subject to chronic flooding. \nAt the end of the tour, the Corps indicated to me that based on the \ninitial results of the feasibility study, the flooding there was quite \nsevere but the project did not seem to meet the Corps' required flow \ncriterion of 1800 cubic feet per second for the 100-year flood. These \nflow criteria are outlined in the Engineering Regulations established \nfor the Corps. Because of the obvious severity of the flooding, the \nengineers requested a legislative waiver of the regulations. Without a \nwaiver, the Corps could not continue as a partner in the project. They \nalso indicated the Corps' regulations do not contain any provision to \nwaive the peak discharge criterion.\n  I'd like to take a few moments to describe briefly the unique \nsituation in the Southwest Valley that necessitates a waiver of the \nCorps' standard regulations. The land along the west side of the Rio \nGrande is essentially flat. The river is contained by large earthen \nlevees, which were built for flood control. When a river is contained \nthis way by levees, the sediment accumulates in the river bed, slowly \nraising the level of the river. Of course, if there were no levees, \nwhen sediment builds up, the river would simply change course to a \nlower level. However, over the years, as the sediment has continued to \naccumulate in the Rio Grande, the level of the river within the levees \nis now higher than the surrounding land. Thus, when there are heavy \nrains during the monsoon season, the runoff has nowhere to go--it \nsimply flows into large pools on the valley floor, flooding homes and \nfarms. The water can't flow uphill into the river, so it stays there \nuntil it either evaporates or is pumped up and hauled away.\n  If the flood water sits in large pools and isn't flowing, it clearly \ncan't meet any criterion based on the flow rate of water. Indeed, given \nthe unique nature of the flooding in the Southwest Valley, most areas \nsubject to chronic flood damage do not meet the Corps' peak discharge \ncriterion.\n  During my visit in July, the three partners in the feasibility study \nspecifically asked me for help in obtaining a waiver of the Corps' \ntechnical requirements to deal with this special situation. My \namendment provides the necessary waiver the Corps needs to continue to \nwork in partnership with the county and AMAFCA on this project.\n  This is not a new authorization; Congress authorized this study last \nyear. My amendment is a simple technical fix to the existing \nauthorization. I do believe the unique situation in Bernalillo County \nwarrants a waiver of the Corps' standard regulations, and I thank the \ncommittee for accepting my amendment.\n\n\n                     Savings Clause Report Language\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as part of the manager's amendment we \namend section (h)(3)(B) of the bill as reported that explains what the \nprogrammatic regulations should contain. What impact does amending this \nsection have on the report language that accompanies this section.\n  Mr. SMITH. I am very glad that you asked that question. First let me \nexplain what subsection (h)(3) does. Subsection (h)(3) requires the \nissuance of programmatic regulations to ensure that the goals and \npurposes of the Plan are achieved by guiding the implementation of the \nproject implementation reports.\n  Confusion was raised due to the wording that we used in the bill as \nreported. In order to clarify section (h)(3)(B)(i), we deleted the \nwords ``provide guidance.'' Despite the change in the manager's \namendment, the report language for this section is still relevant, and \nreflects the committee's interpretation of this section. It is still \nthe committee's intent that in developing the programmatic regulations, \nthe Federal and State partners should establish interim goals-expressed \nin terms of restoration standards-to provide a means by which the \nrestoration success of the plan may be evaluated through the \nimplementation process. The restoration standards should be \nquantitative and measurable at specific points in the plan \nimplementation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. thank you for the clarification.\n\n\n               Florida Consumptive Use Permitting Process\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In the manager's amendment we modified the agreement \nsection of the bill. Am I correct that the purpose of this section is \nto require the State of Florida and the President of the United States \nto enter into a binding agreement requiring Florida to manage its \nconsumptive use permitting process in such a manner that the State will \nbe able to deliver the water made available by the plan for the natural \nsystem to ensure restoration.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. That is correct. Furthermore, the plan \nshould include an agreemen that the State will not pre-allocate any \nwater generated by the plan for consumptive use or otherwise make this \nwater unavailable by the State. This agreement is extremely is \nextremely important, as are the programmatic regulations,\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\nin ensuring that the needs of the natural system are met.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you for the clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 4166 through 4173, en bloc) were agreed to.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                  breakenridge flood reduction project\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, in a brief \ncolloquy on an extremely important flood reduction project. As the \nChairman may recall, I have been a strong proponent of the ongoing \nBreckenridge flood reduction project in Breckenridge, Minnesota. I am \npleased that the Chairman has agreed that this existing flood control \nproject should continue to proceed expeditiously. As a result of the \n1997 floods, the city of Breckenridge experienced over $30 million in \nflood related damages. That flood cost the Federal Government millions \nof dollars in expenditures for advanced measures for flood fighting, \nflood emergency actions during the flood, and post-flood cleanup and \nrecovery efforts at Breckenridge.\n  After the 1997 flood, the city has taken numerous actions to protect \nthemselves from future catastrophic flooding. Such actions include the \nacquisition of many flood prone properties; local design and \nconstruction of new local flood levees at selected areas; initiation of \na partnership between the Corps of Engineers, the city, and the State \nof Minnesota for a cost-shared Section 205 Feasibility Study to define \nan implementable Federal flood reduction project.\n  The city of Wahpeton, North Dakota is located immediately across the \nRed and Bois de Sioux Rivers from Breckenridge and is therefore \nstrongly inter-related from a hydraulic and social perspective. \nWahpeton has also entered into a separate cost-shared Section 205 flood \nreduction study for protecting their city. The flood protection plans \nnow formulated for Wahpeton and Breckenridge are interdependent with \neach project relying on flood control features to be implemented by \ntheir sister city. If Wahpeton moves forward before Breckenridge, then \nBreckenridge could experience even more flooding. The two projects \nshould proceed together. Therefore, in order for either project to move \nforward through completion these separate Federal flood reduction \nprojects must both be constructed expeditiously. The timing associated \nwith construction of each project will affect the implementation \noptions and costs for each project.\n  I would like to continue to work with the Chairman as this bill goes \nto conference in providing further assurances that this existing flood \ncontrol project be constructed as quickly as possible so that the city \nof Breckenridge can be protected from future flooding.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to echo the words of my \ncolleague from Minnesota and thank my colleagues, the Chairman and \nranking members of the Environment and Public Works Committee for their \nattention to the needs of the residents of Breckenridge, Minnesota and \nthis much needed flood control project. We have come a long way since \nthe floods of 1997, when I visited the community to witness first hand \nthe devastation. Since then the city of Breckenridge has been working \nclosely with the Army Corps of Engineers and the Minnesota Department \nof Natural Resources to design a comprehensive flood control plan to \nprotect the community from future losses. I am pleased that the Senate \nWRDA bill will include authorization for this much needed flood control \nproject.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to be able to \naccommodate the Senators' request and provide $21 million in authorized \nlanguage for this existing and ongoing flood reduction project. I know \nhow important this project is to the citizens of Breckenridge, \nMinnesota, and hope the construction can begin expeditiously.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his assistance.\n\n\n                   Adaptive Assessment and monitoring\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak today about the Adaptive \nAssessment and Monitoring section of this legislation with my \ncolleagues from Florida and New Hampshire. This is one of the most \ncritical aspects of this legislation which builds in a feedback loop \nfor the Army Corps and the South Florida Water Management District and \nultimately, the Congress, to incorporate new information into Plan \nauthorization, design and execution. I would encourage the Corps, under \nthe authority and appropriations provided for the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan [CERP], to coordinate with appropriately \nqualified outside institutions, both nationally and internationally, to \nconduct independent scientific assessments and monitoring as part of \nthe Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program. I also believe that one \nof the most important elements of Everglades restoration will be \ntechnology transfer to other ecosystems. I recommend that the Corps \ncontinue its partnerships with appropriately qualified outside \ninstitutions, both nationally and internationally, to distribute \nlessons-learned from this experience.\n  Mr. MACK. I echo the sentiments of the Senator from Florida about the \nAdaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program. As this is a long-term plan \nspanning almost 25 years in execution, it stands to reason that \nresearch will yield new information and technology changes will yield \nnew solutions. The Adaptive Assessment and Monitoring Program is \ncritical to ensuring that this new information is incorporated into our \nplanning process for this project. The type of collaboration described \nby my colleague from Florida will ensure that resources are wisely \nspent by utilizing and expanding monitoring programs already in \noperation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank my colleagues from Florida for \nbringing these issues to my attention, and I agree with my colleagues \nthat the Corps of Engineers should take advantage of the expertise of \nappropriately qualified outside institutions, both nationally and \ninternationally, in the Adaptive Monitoring and Assessment Program \nauthorized under this legislation.\n\n\n                    Indian Trust Doctrine Provision\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Section (h)(2)(C) of Title VI of S. 2796 states, ``in \ncarrying out his responsibilities under this subsection with respect to \nthe restoration of the South Florida ecosystem, the Secretary of the \nInterior shall fulfill his obligations to the Indian trust tribes in \nSouth Florida under the Indian Trust Doctrine as well as other \napplicable legal obligations.'' Is the intent of this provision to \nensure that the Secretary of the Interior give full and equal \nconsideration to all his legal responsibilities?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct. The intent of this provision is to \nensure that the Secretary of the Interior, in carrying out his \nresponsibilities as authorized by this Act, shall fully and equally \nconsider all of his legal responsibilities including, but not limited \nto the Indian Trust Doctrine, Everglades National Park, Biscayne \nNational Park, Big Cypress National Preserve, the National Park System, \nthe National Wildlife Refuge System, Migratory Bird Treaty, and the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n             Clarification of intent of the Savings Clause\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Chairman of the \nSenate Environment and Public Works Committee to clarify the intent of \nthe Savings Clause provision included in subsection (h)(5) section of \n601 of S. 27976, as modified by the manager's amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH. I would be happy to clarify.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It is my understanding that the Savings Clause was \nintended to provide that until a new source of water supply of \ncomparable quantity and quality is available to replace any water \nsupply to be lost as a result of implementation of the Plan, the \nSecretary of the Army and the non-federal sponsor shall not eliminate \nor transfer existing legal sources of water.\n  Mr. SMITH. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Am I correct in saying with respect to flood control, the \nSavings Clause was intended to ensure that implementation of the Plan \nwill\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\nnot result in significant adverse impact to any person with an \nexisting, legally recognized right to a level of protection against \nflooding, including flood protection for the natural system?\n  Mr. SMITH. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Furthermore, I understand that the Savings Clause \nprovision was not intended to allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nredirect to the natural system water from the human environment of \nunsuitable quality or quantity in an effort to provide the flood \nprotection guaranteed in the section?\n  Mr. SMITH. Yes, that is my understanding of the intent of the Savings \nClause as well.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator for his assistance in clarifying the \nintent of this provision.\n\n\n                             waterbury dam\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senators Baucus and Smith, for their hard work on the Water \nResources Development Act of 2000. I am especially grateful for their \ninclusion of a provision in this bill that will ultimately expand the \nsuccessful federal, state, and local partnerships restoring the highest \nwater quality in the Lake Champlain watershed.\n  One project that we could not come to full agreement on before this \nbill's passage, however, was authorization for the repair of the \nWaterbury Dam. Our lack of final language was in a large part due to \nthe absence of a final Dam Safety Assurance Program Evaluation Report \nfrom the Army Corps of Engineers, a final draft of which was sent to \nACE Headquarters for review on August 24, 2000.\n  The Waterbury Dam was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1935 \nand holds 1.23 billion cubic feet of water in its reservoir. Were the \ndam to fail, this volume of water would ultimately submerge and destroy \nthe entire corridor of cities and towns downstream in the Winooski \nRiver valley. Thousands of lives would be lost. Hundreds of thousands \nof acres would be completely devastated.\n  Unfortunately, increasingly serious cracks and seepage in Waterbury \nDam's structure were recently discovered and have heightened concerns \nthat the dam could, in fact, fail. The State of Vermont and the Army \nCorps went into action and drew down the water level to alleviate \npressure on the dam. The Corps carried out an assessment this summer to \nfurther characterize immediate repair needs. There is strong evidence \nthat these cracks are, in fact, the result of initial design flaws and \nthe Corps work today follows two previous instances--one in 1956-8 and \none in 1985--when the Army Corps of Engineers had full authority to \nmake needed dam modifications.\n  I understand that the Army Corps of Engineers is expediting the \nreview of the Dam Safety Assurance Report for the Waterbury Dam. I am \ngrateful to Senators Smith and Baucus for their understanding that the \nfinal report may contain important information relevant for \nauthorization of the project.\n  I look forward to working with my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nSmith and Baucus, once the report is finalized and is able to guide our \nplans for Waterbury Dam repair.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I realize that Waterbury Dam repair is a \npressing need for the state of Vermont and will carefully analyze the \nfinal report when it is released from the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I join Chairman Smith in recognizing the need for repairs \nto Waterbury Dam in Vermont.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, there is an issue that needs to be \naddressed in WRDA that is not addressed by this bill. On June 12, 2000, \nthe Administration sent us a report on the management of the Corps of \nEngineers' hopper dredge fleet. It says that efforts initiated by \nCongress in WRDA 96 have been successful. That legislation moved more \nof the routine maintenance dredging to the private sector and increased \nthe Corps emergency response capability. In their report, the Corps \nrecommended a plan that would move a little more work to the private \nsector while rehabilitating the oldest federal hopper dredge for \nemergency response purposes. While it may be questionable whether or \nnot the benefit of this federal investment is worth the cost, I am \nwilling to implement the Corps recommendations in order to get the \nmanagement and emergency response improvements that are described in \nthe report to Congress. After receiving the report, I requested \nlegislative language from the Corps that they provided to me. I have \nbeen attempting to work with interested members to get this language, \nor possibly other compromise language, adopted in this legislation. I \ndo not understand why the Corps recommendation is not considered a \nvictory by the supporters of this federal dredge. The Corps strongly \nbelieves that their recommendation is a win-win for the nation's ports \nand the ports along the Delaware River as well as the nation's \ntaxpayers. While I am not offering an amendment here today, I want my \ncolleagues to know that this is an issue that I am going to pursue. I \nhope that we will be able to work something out in the conference \ncommittee. Thank you very much. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this important national issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, there is a clear need for Independent \nReview of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. During debate on this bill \nI was prepared to offer an amendment on Independent Review. It was \ndrawn from similar provisions in a larger piece of Corps Reform \nlegislation sponsored by my Wisconsin colleague in the other body (Mr. \nKind). My interest in an Independent Review amendment was shared by the \nMinority Leader (Mr. Daschle) and the Senator from California (Mrs. \nBoxer) and a number of taxpayer and environmental organizations. \nincluding: the League of Conservation Voters, American Rivers, Coast \nAlliance, Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund, Izaak Walton League of \nAmerica, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club and Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense.\n  I believe that the Senate should act right now to require Independent \nReview in this Water Resources Development Act, but the Senate is \napparently not ready to take that step. Nevertheless, in response to my \ninitiative, the bill's managers (Senator Smith and Senator Baucus) have \nadopted an amendment as part of their Manager's Package which should \nhelp get the Authorizing Committee, the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, the additional information it needs to develop and refine \nlegislation on this issue through a one year study by the National \nAcademy of Sciences (NAS) on peer review. As part of the discussions \nwith the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. Smith) and the Senator from \nMontana (Mr. Baucus) over the amendment I intended to offer, they have \nagreed that as the NAS conducts its review, they will hold hearings on \nthe issue of Corps reform and on a bill which I will introduce next \nCongress that will include Independent Review. I want to make certain \nthat an NAS study does not become an excuse not to do anything on Corps \nreform for a year. Therefore, I have not opposed that study, and its \ncompletion will eliminate one argument against enacting serious Corps \nreform. The managers understand my concern in this regard, and are \ninterested in moving forward on reforms, and have agreed to my request \nfor hearings. It is my hope that through hearings the NAS study and my \nbill can dovetail nicely so that we have a fully vetted bill which can \nthen be fined tuned by the NAS recommendations. The agreement we have \nmade provides the best chance to pass a serious reform bill in the next \nyear, rather than reach deadlock.\n  I appreciate the efforts that the Managers of this bill have taken to \nbring this bill to the floor in the closing days of this Senate. I know \nthat many of these Corps projects are extremely important to many of \nour constituents. However, Mr. President, in light of the attention and \nconcern that the replacement of the Upper Mississippi locks has had in \nmy own home state, I felt it that it was important that the issue of \nestablishing additional oversight and review of Corps projects be \nraised in the context of this year's Water Resources bill, and that we \nbegin down the road to passage of Corps reform legislation. Today we \nare closer to that goal than we were yesterday.\n  As last week's five part series on the Corps of Engineers which ran \nin the Washington Post last week highlighted, the ongoing construction \nand maintenance of Corps dams, navigation\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nchannels, and flood control structures, and other water development \nprojects dramatically alter the nation's landscapes. Michael Grunwald's \nSunday, September 10, 2000 story made this point very clear that the \ndebate over whether the Corps:\n\n     . . . should grow or shrink, and how much it should shift its \n     focus from construction projects to restoration project. . \n     .may not be the sexiest of Beltway brawls, but it will have a \n     dramatic effect on America. Corps levees and floodwalls \n     protect millions of homes, farms and businesses. Its coastal \n     ports and barge channels carry 2 billion tons of freight \n     annually. Its dams generate one-fourth of America's \n     hydroelectric power. Its water recreation sites attract more \n     visitors than the National Park Service's. Its land holdings \n     would cover Vermont and New Hampshire. But the Corps may have \n     its greatest impact on nature . . . So the future direction \n     of the Corps will help determine the future health of \n     America's environment.\n\n  Furthermore, this major government program costs federal taxpayers \nbillions of dollars each year, and unfortunately, there have been times \nwhen economically unjustified activities have made it through to \nconstruction. While there are heartening signs of reform in the Corps \nCivil Works program, Congress should be working to create an \nindependent process to help affirm when the Corps gets it right and \nhelp to provide a means for identifying problems before taxpayer funded \nconstruction investments are made. Today we begin that work in earnest.\n  Mr. President, I feel that requiring independent review of large and \ncontroversial Corps projects is a practical first step down the road to \na reformed Corps of Engineers. Independent review would catch mistakes \nby Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps officials \nto justify questionable projects, and would provide planners \ndesperately needed support against the never ending pressure of project \nboosters. Those boosters, Mr. President, include Congressional \ninterests, which is why I believe that this body needs to champion \nreform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork and no \nsubstance. As Mike Grunwald's article on Monday, September 11, 2000 \nstates:\n\n       Water projects are a traditional coin of the realm on \n     Capitol Hill, offering members of Congress jobs, contracts \n     and other benefits for their constituents and campaign \n     contributors --as well as ribbon cutting opportunities for \n     themselves. In fact, the Corps budget consists almost \n     entirely of projects requested by individual lawmakers, then \n     approved by the Corps; the agency has almost no discretionary \n     funds of its own.\n\n  I wish it were the case, Mr. President, that I could argue that \nadditional oversight were not needed, but unfortunately, I see that \nthere is need for additional scrutiny. In the Upper Mississippi there \nis troubling evidence of abuse. There is troubling evidence from \nwhistleblowers that senior Corps officials, under pressure from barge \ninterests, ordered their subordinates to exaggerate demand for barges \nin order to justify new Mississippi River locks. This is a matter which \nis still under investigation, and I hope that no evidence of wrongdoing \nwill ultimately be found. Adequate assessment of the environmental \nimpacts of barges is also very important. I am also concerned that the \nCorps' assessment of the environmental impacts of additional barges \ndoes not adequately assess the impacts of barge movements on fish, \nbackwaters and aquatic plants. We should not gamble with the \nenvironmental health of the river. If we allow more barges on the \nMississippi, we must be sure the environmental impacts of those barges \nare fully mitigated.\n\n  I am raising this issue principally because I believe that Congress \nshould act to restore trust in the Corps if we are going to complete an \nunbiased assessment of navigation needs. The first step in restoring \nthat trust is restoring the credibility of the Corps' decision-making \nprocess. We must remove the cloud hanging over the Corps. There is a \nbasic conflict of interest here, and Mike Grunwald's story on \nWednesday, September 11, 2000, again in the Washington Post, makes this \nclear:\n\n       The same agency that evaluates the proposed water projects \n     gets to work on the ones it deems worthwhile. If the analysis \n     concludes that the economic costs of a project outweigh its \n     benefits, or that the ecological damage of a project is too \n     extreme, then the Corps loses a potential job.\n\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, Congress now finds itself having to \nreset the scales to make economic benefits and environmental \nrestoration co-equal goals of project planning. Our rivers serve many \nmasters--barge owners as well as bass fisherman--and the Corps' \nplanning process should reflect the diverse demands we place on them. I \nwant to make sure that future Corps projects no longer fail to produce \npredicted benefits, stop costing more than the Corps estimated, and do \nnot have unanticipated environmental impacts. In the future, we must \nmonitor the result of projects so that we can learn from our mistakes \nand, when possible, correct them. We should impose a system of peer \nreview as soon as possible and consider other comprehensive reforms. In \na first step toward full evaluation of projects, I have committed \nmyself to making Corps reform a priority in the next year and in the \n107th Congress. The agreement we have reached today ensures that this \nSenate will also make it a priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8933-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, we are currently facing one of the worst \nblood shortages in history, and I implore the citizens of this fine \nnation to volunteer to be a blood donor. Across the country hospitals \nare having to postpone life saving operations because of the lack of \nblood. Just the other day, the Medical University of South Carolina in \nCharleston had to postpone a liver transplant because it lacked the \nnecessary blood supply to perform the surgery. This is simply not \nacceptable.\n  On September 19, 2000, Dr. Bernadine Healy, president and CEO of the \nAmerican Red Cross, made the following statement stressing the critical \nneed for blood donations. I feel that it is essential that we heed Dr. \nHealy's advice, and I ask unanimous consent that her statement be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Statement by Dr. Bernadine Healy, September 19, 2000, American Red \n                  Cross Blood Supply Press Conference\n\n       At this moment, the nation's blood supply is in critically \n     short supply. We could not practice modern medicine without \n     blood. Right now, the medical care of patients is being \n     altered, postponed or canceled because the blood they need is \n     not available. This silent savior in many medical emergencies \n     is in short supply.\n       Blood is a critical link in the chain of health care \n     nationwide. Together, the American Red Cross and the hundreds \n     of independent blood centers maintain the strength of that \n     link providing blood to patients in need. But that link is \n     weak, and the chain of caring is being stretched to its \n     limit.\n       Our role as blood bankers is an important one and we take \n     our responsibilities very seriously. Every donor provides a \n     generous gift of life and we recognize that gift as part of a \n     precious national resource. We are now facing a time when the \n     demand for this resource has grown such that it is outpacing \n     our ability to provide adequate supplies.\n       In August 1999, the Red Cross collected about 16,700 units \n     of blood per day. In August 2000, we collected nearly 17,300 \n     units of blood daily--an increase of 3 percent. However, \n     while collections have increased, so too has distribution. In \n     August 1999, we distributed more than 14,700 units of blood \n     each day. In August 2000, we distributed nearly 17,000 units \n     each day, a 14 percent increase for that one month.\n       The American Red Cross believes we need a three-day \n     inventory available--about 80,000 units--which enables us to \n     provide an uninterrupted supply of blood to patients in need. \n     However, for the entire summer, the Red Cross has operated on \n     little more than a two-day supply.\n       Last Friday, our national inventory plummeted to 36,000 \n     units of blood, and we consider 50,000 units to be a critical \n     inventory level. Thirty-four of our thirty-six blood regions \n     nationwide are in urgent need of blood donations. Many of our \n     regions are being forced to ask local hospitals to postpone \n     elective surgeries, especially if the patient in question has \n     type 0 blood because the demand is greatest for this type.\n       An increase in the population, aging, growing numbers of \n     medical procedures and more complex surgeries that were not \n     possible years ago have contributed to this increase in \n     demand. Patient undergoing chemotherapy and infants in \n     neonatal care need blood. So do accident victims and those \n     undergoing transplants. Blood is always, everywhere in need.\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\n       The American Red Cross is implementing increased donor \n     recruitment initiatives to help offset these trends \n     including:\n       1. Scheduling more blood drives, as well as expanding the \n     hours of existing blood drives;\n       2. Pilot-testing an Internet-based system to enable people \n     to schedule blood donation appointment online;\n       3. Utilizing aggressive telemarketing and direct-mail \n     campaigns to encourage previous blood donors to come back and \n     schedule an appointment;\n       4. Paying for advertising and working with the news media \n     in markets nationwide to get this critical message to \n     potential donors;\n       5. Establishing a pilot ``urban blood donor center'' in \n     Chicago to make it easier for people working in downtown \n     areas to donate blood during the business day.\n       We are excited about these new efforts and hope that they \n     will allow us to reach more prospective donors than ever \n     before. However, the fact remains that we need help now to \n     address the current blood shortage. I want to encourage \n     everyone, from students returning to school, to people who \n     haven't donated blood in a while to call 1-800-GIVE-LIFE \n     today to schedule an appointment. We need you now. Don't \n     forget, 1-800-GIVE-LIFE.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8934-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE HAGUE CONVENTION ON PROTECTION OF CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, countless Americans will welcome the news \nthat the Senate last night ratified the Treaty of the Hague Convention \non Protection of Children and cooperation in Respect of Intercountry \nAdoption. This Treaty was approved by our Foreign Relations Committee \nin April.\n  In addition, the Senate also approved unanimous final passage of the \nIntercountry Adoption Implementation Act--which was likewise \nunanimously approved by the House of Representatives this past Monday.\n  I offered the Intercountry Adoption Implementation act a year ago--\nalong with Senator Landrieu, because this legislation will provide, for \nthe first time, a rational structure for intercountry adoption.\n  Mr. President, this significant legislation is intended to build some \naccountability into agencies that provide intercountry adoption \nservices in the United States while strengthening the hand of the \nSecretary of State in ensuring that U.S. adoption agencies engage in an \nethical manner to find homes for children.\n  In addition, Mr. President, both the Senate and the House agreed that \nsole responsibility for implementing the requirements of the Hague \nConvention, rests with the U.S. Secretary of State. Although, some \nadvocated early on, a role for various government agencies, I believe \nthat spreading responsibility among various agencies would have \nundermined the effective implementation of the Hague Convention.\n  Mr. President, passage of this significant legislation would not have \nbeen possible without the assistance from several talented people in \nboth the Senate and House.\n  In particular, of course, I extend my sincere appreciation to Senator \nLandrieu (and her staff). Senator Landrieu and I have worked together \non issues of adoption since her arrival in the Senate in 1997.\n  Senator Biden, ranking minority member of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, has been exceedingly helpful (as has his staff) in \nfinalizing the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act.\n  It's always a privilege to work with our colleagues in the House--and \nespecially regarding passage of this Act. The Honorable Bill Gilman, \nthe distinguished chairman of the House International Relations \nCommittee; Congressman Sam Gejdenson, ranking minority member on the \nHouse International Relations; Congressmen Dave Camp and William \nDelahunt; and, last but by no means least, my good friend, Congressman \nRichard Burr--who offered the original Senate companion bill in the \nHouse.\n  From my own Senate family, the former legislative counsel for the \nForeign Relations Committee (now counsel for Senate Intelligence), \nPatricia McNerney; and Michele DeKonty, the very special lady who, in \nevery sense, my right-hand lady.\n  Mr. President, this legislation now goes to President Clinton. I am \nhopeful that ratification and implementation of the Hague Convention \nwill encourage more intercountry adoptions, while protecting all who \nare involved in the process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8934-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8934-S8936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           DELAYS IN SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JUDICIAL NOMINEES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I regret to report to the Senate that the \nlast confirmation hearing for federal judges held by the Judiciary \nCommittee was in July. Throughout August and now into the third week in \nSeptember, there have been no additional hearings held or even noticed. \nBy contrast, in 1992, the last year of the Bush Administration, a \nDemocratic majority in the Senate held three confirmation hearings in \nAugust and September and continued to work to confirm judges up to and \nincluding the last day of the session.\n  I also regret that the Judiciary Committee's inaction on judicial \nnominations has led to Senators object to Senate committees continuing \nto meet on other matters when the Senate is in session. The matter is \nmost acute with regard to the numerous vacancies on our Courts of \nAppeals and the qualified women and men who have been stalled before \nthis Committee.\n  This Judiciary Committee has reported only 3 nominees to the Courts \nof Appeals all year. We have held hearings without even including a \nnominee to the Courts of Appeals and denied a Committee vote to two \noutstanding nominees who succeeded in getting hearings. I certainly \nunderstand the frustration of those Senators who know that Roger \nGregory, Helene White, Bonnie Campell and others should be considered \nby this Committee and voted on by the Senate without additional delay.\n  Currently there remain more judiciary vacancies than there were when \nCongress adjourned in 1995. We have not even kept up with attrition \nover that last 5 years. Earlier this week, Senator Hatch joined with me \nand a dozen other Senators to introduce the Federal Judgeship Act of \n2000. That legislation incorporates recommendations of the Judicial \nConference of the United States to authorize 70 judgeships in addition \nto the 64 current vacancies within the federal judiciary. If those \nadditional judgeships were taken into account, the so-called ``vacancy \nrate'' would be over 13 percent with over 130 vacancies.\n  We can make quick progress when we want to do so. The last group of \nnominees considered by the Judiciary Committee included three who were \nnominated on a Friday, had their hearing the next week and were \napproved and reported to the Senate within 6 days.\n  By contrast, we still have pending without a hearing qualified \nnominees like Judge Helene White of Michigan. She has been held hostage \nfor over 45 months without a hearing. She is the record holder for a \njudicial nominee who has had to wait the longest for a hearing and her \nwait continues without explanation to this day.\n  We still have pending before the Committee, the nomination of Bonnie \nCampbell to the Eighth Circuit. Ms. Campbell had her hearing last May, \nbut the Committee refuses to consider her nomination, vote her up or \nvote her down. Instead, there is the equivalent of an anonymous and \nunexplained secret hold. Bonnie Campbell is a distinguished lawyer, \npublic servant and law enforcement officer. She was the Attorney \nGeneral for the State of Iowa and the Director of the Violence Against \nWomen Office at the United States Department of Justice. And she enjoys \nthe full support of both of her home State Senators, Senator Harkin and \nSenator Grassley. I commend Senator Harkin for his remarks on Ms. \nCampbell's nomination earlier today. I understand his frustration and \nbelieve that this Senate's failure to act on this highly qualified \nnominee is without justification.\n  We still have pending without a hearing the nomination of Roger \nGregory of Virginia and Judge James Wynn of North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit. Were either of these highly-qualified jurists confirmed \nby the Senate, we would be finally acting to allow a qualified African \nAmerican to sit on that Court for the first time. We still have pending \nbefore the Committee the nomination of Enrique Moreno to the Fifth \nCircuit. He is the latest in a succession of outstanding Hispanic \nnominees by President Clinton to that Court, but he too is not being \nconsidered by the Committee or the Senate.\n  Let me return briefly to the nomination of Roger Gregory. The \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee indicated\n\n[[Page S8935]]\n\nin his recent op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that the reason Roger \nGregory would not be confirmed is because the Administration refused to \nconsult with his home State Senators. In fact, this nomination is \nsupported by both Virginia Senators, both Senator Warner and Senator \nRobb. Indeed, Senator Robb made a forceful statement on behalf of this \njust a few days ago. In response to that assertion in the Wall Street \nJournal, the Counsel to the President sent a letter to the editors of \nthat paper that corrected the misstatement. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of that letter be included in the Record at the end of my \nremarks.\n  The Chairman also suggested that it was too late in the session to \nmove on these nominations. In addition to the recent examples I already \nnoted, nominees now on the Senate calendar awaiting action after being \nbefore the Judiciary Committee for less than one week, there is the \nexample of the hearing held last week by the Government Affairs \nCommittee on two District of Columbia Superior Court judges, who one \nwas nominated on May 1 and the other was nominated on June 26. Another \nexample of the ability of the Senate to act is the September 8 \nconfirmation of James E. Baker to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nArmed Forces. Of course, the Republican candidate for the presidency \nhas said that nominations should be acted upon within 60 days. Of the \n42 judicial nominations currently pending, 33 have been pending from 60 \ndays to 4 years without final action, including Roger Gregory.\n  Finally, there is the contrasting example of responsible action by \nthe Democratic majority in 1992 on the nomination of Timothy Lewis to \nthe Third Circuit. Tim Lewis was nominated on September 17. By \nSeptember 17, Roger Gregory had already been pending for well over 60 \ndays. Tim Lewis was accorded a hearing on September 24, was voted on by \nthe Committee on October 7, and was confirmed by the Senate on October \n8, before it adjourned for rest of the campaign before the presidential \nelection that year.\n  I note for the Senate that there continue to be multiple vacancies on \nthe Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth and District of Columbia \nCircuits. With 22 current vacancies, our appellate courts have nearly \nhalf of the total judicial emergency vacancies in the federal court \nsystem. I note that the vacancy rate for our Courts of Appeals is more \nthan 11 percent nationwide. If we were to take into account the \nadditional appellate judgeships included in the Hatch-Leahy Federal \nJudgeship Act of 2000 and requested by the Judicial Conference to \nhandle their increased workloads, the vacancy rate would be 16 percent.\n  Pending before the Committee are a dozen nominees to the Federal \nCourts of Appeals who are awaiting a hearing. They include Judge Helene \nWhite of Michigan, who is now the longest pending judicial nomination \nat over 45 months without even a hearing; Barry Goode, whose nomination \nto the Ninth Circuit was the subject of numerous statements by Senator \nFeinstein and who has been pending for over two years; Allen Snyder, \nanother well-respected and highly-qualified nominee who got a hearing \nbut no Committee vote although he received the highest rating from the \nABA, enjoys the full support of his home state Senators, and had his \nhearing on May 10, 2000. There are and have been many others, including \na number of qualified minority nominees whom I have been speaking about \nthroughout the year, including Kathleen McCree Lewis of Michigan, \nEnrique Moreno of Texas and Roger Gregory of Virginia.\n  Let us compare to the year 1992, in which a Democratic majority in \nthe Senate confirmed 11 Court of Appeals nominees during a Republican \npresident's last year in office among the 66 judicial confirmations for \nthe year. In 1992, the Committee held 15 hearings--twice as many as \nthis Committee has found time to hold this year. The Judiciary \nCommittee has held hearings on only five Court of Appeals nominees all \nyear and has refused to vote on two of those. In the last 10 weeks of \nthe 1992 session, the Committee held four hearings and all of the \nnominees who had hearings then were confirmed before adjournment. In \nthe last 10 weeks of the 1992 session, we confirmed 32 judicial \nnominations.\n  What is most significant about the recent trend of judicial vacancies \nand vacancy rates is that the vacancies that existed in 1993, even \nafter the creation of 85 new judgeships in 1990, had been cut almost in \nhalf in 1994, when the rate was reduced to 7.4 percent with 63 \nvacancies at the end of the 103rd Congress. We continued to make \nprogress even into 1995. In fact, the vacancy rate was lowered to 5.8 \npercent after the 1995 session, and before the partisan attack on \nfederal judges began in earnest in 1996 and 1997.\n  Progress in the reduction of judicial vacancies was reversed in 1996, \nwhen Congress adjourned leaving 64 vacancies, and in 1997, when \nCongress adjourned leaving 80 vacancies and a 9.5 percent vacancy rate. \nNo one was happier than I that the Senate was able to make progress in \n1998 toward reducing the vacancy rate. I praised Senator Hatch for his \neffort. Unfortunately, the vacancies have since grown again.\n  During Republican control it has taken two-year periods for the \nSenate to match the one-year total of 101 judges confirmed in 1994, \nwhen we were on course to end the vacancies gap. Nominees like Judge \nHelene White, Barry Goode, Judge Legrome Davis, and J. Rich Leonard, \ndeserve to be treated with dignity and dispatch--not delayed for two \nand three years. We are still seeing outstanding nominees nitpicked and \ndelayed to the point that good women and men are being deterred from \nseeking to serve as federal judges. Nominees practicing law see their \nwork put on hold while they await the outcome of their nominations. \nTheir families cannot plan. They are left to twist in the wind. All of \nthis despite the fact that, by all objective accounts and studies, the \njudges that President Clinton has appointed are a moderate group of \njudges, rendering moderate decisions, and certainly including far fewer \nideologues than were nominated during the Reagan Administration.\n\n  With respect to the Senate's treatment of nominees who are women or \nminorities, I remain vigilant. I have said that I do not regard Senator \nHatch as a biased person. I have also been outspoken in my concern \nabout the manner in which we are failing to consider qualified minority \nand women nominees over the last several years. From Margaret Morrow, \nMargaret McKeown and Sonia Sotomayor, through Richard Paez and Marsha \nBerzon, and including Judge James Beatty, Jr., Judge James Wynn, Roger \nGregory, Enrique Moreno and all the other qualified women and minority \nnominees who have been delayed and opposed over the last several years, \nI have spoken out. The Senate will never remove the blot that occurred \nlast October when the Republican Senators emerged from a Republican \nCaucus to vote lockstep against Justice Ronnie White to be a Federal \nDistrict Court Judge in Missouri.\n  The Senate should be moving forward to consider the nominations of \nJudge James Wynn, Jr. and Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit. Fifty \nyears has passed since the confirmation of Judge Hastie to the Third \nCircuit and still there has never been an African-American on the \nFourth Circuit in the history of that Circuit. The nomination of Judge \nJames A. Beaty, Jr., was previously sent to us by President Clinton in \n1995. That nomination was never considered by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee or the Senate and was returned to President Clinton without \naction at the end of 1998. It is time for the Senate to act on a \nqualified African-American nominee to the Fourth Circuit. President \nClinton spoke powerfully about these matters at the NAACP Convention. \nWe should respond not be misunderstanding or mischaracterizing what he \nsaid, but instead taking action on these well-qualified nominees.\n  In addition, the Senate should act favorably on the nominations of \nEnrique Moreno to the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Moreno succeeded to the \nnomination of Jorge Rangel on which the Senate refused to act last \nCongress. These are well-qualified nominees who will add to the \ncapabilities and diversity of those courts. In fact, the Chief Judge of \nthe Fifth Circuit declared that a judicial emergency exists on that \ncourt, caused by the number of judicial vacancies, the lack of Senate \naction on pending nominations, and the overwhelming workload.\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\n  I continue to urge the Senate to meet its responsibilities to all \nnominees, including women and minorities. That highly-qualified \nnominees are being needlessly delayed is most regrettable. The Senate \nshould join with the President to confirm well-qualified, diverse and \nfair-minded nominees to fulfill the needs of the federal courts around \nthe country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article for the Wall Street Journal \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 12, 2000]\n\n                   `Racial Division' Charge Is Untrue\n\n       In ``Senate Isn't Guilty of Racism In Confirming Judges,'' \n     Sen. Orrin Hatch states that in recent weeks the president \n     has ``nominated numerous minorities for federal judgeships \n     without consulting home-state senators'' (editorial page, \n     Sept. 5). This is simply untrue. The administration has \n     adhered to its practice of consulting with home-state \n     senators prior to nominating judicial candidates, and it did \n     so with the two nominees Sen. Hatch mentioned by name.\n       One of those, Roger Gregory, an accomplished African-\n     American attorney from Virginia, was nominated for the Fourth \n     Circuit at the end of June. Sen. Hatch says the president \n     moved a judgeship from North Carolina to Virginia in order to \n     make the nomination, but the seat for which Mr. Gregory was \n     nominated has not been filed before, nor allocated to any \n     particular state in the Fourth Circuit. Moreover, Roger \n     Gregory has the strong support of both of his home-state \n     senators (who were indeed consulted prior to nomination). \n     Democratic Sen. Chuck Robb recommended Mr. Gregory to the \n     president and has been working tirelessly on Mr. Gregory's \n     behalf. Republican Sen. John Warner has joined Sen. Robb in \n     requesting that Sen. Hatch give Mr. Gregory a hearing.\n       The Fourth Circuit, which hears cases from Maryland, North \n     Carolina, South Carolina. Virginia and West Virginia, has the \n     largest African-American population of any circuit in the \n     country. Yet it has never had an African-American judge. It \n     is extraordinary to suggest that the president's nomination \n     of a highly qualified candidate who has the support of both \n     home-state senators is part of some effort to ``generate \n     racial divisions.'' Rather than make such claims, the \n     Republican leadership should demonstrate its color-blind \n     bipartisanship by promptly confirming Roger Gregory.\n       Indeed, the Senate has a great deal more work to do on \n     judges. Sen. Hatch states that in 1994 the administration had \n     argued that a ``7.4%'' vacancy rate in the judiciary was \n     equivalent to full employment. Using that figure, he suggests \n     that the administration has no basis for complaining about \n     vacancies, because the vacancy rate is now close to that \n     level. But the figure cited by the administration in 1994 was \n     actually 4.7%. To attain even this modest goal, the Senate \n     would need to reduce judicial vacancies to 40. That is, the \n     Senate would need to confirm an additional 24 nominees this \n     year. We look forward to working with the Senate Republicans \n     to achieve this goal.\n\n                                                   Beth Nolan,\n\n                                         Counsel to the President,\n                                                  The White House.\n       Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8936-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FAST AND SIMPLE SHORTCUT TAX ACT\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Still, we expect the average American citizen, under \npenalty of law, to have a complete grasp of all their tax obligations \nand to pay them in full and on time. The complexity of the current tax \ncode has made it a burden to pay ones's tax obligations. This burden \nmust be alleviated.\n  The good news is that we can do something to simplify the tax code \nfor the millions of Americans who do not have complicated investment or \ncorporate income and for whom paying taxes should be as easy and \npainless as possible. The FASST Act offers a voluntary tax plan which \nwould simplify the filing process for millions Americans. It also \nprovides much needed tax relief through the elimination of the marriage \npenalty, a tax which actually punishes people for getting married.\n  The FASST Act would provide a single, low tax rate of 15 percent for \ntaxpayers who earn up to $100,000 per year in wages and receive no more \nthan $5,000 in income from capital gains, interest, and dividends. A \ntaxpayer who chooses to participate in this program would not receive a \ntax return, nor would he have to pay the federal government on April \n15th because too little in taxes was deducted from his payroll. \nInstead, the employee would elect to fill out a modified W-4 form at \nwork whereby his employer would withdraw the exact tax obligation at \nthe single low rate of 15 percent. What a relief it would be for those \nfolks who qualify to be free from the yearly burden of trying to \ndecipher the federal tax code.\n  Taxpayers who elect to participate in this program would still \nbenefit from the current standard tax deduction, as well as personal \nexemptions, child care credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit and a \ndeduction for home mortgage interest expenses and property taxes. Thus, \nemployees would experience the best of both worlds--the current tax \nsystem's generous deduction and credit system for working families, as \nwell as a simplified tax system. This bill also provides generous \nsavings incentives by exempting up to $5,000 of all interest, dividends \nand capital income from taxes.\n  Taxpayers who do not participate in the FASST program would also \nbenefit from provisions in the FASST Act. First, this act reduces the \nmarriage penalty, and provides an exemption from the Alternative \nMinimum Tax for many sole proprietors and small businesses. In \naddition, all taxpayers would be eligible to receive a 50 percent \ncredit for up to $200 in tax preparer expenses if they file their taxes \nelectronically. And again, there is a substantial incentive for savings \nand investment as up to $500 of dividend and interest income is exempt \nfor individuals. The FASST Act is good for all taxpayers.\n  I believe that the FASST Act provides much needed reform to our tax \nsystem. Our current federal tax code is immense, complex, and \nconfusing. It has become a burden on the American taxpayer. The FASST \nAct takes a much-needed first step toward providing a simpler, \nfriendlier means of collecting taxes from our hard-working citizens. I \nam pleased to join with my fellow Senators from North Dakota and \nIllinois in introducing the Fast and Simple Shortcut Tax Act today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8936-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to urge the majority to lift \nits hold on H.R. 3767, which would permanently authorize the visa \nwaiver pilot\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\nprogram. I am a cosponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, \nwhich will achieve the important goal of making our visa waiver program \npermanent. We have had a visa waiver pilot project for more than a \ndecade, and it has been a tremendous success in allowing residents of \nsome of our most important allies to travel to the United States for up \nto 90 days without obtaining a visa, and in allowing American citizens \nto travel to those countries without visas. Countries must meet a \nnumber of requirements to participate in the program, including having \nextraordinarily low rates of visa refusals. Of course, the visa waiver \ndoes not affect the need for international travelers to carry valid \npassports.\n  The visa waiver pilot program expired on April 30. The House passed \nlegislation to make the program permanent before that deadline. But the \nSenate failed to meet this deadline, and the Administration was forced \nto extend it administratively. Since then, the Senate has missed \ndeadline after deadline, and has had to rely on the grace of the \nAdministration for this program--which is relied upon by thousands of \nAmerican travelers every year--to continue.\n  Every Democratic Senator has cleared this bill. But the majority has \nrefused to clear it, even five months after it passed the House and the \nstatutory authorization for this program expired. Earlier in the year, \nsome members had substantive concerns about the bill. Those have been \nrectified. I am unaware of any remaining substantive objections to this \nlegislation, and it is now well past time to pass it. Passing it will \nnot require any floor debate or roll call vote. It simply requires \nSenators to life their holds.\n  This is a bill that benefits American travelers from every State and \nthe tourism industry in every State. It is not a Democratic bill or a \nRepublican bill. It is not a regional bill. It is simply a good, \ncommon-sense bill that deserves the Senate's support. There has been \ntoo much stalling on this bill already--we should act today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8937-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RENAMING OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS IN HONOR OF PRESIDENT \n                             HARRY S TRUMAN\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, tomorrow will be a special day for the \nState of Missouri. Tomorrow, President Clinton and Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright will hold a ceremony to officially rename the U.S. \nState Department Headquarters as The Harry S Truman Federal Building.\n  I am pleased to have played a role in the renaming of the State \nDepartment in honor of one of Missouri's most famous sons--President \nTruman. Last spring, I introduced a bill, S. 2416, to designate the \nheadquarters for the Department of State, as the ``Harry S. Truman \nFederal Building''. The House's companion legislation, H.R. 3639, \nsponsored by Missouri Congressmen Ike Skelton and Roy Blunt, passed the \nSenate on June 8th and was signed by the President on June 20, 2000. \nSecretary of State Albright was supportive of this effort from the \nbeginning, and I thank her. In addition, I would like to thank the \nSenators who cosponsored this bill, Senators Bond, Boxer, Byrd, DeWine, \nHagel, Moynihan, Roberts, and Warner.\n  Born in Lamar, Missouri, Harry S Truman was a farmer, a national \nguardsman, a World War I veteran, a local postmaster, a road overseer, \nand a small business owner before turning to politics. Through these \ntraditional experiences, he gained the courage, honesty, and dedication \nto freedom required of a great leader. Joining the Senate in 1935, \nTruman fought against government waste and saved the U.S. Government \n$15 billion as Chairman of the Senate War Investigating committee. Ten \nyears later, Harry S Truman became Franklin D. Roosevelt's Vice \nPresident. Four short months later, Truman assumed the presidency after \nRoosevelt's untimely death, and remarked to reporters: ``I felt like \nthe moon, the stars, and all the planets had fallen on me.'' Although \nTruman might have felt unprepared, he rose to the challenge with \ntypical Missourian resolve and changed the face of history. President \nTruman went on to become one of the most influential presidents of the \nmodern era. His leadership and character, especially in the area of \nforeign policy, have earned him well-deserved praise and respect \nthroughout the world. The life, character, and freedom-loving values of \nthis great Missourian are honored by countless millions.\n  Mr. President, naming the State Department Headquarters building \nafter President Truman is a befitting tribute to his life and his \nlegacy. This is truly a proud moment for the Truman family, the people \nof Missouri, and all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8937-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8937-S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMBATING CHILDHOOD CANCER AND DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, the month of September is Childhood \nCancer Awareness Month. Contrary to public perception, cancer is not \njust an adult disease. Cancer is the second leading cause of childhood \ndeaths, second only to accidents. Cancer strikes 46 children, or two \nclassrooms of children, every school day. In 1975, only 35 percent of \nchildren with cancer survived more than five years. Thanks to modern \nmedicine, 70 percent of children diagnosed with cancer survive. Thirty \npercent, however, do not.\n  Childhood cancer has a unique set of characteristics and problems \nwhich researchers are still trying to find answers to. While most adult \ncancers result from lifestyle factors, such as smoking, diet, \noccupational, and other exposure to cancer-causing agents, the causes \nof most childhood cancers, are not yet known. While adult cancers are \nprimarily those of the lung, colon, breast, prostate and pancreas, \nchildhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood cells \n(leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system and tumors of the \nmuscles, kidneys and nervous system. Childhood cancers further differ \nfrom adult cancers in that they often have spread to other parts of the \nbody by the time they are diagnosed.\n  Our goal must be to increase funding for research, early detection \nand treatment, and prevention of childhood cancer. The member \ninstitutions of the Children's Oncology Group, C.O.G., provide \ntreatment for up to 90 percent of all children with cancer in North \nAmerica. The Children's Oncology Group is supported, in part, by \nfederal funds from the U.S. National Cancer Institute and by private \nfunds raised by the National Childhood Cancer Foundation. The National \nCancer Institute is slated to receive $3.8 billion in Fiscal Year 2001 \nfor cancer research. Yet childhood cancer is one of many focuses of the \nNCI's research, and it certainly is not among the top funding \npriorities.\n  I have worked with my fellow colleagues on the Senate Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee to raise awareness about the \nneed for greater focus on childhood cancer, and I am delighted that the \nSenate will today pass legislation to address a number of pressing \nchildren's health issues. In particular, I want to thank Senator Frist, \nthe author of this legislation, for working with me to include language \ndirecting the Secretary of Health and Human Services to study \nenvironmental and other risk factors for childhood cancers and to carry \nout projects to improve treatment outcomes among children with cancer \n--such projects shall include expansion of data collection and \npopulation surveillance efforts to include childhood cancers \nnationally, the development of a uniform reporting system nationwide \nfor reporting the diagnosis of childhood cancers, and support for the \nNational Limb Loss Information Center to address the primary and \nsecondary needs of children with cancer to prevent or minimize the \ndisabling nature of these cancers. By authorizing the Secretary to \ncarry out these functions, we will hopefully get the answers we need to \nensure that all children live a healthy, cancer-free life.\n  Another devastating disease which affects almost exclusively male \nchildren, is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, DMD. At this time, there is \nno cure for DMD. Little boys with DMD are most often not diagnosed \nbefore the age of two or three years. Most boys with DMD walk by \nthemselves later than average, and then in an unusual manner. They may \nfrequently fall, have difficulty rising from the ground, or difficulty \ngoing up steps. Calf muscles typically look over developed or \nexcessively large, while other muscles are poorly developed. Use of a \nwheelchair\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nmay be occasional at age 9, but total dependence is normally \nestablished upon reaching the teen years. Most boys affected survive \ninto their twenties, with relatively few surviving beyond 30 years of \nage.\n  I have heard from the parents and grandparents of a little boy in \nArkansas who has DMD. His name is Austin and his family is desperately \nhoping for a cure so they don't have to watch their son and grandson \nlose his ability to walk. While we are far from finding a cure for DMD, \nI am hopeful that language that Senator Frist has graciously worked \nwith me to include in the children's health bill will help Austin and \nthe thousands of other young boys suffering from DMD. Specifically, the \nAct authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to expand and \nincrease coordination of the activities by the National Institutes of \nHealth with respect to research on muscular dystrophies, including DMD.\n  In conclusion, we are about to pass incredibly important legislation \nto address a myriad of children's health issues, including childhood \ncancer and Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Efforts to improve the quality \nand length of life for millions of children are valuable beyond \nmeasure, and I encourage all of my colleagues to work together with me \nto raise awareness about these devastating diseases and the need to \nfind treatments and cures for the children they affect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8938-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE INTERCOUNTRY ADOPTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr President, it may only be September, but it sure \nfeels like Christmas. For seven years, adoption advocates in the United \nStates and throughout the world have waited for the moment that came \nlate yesterday. In fact, it marked the second time this week that \nhistory has been made in these chambers. On Tuesday, this body voted to \nextend permanent normal trade relations to China and yesterday, we \nvoted to ratify the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and \nCooperation in Respect of International Adoption. In doing so, we have \njoined the international community in, for the first time, recognizing \nthat the ``child for the full, harmonious development of his or her \npersonality, should grow up in a family.'' For the hundreds of \nthousands of children growing up on the streets and in institutions \nthroughout the world, yesterday's vote marked the hope of a better \ntomorrow.\n  I would like to begin my remarks by thanking Chairman Helms for his \nextraordinary leadership in passing this historic legislation. There is \nno doubt in my mind that we would not be celebrating this important \nmoment were it not for him. In the two years since we stood together on \nthis floor and introduced this legislation, he has worked tirelessly to \nensure that each of the bill's provisions were aimed at protecting \nadopted children and their families. I would also like to thank Senator \nBiden, Senator Brownback, Senator Kennedy, Senator Abraham, \nRepresentative Gilman, Representative Gejdenson, Representative Smith \nand Representative Camp for their work in moving this bill forward.\n  I would also like to commend the adoption community at large. In my \nopinion, this effort is a shining example of what can be accomplished \nif people are willing to compromise for the greater good. I have said \nit before and I believe it rings true here, adoption brings people, \nwhether they are Republican, Democrat, conservative, liberal, American, \nRussian or Chinese, together. United by the belief that all children \ndeserve to grow in the love of a permanent family. Adoption breaks down \nbarriers and helps build families.\n  Last year international adoption helped 15,744 children to realize \ntheir dream of having a family of their own. Not a day goes by when I \ndo not receive a letter or a picture from one of these families telling \nme what incredible joy adoption has brought to their lives. Not long \nago, I attended the naturalization ceremony for about 100 of these \nfamilies. I distinctly remember looking into the crowd, at the tiny \nfaces of these little ambassadors from Moldova, India, China, \nKazakhstan, Russia, Korea, Romania, and thinking that there is no \nbetter example of the new era of globalization. With inventions like \nthe Internet, geographic barriers will no longer stand in the way of \nchildren finding families. Today, it is possible for a couple from a \nsmall town like New Iberia, Louisiana to be connected with a waiting \nchild in Irkustk, Russia. There is no such thing as an unwanted child, \njust unfound families. We share a collective responsibility to find a \nhome for every child in the world and with yesterday's vote, we \nacknowledged that we are willing to share in that responsibility.\n  As the largest receiving country, we have the opportunity to use this \nlegislation and the system it creates to construct an international \nframework designed to protect the children and families involved in the \nadoption process. It is time for us to take action to eliminate some of \nthe fraud, abuse and greed that can corrupt the adoption process. \nJoined by their commitment to protecting the rights of the child, Hague \ncountries can now enjoy the comfort of knowing that each and every \nadoption will be performed in accordance with the established \nstandards. Adoptive parents can rest easier knowing that there is \nsomewhere they can turn with questions and concerns.\n  As an adoption advocate and adoptive mother, it has been a very \nexciting week. In addition to passing this treaty, the House just \npassed the H.R. 2883, the Adopted Orphans Citizenship Act. This bill \ngrants automatic citizenship for children who are adopted. Unlike a \nchild born to a United States citizen, adopted children are not \nconferred automatic citizenship by virtue of their adoption. Instead, \nthey must go through a long, complex and costly naturalization process. \nThis is not only unnecessary its unfair. Adopted children should have \nthe same rights as birth children and laws which unfairly discriminate \nbetween the two need to be changed. I urge my colleagues to act quickly \nto pass this legislation.\n  Yes, Mr. President, it has been a very good week for children in need \nof homes. Yesterday, President Clinton awarded the second installment \nof the adoption incentive payments to states who had increased their \nnumber of adoptions out of foster care. 46,000 children in foster care \nfound homes through adoption last year. That is a 65 percent increase \nsince 1996.\n  Although I am excited by the progress we have made, I am still driven \nby the vision of the children in institutions abroad and the knowledge \nthat over 500,000 children in this country are caught in the foster \ncare drift. We have accomplished a lot, but much remains to be done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8938-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8938]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I am honored to serve as one of this \nyear's congressional co-chairs for National Bible Week, sponsored by \nthe National Bible Association. This observance occurs during the week \nof November 19-26, 2000, the week during which Thanksgiving Day occurs. \nThis is appropriate\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\nsince many Americans will attend houses of worship during that week to \ngive thanksgiving.\n  As we gather to give thanks, let us remember that ``Man shall not \nlive by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of \nGod.'' (Matthew 4:4) When we try to live by bread alone, we nourish the \nbody but starve the mind. Members of Congress are called upon to right \nwrongs and correct injustice. There is no better way for all of us to \nsatisfy our hunger and thirst for justice than by ``eating'' the life-\ngiving spiritual food found in the Bible. By ``eating'' the food of the \nBible, I mean not just reading and studying the lessons found there, \nbut to ponder those messages in our hearts and apply them to our own \nlives. John Quincy Adams, our sixth President, said, ``For years I have \nread the Bible through once a year. I read it every morning, as the \nvery best way to begin the day.''\n  We are all very busy people. Many of us think we do not have time to \nread the Bible every day. D. L. Moody once answered this common excuse \nby saying, ``My friend, if you are too busy to read the Bible every day \nyou are busier than Almighty God ever intended any human being should \nbe and you had better let some things go and take time to read the \nBible.''\n  The Bible has always been more than a doctrinal source book or a \ncompendium of theological beliefs. People have turned to it time and \ntime again for comfort, encouragement, guidance and direction. I have \nmy Bible on my desk. Woodrow Wilson, our twenty-eighth President, said, \n``I am sorry for the men who do not read the Bible every day. I wonder \nwhy they deprive themselves of the strength and of the pleasure.''\n  Read the Bible. Study the Bible. Ponder the messages contained in the \nBible. By doing this you will learn of God's will for your life. Apply \nthose message to your life and you will learn that there is salvation, \nthere is forgiveness of sins and there is the hope of eternal life in \nthe presence of God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8939-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING THE GENEROSITY OF JOAN C. EDWARDS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nphilanthropy of one of West Virginia's most celebrated adopted \ndaughters. Later this month at a formal naming ceremony, the Marshall \nUniversity School of Medicine in Huntington, West Virginia, will be \nrenamed the Joan C. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University. \nIt gives me great honor to come to the floor today to be able to share \nJoan Edwards' remarkable story with the nation.\n  Born in London, England, Joan's family moved to New Orleans when she \nwas only four years old. At the age of 17, Joan set off to tour the \nnation singing the ``Sugar Blues'' with Clyde McCoy and his Kentucky \nband. As a young girl, Joan's singing career brought her to Chicago, \nNew York, and Pittsburgh, among other cities, where she met her future \nhusband and Huntington, West Virginia native, James ``Jim'' Edwards. \nJoan and Jim were married soon after, and lived in Pittsburgh prior to \nreturning to Huntington to work at the Edwards' family business, \nNational Mattress Company. Together, Jim and Joan would build the \nfamily's business into a great American success story and were also \nable to take up their passion of breeding racehorses.\n  In 1991, after 54 years of marriage, Jim Edwards lost his battle with \ncancer. Shortly thereafter, Joan Edwards announced that she would \npresent a total of over $20 million in contributions to the Huntington \ncommunity from their estate. This included $1 million to the Marshall \nUniversity School of Medicine, $1 million to the Huntington Museum of \nArt, $2 million to the Episcopal Church, and $16 million to the Cabell \nHuntington Hospital for the construction of an adult cancer center.\n  This story in and of itself is remarkable, but Joan Edwards' charity \ngoes even beyond that. Since that time, Joan has donated an additional \n$1 million to the Fine and Performing Arts Center at Marshall and $2 \nmillion to address the University's most pressing needs. And Joan \nEdwards has not stopped there. She has raised the bar even further. \nHaving lost both her husband and son to cancer, Joan has bequeathed an \nadditional $16 million to the Marshall University Medical School with \nan additional $2 million dedicated toward preliminary planning, design, \nand development for the creation of a children's cancer center.\n  It is indeed fitting that Marshall University will bestow a great \nhonor upon Mrs. Edwards, formally renaming its Medical School the Joan \nC. Edwards School of Medicine at Marshall University. I would also like \nto point out that only one-third of all of the medical schools in the \nnation are named after a benefactor. Of these institutions, Marshall \nUniversity's School of Medicine will be the first in the nation named \nafter a woman. This is such a fitting tribute for such an amazing \nwoman.\n  Joan has demonstrated the true meaning of philanthropy. Her active \nengagement in academics, the arts, athletics, and health care has \nimpacted the lives of countless people in West Virginia and across the \ncountry, serving as an inspiration to us all. She has done more for the \nfoundation of the community than most people would ever be able to do, \nand we are fortunate to have her as part of the fabric of West \nVirginia. I thank Joan for all of her selfless acts, and as we \ncelebrate this honor, I am reminded of how proud I am that she is a \nfellow West Virginian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8939-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNITION OF LINDSAY BENKO, OLYMPIC GOLD MEDALIST\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nremarkable young athlete from the great state of Indiana.\n  Yesterday, Americans watched with pride as 23 year-old Lindsay Benko \nand her teammates captured the gold medal in the 4x200 freestyle swim \nrelay. The team did it in style, setting an Olympic record with their \ntime of 7:57.80.\n  With that victory, Lindsay became the first Hoosier to win a medal at \nthe 2000 Summer Olympic games in Sydney, Australia.\n  Lindsay hails from Elkhart, Indiana, a small town in the shadow of \nNotre Dame's famous golden dome. In a town where football rules, today \nit is Lindsay Benko who has captured the headlines and inspired pride \nin Elkhart and South Bend.\n  Like so many other Olympic athletes, Lindsay has been preparing for \nher Olympic moment since she was very young, in fact, she has been \nswimming competitively since she was eight years old. Lindsay has \ndedicated her life to a sport she loves, and worked hard to be among \nthe best. As early as her freshman year at Elkhart Central High School, \nshe was a state champion. In high school, she won a total of eleven \nstate titles, four in the 100 meter freestyle, four in the 200 meter \nfreestyle, and three in the 400 meter freestyle relay. After \ngraduation, Lindsay took her competitive fire and winning Hoosier \nspirit to the University of Southern California, where she won a total \nof five NCAA individual titles.\n  Yesterday, Lindsay conquered her sport at a new level. She can now be \ncalled a world-class athlete and a world champion, but we will continue \nto proudly claim her as our own in the state of Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I join my friends in Elkhart, South Bend and across \nIndiana in congratulating Lindsay Benko for her outstanding \naccomplishment, and wishing the best of luck to all of our nation's \nOlympic athletes as they compete in the 2000 Summer Olympic \nGames.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8939-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8939-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8939-S8940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nMs. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3986.

A bill to permit the televising of Supreme Court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                opening the supreme court to television\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation on behalf of Senator Biden and myself, a bill \nwhich, succinctly stated, would provide the following: The Supreme \nCourt of the United States shall permit television coverage of all open \nsessions of the Court unless the Court decides by a vote of the \nmajority of Justices that allowing such coverage in a particular case \nwill constitute a violation of the due process rights of one or more of \nthe parties before the Court.\n  I will summarize that lengthy statement because of time limitations. \nThe statement contains the citations of the cases referred to and the \nspecific quotations which I shall cite.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to open to public view what the \nSupreme Court of the United States does in rendering important \ndecisions. It is grounded on the proposition that since the Supreme \nCourt of the United States has assumed the power to decide the cutting-\nedge questions on public policy today and has in effect become \nvirtually a ``super legislature'' in taking on the decisions on these \npublic policy issues, that the public has a right to know what the \nSupreme Court is doing, and that right would be substantially enhanced \nby televising the oral arguments of the Court so that the public would \nbe able to see and hear the kinds of issues which the Court is \ndeciding. The public would then have an insight into those issues to be \nable to follow what the Court decides after the due course of the \nCourt's deliberations.\n  In a very fundamental sense, the televising of the Supreme Court has \nbeen implicitly recognized--perhaps even sanctioned--by a 1980 decision \nof the Supreme Court of the United States in a case captioned Richmond \nNewspapers v. Virginia, where the Supreme Court noted that a public \ntrial belongs not only to the accused, but to the public and the press \nas well; and that people now acquire information on court procedures \nchiefly through the print and electronic media.\n\n  That decision, in referencing the electronic media, perhaps might be \nsaid to anticipate televising court proceedings, although I do not mean \nto suggest that the Supreme Court is in agreement with this \nlegislation. It might be appropriate to note at this juncture that the \nCourt could, on its own motion, televise its proceedings but has chosen \nnot to do so, which presents, in my view, the necessity for legislation \non this subject.\n  If one goes to the chambers of the Supreme Court, which are right \nacross the green here in the Capitol complex, one may enter and observe \nthe Court's arguments because they are public. Newspaper reporters are \npermitted to be in the Court. No cameras are permitted in the Court, of \neven still pictures, so when television wishes to characterize an \nargument, they have to send in an artist to have an artist's \nrenderings.\n  When I argued the case of the Navy Yard back in 1964, the Court \nproceedings were illustrated by an artist's drawings. But in the year \n2000, when the public gets a substantial portion, if not most, of its \ninformation from television, the availability strictly to the print \nmedia, is insufficient to give the public a real idea as to what is \ngoing on in the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The Supreme Court has traditionally had an agenda. It is really \nnothing new. The Warren Court vastly expanded criminal rights. In the \nyear 2000, I think no one would question at least some of the Warren \nCourt's decisions, saying that anybody who is being prosecuted in a \ncriminal proceeding has a right to counsel. It is really surprising to \nnote that before 1963, the case of Gideon v. Wainwright, the defendant \nin a criminal case did not have a right to counsel except in murder \ncases.\n  There is no doubt that the Supreme Court of the United States in the \n1930s had an agenda in striking down New Deal legislation. And then, in \na historic move, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, an enormously \npopular President in the mid- to late 1930's, very unhappy about the \nSupreme Court's activism in striking down New Deal legislation by five \nto four decisions--President Roosevelt suggested packing the Court by \nadding six additional Justices. There was quite a public reaction \nadverse to that proposal. Perhaps the Supreme Court of the United \nStates had more public attention at that particular time than at any \nother time in its history.\n  In the face of what was happening, a Supreme Court Justice, Owen J. \nRoberts, who happened to be from Philadelphia, my hometown, decided to \nchange his position and to support and hold constitutional the New Deal \nlegislation leading to the famous phrase ``a switch in time saves \nnine,'' from the old adage about ``a stitch in time saves nine.'' The \nswitch by Supreme Court Justice Owen Roberts, it is said, saved the \nnine-person constituency of the Supreme Court.\n  The Rehnquist Court, I submit, is unusually activist in pursuing its \nagenda. The Court has stricken acts of Congress, saying:\n\n       No Congressman or Senator purported to present a considered \n     judgment,\n\n  Or striking acts of Congress saying there was a:\n\n       lack of legislative attention to the statute at issue,\n\n  Or striking an act of Congress saying the legislation was:\n\n       * * * an unwarranted response to perhaps an inconsequential \n     problem,\n\n  Or declaring an act of Congress unconstitutional saying:\n\n       Congress had virtually no reason to believe [that the \n     statute was well founded.]\n\n  There is no effort here to challenge the authority of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States to have the final word. That has been \nestablished since Marbury v. Madison in 1803. I believe it is necessary \nthat the Supreme Court of the United States have the final word on \ninterpreting the Constitution and beyond that on saying what is a \nconstitutional question. But given the breadth of the Court's authority \nand given the sweeping scope of what the Court is doing, the point is \nthat there ought to be public knowledge and there ought to be a public \nresponse. Because I think it is fair to say that the Court is aware and \ndoes watch the public response, and it ought to really be a factor in \nwhatever the Court decides to do--again, recognizing that the Court has \nthe final say.\n\n  In June of 1999, the Supreme Court curtailed congressional authority \nin favor of the rights of States to sovereign immunity on patents and \ncopyrights, not withstanding the express constitutional grant of \nauthority to Congress to regulate patents and copyrights. Those cases \nled former Solicitor General Walter Dellinger, formerly a professor and \na leading constitutional scholar, to describe these cases as:\n\n       * * * one of the three or four major shifts in \n     constitutionalism we have seen in the last three centuries.\n\n  Those particular cases were subject to very substantial criticism by \nProfessor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, \ncommenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education v College Savings \nBank:\n\n       * * * the decision makes no sense,\n\n  Asserting that it arises from a:\n\n       * * * bizarre States' rights agenda that really has nothing \n     to do with intellectual property.\n\n  The Court's decisions have moved, as I have noted, really onto the \ncutting edge of so many of the critical issues which are matters of \ngreat national concern. The Court has decided issues from birth to \ndeath and the vital issues in between, making the decision on the \nconstitutional right to an abortion; making decisions on how the death \npenalty will be imposed; making decisions on the questions of freedom \nof religion, as illustrated by the case of City of Boerne v. Flores, \nwhere the Court struck down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n  Freedom of religion, of online speech, in Reno v. ACLU, the Court \nstruck down two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1998; \nPrince v. United States, the Court, by a 5-to-4 decision, reversed some \nsix decades of firmly established constitutional authority on the \nsupremacy of Federal laws over States under the commerce clause. And, \nin the Lopez case in 1995, the Supreme Court of the United\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nStates invalidated congressional authority, which had been intact for \nsome 60 years under the commerce clause.\n  So we have seen the expansion of the authority of the Supreme Court \nof the United States in so many lines, really, taking on the aura and \nthe perspective of a superlegislature.\n  Justice Felix Frankfurter perhaps anticipated the day when the \nSupreme Court arguments would be televised when he said that he longed \nfor a day when:\n\n       The news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly \n     as it did the World Series, since the public confidence in \n     the judiciary hinges on the public's perception of it, and \n     that perception necessarily hinges on the media's portrayal \n     of the legal system.\n\n  It is interesting to note that the columns of the Senate match up \nexactly with the columns of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  In the early deliberations on the Constitution, there were proposals \nthat Supreme Court Justices ought to be appointed by the Senate. I am \nnot sure quite how that would have worked out given our large groupings \nand how we would go about making those decisions, but that was once \nthought about.\n  There was a constitutional amendment proposed that would have allowed \nSupreme Court decisions to be overruled by a two-thirds vote of the \nSenate, a proposal which I think would have been very unwise and did \nnot get very far.\n  The Senate does have the constitutional authority on confirmation of \nSupreme Court Justices, perhaps our most important function as so many \nmajor decisions have been decided by a single vote on 5-4 decisions: 79 \nsuch decisions in the past 5 years; 20 such decisions in the last term \nof the Court.\n  The Court has been a strong point in our historical development, but \nas the Court has expanded into areas traditionally reserved for \nCongress, functioning virtually as a superlegislature, without in any \nway challenging the independence of the Court, the independence of the \nFederal judiciary, I do believe it is appropriate for the Congress to \nspeak on the operation of the Court.\n  The Congress has the authority to establish the number of Justices so \nthat if the Congress chose, we could expand the number beyond nine or \ncurtail it. The Congress has established the number six as a quorum for \nthe Court. The Congress has the authority to establish the jurisdiction \nof the Supreme Court of the United States and, in the landmark case of \nEx parte McCardle, decided that the jurisdiction of the Court could be \ncurtailed even on constitutional grounds. Frankly, I do not think that \n1868 decision would stand today as to the authority of the Congress to \ncurtail the jurisdiction of the Court on constitutional grounds, but \nduring confirmation proceedings when those questions are asked, the \nnominees choose to leave that as an open question. It does remain an \nopen question.\n  Televising, of course, is vastly different and a far range from the \nissue of jurisdiction. The Congress of the United States has \nestablished the time limits for Federal trials under the speedy trial \nlimit and has established time limits for consideration of habeas \ncorpus cases. So there is ample authority for the Congress to call for \nthe opening of the Supreme Court for television.\n  Obviously, there are issues of separation of power which I think this \nlegislation respects. Obviously, the final decision will be for the \nCourt. I do not expect a rush to judgment on this very complex \nproposition, but I do believe the day will come when the Supreme Court \nof the United States will be televised. That day will come, and it will \nbe decisively in the public interest so the public will know the \nmagnitude of what the Court is deciding and its role in our democratic \nprocess.\n  The public's interest would be significantly promoted by televising \nthe proceedings of the Supreme Court of the United States. Given the \nenormous importance of the decisions made by the Court, and the fact \nthat so many of these decisions are really public policy choices rather \nthan strictly legal decisions, the public deserves as much access as \npossible to the Court's proceedings.\n  This proposed legislation to televise sessions of the Supreme Court \nfully respects the authority of the Supreme Court to make the ultimate \ndecision on Constitutional questions. It seeks to impose greater \naccountability upon a body which decides so many matters of the \ngreatest importance to our country, often by a single vote.\n  In the normal course of events, the Supreme Court often renders \nopinions which, at their core, decide cutting-edge issues which are \nreally within the legislative domain under the Constitutional doctrine \nof Separation of Powers. In recent years the Supreme Court has \nexaggerated this policy role by explicitly substituting its judgment \nfor that of Congress and striking down legislation which it has found \nis not based upon a ``considered judgment.''\n  In our Constitutional scheme, who are the justices of the Supreme \nCourt to substitute their judgment for that of Congress on these issues \nof public policy? By what right do the Justices decide that Congress \nhas not exercised a ``considered judgment''? When it rules on this \nbasis, the Court goes far beyond its role as final Constitutional \narbiter and becomes a super legislature.\n  Senator Biden cogently addressed this issue in a July 26, 2000 floor \nstatement. After discussing a number of recent Supreme Court opinions \nin which the Court exceeded its authority to strike down laws passed by \nCongress, Senator Biden noted that:\n\n       It is crucial . . . that the American people understand the \n     larger pattern of the Supreme Court's recent decisions and . \n     . . the disturbing direction in which the Supreme Court is \n     moving because the consequences of these may well impact upon \n     the ability of American citizens to ask their elected \n     representatives in Congress to help them solve national \n     problems that have national impact. . . .\n       Make no mistake, what is at issue here is the question of \n     power . . . basically whether power will be exercised by an \n     insulated judiciary or by the elected representatives of the \n     people.\n\n  The public has a right to know how, why and what the Court is doing. \nIn particular, the deliberations of the Court should be open to the \nsunshine of public scrutiny. Television coverage would be a significant \nstep to provide a meaningful opportunity for public to observe and \nunderstand what the Court is doing.\n  Beyond educating the public, enhanced public scrutiny may very well \nhave the effect of discouraging judicial activism and overreaching. The \nexample of Justice Owen Roberts is instructive. In the mid-1930's, the \nSupreme Court struck down many significant pieces of New Deal \nlegislation by votes of 5 to 4. President Roosevelt went to great \nlengths to publicize this episode of judicial activism, culminating in \nhis infamous proposal to pack the Supreme Court by adding six new \nmembers. Notwithstanding FDR's enormous popularity, that proposal \nraised a storm of protest and failed. In the midst of that controversy, \na swing justice, Owen J. Roberts, shifted his position to support the \nNew Deal programs. Accordingly, a majority of the Court then supported \nand upheld New Deal legislation. Justice Robert's change in position \nled to the famous phrase, ``a switch in time saves nine.''\n  The current Court broke with sixty years of tradition in curtailing \nCongress's authority under the Commerce Clause in Lopez, which \ninvalidated Federal legislation creating gun-free school zones. In June \n1999 in three far-reaching decisions, the Supreme Court curtailed \nCongressional authority in favor of the right of states to sovereign \nimmunity on patent, copyright and other intellectual property \ninfringement matters. These cases are: College Savings Bank v. Florida \nPrepaid, 527 U.S. 666, Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, 527 \nU.S. 627, and Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706.\n  The June 1999 patent and copyright infringement cases have been \nroundly criticized by the academicians. Stanford University historian \nJack Rakove, author of ``Original Meanings'', a Pulitzer Prize winning \naccount of the drafting of the Constitution, characterizes Justice \nKennedy's historical argument in Alden v. Maine as ``strained, even \nsilly''.\n  Professor Rebecca Eisenberg of the University of Michigan Law School, \nin commenting on Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board \nvs. College Savings Bank, said:\n\n       ``The decision makes no sense'', asserting that it arises \n     from ``a bizarre states' rights agenda that really has \n     nothing to do with intellectual property.\n\n  Harvard Professor Laurence Tribe commented:\n\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\n\n       ``In the absence of even a textual hint in the \n     Constitution, the Court discerned from the constitutional \n     `ether' that states are immune from individual lawsuits.'' \n     (These decisions are) ``scary''. ``They treat states' rights \n     in a truly exaggerated way, harking back to what the country \n     looked like before the civil war and, in many ways, even \n     before the adoption of the Constitution.''\n\n  College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4375, Florida \nPrepaid v. College Savings Bank 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4376 and Alden v. \nMaine, 1999 U.S. LEXIS 4374.\n  In addition to treating the Congress with disdain, the five person \nmajority in all three cases demonstrated judicial activism and \nexhibited what can only be viewed as a political agenda in drastically \ndeparting from long-standing law. Former Solicitor General Walter \nDellinger described these cases as:\n\n     ``one of the three or four major shifts in constitutionalism \n     we've seen in two centuries.''\n\n  A commentary in the Economist on July 3, 1999 emphasized the Court's \nradical departure from existing law stating:\n\n       ``The Court's majority has embarked on a venture as \n     detached from any constitutional moorings as was the liberal \n     Warren Court of the 1960's in its most activist mood.''\n\n  In its two opinions in College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid and \nFlorida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, the Court held that the \ndoctrine of sovereign immunity prevents states from being sued in \nFederal court for infringing intellectual property rights. These \ndecisions leave us with an absurd and untenable state of affairs. \nThrough their state-owned universities and hospitals, states \nparticipate in the intellectual property marketplace as equals with \nprivate companies. The University of Florida, for example, owns more \nthan 200 patents. Furthermore, state entities such as universities are \nmajor consumers of intellectual property and often violate intellectual \nproperty laws when, for example, they copy textbooks without proper \nauthorization.\n  But now, Florida and all other states will enjoy an enormous \nadvantage over their private sector competitors--they will be immune \nfrom being sued for intellectual property infringement. Since patent \nand copyright infringement are exclusively Federal causes of action, \nand trademark infringement is largely Federal, the inability to sue in \nFederal court is, practically speaking, a bar to any redress at all.\n  The right of states to sovereign immunity from most Federal lawsuits \nis guaranteed in the Eleventh Amendment to the constitution, which \nprovides that:\n\n       The Judicial Power of the United States shall not be \n     construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced \n     or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of \n     another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any foreign \n     state.\n\n  It has long been recognized, however, that this immunity from suit is \nnot absolute. As the Supreme Court noted in one of the Florida Prepaid \nopinions, the Court has recognized two circumstances in which an \nindividual may sue a state:\n\n       First, Congress may authorize such a suit in the exercise \n     of its power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment--an \n     Amendment enacted after the Eleventh Amendment and \n     specifically designed to alter the federal-state balance. \n     Secondly, a state may waive its sovereign immunity by \n     consenting to suit. College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid \n     at 7.\n\n  Congress' power to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment is contained in \nSection Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, which provides that ``The \nCongress shall have the power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, \nthe provisions of this article.'' One of the provisions of the \nFourteenth Amendment, Section One, provides that no State shall, \n``deprive any person of . . . property . . . without due process of \nlaw.'' Accordingly, Congress has the power to pass laws to enforce the \nrights of citizens not to be deprived of their property--including \ntheir intellectual property--without due process of law.\n  Employing this power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, \nCongress passed the Patent Remedy Act and the Trademark Remedy \nClarification Act in 1992. As its preamble states, Congress passed the \nPatent Remedy Act to ``clarify that States . . . are subject to suit in \nFederal court by any person for infringement of patents and plant \nvariety protections.'' Congress passed the Trademark Remedy \nClarification Act to subject the States to suits brought under Sec. 43 \nof the Trademark Act of 1946 for false and misleading advertising.\n  In Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank, the Court held in a 5 to \n4 opinion that Congress did not validly abrogate state sovereign \nimmunity from patent infringement suits when it passed the Patent \nRemedy Act. In an opinion by Chief Justice Rehnquist, the Court \nreasoned that in order to determine whether a Congressional enactment \nvalidly abrogates the States' sovereign immunity, two questions must be \nanswered, ``first, whether Congress has unequivocally expressed its \nintent to abrogate the immunity . . . and second whether Congress has \nacted pursuant to a valid exercise of power.''\n  The Court acknowledged that in enacting the Patent Remedy Act, \nCongress made its intention to abrogate the States' immunity \nunmistakably clear in the language of the statute. The Court then held, \nhowever, that Congress had not acted pursuant to a valid exercise of \npower when it passed the Patent Remedy Act. The Court wrote that \nCongress' enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment is \n``remedial'' in nature. Therefore, ``for Congress to invoke Section 5 \nit must identify conduct transgressing the Fourteenth Amendment's \nsubstantive provisions, and must tailor its legislative scheme to \nremedy or preventing such conduct.'' Florida Prepaid v. College Savings \nBank at 20.\n  The Court found that Congress failed to identify a pattern of patent \ninfringement by the States, let alone a pattern of constitutional \nviolations. The Court specifically noted that a deprivation of property \nwithout due process could occur only where the State provides \ninadequate remedies to injured patent owners. The Court then observed \nthat:\n\n       Congress, however, barely considered the availability of \n     state remedies for patent infringement and hence whether the \n     States' conduct might have amounted to a constitutional \n     violation under the Fourteenth Amendment. . . . Congress \n     itself said nothing about the existence or adequacy of state \n     remedies in the statute or in the Senate Report, and made \n     only a few fleeting references to state remedies in the House \n     Report, essentially repeating the testimony of the witnesses. \n     Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank at 27-28.\n\n  Accordingly, the Court concluded that:\n\n       The legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy \n     Act does not respond to a history of widespread and \n     persisting deprivation of constitutional rights of the sort \n     Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic Section 5 \n     legislation. Instead, Congress appears to have enacted this \n     legislation in response to a handful of instances of state \n     patent infringement that do not necessarily violate the \n     Constitution. Florida Prepaid v. College Savings Bank at 31-\n     32.\n\n  Not only is the result of this opinion troubling--that states will \nenjoy immunity from suit--but also by the reasoning which supports this \nresult. Here we have a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court choosing to \nignore an act of Congress because he has concluded that Congress passed \nthe legislation with insufficient justification. In essence, the Chief \nJustice is telling us we did a poor job developing our record before \npassing the Patent Remedy Act. As we all know, however, many of us \nsupport legislation for reasons that don't make it into the written \nrecord. The record is an important, but imperfect, summary of our \nviews. This is why past Courts have been reluctant to discuss \nCongressional motives in this fashion.\n\n  In College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid, the Supreme Court decided \nin a 5 to 4 opinion that Trademark Remedy Clarification Act (the \n``TRCA'') was not a valid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The \nCourt, in an opinion by Justice Scalia, noted that Congress passed the \nTRCA to remedy and prevent state deprivations of two types of property \nrights: (1) a right to be free from a business competitor's false \nadvertising about its own product, and (2) a more generalized right to \nbe secure in one's business interests. The Court contrasted these \nrights with the hallmarks of a protected property interest, namely the \nright to exclude others.\n  Justice Scalia reached the surprising conclusion that protection \nagainst false advertising secured by Section 43(a) of the Lanham Act \ndoes not implicate property rights protected by the due process clause \nso that Congress could not rely on its remedies under Section 5 of the \n14th Amendment to abrogate state sovereign immunity. If\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\nconducting a legitimate business operation with protection from false \nadvertising is not a ``property right'', it is hard to conceive of what \nis business property. That Scalia rationale shows the extent to which \nthe Court has gone to invalidate Congressional enactments.\n  The Court then discussed whether Florida's sovereign immunity, though \nnot abrogated, was voluntarily waived. Here, the Court expressly \noverruled its prior decision in Parden v. Terminal R. Co. 377 U.S. 184 \n(1964) and held that there was no voluntary waiver. In Parden, the \nCourt had created the doctrine of constructive waiver, which held that \na state could be found to have waived its immunity to suit by engaging \nin certain activities, such as voluntary participation in the conduct \nCongress has sought to regulate. Since Congress has sought to regulate \ninterstate commerce, then a state which participated in interstate \ncommerce by registering and licensing patents would be held to have \nvoluntarily waived its immunity to a patent infringement suit. By \noverruling Parden, however, the Court held that a voluntary waiver of \nsovereign immunity must be express. Florida made no such express waiver \nof its sovereign immunity.\n  In other relatively recent cases, the Court has gone out of its way, \nalmost on a personal basis, to chastise and undercut Congress. The case \nof Sable v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989) provides a striking example of \nthis trend. In Sable, the Court struck down a ban on ``indecent'' \ninterstate telephone communications passed by Congress in 1988. In \nrejecting this provision, the Court focused on whether there were \nconstitutionally acceptable less restrictive means, short of a total \nban, to achieve its goal of protecting minors. The Court then declared, \nin unusually dismissive and critical language, that Congress has not \nsufficiently considered this issue:\n\n     aside from conclusory statements during the debates by \n     proponents of the bill . . . that under the FCC regulations \n     minors could still have access to dial-a-porn messages, the \n     congressional record presented to us contains no evidence as \n     to how effective or ineffective the FCC's most recent \n     regulations were or might prove to be.\n       The bill that was enacted . . . was introduced on the \n     floor. . . . No Congressman or Senator purported to present a \n     considered judgement with respect to how often or to what \n     extent minors could or would circumvent the rules and have \n     access to dial-a-porn messages. (Emphasis Added)\n\n  If a member of the Congress made a judgment, by what authority does \nthe Supreme Court superimpose its view that it wasn't a ``considered \njudgment''? A fair reading of the statements from the floor debate on \nthis issue undercuts the Court's disparaging characterization of this \ndebate. For example, Representative Tom Bliley of Virginia gave a \nrather detailed and persuasive discussion of how he concluded that a \nlegislative ban was necessary. Mr. Bliley noted that in 1983, Congress \nfirst passed legislation which required the FCC to report regulations \ndescribing methods by which dial-a-porn providers could screen out \nunderage callers. Mr. Bliley then walks us through the repeated failure \nof the FCC to pass regulations which could withstand judicial scrutiny. \nFinally Mr. Bliley notes that:\n\n     it has become clear that there was not a technological \n     solution that would adequately and effectively protect our \n     children from the effect of this material. We looked for \n     effective alternatives to a ban--there were none.\n\n  The Court repeats its critique of Congressional action in the case of \nReno v. ACLU, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Here, the Court struck down the \nCommunications Decency Act, which prohibited transmission to minors of \n``indecent'' or ``patently offensive'' communications. In this opinion, \nthe Court again discusses whether less restrictive means were available \nand again concludes that Congress had not sufficiently addressed the \nissue. The opinion notes that:\n\n       The Communications Decency Act contains provisions that \n     were either added in executive committee after the hearings \n     [on the Telecom Act] were concluded or as amendments offered \n     during floor debate on the legislation. . . . No hearings \n     were held on the provisions that became the law.\n\n  The Court in Reno later notes that, ``The lack of legislative \nattention to the statute at issue in Sable suggests another parallel \nwith this case.'' (Emphasis Added)\n  Once again, if Congress passes a law, by what authority does the \nSupreme Court conclude that we did not devote sufficient legislative \nattention to the law? In the Reno opinion itself the Court noted that \nsome Members of the House of Representatives opposed the Communications \nDecency Act because they thought that less restrictive screening \ndevices would work. These members offered an amendment intended as a \nsubstitute for the Communications Decency Act, but instead saw their \nprovision accepted as an additional section of the Act. In light of \nthis record, how can the Court say that Congress did not consider less \nrestrictive means?\n  Most recently, in its January, 2000, opinion in Kimel v. Florida \nBoard of Regents, 528 U.S. 62, the Supreme court once again took aim at \nCongress' judgment. In Kimel, the Court held that a 1974 amendment to \nthe Age Discrimination in Employment Act (the ``ADEA'') to extend its \napplication to discrimination by state and local governments was not a \nvalid abrogation of state sovereign immunity. The Court rejected \nCongress' action in truly dismissive tones:\n\n       Our examination of the ADEA's legislative record confirms \n     that Congress' 1974 extension of the Act to the States was an \n     unwarranted response to a perhaps inconsequential problem. \n     Congress never identified any pattern of age discrimination \n     by the States, much less any discrimination whatsoever that \n     rose to the level of constitutional violation. * * * \n     (Emphasis Added)\n       A review of the ADEA's legislative record as a whole * * * \n     reveals that Congress had virtually no reason to believe that \n     state and local governments were unconstitutionally \n     discriminating against their employees on the basis of age. \n     Congress' failure to uncover any significant pattern of \n     unconstitutional discrimination here confirms that Congress \n     had no reason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation \n     was necessary in this field. Kimel at (Emphasis Added)\n\n  Almost every member of Congress had had close working relationships \nwith employees of the state and local governments back home, and all \nmembers of Congress meet state and local government employees when they \nare back in their states or districts. In fact, many members of \nCongress were once themselves state employees. Congress is therefore in \na very good position to know that age discrimination by the states is \nnot an ``inconsequential'' problem. In fact, the absence of an in-depth \ndebate on this topic likely reflects the fact that this proposition \nthat state and local governments discriminate on the basis of age was \nnon-controversial. The Supreme Courts failure to defer to Congress' \nexperience on this issue and its jaundiced reading of the record are \ntroubling.\n  While numerous other instances of judicial activism may be cited, the \ndecisions during Chief Justice Warren's tenure from 1953 through 1969 \nare illustrative. While few, if any at this late date, would disagree \nwith the Warren Court's decision holding segregation unconstitutional \nin Brown v. Board of Education, it was a clear-cut case of judicial \nactivism overturning Pleassey v. Ferguson since neither the legislative \nnor executive branches of the federal or state governments would \ncorrect those rank injustices.\n  The Warren Court significantly expanded the interpretation of the due \nprocess clause of the 14th Amendment to add Constitutional rights to \ncriminal defendants in state court cases. In Mapp v. Ohio, the Court \nrule that unconstitutionally seized evidence could not be introduced in \na state criminal proceeding. In Gideon v. Wainwright, the Supreme Court \nrequired that the State provide a defendant a lawyer when ``hailed'' \ninto criminal court. Miranda v. Arizona, perhaps the Court's most \nfamous opinion, rule out a defendant's confession or statement unless \nfive specific warnings were given by police and waivers obtained from \nthe defendant before incriminating statements could be introduced \nagainst him/her in state court proceedings.\n  Another era of judicial activism occurred in the mid-1930's. During \nthis period, the Supreme Court embarked on a very different activist \nagenda by striking down many of the core laws passed as part of \nPresident Roosevelt's New Deal. In the 1935 case of A.L.A. Schecter \nPoultry Corp. v. United States, the Supreme Court struck down the \nNational Industrial Recovery Act on the grounds that it exceeded \nCongress' power under the Commerce Clause. Also in 1935, in Railroad \nRetirement Board v. Alton R.R., the Supreme\n\n[[Page S8946]]\n\nCourt struck down the Railroad Retirement Act on the same Commerce \nClause grounds. In the 1936 case of United States v. Butler, the \nSupreme Court struck down the agricultural Adjustment Act on the \ngrounds that it sought to regulate a subject--the production of daily \nproducts--prohibited to Federal government under the 10th Amendment. \nAlso in 1936, in Carter v. Carter Coal Co., the Court struck down the \nBituminous Coal Conservation Act on the same 10th Amendment grounds.\n  These decisions, led to the infamous proposal to pack the Supreme \nCourt by adding six new members. Notwithstanding FDR's enormous \npopularity, that proposal raised a storm of protest and failed.\n  Televised court proceedings better enable the public to understand \nthe role of the Supreme Court and its impact on the key decisions of \nthe day. Not only has the Supreme Court invalidated Congressional \ndecisions where there is, in the views of many, simply a difference of \nopinion to what is preferable public policy, but the Court determines \navant-garde issues such as whether aids is a disability under the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, whether Congress can ban obscenity \nfrom the Internet, and whether states can impose term limits upon \nmembers of Congress. Just this past term, the Court addressed whether \nthe FDA has the authority to regulate tobacco products as a drug and \nwhether states can ban partial birth abortion.\n  The current Court, like its predecessors, hands down decisions which \nvitally affect the lives of all Americans. Since the Court's 1803 \nhistoric decision in Marbury v. Madison, the Supreme Court has the \nfinal authority on issues of enormous importance from birth to death. \nIn Roe v. Wade (1973), the Court affirmed a Constitutional right to \nabortion in this country and struck down state statutes banning or \nseverely restricting abortion during the first two trimesters on the \ngrounds that they violated a right to privacy inherent in the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the case of Washington \nv. Glucksberg (1997), the court refused to create a similar right to \nassisted suicide. Here the Court held that the Due Process Clause does \nnot recognize a liberty interest that includes a right to commit \nsuicide with another's assistance.\n  In the Seventies, the Court first struck down then upheld state \nstatutes imposing the death penalty for certain crimes. In Furman v. \nGeorgia (1972), the Court struck down Georgia's death penalty statute \nunder the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment \nand stated that no death penalty law could pass constitutional muster \nunless it took aggravating and mitigating circumstances into account. \nThis decision lead Georgia and many states to amend their death penalty \nstatutes and, four years later, in Gregg v. Georgia (1976), the Supreme \nCourt upheld Georgia's amended death penalty statute.\n  Over the years, the Court has also played a major role in issues of \nwar and peace. In its opinion in Scott v. Sanford (1857)--better known \nas the Dredd Scott decision--the Supreme Court held that Dredd Scott, a \nslave who had been taken into ``free'' territory by his owner, was \nnevertheless still a slave. The Court further held that Congress lacked \nthe power to abolish slavery in certain territories, thereby \ninvalidating the careful balance that had been worked out between the \nNorth and the South on the issue. Historians have noted that this \nopinion fanned the flames that led to the Civil War.\n  More recently, the Supreme Court played an important role during the \nVietnam War. Prominent opponents of the war repeatedly petitioned the \nCourt to declare the Presidential action unconstitutional on the \ngrounds that Congress had never given the President a declaration of \nwar. The Court decided to leave this conflict in the political arena \nand repeatedly refused to grant writs of certiorari to hear these \ncases. This prompted Justices Douglas, sometimes accompanied by \nJustices Stewart and Harlan, to take the unusual step of writing \nlengthy dissents to the denials of cert.\n  In New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)--the so called \n``Pentagon Papers'' case--the Court refused to grant the government \nprior restraint to prevent the New York Times from publishing leaked \nDefense Department documents which revealed damaging information about \nthe Johnson Administration and the war effort. The publication of these \ndocuments by the New York Times is believed to have helped move public \nopinion against the war.\n  In its landmark civil rights opinions, the Supreme Court took the \nlead in effecting needed social change, helping us to address \nfundamental questions about our society in the courts rather than in \nthe streets. In Brown v. Board of Education, the Court struck down the \nprinciple of ``separate but equal'' education for blacks and whites and \nintegrated public education in this country. This case was followed by \na series of civil rights cases which enforced the concept of \nintegration and full equality for all citizens of this country, \nincluding Garner v. Louisiana (1961), Burton v. Wilmington Parking \nAuthority (1961), and Peterson v. City of Greenville (1963).\n  When deciding issues of such great national import, the Supreme Court \nis rarely unanimous. In fact, a large number of seminal Supreme Court \ndecisions have been made by a vote of 5-4. Such a close margin reveals \nthat these decisions are far from foregone conclusions distilled from \nthe clear meaning of the Constitution and legal precedents. On the \ncontrary, these major Supreme Court opinions are really policy \ndecisions reached on the basis of the preferences and views of each \nindividual justice. In a case that is decided by a vote of 5-4, \nindividual justices have the power by his or her vote to change the law \nof the land.\n  Given the enormous significance of each vote cast by each justice on \nthe Supreme Court, it is important that each justice know that they \nwill be held accountable for their vote. Televising the proceedings of \nthe Supreme Court will allow the sunlight to shine brightly on these \nproceedings and ensure greater accountability.\n  The following are just a handful of examples of major 5-4 decisions \nhanded down by the Supreme Court this century:\n  Lochner v. New York (1905). The Court struck down an early attempt at \nlabor regulation by holding that a law limiting bakers to a sixty-hour \nwork week violated the liberty of contract secured by the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918). The Court again struck down a labor law, \nthis time the Keating-Own Federal Child Labor Act, on the grounds that \nCommerce Clause did not give Congress the power to completely forbid \ncertain categories of commerce.\n  Furman v. Georgia (1972). The Court struck down the death penalty \nunder the cruel and unusual punishment clause of the Eighth Amendment.\n  Plyer v. Doe (1982). The Court invoked the Equal Protection Clause of \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to strike down a Texas statute which denied \nstate funding for the education of illegal immigrant children.\n\n  Webster v. Reproductive Health Services (1989). In this case, which \nhas been widely viewed as a retreat from Roe v. Wade, the Court upheld \nvarious restrictions on the availability of abortion including a ban on \nthe use of public funds and facilities for abortions.\n  United States v. Eichman (1990). The Court invalidated state and \nFederal laws prohibiting flag desecration on the grounds that they \nviolated the First Amendment.\n  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena (1995). The Court held that \nFederal racial classifications, like those of a state, must be reviewed \nunder a strict scrutiny standard.\n  U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton (1995). The Court struck down a state \nlaw imposing term limits upon Members of Congress on the grounds that \nstates have no authority to change, add to, or diminish the age, \ncitizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service \nenumerated in the Qualifications Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  During the past five years alone, there have been eighty 5 to 4 \nSupreme Court decisions. Out of the 79 cases decided in the Court's \nmost recent term, 20 were decided by a single justice on a 5 to 4 vote. \nThe following are some of the important decisions handed down by the \nCourt in its last few sessions that were decided by a 5 to 4 vote:\n  Tobacco regulation. In FDA v. Brown and Williamson Tobacco \nCorporation, the Court ruled that the FDA lacks authority under the \nFederal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to regulate tobacco \nproducts.\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\n  Abortion. In Stenberg v. Carhart, the Court ruled that Nebraska's \nstatute criminalizing the performance of ``partial birth abortions'' is \nunconstitutional under principles set forth in Roe v. Wade (1973) and \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey (1992).\n  Violence Against Women Act. In United States v. Morrison, the Court \nstruck down a key provision of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act \n(VAWA) that allowed victims of gender-motivated violence to bring \nprivate civil lawsuits against the perpetrators in federal court. The \nSupreme Court said that Congress, in enacting the VAWA provision, \noverstepped its authority to regulate interstate commerce and enforce \nthe Constitution's equal-protection guarantee.\n  HIV infection. In Bragdon v. Abbott, the Court ruled that HIV \ninfection is a ``disability'' as defined by the American with \nDisabilities Act, even if the person who has tested positive for HIV is \nasymptomatic.\n  Fourth Amendment. In Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole v. \nScott, the Court limited the exclusionary rule by holding that it does \nnot apply in parole revocation hearings.\n  Freedom of Religion. In City of Boerne v. Flores, the Court struck \ndown the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (``RFRA'') on the grounds \nthat it exceeded Congressional power under Section 5 of the Fourteenth \nAmendment. RFRA had provided that governments can infringe upon \nreligious practices only if they have health, safety or other \n``compelling interest'' in doing so.\n  Freedom of Speech Online. In Reno v. ACLU, the Court struck down two \nprovisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 prohibiting \ntransmission of obscene and indecent messages to minors on the grounds \nthat they violated the First Amendment.\n  In Printz v. United States, the Court voted 5 to 4 to reverse six \ndecades of firmly established constitutional authority on the supremacy \nof federal laws over states rights under the Commerce Clause. \nSpecifically, the Court held unconstitutional the provisions of the \nBrady Bill that require state and local law enforcement officers to \nconduct background checks on prospective handgun purchasers.\n  In Agostini v. Felton, the Court voted to lower the barrier between \nchurch and state by holding that the Establishment Clause of the First \nAmendment does not bar use of public school teachers to provide \nremedial education to disadvantaged children in parochial schools.\n  In Raines v. Byrd, the Court ruled that our colleagues, Senators \nByrd, Levin, Moynihan, and Hatfield, lacked standing to challenge the \nconstitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act since they failed to \nestablish a particularized personal injury. The Court's rejection of an \n``institutional injury'' to Congress as a basis for standing \nsignificantly limits the ability of legislators to raise constitutional \nchallenges to legislation in the courts.\n  Cameras Should be allowed in the Supreme Court on Basic Public Policy \nand Constitutional Grounds.\n  Given the awesome national significance of the decisions made by the \nSupreme Court, the right of the public to view the process by which \nthese decisions are made is self evident. In a democracy, the workings \nof the government at all levels should be open to public view. The more \nopenness, and the more real the opportunity for public observation, the \ngreater the understanding and trust. As the Supreme Court noted in the \n1986 case of Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, ``People in an \nopen society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but \nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from \nobserving.''\n  It was in this spirit that the House of Representatives opened its \ndeliberations to meaningful public observation by allowing C-Span to \nbegin televising debates in the House chamber in 1979. The Senate \nfollowed the House's lead in 1986 by voting to allow television \ncoverage of the Senate floor.\n\n  Beyond this general policy preference for openness, however, there is \na strong argument that the Constitution requires that television \ncameras be permitted in the Supreme Court.\n  It is well established that the Constitution guarantees access to \njudicial proceedings to the press and the public. In 1980, the Supreme \nCourt relied on this tradition when it held in Richmond Newspapers v. \nVirginia that the right of a public trial belongs not just to the \naccused, but to the public and the press as well. The Court noted that \nsuch openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable attribute \nof an Anglo-American trial.''\n  Recognizing that in modern society most people cannot physically \nattend trials, the Court specifically addressed the need for access by \nmembers of the media:\n\n       Instead of acquiring information about trials by first hand \n     observation or by word of mouth from those who attended, \n     people now acquire it chiefly through the print and \n     electronic media. [emphasis added] In a sense, this validates \n     the media claim of acting as surrogates for the public. \n     [Media presence] contributes to public understanding of the \n     rule of law and to comprehension of the functioning of the \n     entire criminal justice system.\n\n  Today, television is the means by which most Americans get their \ninformation. To exclude television cameras from the court is to \neffectively prevent large segments of American society from ever \nwitnessing what transpires therein. Furthermore, television provides a \nlevel of access to courtroom proceedings far closer to the ideal of \nactual attendance in the court than either newspapers or photographs \ncan provide.\n  In addition, a strong argument can be made that forbidding television \ncameras in the court, while permitting access to print and other media, \nconstitutes an impermissible discrimination against one type of media \nin contravention of the First Amendment. In recent years, the Supreme \nCourt and lower courts have repeatedly held that differential treatment \nof different media is impermissible under the First Amendment absent an \noverriding governmental interest. For example, in 1983 the Court \ninvalidated discriminatory tax schemes imposed only upon certain types \nof media in Minneapolis Star & Tribune Co. v. Minnesota commissioner of \nRevenue. In the 1977 case of ABC v. Cuomo, the Second Circuit rejected \nthe contention by the two candidates for mayor of New York that they \ncould exclude some members of the media from their campaign \nheadquarters by providing access through invitation only. The Court \nwrote that:\n\n       Once there is a public function, public comment, and \n     participation by some of the media, the First Amendment \n     requires equal access to all of the media or the rights of \n     the First Amendment would no longer be tenable.\n\n  In the 1965 case of Estes v. Texas, the Supreme Court rejected the \nargument that the denial of television coverage of trials violates the \nequal protection clause. In the same opinion, the Court held that the \npresence of television cameras in the Court had violated a Texas \ndefendant's right to due process. Subsequent opinions have cast serious \ndoubt upon the continuing relevance of both prongs of the Estes \nopinion.\n  In its 1981 opinion in Chandler v. Florida, discussed above, the \ncourt recognized that Estes must be read narrowly in light of the state \nof television technology at that time. The television coverage of \nEstes' 1962 trial required cumbersome equipment, numerous additional \nmicrophones, yards of new cables, distracting lighting, and numerous \ntechnicians present in the courtroom. In contrast, the court noted, \ntelevision coverage in 1980 can be achieved through the presence of one \nor two discreetly placed cameras without making any perceptible change \nin the atmosphere of the courtroom. Accordingly, the Court held that, \ndespite Estes, the presence of television cameras in a Florida trial \nwas not a violation of the rights of the defendants in that case. By \nthe same logic, the holding in Estes that exclusion of television \ncameras from the courts did not violate the equal protection clause \nmust be revisited in light of the dramatically different nature of \ntelevision coverage today.\n  Given the strength of these arguments, it is not surprising that over \nthe last two decades there has been a rapidly growing acceptance of \ncameras in American courtrooms which has reached almost every court \nexcept for the Supreme Court itself. Ironically, it was a Supreme Court \ndecision which helped spur the spread of television cameras in the \ncourts. In 1981, in the case of Chandler v. Florida, the Supreme Court \ndecided that televising\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\ncriminal proceedings did not inherently interfere with a criminal \ndefendant's constitutional right to a fair trial, and that there was no \nempirical evidence to support a claim that it did. Shortly after the \nChandler decision, the American Bar Association revised its canons to \npermit judges to authorize televising civil and criminal proceedings in \ntheir courts.\n  Following the green lights provided by the Supreme Court and the ABA, \nforty-seven states have decided to permit electronic coverage of at \nleast some portion of their judicial proceedings. In 1990, the federal \nJudicial Conference authorized a three-year pilot program allowing \ntelevision coverage of civil proceedings in six federal district courts \nand two federal circuit courts. The program began in July, 1991 and ran \nthrough December 31, 1994. The Federal Judicial Center monitored the \nprogram and issued a positive final evaluation. In particular, the \nJudicial Center concluded that:\n\n       Overall, attitudes of judges toward electronic media \n     coverage of civil proceedings were initially neutral and \n     became more favorable after experience under the pilot \n     program.\n\n  The Judicial Center also concluded that:\n\n       Judges and attorneys who had experience with electronic \n     media coverage under the program generally reported observing \n     small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the \n     proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of \n     justice.\n\n  Despite this positive evaluation, the Judicial Conference voted in \nSeptember, 1994, to end the experiment and not to extend the camera \ncoverage to all courts. This decision was made in the aftermath of the \ninitial burst of television coverage of O.J. Simpson's pretrial \nhearing. Some have argued that the decision was unduly influenced by \nthis outside event.\n  In March, 1996, the Judicial Conference revisited the issue of \ntelevision cameras in the federal courts and voted to permit each \nfederal court of appeals to ``decide for itself whether to permit the \ntaking of photographs and radio and television coverage of appellate \narguments.'' Since that time, two circuit courts have enacted rules \npermitting television coverage of their arguments. It is significant to \nnote that these two circuits were the two circuits which participated \nin the federal experiment with television cameras a few years earlier. \nIt seems that once judges have an experience with cameras in their \ncourtroom, they no longer oppose the idea.\n  On September 6, 2000, the Senate Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts held a hearing on ``Allowing \nCameras and Electronic Media in the Courtroom.'' The primary focus of \nthe hearing was Senate bill 721, legislation introduced by Senators \nGrassley and Schumer that would give federal judges the discretion to \nallow television coverage of court proceedings. One of the witnesses at \nthe hearing, Judge Edward Becker, Chief Judge U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Third Circuit, spoke in opposition to the legislation and the \npresence of television cameras in the courtroom. The remaining five \nwitnesses, however, including a federal judge, a state judge, a law \nprofessor and other legal experts, all testified in favor of the \nlegislation. They argued that cameras in the courts would not disrupt \nproceedings but would provide the kind of accountability and access \nthat is fundamental to our system of government.\n  In my judgment, Congress, with the concurrence of the President, or \noverriding his veto, has the authority to require the Supreme Court to \ntelevise its proceedings. Such a conclusion is not free from doubt and \nis highly likely to be tested with the Supreme Court, as usual, having \nthe final word. As I see it, there is no constitutional prohibition \nagainst such legislation.\n  Article 3 of the Constitution states that the judicial power of the \nUnited States shall be vested ``in one Supreme Court and such inferior \nCourts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.'' \nWhile the Constitution specifically creates the Supreme Court, however, \nit left it to Congress to determine how the Court would operate. For \nexample, it was congress that fixed the number of justices on the \nSupreme Court at nine. Likewise, it was Congress that decided that any \nsix of these justices are sufficient to constitute a quorum of the \nCourt. It was Congress that decided that the term of the Court shall \ncommence on the first Monday in October of each year, and it was \nCongress that determined the procedures to be followed whenever the \nChief Justice is unable to perform the duties of his office.\n  Beyond such basic structural and operational matters, Congress also \ncontrols more substantive aspects of the Supreme Court. Most \nimportantly, it is Congress that in effect determines the appellate \njurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Although the Constitution itself \nsets out the appellate jurisdiction of the Court, it provides that such \njurisdiction exists ``with such exceptions and under such regulations \nas the Congress shall make.'' In the early days of the Supreme Court, \nChief Justice Marshall, writing for the Court in Durousseau v. United \nStates, recognized that the power to make exceptions to the Court's \njurisdiction is the equivalent of the power to grant jurisdiction, \nsince exceptions can be ``implied from the intent manifested by the \naffirmative description [of jurisdiction].''\n  the Supreme Court recognized the power of Congress to control its \nappellate jurisdiction in a dramatic way in the famous 1868 case of Ex \nParte McCardle. In this case, McCardle, a newspaper editor, was being \nheld in custody by the military for trial on charges stemming from the \npublication of articles alleged to be libelous and incendiary. McCardle \npetitioned the Supreme Court for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court \nheard his case but, before it rendered its opinion, Congress repealed \nthe statute that gave the Supreme Court jurisdiction to hear the habeas \nappeal. In light of this Congressional action, the Supreme Court felt \ncompelled to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n  Congress also exercises broad and significant control over the timing \nwithin which federal courts must act. For example, Congress passed the \nSpeedy Trial Act to quantify an individual's Sixth Amendment right to a \nspeedy trial. Specifically, the Act requires that an individual \narrested for a criminal offense be indicted within thirty days of \narrest and be brought to trial within seventy days of an indictment.\n  Likewise, the habeas corpus reform I authored, which became law as \npart of the comprehensive anti-terrorism act of 1996, imposes strict \ntimetables upon the filing and review of habeas corpus petitions and \nappeals. For example, in the case of both death row inmates and other \nprisoners, the Act establishes a one-year deadline within which state \nand federal prisoners must file their federal habeas petitions. In \ncapital cases, the Act requires a district court to render a final \ndetermination of a habeas petition not later than 180 days after the \ndate on which it is filed, and it requires a court of appeals to hear \nand render a final determination of any appeal of an order granting or \ndenying such petition within 120 days after the date on which the reply \nbrief is filed.\n  Some objections have been raised to televised proceedings of the \nSupreme Court on the ground that it would subject justices to undue \nsecurity risks. My own view is such concerns are vastly overstated. \nWell-known members of Congress, including such high profile \npersonalities as Senator Ted Kennedy, walk on a regular basis in public \nview in the Capitol complex. Other very well-known personalities, \npresidents, vice presidents, cabinet officers, all are on public view \nwith even incumbent presidents exposed to risks as they mingle with the \npublic. Such risks are minimal and, in my view, are worth the \nrelatively minor exposure that Supreme Court justices would undertake \nthrough television appearances.\n  The Supreme Court could, of course, permit television through its own \nrule but has decided not to do so. Congress should be circumspect and \neven hesitant to impose a rule mandating the televising of Supreme \nCourt proceedings and should do so only in the face of compelling \npublic policy reasons. The Supreme Court has such a dominant role in \nkey decision-making functions that their proceedings ought to be better \nknown to the public; and, in the absence of Court rule, public policy \nwould be best served by enactment of legislation requiring the \ntelevising of Supreme Court proceedings.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. Durbin):\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\n  S. 3087. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nsimplify the individual income tax by providing an election for \neligible individuals to only be subject to a 15 percent tax on wage \nincome with a tax return free filing system, to reduce the burdens of \nthe marriage penalty and alternative minimum tax, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 the fair and simple shortcut tax plan\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, for all the talk about taxes in this \nchamber, we often overlook one of the worst burdens of the current tax \nsystem. I'm talking about the monumental hassle that taxpayers face to \nfile their tax returns each year.\n  It is simply inexcusable that Congress has made it so expensive and \ncomplex for Americans to fulfill this basic civic duty. Taxpayers will \nprobably spend somewhere around three billion hours and at least $75 \nbillion next year in the effort to meet their federal income tax \nobligations. It's no wonder they barrage congressional offices with \nletters each spring imploring us to simplify the Tax Code.\n  They are right. Each little provision in the tax code has a \njustification, but together they add up to a big headache for the \nAmerican taxpayer. We can't blame the IRS for the misery endured this \npast year or in the years ahead. There's no way to truly simplify tax \nday unless Congress changes the underlying law.\n  That's why I'm pleased to be joined by Senators Gregg and Durbin in \nintroducing a tax reform proposal that we call the ``Fair and Simple \nShortcut Tax'' (FASST) plan. Our plan would give most taxpayers the \nopportunity to pay their federal income taxes without having to prepare \na tax return if they so choose. Some thirty countries already enable \ntheir citizens to pay their federal taxes in this way. We believe tax \nsimplification along these lines can work in this country, too. Our \napproach would also be less costly than other major tax simplification \nplans that have been proposed in Congress in the past several years.\n  Our bill is based on a principle that both sides of the aisle \ngenerally are eager to espouse--namely, choice. The bill would allow \ntaxpayers to choose to pay their taxes without complexity, paperwork \nand hassle. Those who prefer to use the current system, with its \ncomplexity and expenses, could do so if they wanted. But if they want \nsomething simpler, they could choose that instead.\n  Under FASST, most taxpayers could forget about filing a federal tax \nreturn on April 15th. Instead, their entire income tax liability would \nbe withheld at work. There would be no more deciphering statements from \nmutual funds, no more frantic search for records and receipts, and no \nlast minute dash to the Post Office in order to meet the midnight \ndeadline. According to Treasury Department officials who have studied \nit, the FASST plan would give up to 70 million Americans the \nopportunity to elect the no-return option.\n  Specifically, under the FASST plan, most taxpayers could choose the \nno-filing option by filling out a slightly modified W-4 form at work. \nUsing tables prepared by the IRS, their employers would determine the \nemployee's exact tax obligation at a single rate of 15 percent \non wages--after several major adjustments--and withhold that amount. \nThis amount would satisfy the taxpayer's entire federal income tax \nobligation for the year, absent some unforeseeable changes in \ncircumstances or fraud.\n\n  The FASST plan would be available for couples earning up to $100,000 \nin wages and no more than $5,000 in other income such as interest, \ndividends or capital gains. In the case of individual taxpayers, the \nwage and non-wage income limits would be $50,000 and $2,500, \nrespectively. Popular deductions would continue under this plan: the \nstandard deduction, personal exemptions, the child care credit and \nEarned Income Tax Credit, along with a deduction for home mortgage \ninterest expenses and property taxes. Our bill would include critical \nsavings incentives for average Americans by exempting up to $5,000 of \nall interest, dividends and capital gains income from taxation for \ncouples, $2,500 for singles. Moreover, savings contributions made \nthrough employers would be excluded from the wage calculations in the \nbeginning.\n  Consider some of the advantages of this hassle-free plan:\n  No taxpayers would lose. If a taxpayer prefers to file an ordinary \nreturn, he or she would still have that choice, and no one would be \nforced to lose a tax deduction that he or she wants to keep.\n  Wages would be taxed at a single, low rate of 15 percent.\n  A deduction for home mortgage interest expenses, the Earned Income \nTax Credit, and other popular parts of our current tax code would be \npreserved. Other major tax reform plans would eliminate those \ndeductions, which many people count on.\n  The alternative minimum tax, AMT and the marriage penalty would be \neliminated.\n  Compliance costs for taxpayers and government alike would fall. If 70 \nmillion Americans chose the FASST option, hundreds of millions of \ndollars now spent on paper pushing could be used in more productive \nways.\n  Those taxpayers who continued to file under the old system would get \nrelief too. The plan would reduce the marriage penalty by making the \nstandard deduction for married couples double the amount available for \nsingle filers. Also, it would virtually eliminate the complicated AMT \nfor most sole proprietors, farmers and other small businesses by \nexempting the first $1 million in self-employment income from the AMT \ncalculations. This legislation also would provide a 50 percent credit \nfor up to $1,000 in expenses that businesses might incur implementing \nthe FASST plan. In addition, it would grant taxpayers who continue to \nuse the current system a 50 percent tax credit for up to $200 in tax \npreparer expenses, provided they file their returns electronically. \nFinally, the bill would offer individuals a substantial incentive for \nsavings and investment by exempting up to $500 of dividend and interest \nincome, $1,000 for couples.\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans in this country are tired of \nspending countless hours wading through complex forms and instruction \nbooks. Our bill is both simple and fair, and it gives most taxpayers \nthe choice to avoid the annual nightmare that the federal tax system \nhas become.\n  In testimony before a Senate subcommittee earlier this year, IRS \nCommissioner Rossotti testified that it's ``unquestionable that this \nbill provides significant tax simplification.'' Imagine how much better \nlife would be if April 15th were just another day. Under the FASST \nplan, for millions of Americans, that could be true. We urge our \ncolleagues to support this important legislation, which we think will \ngo a long way toward eliminating the burden of ``tax day'' for tens of \nmillions of taxpayers in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this legislation be \ninserted in the Record immediately following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 3087\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to promulgate regulations regarding allowable \n     costs under the Medicaid Program for school based services \n     provided to children with disabilities; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n\n                   administrative services adjustment\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \nprovides fair relief to schools in Michigan and other states.\n  In 1993, the state of Michigan and our school districts worked out an \nagreement which would provide schools a portion of Federal Medicaid \ndollars based on school based health related activities that were being \nprovided to eligible children receiving special education services. \nWhen these school superintendents looked around in 1996, they saw a \nsimilarly situated state which was providing administrative services to \nhelp special needs kids, and they decided to follow suit for children \nin Michigan. Michigan then implemented the Administrative Outreach \ncomponent of school based services based on a program that had been in \noperation in that state for the previous two years.\n  Recently, HCFA disallowed $103.6 million in claims submitted by the \nstate of Michigan to reimburse the schools for services already \nrendered in this effort. It is simply unfair that these school \ndistricts are now being penalized when they have been trying to provide \nhealth services through the schools for special needs kids in ways used \nin other states and after relying on HCFA regional guidance.\n  I have met with a large group of Michigan school superintendents and \ntheir staff and I know how committed they are to helping children with \nspecial needs. Apparently, the rules need to be clarified, and in a \nmeeting with HCFA that the Michigan superintendents had this week, HCFA \ncommitted to sitting down with the education community by the end of \nthis month to finalize an administrative guide regarding claims for \nreimbursement. That is surely an appropriate goal, but in the meantime, \nMichigan claims have been disallowed although the state relied on \nregional HCFA guidance. While national guidance is being clarified, we \nshould not penalize states who have acted reasonably based on existing \nguidance.\n  I believe Michigan school superintendents when they say they believed \nthey were acting appropriately in providing services for children with \nspecial educational needs. These are honest hardworking people trying \nto run school districts on tight budgets. I am introducing this \nlegislation because I believe any attempt to penalize schools who acted \nin good faith will ultimately hurt special needs kids as well as our \nschools themselves.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n       S. 3090. A bill to establish the Rocky Flats National \n     Wildlife Refuge in the State of Colorado, and for other \n     purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n            rocky flats national wildlife refuge act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator Ben Nighthorse \nCampbell, to introduce a very important piece of legislation for my \nstate of Colorado and this nation--The Rocky Flats National Wildlife \nRefuge Act. My colleague, Representative Mark Udall, is introducing \ncompanion legislation in the House cosponsored by the entire Colorado \ndelegation.\n\n  Today we begin a new chapter in the history of Rocky Flats. This \nlegislation will permanently designate the Rocky Flats Environmental \nTechnology Site as a National Wildlife Refuge following the cleanup and \nclosure of the site. It ensures that the Federal Government will retain \nfull liability and ownership of this former nuclear weapons facility. \nThis legislation will transform Rocky Flats from producing weapons to \nprotecting wildlife. It will ensure that our children and grandchildren \nwill be able to enjoy the wildlife and open space that currently exists \nat Rocky Flats.\n  This is a tremendous achievement. Once the bill is enacted, we will \nsee Rocky Flats move from being an active nuclear weapons site into an \nactive refuge for wildlife and wild flowers in less than two decades. \nAn accomplishment which no one thought was possible.\n  My vested interest in Rocky Flats began during the 1980's when I was \nthe\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\nChairman of the State Senate Committee on Health, Environment, Welfare \nand Institutions. Although I supported the national security mission of \nthe Rocky Flats site prior to closure, I believe that the Department of \nEnergy must also ensure the safety and health of all Coloradans and the \nenvironment. When the Rocky Flats site was shut down in 1990, cleaning \nup and closing down the site became one of my top legislative \npriorities and will remain so until this project is complete.\n  So where did the idea come from to turn Rocky Flats, a former nuclear \nweapons production facility, into a National Wildlife Refuge?\n  My experience with wildlife refuge designations began with \nCongresswoman Schroeder at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal in 1992. We \nworked on a bill very similar to the one we are here to discuss today, \nwhich designated the Arsenal as a National Wildlife Refuge. Given the \nsuccess we experienced at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, I am confident \nthis is an appropriate designation for Rocky Flats.\n  Last year, I became the Strategic Subcommittee Chairman of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, which has direct oversight of former DoE \nweapons facilities including Rocky Flats. This is the first site in the \nDoE complex to receive funding for cleanup and closure, and will \ntherefore be a role model for other sites in the complex. As Chairman \nof the Subcommittee, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues \nto educate them on the importance of cleaning up and closing down Rocky \nFlats so it can be utilized as a National Wildlife Refuge. This \neducation extends beyond the cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats to the \nimportance of cleaning up and closing of all the former DoE weapons \nsites.\n  To this end, Congressman Udall and I have worked in a bipartisan \nmanner, with the Department of Energy, the EPA, the State of Colorado, \nthe local governments and the Rocky Flats stakeholders to produce the \nproposed Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge Act. It has been hard \nwork and with many discussion drafts, but in the end I believe we have \nproduced a bill that the communities surrounding Rocky Flats can and \nwill be proud of.\n  It is important to understand that this legislation maintains that \nthe Rocky Flats site will remain in permanent Federal ownership, and \nthat the administrative transfer of this site from DoE to the Fish and \nWildlife Service will take place after the cleanup and closure of the \nsite is complete. While cleanup is still our top priority, \ndetermination of official closure is determined by the Environmental \nProtection Agency's signing of the final on-site record of decision. \nThere are many components of this bill which I will summarize as \nfollows:\n  The sponsors of the legislation recognize the historic importance of \nthe Lindsay Ranch homestead facilities and this legislation guarantees \nthe ranch's preservation.\n  Additionally, this bill ensures that the site will remain a unified \nsite, therefore disallowing the annexation of land to any local \ngovernment, or for the construction of through roads. The only roads \nthat may be constructed on the site would be by the Fish and Wildlife \nService for the management of the refuge.\n  Currently, there is a provision in this legislation to allow the \nSecretary of Energy and the Secretary of the Interior to authorize a \ntransportation right of-way on the eastern boundary of the site for \ntransportation improvements along Indiana Street. We are aware of the \ncontinued evaluation of this issue and want this section of the bill to \nbe consistent with the needs of the State of Colorado and the local \ngovernments.\n  With respect to the transfer of management responsibilities and \njurisdiction over Rocky Flats, this bill requires the Department of \nEnergy and the Fish and Wildlife Service to publish in the Federal \nRegister a Memorandum of Understanding one year after the enactment of \nthis Act. This Memorandum of Understanding will address administrative \nmatters such as the division of responsibilities between the two \nagencies until the official transfer of the site occurs. This \nlegislation clearly states that no funding designated for cleanup and \nclosure of the site will be used for these activities.\n  It is important that the transfer of the site from the Department of \nEnergy to the Fish and Wildlife Service exclude any property that must \nbe retained by DoE for future onsite monitoring, as well as property \nwhich must be retained for protection of human health and safety.\n\n  The improvements necessary for the site to be managed as a wildlife \nrefuge will be completed at no cost to the Secretary of the Interior. \nTherefore, the Secretary of Interior will need to identify appropriate \nimprovement needs and submit this request to the Secretary of Energy in \nwriting. This legislation also clarifies that in the event of future \ncleanup activities, this action will take priority over wildlife \nmanagement. These two agencies must continue to work with each other \ntowards their missions.\n  One of the most important directives in this Act states that \n``nothing in this Act affects the level of cleanup and closure at the \nRocky Flats site required under the Rocky Flats Cleanup Agreement or \nany Federal or State law.'' Through the ongoing discussions that \nCongressman Udall and I have had with the Rocky Flats stakeholders we \nbelieve it is important to reiterate that this bill should not be used \nas a mechanism to drive the level of cleanup. We are confident that \nthis language clarifies this issue. Our primary goal remains and will \ncontinue to remain the on-going cleanup and closure of Rocky Flats. \nAnd, nothing in this bill affects the on-going cleanup and closure \nactivities at the Rocky Flats.\n  Once the site is transferred to the Fish and Wildlife Service, the \nrefuge will be managed in accordance with the National Wildlife Refuge \nSystem Act to preserve wildlife, enhance wildlife habitat, conserve \nthreatened and endangered species, provide education opportunities and \nscientific research, as well as recreation.\n  We recognize the importance of the locally elected officials and \nstakeholders in the effectiveness and success of this bill. Therefore, \nwe want to ensure their continued contribution at Rocky Flats. Through \nthis bill we direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to convene a public \nprocess to include input on the management of the site. The public \nprocess will provide a forum for recommendations to be given to the \nFish and Wildlife Service on issues including the site operations, \ntransportation improvements, leasing land to the National Renewable \nEnergy Laboratory, perimeter fences, the development of a Rocky Flats \nmuseum and visitors center. Upon the completion of this report by the \nFish and Wildlife Service, a report will be submitted to Congress to \nidentify the recommendations resulting from the public process.\n  We have received a lot of input with respect to private property \nrights. This legislation recognizes and preserves these property and \naccess rights, which include mineral rights, water and easement rights, \nand utility rights-of-ways. This legislation does direct the Secretary \nof Energy to seek to purchase mineral rights from willing sellers. For \nmanagement purposes, this Act provides the Secretary of Energy and the \nSecretary of Interior the authority to impose reasonable conditions on \nthe access to private property rights for cleanup and refuge management \npurposes.\n  Additionally, this bill provides the Secretary of Energy with the \nauthority to allow Public Service Company of Colorado to construct an \nextension from an existing extension line on the site.\n  As a tribute to the Cold War and those who worked at Rocky Flats both \nprior to and after the site closure, Congressman Udall and I, through \nthis legislation, authorize the establishment of a Rocky Flats museum \nto commemorate the site. This bill requires that the creation of the \nmuseum shall be studied, and a report shall be submitted to Congress \nwithin three years following the enactment of this act.\n  Lastly, this bill directs the Department of Energy and the Fish and \nWildlife Service to inform Congress on the costs associated with the \nimplementation of this Act.\n  This process has moved forward successfully thanks to the hard work \nof the local governments and the Rocky Flats stakeholders. I also want \nto thank Representative Udall for the bi-partisan manner in which he \nand his staff worked with me and my office. Rocky Flats, like all other \ncleanup sites, is bigger than partisan politics and this effort proves \nit.\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\n  Once clean up and closure is accomplished in 2006, I look forward to \nreturning to Rocky Flats for the dedication of new Rocky Flats National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord as follows:\n\n                                S. 3090\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rocky Flats National \n     Wildlife Refuge Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Government, through the Atomic Energy \n     Commission, acquired the Rocky Flats site in 1951 and began \n     operations there in 1952. The site remains a Department of \n     Energy facility. Since 1992, the mission of the Rocky Flats \n     site has changed from the production of nuclear weapons \n     components to cleanup and closure in a manner that is safe, \n     environmentally and socially responsible, physically secure, \n     and cost-effective.\n       (2) The site has generally remained undisturbed since its \n     acquisition by the Federal Government.\n       (3) The State of Colorado is experiencing increasing growth \n     and development, especially in the metropolitan Denver Front \n     Range area in the vicinity of the Rocky Flats site. That \n     growth and development reduces the amount of open space and \n     thereby diminishes for many metropolitan Denver communities \n     the vistas of the striking Front Range mountain backdrop.\n       (4) Some areas of the site contain contamination and will \n     require further remediation. The national interest requires \n     that the ongoing cleanup and closure of the entire site be \n     completed safely, effectively, and without unnecessary delay \n     and that the site thereafter be retained by the United States \n     and managed so as to preserve the value of the site for open \n     space and wildlife habitat.\n       (5) The Rocky Flats site provides habitat for many wildlife \n     species, including a number of threatened and endangered \n     species, and is marked by the presence of rare xeric \n     tallgrass prairie plant communities. Establishing the site as \n     a unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System will promote \n     the preservation and enhancement of those resources for \n     present and future generations.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide for the \n     establishment of the Rocky Flats site as a national wildlife \n     refuge while creating a process for public input on refuge \n     management and ensuring that the site is thoroughly and \n     completely cleaned up.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, today I'm introducing a bill to \nimplement recommendations by the General Accounting Office contained in \na report--issued just today--which assesses the efforts of the \nDepartment of Agriculture's Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards \nAdministration (GIPSA) in implementing the Packers and Stockyards Act. \nDone correctly, GIPSA is supposed to use the Packers and Stockyards Act \nas a tool to prevent farmers from being subject to unfair and anti-\ncompetitive practices.\n  In August 1999, I asked the GAO to investigate whether GIPSA was \ntaking full advantage of its authority to investigate competition \nconcerns in the cattle and hog industries. In a nutshell, GIPSA has \nfailed in its mission to protect family farmers. GIPSA has failed to \nensure fairness and competitiveness in the livestock industry. The \nreport recommends that significant changes need to be made to GIPSA's \ninvestigation and case management, operations, and development \nprocesses, as well as its staff resources and capabilities, in order \nfor it to effectively perform its Packers and Stockyards duties.\n  The news of this administration's failure of duty couldn't come at a \nworse time. Family farmers and independent producers are experiencing \nsome of the lowest prices for their commodities in years. In the \nmeantime, agribusiness has become so concentrated that family farmers \nare concerned they can't get a fair price for their products. They are \nseeing fewer options for marketing their commodities and they are \nhaving to sustain increased input costs. The extent of concentration in \nagribusiness has raised serious concerns about the ability of companies \nto engage in unfair practices. Most of these complaints involve the \nlivestock industry.\n  The Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission are responsible \nfor protecting the marketplace from mergers, acquisitions and practices \nthat adversely affect competition. But GIPSA, under the Packers and \nStockyards Act, has substantial, explicit authority to halt anti-\ncompetitive activity in the livestock industry by taking investigative, \nenforcement and regulatory action. But GIPSA has done none of this. All \nwe hear are calls for more legislation or more money. It's clear that \nthis is just another example of this administration passing the buck to \nCongress by calling for new legislative authority, when they are the \nones that have failed to exercise the broad authority they already \nhave. If USDA won't use their existing powers, what makes us in \nCongress think they'd use new powers?\n  As I've stated, I asked for this GAO investigation because I \nsuspected that USDA had not been doing enough to ensure that small and \nmid-sized producers were not being harmed by possible anti-competitive \nactivity in the livestock industry. So, to tell you the truth, I wasn't \nsurprised when GIPSA got a failing grade. But I can tell you that I am \noutraged by USDA and this administration's lack of priorities in doing \ntheir job and their failure to enforce the laws on the books. Let me \nmake this clear, this USDA is not a friend to the family farmer. And \nthe Clinton-Gore administration is one to talk about us here in \nCongress doing nothing about concerns in agriculture. Maybe I need to \ndefine what ``nothing'' means. I think that this GAO Report defines \n``nothing'' quite well.\n  Let me summarize the findings of the GAO report. The report confirms \nthat GIPSA's authority to halt anti-competitive practices and protect \nbuyers and sellers of livestock is quite broad and, in fact, go further \nthan the Sherman Act in addressing anti-competitive practices.\n  The report also found that two major factors have impacted GIPSA's \ncapability to perform their competition duties. Investigation and case \nmethods, practices and processes are inadequate or non-existent at \nGIPSA.\n  For example, the GAO found that GIPSA's investigations are planned \nand conducted primarily by economists and technical specialists without \nthe formal involvement of USDA's Office of General Counsel attorneys \nfrom the beginning of an investigation. Attorneys only get involved \nwhen a case report is completed. On the other hand, DOJ and FTC have \nteams of attorneys and economists that perform investigations of anti-\ncompetitive practices, with the attorneys taking the lead from the \noutset to ensure that a legal theory is focused on the potential \nviolation of law. The GAO also found that GIPSA does not have \ninvestigative methods designed for competition cases, nor does it have \ninvestigation guidance for anti-competitive practice methods and \nprocesses. In contrast, DOJ and FTC have detailed processes and \npractices specifically designed for these kinds of cases.\n  GIPSA is also inadequately staffed. The GAO indicated that although \nthe agency has hired additional economists, they are relatively \ninexperienced. More importantly, even though I understand there are \naround 300 lawyers in the General Counsel's Office, the report found \nthat the number of attorneys working on GIPSA matters has actually \ndecreased from 8 to 5 since GIPSA reorganized in 1998. To add insult to \ninjury, they are not all assigned full-time to GIPSA's financial, trade \npractice, and competition cases; some have other USDA responsibilities \nas\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\nwell. Consequently, very little attorney time is actually dedicated to \ncompetition cases, thanks to the low priority this administration has \nplaced on the problem.\n  The GAO Report's recommendations are straightforward. It recommends \nthat GIPSA come up with investigation and case methods, practices and \nprocesses for competition-related allegations, in consultation with the \nDOJ and FTC.\n  It recommends that GIPSA integrate the attorney and economist working \nrelationship, with attorneys at the lead from the beginning of the \ninvestigation. It also suggests that USDA might want to report to \nCongress on the state of the cattle and hog market, as well as on \npotential violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act. In effect, the \nGAO provides a blueprint for how GIPSA should be run, and the policies \nand procedures it should have in place to protect family farmers.\n  So, the GAO is telling us that USDA and GIPSA just haven't gotten \ntheir act together to function like a competent agency. And they are \nrecommending that USDA and GIPSA do something that makes common sense--\ndevelop a successful plan, train your people, get guidance from the \nexperts, write effective processes and procedures designed for \ncompetition cases, hire antitrust lawyers.\n  Let me give you some more information. Way back in October 1991, the \nGAO issued another report which determined that, despite increased \nconcentration in the livestock industry, GIPSA's monitoring and \nanalysis were not up to speed to identify anti-competitive practices. \nInstead, GIPSA still placed its primary emphasis on ensuring prompt and \naccurate payment to livestock sellers. In 1997, USDA's own Office of \nInspector General found that GIPSA needed to make extensive \nimprovements to its Packers and Stockyards Program to live up to its \ncompetition responsibilities. The 1997 OIG report found that GIPSA did \nnot have the capability to perform effective anti-competitive practice \ninvestigations because it was not properly organized, operated or \nstaffed. It recommended that GIPSA make extensive organizational and \nresource improvements within the department, as well as employ an \napproach similar to that used by DOJ and FTC, by integrating attorneys \nand economists from the beginning of the investigative process. Sound \nfamiliar?\n  Because of the large number of complaints about competition in the \nlivestock industry, one would have thought that USDA and the \nadministration would have put addressing competition concerns in every \nway possible and ensuring the effective functioning of GIPSA at the top \nof their list. USDA and the administration had clear warnings in the \n1991 GAO Report and the 1997 OIG Report that there were significant \nproblems, yet they've been ineffective in addressing them. In fact, \nUSDA agreed with the reports and acknowledged that they needed to \nreevaluate guidelines and regulations, as well as make appropriate \norganizational, procedure and resource changes. So why wasn't this \ndone? Why weren't these concerns addressed in an effective manner? Why \nstill all this mismanagement? Why still no guidance, policies or \nproceures?\n  And now this GAO report raises even more troubling questions. What \nare USDA's real priorities? Are ag concentration and anti-competitive \nactivity of any concern to the Clinton/Gore administration? How many \nviolations of the Packers and Stockyards Act have slipped through the \ncracks because of GIPSA's failure to execute its statutory \nresponsibility? My hearing on September 25, next week in my Judiciary \nSubcommittee, will explore these and other questions.\n  I can already see the finger-pointing to come from USDA. They are \ngoing to say they need more time. Well, they've known since 1991 that \nthey had problems, isn't that time enough to fix them? They are going \nto say that we haven't given them enough money. But the fact is that \nCongress has increased GIPSA and USDA OGC funding almost every year \nsince 1991. If USDA saw that they needed more antitrust lawyers for \ntheir Packers and Stockyards competition cases, they should have \ndedicated more of their funds to hiring them. The problem is this \nadministration's priorities. The problem is this administration's \ninability to take responsibility.\n  In any event, it's clear that we can't count on this administration's \nAgriculture Department to reorganize and fix the problems identified in \nthis GAO report. USDA promised to respond to similar problems \nidentified in the 1991 GAO Report and 1997 OIG report, yet did nothing \nof any real effect to change the situation. Promises made to farmers \nand promises broken. It's clear to me that recent movements on the part \nof USDA to address some of these issues are just another way to deflect \ncriticisms of their failure to act. And my concerns continue to grow. \nLegislation is necessary to force USDA and GIPSA to do their job. It's \nobvious that if we leave it to this administration, it will be the same \nold, same old. And the family farmer will continue to wait for \nsomething to happen. USDA has broken too many promises already.\n  No more. My bill, the Packers and Stockyards Enforcement Improvements \nAct, will require USDA to implement GAO's commonsense recommendations, \nGAO's blueprint for success. Specifically, my bill will require that, \nwithin one year, USDA implement the recommendations of the GAO report, \nin consultation with DOJ and FTC. My bill will require that, during \nthis one year implementation period, USDA will work with DOJ and FTC to \nidentify anti-competitive violations and take enforcement action under \nthe Packers and Stockyards Act. My bill will require USDA to set up a \ntraining program for competition investigations within one year. In \naddition, my bill will require USDA to provide Congress with a yearly \nreport on the state of the cattle and hog industries and identify \nactivities that represent potential violations under the Packers and \nStockyards Act.\n  Finally, my bill will require USDA to report back to Congress within \na year on what actions it has taken to comply with this act.\n  This is a good government bill. It doesn't change the authority of \nUSDA to address anti-competitive activity in the livestock industry \nunder the Packers and Stockyards Act. Obviously, there's no need to do \nthat--USDA already has all the authority they need. Instead, my bill \ndoes something a lot more fundamental--it makes USDA and GIPSA \nreorganize, regroup and revamp their Packers and Stockyards program so \nthey can do their job. Hopefully this will help change USDA's failure \nto take its current statutory responsibilities seriously. It seems to \nme that this is a recurring theme, the administration not enforcing the \nlaws on the books and then blaming others for their inadequacies. But \nthe report is clear. They are the problem. This GAO report is important \nbecause it has identified what the real problem is: USDA and the \nadministration are asleep at the switch.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have my bill printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3091\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission to roll back the wholesale price of electric \n     energy sold in the Western System Coordinating Council, and \n     for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n\n          the halt electricity price-gouging in san diego act\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a very important \nbill, the Halt Electricity Price-gouging in San Diego Act. This bill, a \ncompanion to the bill introduced in the House on September 7, 2000 by \nCongressman Filner, sends a loud and clear signal to electric companies \nin California that the federal government will not tolerate price \ngouging of our people.\n  California is currently experiencing an energy crisis, particularly \nin San Diego. Energy supplies are barely adequate on any given day to \nmeet demand. Wholesale electricity prices have soared, causing San \nDiego Gas and Electric to pass along increased costs to consumers and \nresulting in bills that have increased as much as 300 percent in the \nSan Diego area.\n  Small business owners and people on small or fixed incomes, \nespecially the elderly, are particularly suffering. Other utilities in \nthe state have similar supply and cost problems, causing losses in the \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  This bill would direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n(FERC) to impose price caps on wholesale electricity prices. The bill \nwould also require power suppliers to refund fees charged above the \nFERC-imposed price cap since June 1, 2000. The precise total of refunds \ndue would be determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  I urge FERC to act swiftly and bring relief to those who have been \nhit by this terrible situation.\n  The fight for fair utility rates is going to be difficult and may \nrequire a number of other solutions. I will continue to work with \nCongressman Filner and others to ensure that we end the crisis and \nprevent similar incidents in California and elsewhere in the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8958-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8958-S8959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Smith) was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to \namend the Tariff Act of 1930 to eliminate disincentives to fair trade \nconditions.\n\n\n                                 S. 459\n\n  At the request of Mr. Hatch, the name of the Senator from Missouri \n(Mr. Bond) was added as a cosponsor of S. 459, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the State ceiling on private \nactivity bonds.\n\n\n                                S. 1314\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the name of the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1314, a bill to establish a grant \nprogram to assist State and local law enforcement in deterring, \ninvestigating, and prosecuting computer crimes.\n\n\n                                S. 1805\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. L.

Res. 138\n\n       Whereas human progress in the 21st century will depend upon \n     global understanding and cooperation in finding positive \n     solutions to hunger and violence;\n       Whereas the turn of the millennium offers unparalleled \n     opportunity for humanity to examine its past, set goals for \n     the future, and establish new patterns of behavior;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and the world \n     observed the day designated by the United Nations General \n     Assembly as ``One Day in Peace, January 1, 2000'' (General \n     Assembly Resolution 54/29);\n       Whereas the example set on that day ought to be recognized \n     globally and repeated each year;\n       Whereas the people of the United States seek to establish \n     better relations with one another and with the people of all \n     countries; and\n       Whereas celebration by the breaking of bread together \n     traditionally has been the means by which individuals, \n     societies, and nations join together in peace: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) each year should begin with a day of peace and sharing \n     during which--\n       (A) people around the world should gather with family, \n     friends, neighbors, their faith community, or people of \n     another culture to pledge nonviolence in the new year and to \n     share in a celebratory new year meal; and\n       (B) Americans who are able should match or multiply the \n     cost of their new year meal with a timely gift to the hungry \n     at home or abroad in a tangible demonstration of a desire for \n     increased friendship and sharing among people around the \n     world; and\n       (2) the President should issue a proclamation each year \n     calling on the people of the United States and interested \n     organizations to observe such a day with appropriate programs \n     and activities.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I introduce today on behalf of myself \nand Senators Lieberman, Kennedy, Reid, Moynihan, Levin, and Landrieu, a \nresolution to designate January 1, 2001, and every following January \n1st, as a day of peace and reconciliation among all peoples of the \nworld. The purpose of this resolution is to create a day of peaceful \ncelebration across the world and in our backyards, as well as a day for \nsharing food with others whose lives we normally do not touch in a \npersonal way.\n  ``One Day in Peace,'' a pledge of no violence in our homes, \nneighborhoods, and battlefields, on January 1, 2000, was supported by \nover 100 nations, 25 U.S. governors, hundreds of mayors worldwide and \nover 1,000 organizations in nearly 140 countries, as well as the UN \nGeneral Assembly. It worked and the new millennium was ushered in with \na day of peace worldwide.\n  At the same time, another event, The Millennium Meal Project, an \ninternational effort to use the tradition of breaking bread to promote \npeace and end hunger, was officially endorsed by the White House, \nmembers of both the House and Senate, the World Peace/Inner Peace \nConference and the Jubillenium World Conference on Religion and Peace \nfeaturing 19 diverse faiths and went exceedingly well this past January \n1, 2000.\n  Now these two initiatives have joined together in order to encourage \npeople all over the world, through sharing of a special meal, to reach \nout to one another for ``One Day'' by creating an environment of peace \nand mutualism. Since the beginning of recorded history, breaking bread \ntogether has been seen as a tradition when people from opposing sides \ncan sit down and learn about one another in a peaceful manner.\n  Particularly we as Senators need to put aside our differences, on \nboth sides of the aisle, to discover and celebrate our commonalities in \norder to prepare ourselves for working more harmoniously during the \n107th Congress to solve the critical problems of both violence and \nhunger in our nation and in our world. We know, all too well, that \nchildren around the world and at home are going to bed hungry, and that \nour children are often afraid to go to school.\n  Let us make ``One Day'' a special time of reflection, to eliminate \nhunger and violence for children and families throughout the world, by \nsharing our prosperity and friendship with people from all backgrounds, \nbeliefs and cultures. This day should be held high in importance to \ncelebrate our diversities and differences, rather than emphasizing them \nas barriers between us.\n  I hope this resolution will be adopted unanimously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S8959-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8959-S8960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 359--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 16, 2000, TO OCTOBER 20, \n              2000, AS ``NATIONAL TEACH FOR AMERICA WEEK''\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING HOMESTEAD AIR FORCE \n                   BASE.\n\n       (a) In General.--(1) The Everglades is an American treasure \n     and includes uniquely-important and diverse wildlife \n     resources and recreational opportunities;\n       (2) the preservation of the pristine and natural character \n     of the South Florida ecosystem is critical to the regional \n     economy;\n       (3) as this legislation demonstrates, the Senate believes \n     it to be a vital national mission to restore and preserve \n     this ecosystem and accordingly is authorizing a significant \n     Federal investment to do so;\n       (4) the Senate seeks to have the remaining property at the \n     former Homestead Air Base conveyed and reused as \n     expeditiously as possible, and several options for base reuse \n     are being considered, including as a commercial airport; and\n       (5) the Senate is aware that the Homestead site is located \n     in a sensitive environmental location, and that Biscayne \n     National Park is only approximately 1.5 miles to the east, \n     Everglades National Park approximately 8 miles to the west, \n     and the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary approximately \n     10 miles to the south.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) development at the Homestead site could potentially \n     cause significant air, water, and noise pollution and result \n     in the degradation of adjacent national parks and other \n     protected Federal resources;\n       (2) in their decisionmaking, the Federal agencies charged \n     with determining the reuse of the remaining property at the \n     Homestead base should carefully consider and weigh all \n     available information concerning potential environmental \n     impacts of various reuse options;\n       (3) the redevelopment of the former base should be \n     consistent with restoration goals, provide desirable numbers \n     of jobs and economic redevelopment for the community, and be \n     consistent with other applicable laws;\n       (4) consistent with applicable laws, the Secretary of the \n     Air Force should proceed as quickly as practicable to issue a \n     final SEIS and Record of Decision so that reuse of the former \n     air base can proceed expeditiously;\n       (5) following conveyance of the remaining surplus property, \n     the Secretary, as part of his oversight for Everglades \n     restoration, should cooperate with the entities to which the \n     various parcels of surplus property were conveyed so that the \n     planned use of those properties is implemented in such a \n     manner as to remain consistent with the goals of the \n     Everglades restoration plan; and\n       (6) by August 1, 2002, the Secretary should submit a report \n     to the appropriate committees of Congress on actions taken \n     and make any recommendations for consideration by Congress.\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\n                 TITLE VII--WILDLIFE REFUGE ENHANCEMENT\n\n     SEC. 701.

GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the value of research \n     and development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that has saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) The research and development investment across all \n     Federal agencies has been effective in creating technology \n     that has enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; science, engineering, and technology contribute \n     to the creation of new goods and services, new jobs and new \n     capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to \n     exploit it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently are underrepresented in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Civilian research and development expenditures reached \n     their pinnacle in the mid-1960s due to the Apollo Space \n     program, declining for several years thereafter. Despite \n     significant growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s, these \n     expenditures, in constant dollars, have not returned to the \n     levels of the 1960s.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress and the \n     President to steer the Federal government's role in science, \n     engineering, and technology in a manner that ensures a \n     prudent use of limited public resources. There is both a \n     long-term problem--addressing the ever-increasing level of \n     mandatory spending--and a near-term challenge--apportioning a \n     dwindling amount of discretionary funding to an increasing \n     range of targets in science, engineering, and technology. \n     This confluence of increased national dependency on \n     technology, increased targets of opportunity, and decreased \n     fiscal flexibility has created a problem of national urgency. \n     Many indicators show that more funding for science, \n     engineering, and technology is needed but, even with \n     increased funding, priorities must be established among \n     different programs. The United States cannot afford the \n     luxury of fully funding all deserving programs.\n\n     SEC. 102. SPECIAL FINDINGS REGARDING HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings with respect to \n     health-related research:\n       (1) Health and economic benefits provided by health-related \n     research.--Because of health-related research, cures for many \n     debilitating and fatal diseases have been discovered and \n     deployed. At present, the medical research community is on \n     the cusp of creating cures for a number of leading diseases \n     and their associated burdens. In particular, medical research \n     has the potential to develop treatments that can help manage \n     the escalating costs associated with the aging of the United \n     States population.\n       (2) Funding of health-related research.--Many studies have \n     recognized that clinical and basic science are in a state of \n     crisis because of a failure of resources to meet the \n     opportunity. Consequently, health-related research has \n     emerged as a national priority and has been given \n     significantly increased funding by Congress in both fiscal \n     year 1999 and fiscal year 2000. In order to continue \n     addressing this urgent national need, the pattern of \n     substantial budgetary expansion begun in fiscal year 1999 \n     should be maintained.\n       (3) Interdisciplinary nature of health-related research.--\n     Because all fields of science and engineering are \n     interdependent, full realization of the nation's historic \n     investment in health will depend on major advances both in \n     the biomedical sciences and in other science and engineering \n     disciplines. Hence, the vitality of all disciplines must be \n     preserved, even as special considerations are given to the \n     health research field.\n\n     SEC. 103. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN \n                   RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each support a \n     narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at each \n     stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in american university research \n     infrastructure.--Federal investment in science, engineering, \n     and technology programs must foster a close relationship \n     between research and education. Investment in research at the \n     university level creates more than simply world-class \n     research. It creates world-class researchers as well. The \n     Federal strategy must continue to reflect this commitment to \n     a strong geographically-diverse research infrastructure. \n     Furthermore, the United States must find ways to extend the \n     excellence of its university system to primary and secondary \n     educational institutions and to better utilize the community \n     college system to prepare many students for vocational \n     opportunities in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n     SEC. 104. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; GUIDING \n                   PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted in accordance with the following \n     guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones and international benchmarks.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the Congress \n     must recognize that a negative result in a well-conceived and \n     executed project or program may still be critically important \n     to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which government has \n     traditionally served as the principal resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, all of \n     which may also raise the standard of living, which may \n     include pre-commercial, pre-competitive engineering research \n     and technology development. Additionally, government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically more specific nature of private-sector \n     funding. Government funding should be restricted to pre-\n     competitive activities, leaving competitive activities solely \n     for the private sector. As a rule, the government should not \n     invest in commercial technology that is in the product \n     development stage, very close to the broad commercial \n     marketplace, except to meet a specific agency goal. When the \n     government provides funding for any science, engineering, and \n     technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps \n     to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the \n     program will accrue broadly.\n\n     SEC. 105. POLICY STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Policy.--This title is intended to--\n       (1) assure a doubling of the base level of Federal funding \n     for basic scientific, biomedical, and pre-competitive \n     engineering research, achieved by steadily increasing the \n     annual funding of civilian research and development programs \n     so that the total annual investment equals 10 percent of the \n     Federal government's discretionary budget by fiscal year \n     2011;\n       (2) invest in the future economic growth of the United \n     States by expanding the research activities referred to in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) enhance the quality of life and health for all people \n     of the United States through expanded support for health-\n     related research;\n       (4) allow for accelerated growth of individual agencies to \n     meet critical national needs;\n       (5) guarantee the leadership of the United States in \n     science, engineering, medicine, and technology;\n       (6) ensure that the opportunity and the support for \n     undertaking good science is widely available throughout the \n     United States by supporting a geographically-diverse research \n     and development enterprise; and\n       (7) continue aggressive Congressional oversight and annual \n     budgetary authorization of the individual agencies listed in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Agencies Covered.--The agencies and trust \n     instrumentality intended to be covered to the extent that \n     they are engaged in science, engineering, and technology \n     activities for basic scientific, medical, or pre-competitive \n     engineering research by this title are--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) the National Science Foundation;\n       (3) the National Institute for Standards and Technology, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       (5) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (6) the Centers for Disease Control, within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (7) the Department of Energy (to the extent that it is not \n     engaged in defense-related activities);\n       (8) the Department of Agriculture;\n       (9) the Department of Transportation;\n       (10) the Department of the Interior;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Smithsonian Institution;\n       (13) the Department of Education;\n       (14) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (15) the Food and Drug Administration, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services; and\n       (16) the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n       (c) Damage to Research Infrastructure.--A funding trend \n     equal to or lower than current budgetary levels will lead to \n     permanent damage to the United States research \n     infrastructure. This could threaten American dominance of \n     high-technology industrial leadership.\n       (d) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goal.--The goal of this title is to increase the \n     percentage of the Federal discretionary budget allocated for \n     civilian research and development by 0.3 percent annually to \n     realize a total of 10 percent of the Federal discretionary \n     budget by fiscal year 2011.\n       (2) Amounts authorized.--There are authorized to be \n     appropriated to the agencies listed in subsection (b) for \n     civilian research and development the following amounts:\n       (A) $43,080,000,000 for fiscal year 2001.\n       (B) $45,160,000,000 for fiscal year 2002.\n       (C) $47,820,000,000 for fiscal year 2003.\n       (D) $50,540,000,000 for fiscal year 2004.\n       (E) $53,410,000,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n       (3) Fiscal years 2006-2011.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to the agencies listed in subsection (b) for \n     civilian research and development for each of the fiscal \n     years 2006 through 2011 an amount that, on the basis of \n     projections of Federal discretionary budget amounts as such \n     projections become available, will meet the goal established \n     by paragraph (1).\n       (4) Acceleration to meet national needs.--\n       (A) In general.--If an agency listed in subsection (b) has \n     an accelerated funding fiscal year, then, except as provided \n     by subparagraph (C), the amount authorized by paragraph (2) \n     or determined under paragraph (3) for the fiscal year \n     following the accelerated funding fiscal year shall be \n     determined in accordance with subparagraph (B).\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\n       (B) Exclusion of accelerated funding agency.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated for civilian research and \n     development under this subparagraph for a fiscal year shall \n     be determined--\n       (i) by reducing the total amount that, but for subparagraph \n     (A), would be authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (2) \n     or paragraph (3) by a percentage equal to the percentage of \n     total amount authorized by that paragraph for the fiscal year \n     preceding the accelerated funding fiscal year to the agency \n     that had the accelerated funding fiscal year; and\n       (ii) allocating the reduced amount among all agencies \n     listed in subsection (b) other than the agency that had the \n     accelerated funding fiscal year.\n       (C) Exception to accelerated funding agency rule.--\n     Subparagraph (B) does not apply if the amount appropriated to \n     an agency for civilian research and development purposes for \n     a fiscal year, adjusted for inflation (assuming an annual \n     rate of inflation of 3 percent), does not exceed the amount \n     appropriated to that agency for those purposes for fiscal \n     year 2000 increased by 2.5 percent a year for each fiscal \n     year after fiscal year 2000.\n       (D) Accelerated funding fiscal year defined.--In this \n     subsection, the term ``accelerated funding fiscal year'' \n     means a fiscal year for which the amount appropriated to an \n     agency for civilian research and development purposes is an \n     increase of more than 8 percent over the amount appropriated \n     to that agency for the preceding fiscal year for those \n     purposes.\n       (e) Conformance with Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds may be made available under \n     this title in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       (f) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n       (g) Congressional Authorization Process.--The policies and \n     authorizations in this Act establish minimum levels for the \n     overall Federal civilian research portfolio across the \n     agencies listed in subsection (b) under the procedures \n     defined in subsection (d). The amounts authorized by \n     subsection (d) establish a framework within which the \n     authorizing committees of the Congress are to work when \n     authorizing funding for specific Federal agencies engaged in \n     science, engineering, and technology activities.\n\n     SEC. 106. ANNUAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANALYSES.\n\n       The Director of the Office of Science and Technology shall \n     provide, no later than February 15th of each year, a report \n     to Congress that includes--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     civilian research and development programs throughout all \n     Federal agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that is consistent with the funding \n     projections of this title for each future fiscal year until \n     2011, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those terms in chapter 63 of title \n     31, United States Code);\n       (4) a Federal strategy for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community; \n     and\n       (5) an annual analysis of the total level of funding for \n     civilian research and development programs throughout all \n     Federal agencies as compared to the previous fiscal year's \n     Congressional budget appropriations for science, engineering, \n     and technology activities of the agencies described in \n     section 105(b), that details for the current fiscal year--\n       (A) how total funding levels compare to those authorized \n     according to section 105(d);\n       (B) how the differences in those funding levels will affect \n     the health, stability, and international standing of the \n     Federal civilian research and development infrastructure;\n       (C) how the disparities in those levels affect the ability \n     of the agencies covered by this Act to perform their \n     missions; and\n       (D) which agencies are excluded under this Act due to \n     accelerated funding and the aggregate amount to be authorized \n     to other agencies under section 105(d).\n\n     SEC. 107. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy shall enter into agreement with the \n     National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to conduct a \n     comprehensive study to develop methods for evaluating \n     Federally-funded research and development programs. The \n     Director shall report the results of the study to the \n     Congress not later than 18 months after the date of enactment \n     of this Act. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for Federally-funded research and development \n     programs by--\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal government to evaluate Federally-funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which civilian research and \n     development agencies incorporate independent merit-based \n     review into the formulation of their strategic plans and \n     performance plans;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying Federally-funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of Federally-funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The Term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.--The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000, which shall remain available \n     until expended.\n\n     SEC. 108.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Networking and Information \n     Technology Research and Development Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Information technology will continue to change the way \n     Americans live, learn, and work. The information revolution \n     will improve the workplace and the quality and accessibility \n     of health care and education and make government more \n     responsible and accessible. It is important that access to \n     information technology be available to all citizens, \n     including elderly Americans and Americans with disabilities.\n       (2) Information technology is an imperative enabling \n     technology that contributes to scientific disciplines. Major \n     advances in biomedical research, public safety, engineering, \n     and other critical areas depend on further advances in \n     computing and communications.\n       (3) The United States is the undisputed global leader in \n     information technology.\n       (4) Information technology is recognized as a catalyst for \n     economic growth and prosperity.\n       (5) Information technology represents one of the fastest \n     growing sectors of the United States economy, with electronic \n     commerce alone projected to become a trillion-dollar business \n     by 2005.\n       (6) Businesses producing computers, semi-conductors, \n     software, and communications equipment account for one-third \n     of the total growth in the United States economy since 1992.\n       (7) According to the United States Census Bureau, between \n     1993 and 1997, the information technology sector grew an \n     average of 12.3 percent per year.\n       (8) Fundamental research in information technology has \n     enabled the information revolution.\n       (9) Fundamental research in information technology has \n     contributed to the creation of new industries and new, high-\n     paying jobs.\n       (10) Our Nation's well-being will depend on the \n     understanding, arising from fundamental research, of the \n     social and economic benefits and problems arising from the \n     increasing pace of information technology transformations.\n       (11) Scientific and engineering research and the \n     availability of a skilled workforce are critical to continued \n     economic growth driven by information technology.\n       (12) In 1997, private industry provided most of the funding \n     for research and development in the information technology \n     sector. The information technology sector now receives, in \n     absolute terms, one-third of all corporate spending on \n     research and development in the United States economy.\n       (13) The private sector tends to focus its spending on \n     short-term, applied research.\n       (14) The Federal Government is uniquely positioned to \n     support long-term fundamental research.\n       (15) Federal applied research in information technology has \n     grown at almost twice the rate of Federal basic research \n     since 1986.\n       (16) Federal science and engineering programs must increase \n     their emphasis on long-term, high-risk research.\n       (17) Current Federal programs and support for fundamental \n     research in information technology is inadequate if we are to \n     maintain the Nation's global leadership in information \n     technology.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Senator Smith of New Hampshire has an \namendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4175.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4175) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will soon \npass my legislation, S. 522, the Beaches Environmental Assessment and \nCoastal Health Act of 2000. I ask my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and the managers' amendment that is before the Senate. This \nlegislation is cosponsored by Senators Akaka, Boxer, Cleland, Dodd, \nFeinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Levin, Lieberman, Moynihan, Smith of New \nHampshire, Sarbanes, and Torricelli.\n  Many Americans who visited the beach this summer went home with more \nthan just a tan. They brought back illnesses they contracted because \nthey swam in contaminated water without realizing it.\n  Unfortunately, whether you get sick from your trip to the beach \ndepends on which state you happen to be in. That's because states do \nnot have uniform standards for coastal water quality.\n  For 10 straight years, Mr. President, the Natural Resources Defense \nCouncil has issued its report, ``Testing the Waters,'' which provides a \ncomprehensive, highly reliable assessment of the quality of the \nnation's waters. Since 1991, first with then-Representative Bill Hughes \nof New Jersey and subsequently with Representative Frank Pallone of New \nJersey, I have introduced legislation to require states to adopt \nconsistent coastal water quality standards to protect beachgoers from \ncontamination. This legislation also would call on states to develop \nbeach water quality monitoring and notification programs.\n  Over the years, I've been greatly concerned about the increase in \nbeach closings and advisories throughout the nation. In 1999, according \nto the NRDC's 10th annual report, there were more than 6,100 beach \nclosings and advisories at our nation's oceans, bays and Great Lakes. \nSince 1988, there have been more than 36,156 beach closings and \nadvisories.\n  There is some good news in this information, Mr. President. For one, \nit indicates a greater vigilance by state and local governments. Since \nthe first NRDC report was issued and citizens learned more about the \nrisks at their beaches, at least nine states and many local governments \nhave initiated or expanded their coastal water quality monitoring \nprograms. This shows that many states and local governments are deeply \nconcerned about the health hazards faced by people who swim in \ncontaminated water.\n  However, these data show us that we continue to have serious water \npollution at our nation's beaches. For example, 70 percent of beach \nclosings and advisories in 1999 were prompted by state and local \ngovernment monitoring programs that detected bacteria levels exceeding \nstate or local water quality standards. These bacteria levels have been \nassociated with a variety of gastrointestinal diseases.\n  This bill would ensure that all coastal states apply the U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's criteria for detecting bacteria in \ntheir beach waters. Mr. President, the goal of this bill is to ensure \nthat no matter where people go to the beach, they will know that a \nuniform level of protection is being applied.\n  Right now, only seven states have adopted the criteria that the EPA \ncalled on states to adopt back in 1986. This bill give states three-\nand-a-half years to bring their standards up to where President \nReagan's EPA said they should have been 14 years ago.\n  The second part of my bill provides incentive grants to help states \nset up beach monitoring and public information programs. Right now, \nonly nine states comprehensively monitor most or all of their beaches. \nThese are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, New \nJersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n  My bill does not say how a state should monitor its beaches or how \nthat information should get to the public. To help the states, the EPA \nwould be required to develop monitoring and notification guidance.\n  While we often don't know the exact source of coastal water \npollution, we suspect that in many cases, sewer overflows and street \nrunoff following heavy rainstorms are partly responsible. My bill \nfocuses on a critical need: for states to set uniform standards and \nprovide information to the public. My bill does not seek to regulate \nthese sources of pollution. I sincerely hope that the Senate will \naddress this key concern in the next Congress.\n  Finally, my bill would require the EPA to establish a publicly \navailable database containing the information states submit about their \nmonitoring programs. Right now, Mr. Chairman, only California, \nDelaware, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island compile and \npublicize records of beach closings and bacteria levels. The \nlegislation would encourage all coastal states and the EPA to provide \nthis information to the public.\n  I want to thank the managers of this bill, Senator Bob Smith and \nSenator Baucus, for their leadership in bringing this bill before the \nfull Senate. I also want to recognize the members of the Committee \nstaff for working so diligently on this legislation. In particular, I \nwant to compliment John Pemberton and Ann Klee of the Majority Staff of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee; Jo-Ellen Darcy of the \nMinority staff of the Committee; and Amy Maron and Ruth Lodder of my \npersonal staff.\n  Many organizations also made significant contributions to this bill. \nI want to thank the Natural Resources Defense Council, American Oceans \nCampaign, Center for Marine Conservation, Surfrider Foundation, \nAssociation of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control \nAdministrators, and the Coastal States Organization for their hard \nwork.\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the \nSenate today has unanimously passed S. 522, the Beaches Environmental \nAssessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000 and H.R. 999, the Beaches \nEnvironmental Awareness, Cleanup, and Health Act of 1999. These bills \nreflect what we can do when we work together cooperatively, and on a \nbipartisan basis to protect the environment. Most importantly, they \nwill result in significant environmental benefits on the ground--\ncleaner and safer beaches for all Americans. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, S. 522.\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\n  I want to thank Congressman Bilbray for taking the lead on this Beach \nlegislation over the years and for all his hard work in making sure we \npass this legislation. Without his hard work and determination over the \nyears we would not have passed this legislation today. I also would \nlike to recognize Senator Lautenberg for his leadership on this issue \nin the Senate.\n  Every year, over 180 million people visit coastal waters for \nrecreational purposes. Over half of the population of the United States \nlives near a coastal area and traditionally a great majority of \nAmericans visit coastal areas every year to swim, fish, hunt, dive, \nbike, view wildlife and learn. For many states, this tourism provides \nsignificant economic benefits. In fact, coastal recreation and the \ntourism industry are the second largest employers in the nation, and \nsupporting 28.3 million jobs. In New Hampshire, for example, the \nseacoast region is one of the most popular tourism spots in the State. \nRye Beach and Hampton Beach, to name a couple, provide beautiful \nvacation spots for those of us in New Hampshire and many of our friends \nin neighboring states.\n  Unfortunately, pathogens found in sewage spills, storm water runoff, \nand combined sewer overflows are impairing water quality and \nthreatening the health of the public who visit our nation's beaches. \nWhile some States have strong programs for monitoring and informing the \npublic of the presence of pathogens that are harmful to human health, \nothers do not.\n  In response to the need for consistency among the States in \nmonitoring and public notification of pathogens in coastal recreation \nwaters, Representative Bilbray and Senator Lautenberg introduced their \nBeach bills.\n  The bills require all states with coastal recreation waters to adopt \nwater quality criteria that protect public health and welfare, \nconsistent with EPA criteria guidance for pathogens and pathogen \nindicators. The legislation requires the Administrator of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, in cooperation with State and local \ngovernments, to publish performance criteria that provide guidance for \nstate monitoring and assessment, and public notification programs that \nprotect human health.\n  The performance criteria will be used by the States as guidance to \nimprove upon existing monitoring and notification programs or, in some \nStates to establish monitoring and notification programs. In the case \nof New Hampshire, which as an extensive monitoring and notification \nprogram, these performance criteria will provide further guidance to \nimprove upon our program.\n  The bills provides $30 million over 5 years in grants to States and \nlocal communities for the implementation and development of these \nmonitoring and notification programs. In certain situations, such as \nthe early stage of a program, EPA will be able to award as a grant a \nlarge percentage, up to 100 percent, of the costs of developing a \nprogram to some states. This provides those few States without \nmonitoring and notification programs a great incentive through grant \nfunding to develop and implement this comprehensive program. Improving \nwater quality at our nation's beaches, as well as implementing \nmonitoring and public notification programs, will benefit all Americans \nwho have a right to expect that they can safely swim in the water.\n  The Committee filed the Report on S. 522 (Rept. No. 106-366) on \nAugust 25, 2000. The Committee Report and the text of S. 522, as \namended in Committee, reflected a number of changes negotiated by the \nCommittee and the two principle sponsors of the House and Senate bills, \nCongressman Brian Bilbray of California and Senator Frank Lautenberg. \nOver the past few months, I have worked with my colleagues on the \nCommittee, particularly Senators Lautenberg and Baucus, and with \nCongressman Bilbray to continue to improve the language of this \nlegislation. Together, we have crafted a comprehensive Manager's \nAmendment that I believe provides States with needed flexibility and \nenhances environmental protection. As the manager of the bill, and a \ncosponsor of the Senate bill, I am pleased that the Senate passed this \nManager's Amendment as a substitute to the text of both H.R. 999 and S. \n522. Both bills, as passed by the Senate, reflect the agreements and \nprinciples set forth in Senate Report No. 106-366.\n  I thank Senator Baucus and my other Committee colleagues, as well as \nSenators Lott and Daschle, for helping us continue the tradition of \nbipartisan action on environmental matters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/21/senate-section/article/S9003-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9003-S9009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS PROGRAMS ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Next Generation Internet \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States investment in science and technology \n     has yielded a scientific and engineering enterprise without \n     peer. The Federal investment in research is critical to the \n     maintenance of our international leadership.\n       (2) Federal support of computing, information, and \n     networking research and development has been instrumental in \n     driving advances in information technology, including today's \n     Internet, that are transforming our society, enriching the \n     lives of Americans, enabling scientific and engineering \n     discoveries, and improving the competitiveness and \n     productivity of United States' businesses. We have an \n     essential national interest in ensuring a continued flow of \n     innovation and advances in information technology to assure \n     the continued prosperity of future generations.\n       (3) The Internet is at a pivotal point in its history. \n     While promising new applications in medicine, environmental \n     science, and other disciplines are becoming a reality, they \n     are still constrained by the Internet's capacity and \n     capabilities. The current Internet cannot support an emerging \n     set of activities, many of which are essential to mission-\n     critical applications in government, national laboratories, \n     academia, and business.\n       (4) Government-sponsored network research and development \n     in large scale networking technologies, service, and \n     performance is critical to enable the future growth of the \n     Internet and to meet Federal agency mission needs.\n       (5) Since its establishment in 1998, the Next Generation \n     Internet Program, which builds on the research and \n     development activities funded under the Large Scale \n     Networking Programs, has successfully deployed networking \n     testbeds and funded peer-reviewed research and development to \n     address the critical need for networks that are more \n     powerful, reliable, and versatile than the current Internet.\n       (6) Networking research and development is an integral part \n     of the Federal information technology research and \n     development program. Balanced investments in other areas, \n     including software design and productivity, high-end \n     computing, high confidence software and systems, human-\n     computer interface and information management, high-end \n     computing infrastructure and applications, and research into \n     the social, legal, ethical, and workforce implications of \n     information technology should be pursued.\n\n     SEC. 103.

GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the value of research \n     and development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) Research and development investment across all Federal \n     agencies has been effective in creating technology that has \n     enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; and science, engineering, and technology \n     contribute to the creation of new goods and services, new \n     jobs and new capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently underparticipate in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal Investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Federal investment of approximately 13 to 14 percent of \n     the Federal discretionary budget in research and development \n     over the past 11 years has resulted in a doubling of the \n     nominal amount of Federal funding.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress to steer the \n     Federal government's role in science, engineering, and \n     technology in a manner that ensures a prudent use of limited \n     public resources. There is both a long-term problem--\n     addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending--\n     and a near-term challenge--apportioning a dwindling amount of \n     discretionary funding to an increasing range of targets in \n     science, engineering, and technology. This confluence of \n     increased national dependency on technology, increased \n     targets of opportunity, and decreased fiscal flexibility has \n     created a problem of national urgency. Many indicators show \n     that more funding for science, engineering, and technology is \n     needed but, even with increased funding, priorities must be \n     established among different programs. The United States \n     cannot afford the luxury of fully funding all deserving \n     programs.\n       (3) Current projections of Federal research funding show a \n     downward trend.\n\n     SEC. 203. SPECIAL FINDINGS REGARDING HEALTH-RELATED RESEARCH.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings with respect to \n     health-related research:\n       (1) Health and economic benefits provided by health-related \n     research.--Because of health-related research, cures for many \n     debilitating and fatal diseases have been discovered and \n     deployed. At present, the medical research community is on \n     the cusp of creating cures for a number of leading \n     diseases and their associated burdens. In particular, \n     medical research has the potential to develop treatments \n     that can help manage the escalating costs associated with \n     the aging of the United States population.\n       (2) Funding of health-related research.--Many studies have \n     recognized that clinical and basic science are in a state of \n     crisis because of a failure of resources to meet the \n     opportunity. Consequently, health-related research has \n     emerged as a national priority and has been given \n     significantly increased funding by Congress in fiscal year \n     1999. In order to continue addressing this urgent national \n     need, the pattern of substantial budgetary expansion begun in \n     fiscal year 1999 should be maintained.\n       (3) Interdisciplinary nature of health-related research.--\n     Because all fields of science and engineering are \n     interdependent, full realization of the nation's historic \n     investment in health will depend on major advances both in \n     the biomedical sciences and in other science and engineering \n     disciplines. Hence, the vitality of all disciplines must be \n     preserved, even as special considerations are given to the \n     health research field.\n\n     SEC. 204. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN THE \n                   RESEARCH PROCESS AND USEFUL TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many \n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each support a \n     narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at each \n     stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in the american research infrastructure.--\n     Federal investment in science, engineering, and technology \n     programs must foster a close relationship between research \n     and education. Investment in research at the university level \n     creates more than simply world-class research. It creates \n     world-class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must \n     continue to reflect this commitment to a strong \n     geographically-diverse research infrastructure. Furthermore, \n     the United States must find ways to extend the excellence of \n     its university system to primary and secondary educational \n     institutions and to better utilize the community college \n     system to prepare many students for vocational opportunities \n     in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n     SEC. 205. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; GUIDING \n                   PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\n     in accordance with the following guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the \n     Congress must recognize that a negative result in a well-\n     conceived and executed project or program may still be \n     critically important to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which government has \n     traditionally served as the principle resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, and \n     raising the standard of living, which may include pre-\n     commercial, pre-competitive engineering research and \n     technology development. Additionally, government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically more specific nature of private-sector \n     funding. Government funding should be restricted to pre-\n     competitive activities, leaving competitive activities solely \n     for the private sector. As a rule, the government should not \n     invest in commercial technology that is in the product \n     development stage, very close to the broad commercial \n     marketplace, except to meet a specific agency goal. When the \n     government provides funding for any science, engineering, and \n     technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps \n     to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the \n     program will accrue broadly.\n\n     SEC. 206. POLICY STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Policy.-- This title is intended to--\n       (1) assure a base level of Federal funding for basic \n     scientific, biomedical, and pre-competitive engineering \n     research, with this base level defined as a doubling of \n     Federal basic research funding over the 11 year period \n     following the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) invest in the future economic growth of the United \n     States by expanding the research activities referred to in \n     paragraph (1);\n       (3) enhance the quality of life and health for all people \n     of the United States through expanded support for health-\n     related research;\n       (4) allow for accelerated growth of agencies such as the \n     National Institutes of Health to meet critical national \n     needs;\n       (5) guarantee the leadership of the United States in \n     science, engineering, medicine, and technology; and\n       (6) ensure that the opportunity and the support for \n     undertaking good science is widely available throughout the \n     United States by supporting a geographically-diverse research \n     and development enterprise.\n       (b) Agencies Covered.--The agencies and trust \n     instrumentality intended to be covered to the extent that \n     they are engaged in science, engineering, and technology \n     activities for basic scientific, medical, or pre-competitive \n     engineering research by this title are--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) the National Science Foundation;\n       (3) the National Institute for Standards and Technology, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       (5) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (6) the Centers for Disease Control, within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services;\n       (7) the Department of Energy (to the extent that it is not \n     engaged in defense-related activities);\n       (8) the Department of Agriculture;\n       (9) the Department of Transportation;\n       (10) the Department of the Interior;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Smithsonian Institution;\n       (13) the Department of Education;\n       (14) the Environmental Protection Agency; and\n       (15) the Food and Drug Administration, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services.\n       (c) Damage to Research Infrastructure.--A continued trend \n     of funding appropriations equal to or lower than current \n     budgetary levels will lead to permanent damage to the United \n     States research infrastructure. This could threaten American \n     dominance of high-technology industrial leadership.\n       (d) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goals.--The long-term strategy for research and \n     development funding under this section would be achieved by a \n     steady 2.5 percent annual increase above the rate of \n     inflation throughout a 11-year period.\n       (2) Inflation assumption.--The authorizations contained in \n     paragraph (3) assume that the rate of inflation for each year \n     will be 3 percent.\n       (3) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for civilian research and development in the agencies listed \n     in subsection (b)--\n       (A) $39,790,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (B) $41,980,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (C) $44,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (D) $46,720,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (E) $49,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (F) $52,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (G) $54,860,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (H) $57,880,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (I) $61,070,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       (J) $64,420,000,000 for fiscal year 2009; and\n       (K) $67,970,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       (4) Acceleration to meet national needs.--\n       (A) In general.--If the amount appropriated for any fiscal \n     year to an agency for the purposes stated in paragraph (3) \n     increases by more than 8 percent over the amount appropriated \n     to it for those purposes for the preceding fiscal year, then \n     the amounts authorized by paragraph (3) for subsequent fiscal \n     years for that agency and other agencies shall be determined \n     under subparagraphs (B) and (C).\n       (B) Exclusion of agency in determining other agency amounts \n     for next fiscal year.--For the next fiscal year after a \n     fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the amount \n     authorized to be appropriated to other agencies under \n     paragraph (3) shall be determined by excluding the agency \n     described in subparagraph (A). Any amount that would, but for \n     this subparagraph, be authorized to be appropriated to that \n     agency shall not be appropriated.\n       (C) Resumption of regular treatment.--Notwithstanding \n     subparagraph (B), an agency may not be excluded from the \n     determination of the amount authorized to be appropriated \n     under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year following a fiscal year \n     for which the sum of the amounts appropriated to that agency \n     for fiscal year 2000 and all subsequent fiscal years for the \n     purposes described in paragraph (3) does not exceed the sum \n     of--\n       (i) the amount appropriated to that agency for such \n     purposes for fiscal year 2000; and\n       (ii) the amounts that would have been appropriated for such \n     purposes for subsequent fiscal years if the goal described in \n     paragraph (1) had been met (and not exceeded) with respect to \n     that agency's funding.\n       (D) No limitation on other funding.--Nothing in this \n     paragraph limits the amount that may be appropriated to any \n     agency for the purposes described in paragraph (3).\n       (e) Conformance with Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds may be made available under \n     this title in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       (f) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 207. PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.\n\n       The President of the United States shall, in coordination \n     with the President's annual budget request, include a report \n     that parallels Congress' commitment to support Federally-\n     funded research and development by providing--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     research and development programs throughout all civilian \n     agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that reflects the funding \n     projections of this title for each future fiscal year until \n     2010, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those terms in chapter 63 of title \n     31, United States Code); and\n       (4) specific proposals for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community.\n\n     SEC. 208. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, shall enter into agreement \n     with the National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to \n     conduct a comprehensive study to develop methods for \n     evaluating Federally-funded research and development \n     programs. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for Federally-funded research and development \n     programs by--\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal government to evaluate Federally-funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which agencies incorporate \n     independent merit-based review into the formulation of the \n     strategic plans of funding agencies and if the quantity or \n     quality of this type of input is unsatisfactory;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying Federally-funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of Federally-funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.--The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000 for the 18-month period beginning \n     October 1, 2000.\n\n     SEC. 209.
