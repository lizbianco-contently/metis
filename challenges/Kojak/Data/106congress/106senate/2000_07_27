ACKER, S.J.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the Senate's guest Chaplain today, \nFather Thomas S. Acker, S.J., for his eloquent prayer opening today's \nsession of the United States Senate.\n  For the last 18 years, Fr. Acker has been serving as President of \nWheeling Jesuit University in Wheeling, West Virginia.\n  During that time, Wheeling Jesuit University has grown to become one \nof the leading universities in the State of West Virginia, and much of \nthat growth is due to the insight and hard work of this Jesuit priest. \nDuring Fr. Acker's tenure at Wheeling Jesuit, the enrollment has \ndoubled--doubled--and the number of buildings and square footage on \ncampus has more than doubled. The addition of the Robert C. Byrd \nNational Technology Transfer Center, the Erma Ora Byrd Center for \nEducational Technologies, and the Alan B. Mollohan Challenger Learning \nCenter on campus places Wheeling Jesuit University in a unique position \nfor growth into the 21st Century, which will begin next year, and has \nmade a difference in the lives of the residents of West Virginia and \nbeyond.\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\n  Recently, Fr. Acker was presented, by Administrator Dan Goldin, with \nthe Distinguished Public Service Medal of the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration, NASA, the highest honor given to a civilian from \nthat agency. This award reflects the high confidence that NASA and its \nAdministrator have in the stewardship of Fr. Acker in connection with \nagency programs administered--where? at Wheeling Jesuit University.\n  Fr. Acker, a native of Cleveland, Ohio, entered the Jesuit order in \n1947. That was my first year in the West Virginia House of delegates. \nHe has a Ph.D. in biology. I don't have a Ph.D. in anything. But I have \ngrandsons who have Ph.Ds. I have two grandsons who have Ph.D.s in \nphysics; not political science but physics. But Fr. Acker has a Ph.D. \nin Biology from Stanford University. He has taught at John Carroll \nUniversity. He has taught at the University of Detroit. He has taught \nat San Francisco University. He has served as Dean of Arts and Sciences \nat St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and worked in \nthe country of Nepal, first as a Fulbright professor and then as \nProject Director of the U.S. Peace Corps.\n\n  Fr. Tom Acker's tenure as the President at Wheeling Jesuit University \nwill end on Monday, July 31, 2000, the last year of the 20th century, \nbut he will not be leaving the State of West Virginia. He has grown to \nlove that State. Rather, he will remain in West Virginia, working in \nthe southern sector to continue his great service to the great State of \nWest Virginia.\n  I look forward to my continued relationship with this strong, \ncompetent, and compassionate man of the cloth, and I congratulate him \non his decision to remain in West Virginia.\n  I listened carefully to his prayer today. He used the words, ``In God \nWe Trust.'' I was in the House of Representatives in 1954, on June 7, \nwhen the House of Representatives passed legislation to include the \nwords ``under God'' in the pledge of allegiance--June 7, 1954; ``under \nGod.'' There are some people in this country who would like to take \nthose words out of that pledge, but not Fr. Acker. I don't think \nanybody here in the Senate would be for that. That was June 7, 1954.\n  June 7, 1955, 1 year to the day, the House of Representatives voted \nto include the words ``In God We Trust,'' to have those words, as the \nnational motto, put on all coins and all currency of the United States. \nThose words were already on some of the coins, but on June 7, 1955, the \nHouse of Representatives voted to have the words ``In God We Trust''--\nthere they are-- ``In God We Trust,'' have that as the national motto \nand have those words on the coins and currency of the United States.\n  I was in the House on both occasions. I am the only person in \nCongress today who was in Congress when we voted to include the words \n``under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance. I thank our visiting \nminister today for his use of those words.\n  He also used the same words from the scriptures that Benjamin \nFranklin used in the Constitutional Convention in 1787 when the clouds \nof dissension and despair held like a pall over the Constitutional \nConvention. Everything was about to break up. They were having a lot of \ndissension, I say to the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from \nFlorida. They were not agreeing on very many things. They were very \ndiscouraged. But Benjamin Franklin stood to his feet and suggested \nthere be prayer at the convention, and he used those scriptures in his \nstatement:\n\n       Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that \n     build it: except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh \n     but in vain.\n\n  Thank you, Father Acker, for using those words and for having as the \ntheme of your prayer this morning ``In God We Trust.'' Thank you.\n  I thank our Chaplain also, and I thank you, again, Father Acker. We \nhope you will enjoy your work in southern West Virginia. We are \nprivileged to have you in my part of the State finally, southern West \nVirginia. My part is the whole State. We thank you, and may God bless \nyou.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from West Virginia and \nthe visiting priest depart, I say to the man who runs this fine school \nin West Virginia--and I believe the Senator from Florida will say--what \na treasure we have in the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Today is a day of solemnity in the Senate. We are going to swear in a \nnew Senator as a result of the death of one of our colleagues. It is a \nday of reflection for all of us. Speaking for myself, and I am sure the \nSenator from Florida, every day we reflect on how fortunate we are to \nhave someone who is a living example of the words that are engraved in \nthe back of this Chamber: ``In God We Trust.'' He is someone to whom we \nall look --both the minority and majority--for ethical standards, for a \nsense of morality that he brings to this body. I say to the priest from \nWest Virginia, the State of West Virginia is well served and has been \nwell served by Senator Robert Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I, too, express my appreciation for the \nbeautiful words of the Senator from West Virginia this morning. And to \nFather Acker: On behalf of the entire Senate, we welcome you today and \nappreciate greatly your words of prayer.\n  This is a special day for all of us, as the Senator from Nevada \nindicated. We will be swearing in a new Senator from Georgia. We do so \nwith heavy hearts, however.\n  I seek recognition now for a few moments to say a few words on the \nlife of our colleague, Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Nevada, who has been very close to me for these several \nyears in which we have served together in the Senate. I appreciate his \nfriendship. I thank him for his good words today. I am grateful, \nflattered, and humbled by them. I thank the distinguished Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7724-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7724]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the 10 days since his sudden passing and the \noutpouring of expression from many different directions have given me \nthe opportunity to reflect on Paul's life, the gifts he brought to the \nSenate, and the impact his life had on people.\n  I want to focus my remarks on Paul Coverdell's humility, which I \nthink was his defining quality, his greatest gift, and one which had \nthe greatest impact on the lives of others.\n  Many people might say that humility, sometimes defined as freedom \nfrom pride or arrogance, is a quality not found often in our society \ntoday. No one disputes, however, that Paul Coverdell possessed a deep \nsense of humility.\n  During the past 10 days, Paul Coverdell has been described as: \nSerious and low key; self-effacing; uncomfortable in the limelight; a \nhumble public servant who became a political giant through selfless \ndedication and quiet civility; a very gentle and courteous person; a \nperson people went to, felt really comfortable with, and opened up to; \na person who really cared for what happened to others; a person many \nregarded as the Senate's leading mediator; a person of scrupulous \nintegrity and unblemished character; a person with an unsurpassed work \nethic and standard of personal ethics and devotion to what he was \ndoing; a person who always kept his word and was someone you could \ncount on--just to mention a few characterizations.\n  How many of us would like to be known as individuals who possess \nthese qualities?\n  Too often we think success results from aggressive, enterprising, \npushy, and contentious behavior. In the case\n\n[[Page S7725]]\n\nof Paul Coverdell, his success resulted from his combination of \nhumility and energy which enabled him to be known as the person who was \nthe cornerstone of the Georgia Republican Party and whose objective was \nto make his State party credible and viable in what had been virtually \na one-party State; who was a political mentor to a number of \npoliticians on both sides of the aisle; who was said by former Senator \nSam Nunn to be ``the person who makes the Senate work;'' and finally, \nDemocrats in his State have said that Paul Coverdell's legacy is one of \nactions and deeds, not words and glory; friendship and trust, not \ncynicism and betrayal.\n\n  There is no question that the outpouring of sentiment of Paul's \nhumility, humanity, and his contribution to his State and to his Nation \nwould have overwhelmed him. He would have been embarrassed by all of \nthe adulation and attention.\n  Paul was the personification of Proverbs 22:4: ``the reward for \nhumility and fear of the Lord . . . is riches and honor and life.'' \nPaul Coverdell surely conducted his life in a manner that resulted in \ngreat riches and honor of public opinion.\n  The Book of Revelation, 20:12, states: ``and I saw the dead, great \nand small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Also, \nanother book was opened, the book of life. And the dead were judged \naccording to their works, as recorded in the books.''\n  Our earthly judgment of Paul Coverdell will surely be confirmed in \nheaven. Paul's works and his hard-working qualities were legendary.\n  I want to take a moment to speak about a passion of Paul's. He often \ntalked of the importance of freedom, challenging each of us to do our \npart to ensure that the legacy of 1776 endures for generations to come. \nI picked out a few of his quotes concerning freedom from some of his \nspeeches, and I want to repeat them today.\n  From a Veteran's Day speech:\n\n       In the end, all that any of us can do with regard to this \n     great democracy is to do our part . . . during our time.\n\n  From a speech to an annual meeting of the Georgia Youth Farmers \nAssociation:\n\n       You live by the grace of God in the greatest democracy in \n     the history of the entire world. And each of us has our own \n     personal responsibility to help care for it, to love it, and \n     to serve it.\n\n  From a speech to an ecumenical service at Ebenezer Baptist Church in \nAtlanta:\n\n       Several years ago I was in Bangladesh, the poorest country \n     in the world, on the day they created their democracy. A \n     Bangladeshi said to me, ``I don't know if you or your fellow \n     citizens of your country understand the role you play for \n     democracy everywhere. It is an awesome responsibility and I \n     don't envy you, but I pray, sir, that you and your fellow \n     citizens continue to accept it.\n\n  Finally, from a speech at an Andersonville, GA, Memorial Day \nceremony:\n\n       I am sure that each of you, like me, has wondered how we \n     can ever adequately honor these great Americans who made the \n     ultimate sacrifice for the preservation of our nation and the \n     great Americans who suffered and endured on these hallowed \n     grounds as prisoners of war. We look across these fields and \n     see monuments. We have heard an elegant poem written by a \n     young American. We have tried through movies to somehow \n     express our gratitude. Nothing ever quite seems to meet the \n     challenge. I have finally concluded in my mind and in my \n     heart that the only way to appropriately express our \n     gratitude is through duty and stewardship to this great \n     nation.\n\n  Paul Coverdell truly expressed his gratitude to his country in the \nmanner in which he lived his life--through his service and stewardship \nto our Nation.\n  Perhaps the ultimate compliment for a politician was accorded Paul \nCoverdell by one of his constituents, who simply said: He gave politics \na good name.\n  Paul was an unsung hero, the glue that bound us together, \nparticularly on the Republican side, but he also had an unusually fair \npresence in the entire body of this Senate. We are blessed and better \noff because of the impact of Paul's humility.\n  I hope I have learned something from him about life. God sent him so \nmany friends--and he recognized us all and embraced us. We are thankful \nand grateful for his presence in our lives. And the loss of Paul \nCoverdell has made me realize just how much I am going to miss each of \nyou when I leave the Senate in a few months.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, it is very hard to adjust to the sad \nreality of Paul Coverdell's absence from the Senate. I miss him very \nmuch. And the Senate, we have to admit, is not the same without him.\n  It was always a genuine pleasure to be in his company. I enjoyed very \nmuch going to Georgia with him during his reelection campaign. I also \nreturned with him to learn more about the severe problems his State's \nagricultural producers were experiencing from the drought. We worked \ntogether on these and other issues that were important to our region on \nthe Senate Agriculture Committee.\n  He was a very influential force in the Senate for the people of his \nState. And he was a thoughtful leader on national issues as well.\n  While we continue to mourn his passing, we should try to carry on \nwith the same determination and energy he brought to the challenges he \nfaced. His example will be a very valuable legacy. Not only has Georgia \nbenefited from his good efforts to represent its interests, but also \nthrough his leadership as Director of the Peace Corps, and on other \ninternational issues, he has made the world a better and safer place \nfor all mankind.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nsetting aside time this morning so many of us could pay tribute to Paul \nCoverdell. Certainly last week, many of us who were friends with Paul \nreally were not up to giving him a proper tribute because the shock of \nlosing one of our friends was so enormous that we really did not feel \nthat we could get through the kind of tribute that Paul deserves. So I \nthank the majority leader for giving us this time.\n  We have now had a chance to collect our thoughts about the sudden \ndeath of our colleague and friend, Paul Coverdell of Georgia. One need \nonly look at the breadth of representation at the memorial service in \nAtlanta to understand the many ways in which Paul's life affected ours.\n  At the service, it was hard to miss the sweet but sad irony that, for \none last time, Paul Coverdell was the great unifier. The Democratic \nGovernor of Georgia, Governor Barnes, called Paul Coverdell--one of \njust a handful of Republicans in the State legislature when Governor \nBarnes, himself, was elected to the legislature in 1974--he called Paul \nhis best teacher in politics. Senator Kennedy, our colleague from \nacross the aisle, with whom Senator Coverdell had tangled on many \nimportant education issues, sat right next to me in the church to honor \nPaul Coverdell.\n  Senator Coverdell is sorely missed in the Senate and in Georgia.\n  He is not missed because he was a great legislator--but he was. His \ninnovative approach to helping families have more flexibility in \neducation spending became the Coverdell education savings account bill.\n  We do not feel his loss as badly as we do simply because he was a \ngreat Senate leader--but he was. His leadership could bring disparate \npolicy and political strands together to form a single, strong bond \nthat allowed us to move forward with our priorities.\n  Others have said it, but I will repeat for emphasis: Paul Coverdell \nwas as close as any Senator comes to being indispensable to his party.\n  He will not be missed most because he was a giant in Georgia \npolitics--but he was. Over the past third of a century, he built, from \nvirtually nothing, the Republican Party of Georgia, starting at a time \nwhen, much as in my own home State of Texas, Republicans numbered only \na few in the state Legislature.\n  Georgia is a better state today--and so is Texas--because there is a \nstrong two-party system. Paul Coverdell is the reason why. And the \npeople of Georgia registered their appreciation by making him the first \nGeorgia Republican in over a century to be reelected to the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7726]]\n\n  And he won't be missed the most because he was an outstanding \nadministrator and a man of vision as the Director of the Peace Corps--\nbut that is certainly the case.\n  Paul was the right man for the job in 1989 when President Bush \nappointed him to head the Peace Corps, just as the Berlin Wall came \ntumbling down.\n  In 1989, Poland, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia were emerging from \nbehind the Iron Curtain. Paul Coverdell thought about his agency. It \nwas a creature of the Cold War, created to keep the Third World from \nfalling prey to communism by exposing those countries to the energy, \npromise and ideals of American youth.\n  The Peace Corps helped win the cold war, and Paul Coverdell had the \nvision to know that it could also help win the peace. Although it had \nbeen dedicated to helping underdeveloped countries with subsistence \nagriculture and infrastructure projects, Director Paul Coverdell saw \nthe promise of helping win the Cold War peace when he asked: ``Why not \nin Europe, too?''\n  Under his leadership, the Peace Corps began sending volunteers into \nEastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, blazing a new trail for \nthis old cold war agency. On June 15, 1990, President George Bush \nwished farewell to the first such volunteers as they departed for \nHungary and Poland.\n  Today, those countries are firmly in the sphere of freedom and \ndemocracy, and last year joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. \nPaul Coverdell's vision had become a reality.\n  When he was director of the Peace Corps, Senator Coverdell emphasized \na particular program that had gone fallow given the many other \npriorities the agency was facing. This program, part of the Peace \nCorps' legislative mandate to foster greater global understanding by \nU.S. citizens, offered fellowship to returning volunteers in exchange \nfor their agreement to work in an underserved American community as \nthey pursued their degree.\n  Senator Coverdell placed renewed emphasis on this program as Director \nof the Peace Corps and has been credited by Peace Corps alumni for his \nleadership in this area. These fellowships, funded through private-\nsector financed scholarships or reduced tuition agreements with \nuniversities and colleges, have been a great success.\n  Paul obviously continued his pursuit of excellence in education with \nmany innovative proposals right here in this body. I will be offering \nlegislation that renames the program the Paul D. Coverdell Peace Corps \nFellowship in memory of his commitment to both the Peace Corps and \neducation.\n  A greater legislator, a leader of his party and of his State, a man \nof peace and vision: These surely describe, Paul Coverdell, but they do \nnot explain the depth and breadth of warm outpouring that we have seen \nsince his sudden death last week.\n  More than any other reason, Senator Coverdell will be missed because \nhe was a sweet, warm man, utterly without pretension.\n  Paul Coverdell: statesman; husband; Senator; leader; but above all, \ngentleman.\n  For all the wonderful tributes our colleagues have offered here in \nthe Senate, and those that were made at Paul's service on Saturday, \nnone surpass in sincerity and simplicity those posted on the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution's tribute web-site by ordinary Georgians.\n  A real reflection of Paul's impact is that there are postings from \nall around the country. But one, in particular, bears quoting. A man \nfrom Duluth, Georgia quotes from a well-known essay: ``The True \nGentleman'' to describe Paul, and it certainly fits:\n\n       The True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from \n     good will . . . whose self-control is equal to all \n     emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his \n     poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity . . . ; who is \n     himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; \n     who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of \n     his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with \n     frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed \n     follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of \n     others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any \n     company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.\n\n  How true these words ring of my friend, Paul Coverdell.\n  I close with the words of a young boy from Georgia, written early in \nthe last century in his school notebook. When assigned to write a short \nthought about how he wanted to live his life, the young boy, just 10 \nyears or so at the time, wrote:\n\n     I cannot do much, said the little star, To make the dark \n           world bright.\n\n     My silver beams cannot pierce far Into the gloom of night.\n\n     Yet--I am part of God's plan, And I will do the best I can.\n\n  That sounds like Paul, another Georgian whose star burned so bright \nand who fulfilled God's plan by doing the best he could.\n  Those words were written by young Richard Russell, as a fourth-grade \nstudent. Richard Russell went on to become a great Senator from \nGeorgia, who, like Paul, died in office in 1971. Russell's name graces \nthe building that houses my office, and Paul Coverdell's, too.\n  Today, we consider those great men and the reward they've gone on to \nenjoy. WE miss them; we miss Paul Coverdell today, and the Senate is a \nlonelier, less happy place without him. Godspeed to our friend.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to comment on the \nextraordinary and wonderful life of my friend and our colleague, Paul \nCoverdell of Georgia. While my abilities are unequal to this task, I \nbelieve I must try, not because my mere comments will add the slightest \nglimmer of luster to his sterling legacy but because it is important \nfor me and those living to contemplate his exemplary character, ways of \nworking, positive spirit, courage, and enthusiasm.\n  The one thing I want to remember most about Paul is that quick, \ngenuine, and, at times, child-like smile he had. It seemed a bit \nwhimsical, sometimes a bit tired, a bit resigned, at first glance; but \non closer observation, that smile was always full of understanding, \ncompassion, and insight into the difficulties we face. Paul's smile was \nnever silly or false but frequent, wise, encompassing, and in empathy \nand comprehension for our frailties, completely knowing our weaknesses \nand encapsulating the precariousness of our human and political \ncondition. Yes, it was fresh and child-like and frequently given; yet \nin that smile was great strength. There was a kind of understanding \nthere that was born of experience, study, insight, and concern. \nMoreover, because it was founded on an honest appreciation of our \npresent condition in this life, its warmth, its humanity never failed \nto inspire.\n  Paul Coverdell was an honest man, an honest broker, an honest leader. \nPaul Coverdell had the courage to act on that honesty, to speak the \ntruth in a positive way. He always saw the glass half full, not half \nempty. These qualities have the capacity to inspire, and they have \nnever failed to inspire me. When I was frustrated, doubtful, and \nconcerned, I always looked for a chance to speak with Paul. On \noccasion, if he sensed I was troubled, he would seek me out. After \nthose conversations I always felt encouraged.\n  As I think on it today, he was a greater encourager for me and for \nothers than I realized at the time. His friendship, insight, and advice \nwere invaluable for my start in the Senate three years ago. I will \ndeeply miss him.\n  On the day following his death, I spoke on this floor and said, that \nI knew we rightly should celebrate his life and not mourn, but I was \nnot able to celebrate at that time because of the hurt of his loss. I \nam better now, but his death has struck me and others in this body \nhard.\n  Still, Paul Coverdell's life is, indeed, to be celebrated. He loved \nhis country. He understood its greatness and uniqueness and deeply \nloved it. He loved the Senate. His tireless work on matters great and \nsmall was abundant evidence of that fact. Paul enjoyed the debate, and \nhelping develop strategy for the leadership, but his ultimate goal was \nalways towards improving his country. That was the constant goal of\n\n[[Page S7727]]\n\nhis service. He loved the Members of the Senate--all of them--even \nthose with whom he disagreed and he was loved in return.\n  Paul Coverdell was a very effective Senator. He followed through on \nhis assignments. He passed legislation and he helped many others pass \nimportant legislation. In that small frame, he had, as Phil Gramm said, \nthe heart of a lion. Paul was a man of great principle and it was a \nrich and deeply understood the American tradition to which he adhered \nwith vigor. Paul was knowledgable. He knew a lot of about a lot of \nthings. Experiences like the Peace Corps had taught him much. That \nknowledge made him wise and helpful to all of us in this body.\n\n  Paul, though not at all naive, was certainly optimistic. Even if he \nknew something bad was about to happen, he looked beyond that bad event \nand saw possibilities in the future for an even greater good. That was \nalways the case with him. I remember numerous occasions in which he saw \nbeyond temporary setbacks and could visualize a positive future. His \noptimism helped shape the agenda of the Republican Conference. It was \nalways his method to focus on our successes, and not on the \nfrustrations. Once one listened fairly to his arguments, one could have \nno choice but to become optimistic also.\n  Certainly this Senate has lost a giant. He held a position of great \nleadership, was projected to continue to rise in leadership and was a \ntireless supporter of all Members of this body.\n  My sympathies, and those of my wife, Mary, are extended to Nancy, to \nhis mother and to other members of the family. They have suffered the \ngreatest loss. The scripture says our time on this Earth is but as a \nvapor. Indeed, James 4:13 puts us in our place. It says:\n\n       Come now, you who say, ``Today or tomorrow we will go to \n     such and such town and spend a year there and get gain,'' \n     whereas you do not know about tomorrow. What is your life? \n     For you are but a mist that appears for a little time and \n     then vanishes. Instead, you should say, If the Lord wills, we \n     shall live and do this or that, and it is your boast in your \n     arrogance.\n\n  That was not Paul. He was not a person of arrogance. More than any \nother person in this body that I can know, he was a man of unassuming \npersonality, a man of genuine humility, a person utterly without \npretension. I think he showed us a lot.\n  I don't know any 150-year-old people. All of us must expect to die. \nOur challenge is to keep the faith, to maintain our ideals, to adhere \nto great principles and to live with enthusiasm. Paul Coverdell was a \ngood man and he set a good example for all of us. His death should call \nus all to intensify our own efforts to fill the void he leaves so that \nwe may serve our country with effectiveness and strengthen the \nqualities that make up this great Senate.\n  I pray God will give us the ability to meet the challenge that are \nbefore us, that he will comfort those who are mourning, and that we can \ncontinue to maintain the ideals that Paul shared with us for a great \nand vigorous and effective America.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning, \nfollowing my distinguished colleague and good friend from Alabama, \nfeeling the same inadequacy to express my thoughts and feelings about \nthe life of someone for whom I had a tremendous amount of respect. As \nPhil Gramm so aptly put it in his eulogy on Saturday, if you knew Paul \nCoverdell, he was your friend. Paul was a friend.\n  I guess in the last week from reading and listening and talking to \npeople about Paul, it is incredible that in this city someone could be \nso universally understood by everyone. All of us are individuals. We \nare very complex.\n  Some often say in Washington that politicians have many facets and \nmany faces. Paul was Paul. He was like that to me. He was like it to \nJeff. He was like it to the Presiding Officer. He was like it to \neveryone here. Everyone who has gotten up and talked about Paul said \nthe same thing in the final analysis. They talked about his decency, \nhis good nature, his peacemaking, his optimism, his energy, and his \nenthusiasm.\n  I understand we are going to compile all of the things that have been \nsaid about Paul. The remarkable thing is the sameness of what everyone \nsays about Paul. It is a remarkable quality in and of itself--that Paul \nwas always Paul. He was always himself. He was never trying to be \nsomething for everyone to meet their expectation. He was who he was, as \ngenuine and as pure as you can possibly be. That is a tremendous gift \nthat he had.\n  It is so resoundingly amplified by the comments of our colleagues \nwhose eulogies and comments have been out of the same embryo. That may \nbe one of the great legacies and lessons of Paul Coverdell and his \nlife.\n  There are a few people who I want to thank. First, I thank Nancy and \nhis mother for the dedication that they gave to Paul in allowing him to \nprovide his service.\n  He spent an incredible amount of time working issues, long days and \nlong nights away from Nancy while she was in Georgia. She made a \ntremendous sacrifice for him and for his career in the Senate. \nObviously, the impact she had on Paul's life was profound and obviously \npositive. The same could be said for his mother. I cannot imagine a \nmother being more proud of a son than Paul's mother was of him and the \ncontribution he made to Georgia, to the Senate, to this country.\n  I thank the people of Georgia for sending the Senate Paul Coverdell. \nHe had some tough races but Georgia stood behind him, supported him, \nand elected a Republican Senator, twice, from the State of Georgia. \nGeorgia should be very proud of that choice.\n  Finally, I thank God for sending Paul, a truly extraordinary person. \nWhen I found out on Tuesday Paul very well may not make it, I was \nsitting in the back talking to Senator Gorton. I was talking about what \na tragic loss it would be should Paul die. I looked around at the \ndesks, I looked at Slade, and I said: I don't know where Paul's desk \nis. He never sat at his desk. He was always running all over the \nplace--down in the well, back in the Cloakroom, running from place to \nplace. He was never at his desk. I thought to myself, where did he sit?\n  What a fitting analysis of the role that Paul Coverdell played in \nthis place. He was everywhere, doing everything, never sitting back at \nhis desk worried about himself or what he would say or do but running \naround making things happen, back in the Cloakroom with that Styrofoam \nWaffle House coffee cup. I don't know where he got all those Styrofoam \nWaffle House cups, but he had one in his hand all the time. There would \nbe two or three placed throughout the Cloakroom by the end of the day. \nEveryone knew where Paul had been. He was just working all the time, \nputting every ounce of his energy--and it was an incredible amount of \nenergy--into his work in the Senate.\n  I was at the funeral on Saturday. Many things were said about Paul \nmoving on from one life to the next. It reminded me of a quote from a \nfuneral I attended earlier this year for Governor Casey in Scranton, \nPA. The quote on the back of the book we received when we came into the \nchurch could not help but remind me of Paul: ``Death is not \nextinguishing the light. It is putting out the lamp because the dawn \nhas come.''\n  Paul's light here in the Senate burned so bright. He illuminated \nevery conversation. Every room he walked into with his energy, with his \npositive attitude, with his optimism. That light will be missed. Lights \nthat seem to burn the brightest are doomed not to burn the longest. If \nwe are measuring the wattage or the illumination that has been cast on \nthis Earth, no one cast more light in 61 years than Paul ever did. It \nis a comfort to know that the dawn for Paul has come and that he is \nexperiencing a brighter light than we all know right now. It is a \ncomfort to know he is experiencing that light and is in heaven.\n  As a Catholic, I believe in intercessory prayer. Those in heaven can \npray to God to help those on Earth. I know Paul is praying for us. I \nask for your prayers, Paul, for all of us here, because we will miss \nyou.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a noble \nSouthern gentleman, Senator Paul Coverdell. All of us in the Senate \nwere saddened by the sudden loss of such a fine man, and we will sorely \nmiss him. As a relative newcomer to the Senate, I have spent a great \ndeal of my time on the Senate floor observing my colleagues. You can \ntell a lot about a person by his demeanor, and I first grew to\n\n[[Page S7728]]\n\nlike Paul Coverdell simply by watching him. He wore a cloak of \npeacefulness around him and he radiated kindness. It was rare to see \nhim without a smile.\n  When I began working with him on the ``Small Watershed Dams \nRehabilitation'' bill, I realized that my first impressions of him had \nbeen accurate. He was, indeed, kind and friendly. It was a pleasure to \nwork with him in a bipartisan manner on an issue that is vital to both \nof our states. As is obvious by his rise within the leadership of the \nRepublican Party, he was extremely loyal to his Party. But he never let \npartisanship interfere with his relationships in the Senate. In short, \nhe was a statesman in every sense of the word.\n  To his wife, Nancy, and the rest of his family, I extend my sincere \ncondolences. Public life is not an easy one, and our country's greatest \nleaders can be identified by the support system that is their family. \nThank you, Nancy, for sharing Paul with the rest of us.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, as we today welcome Senator Coverdell's \nsuccessor, I wanted to talk about the man whose shoes he must fill.\n  Last week the Atlanta Journal Constitution's tribute article to our \nlate friend Paul Coverdell included the following story. Once, at a \ncounty fair on a hot summer day, someone asked Paul why he was wearing \na coat and tie in such a casual setting. Paul replied that he had \nnoticed that in an emergency, when people are trying to figure out what \nto do, they always go to the guy with the tie on.\n  Well, tie or not, Senator Coverdell was a guy whom we always went to.\n  I, like many of us on both sides of the aisle, considered him a \nfriend. His hand and arm gestures will always be remembered as ``get up \nand go'' signs. I had the privilege of lunching with Paul nearly every \nWednesday for the last several years and his presence there was a \ntreat.\n  He was a hard worker. He knew where he wanted to go. And he was \nwilling to help those with whom he teamed on issues--issues that were \ninvariably important and meaningful. I checked last night, and there \nare 103 pieces of legislation listed as sponsored by Senator Coverdell.\n  Now, Paul did work on parochial legislation for his state, and he had \nhis share of technical bills, but he also authored many significant and \nfar-reaching national provisions. He worked for the country as well as \nGeorgia, and strove to improve the education, the safety, and the \nprospects of our children specifically and our citizenry generally.\n  He had an IRS reform bill, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act, \nEducation IRA's, anti-drug legislation . . . and then there are the \ncountless hours spent working on bills for his colleagues and \nconference. Even his commemorative bills were significant--Reagan \nWashington National Airport for example, a bill I jumped to co-sponsor.\n  He had 30 productive years of service to his country--army postings \nin Asia, Georgia State Senate, Peace Corps Director, and an invaluable \nMember of the United States Senate. I was proud to be his friend and \ncolleague. I will miss my friend from Georgia.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe article from the Atlanta Journal Constitution.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, July 19, 2000]\n\n                       He Was a Great, Great Man\n\n\n               Colleagues recall Georgian as hard worker\n\n                             (By Alan Judd)\n\n       Once, when he was chairman of the state Republican Party, \n     Paul Coverdell spent a hot Saturday at a county fair in North \n     Georgia. As always, he was spreading the Republican word. And \n     as usual, despite the casual setting, he was dressed in coat \n     and tie.\n       Lee Raudonis, a longtime aide, recalls that when he asked \n     why, Coverdell responded: ``Well, I've noticed that if \n     there's ever any kind of emergency and people are trying to \n     figure out what to do, they always go to the guy with the tie \n     on.''\n       For three decades, as a Georgia lawmaker, state party \n     leader, Peace Corps director and U.S. senator, Paul Coverdell \n     was the man people went to.\n       As word of his death spread Tuesday, many of those who \n     counted on Coverdell said they couldn't fathom a world in \n     which they couldn't turn to him.\n       ``Unbelievable,'' said state Rep. Bob Irvin of Atlanta, the \n     Georgia House minority leader, a friend of Coverdell's since \n     they met at a campaign rally on July 4, 1968. ``He was my \n     oldest and best friend in politics.''\n       ``We shall miss him as we would miss our own son,'' former \n     President George Bush, one of Coverdell's closest friends, \n     said in a statement. ``We loved him dearly.''\n       Coverdell's death at age 61 came as he reached the pinnacle \n     of a life in politics. Although less than two years into his \n     second six-year term, he was the fifth-highest Republican in \n     the Senate's power structure. And he was the Senate liaison \n     for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Texas \n     Gov. George W. Bush.\n       It was a heady time for Paul Douglas Coverdell, \n     an insurance agent turned politician who moved to Atlanta \n     as a teenager in the early 1950s from his native Des \n     Moines, Iowa.\n       After graduating from Northside High School, he attended \n     the University of Missouri, where he received a bachelor's \n     degree in journalism. He spent two years in the Army before \n     returning to Atlanta to take over his family's insurance \n     business. Soon, his interests turned to politics.\n       In 1970, he was elected to the state Senate from a north \n     Atlanta district. At the time, Republican legislators were \n     rare, so Coverdell formed alliances with like-minded \n     Democrats. By the late 1970s, then-Lt. Gov. Zell Miller had \n     appointed Coverdell to chair the Senate Retirement \n     Committee--a first, said a former Senate colleague, Pierre \n     Howard.\n       ``He was one of the hardest-working, most disciplined, most \n     incisive public servants I've ever known,'' said Howard, who \n     later became lieutenant governor. ``There was nobody who \n     surpassed his work ethic and his ethics and his devotion to \n     what he was doing. You might not agree with him on an issue \n     here or there, but you always knew that he was sincere and \n     that he was well-informed and that he was going to work hard \n     to achieve the objective that he had.''\n       Since the mid-1970s, his objective was to make the GOP \n     credible and viable in what had long been virtually a one-\n     party state.\n       ``He really never, ever let go of this stuff,'' said Rep. \n     John Linder (R-Ga.). ``If there was an evening when he was \n     free from 9 to 12, he'd pace around his driveway and think \n     about what would be next.''\n       Coverdell and other Republicans--Mack Mattingly, a future \n     U.S. senator, and future House Speaker Newt Gingrich, among \n     them --met regularly at St. Simons Island to establish long-\n     range goals for the party.\n       ``That group actually worked to develop what in many ways \n     became the modern Republican Party in Georgia,'' Gingrich \n     said Tuesday night from California. ``We've been a very close \n     team for the last 26 years.''\n       Although a staunch Republican, Coverdell eschewed \n     partisanship. It was a quality that served him well, Gingrich \n     said.\n       ``Paul had several strengths that combined in an unusual \n     way,'' Gingrich said. ``He was very intelligent. He had a \n     great deal of courage. He was willing to take responsibility. \n     He would work very, very hard. And he always kept his word. \n     That gave you somebody you could count on and work with in a \n     very remarkable way.''\n       Beginning in 1978, Coverdell formed a close friendship with \n     another politician, a relationship that would help propel him \n     to a higher political level.\n       While vacationing with his wife, Nancy, in Kennebunkport, \n     Maine, Coverdell opened the local telephone book to look up \n     one of the town's best-known residents: George Bush, the \n     former U.S. ambassador to China and the United Nations. He \n     knocked on Bush's door, and the pair quickly became friends.\n       When Bush ran for president two years later, Coverdell was \n     one of his earliest supporters, serving as his finance \n     chairman in Georgia. Bush lost the Republican nomination to \n     Ronald Reagan. But as vice president, he remained close to \n     Coverdell. The two men were ``not only great political \n     allies, but very close friends,'' said Jean Becker, a \n     spokeswoman for Bush. The Coverdells were frequent guests at \n     the Bush home in Kennebunkport, Becker said. Just last month, \n     they attended Barbara Bush's 75th birthday party there.\n       When Bush became president in 1989--inaugurated on \n     Coverdell's 50th birthday--one of his first acts was to \n     appoint Coverdell director of the Peace Corps. In that job, \n     Coverdell was such a workaholic, Raudonis said, that when \n     once asked to list his hobbies, all he could come up with was \n     ``dining out.''\n       After an Asian tour, Raudonis said, Coverdell proudly \n     pointed out that he had never checked into a hotel. Instead, \n     if he slept at all, it was on planes between destinations.\n       ``Paul was the type who's constantly on the go,'' said \n     Raudonis, who worked for Coverdell for 10 years in Georgia \n     and Washington. ``The idea of having to take 12 hours off to \n     go to a hotel, he couldn't figure out why anybody would do \n     that.''\n       After three years, Coverdell left the Peace Corps in 1992 \n     to seek what friends say he had long wanted: a U.S. Senate \n     seat.\n       In a close race, he unseated Democrat Wyche Fowler. He was \n     re-elected in 1998.\n       Although he ascended to a leadership position in the Senate \n     and maintained a remarkably full schedule, Coverdell had \n     found time in recent years to relax a bit, friends say. He \n     developed a passion for gardening, and his recent Christmas \n     cards included a picture of his flowers.\n\n[[Page S7729]]\n\n       ``My greatest regret for him is that he didn't have the \n     time that he deserved to enjoy himself more,'' Howard said. \n     ``I feel a real sense of loss. He was a great, great man.''\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleagues \nin mourning the loss of Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia.\n  He was a man that I respected and admired. All of us here in the \nSenate feel his absence acutely. Paul Coverdell was a fixture in the \nSenate. I cannot recall how often I have sat at my desk and, looking up \nat C-SPAN, saw him there leading his party on one difficult issue after \nanother. He did so honorably, tenaciously, and modestly. And, of \ncourse, he did so effectively.\n  I feel a real void in the Senate Chamber without his presence and \nfeel a sense of surprise when I look up and see someone other than \nSenator Coverdell at the Republican floor manager's desk.\n  Paul Coverdell touched many lives. I am privileged to have known him \nand count myself lucky to have served in the Senate with him. He was a \nunique and truly special person, taken from us too young and so \nsuddenly.\n  I send to his family, his friends, and his staff my deepest \ncondolences. He was a good man who will be sorely missed. But he will \nalso be remembered by us all, and his spirit will never leave us.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing the \ngrief felt by us all at the passing of Senator Paul Coverdell.\n  As a fellow Southerner, I can tell you that Paul epitomized all that \nis good and noble about the South. He was principled, but always looked \nfor workable solutions to problems. He was a determined advocate, but \nalways added an air of civility to this chamber. He was a Republican \nthrough and through, but always sought out ways to work with the other \nside of the chamber.\n  My friend, the Senior Senator from New York, called Senator Coverdell \na man of peace. I think that sums up his contribution to this world \nvery eloquently.\n  His work, as director of the Peace Corps during a time of world \ntransition, was extremely important. He brought the Peace Corps the \nnations of the Warsaw Pact and the former Soviet Union. This single \ndecision may harvest benefits to this nation that we will enjoy for \nmany generations.\n  Had Senator Coverdell's life work ended there, he would have \naccomplished much for which he and the nation could be proud. However, \nfortunately for the people of Georgia, he continued his life in public \nservice.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1997, one of the first bills that I \nworked on as a Democratic sponsor was with Paul Coverdell. I will \nalways remember the warm reception that he gave me, and the \nencouragement to go forward with the Coverdell-Landrieu Protecting the \nRights of Property Owners Act.\n  Since I had just finished a bruising campaign it was such a pleasure \nto be welcomed in such a warm and bipartisan manner from this southern \ngentleman.\n  Senator Coverdell was also an early and ardent supporter of the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act. As many in this Chamber well know, I \nhave pestered and cajoled my colleagues on CARA for 2\\1/2\\ years.

Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request for \nthe leader.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \nmajority leader, after consultation with the minority leader, to \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 460, S. 1796, under the \nfollowing limitations: 2 hours for debate equally divided between the \nchairman and ranking members, or their designees.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the only amendment in order be a \nMack, Lautenberg, Leahy, and Feinstein substitute amendment No. 4021.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding \nback of time, and the disposition of the above-listed amendment, the \nbill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of the bill as amended, if amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that we have reached a time \nagreement to take up and consider S.1796, the Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act. However, it is regrettable that we could not pass this \nimportant legislation by unanimous consent this week, as I had hoped.\n  The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act addresses an issue that \nshould deeply concern all of us: the enforcement of court-ordered \njudgments that compensate the victims of state-sponsored terrorism. \nThis legislation has the strong support of American families who have \nlost loved ones due to the callous indifference to life of \ninternational terrorist organizations and their client states, and it \ndeserves our support as well.\n  One such family is the family of Alisa Flatow, an American student \nkilled in Gaza in a 1995 bus bombing. The Flatow family obtained a $247 \nmillion judgment in Federal court against the Iranian-sponsored Islamic \nJihad, which proudly claimed responsibility for the bombing that took \nher life. But the family has been unable to enforce this judgment \nbecause Iranian assets in the United States remain frozen.\n  This bill would provide an avenue for the Flatow family and others in \ntheir position to recover the damages due them under American law. It \nwould permit successful plaintiffs to attach certain foreign assets to \nsatisfy judgments against foreign states for personal injury or death \ncaused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabotage, \nhostage taking, or the provision of material support or resources for \nsuch an act. Meanwhile, it allows the President to waive the bill's \nprovisions if that is necessary for the national security interest.\n  Some have raised concerns that the legislation could cause the United \nStates to violate its treaty obligations to protect the diplomatic \nproperty of other nations, and thus provoke retaliation against our \ndiplomatic property in other nations. I believe that this bill can and \nshould be construed as being consistent with our international \nobligations, and I trust the State Department to ensure that it does \nnot compromise the integrity of our diplomatic property abroad. I want \nto commend Senator Biden for working with the sponsors and the State \nDepartment to help fashion the changes to S.1796 that help accomplish \nthat goal.\n  I am also pleased that the time agreement will allow the Senate to \nconsider a Mack-Lautenberg-Leahy-Feinstein amendment dealing with \nsupport for victims of international terrorism. This amendment will \nenable the Office for Victims of Crime to provide more immediate and \neffective assistance to Americans who are victims of terrorism abroad--\nAmericans like those killed or injured in the embassy bombings in Kenya \nand Tanzania, and in the Pan Am 103 bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland. \nThese victims deserve help, but according to OVC, existing programs are \nfailing to meet their needs. Working with OVC, we have crafted \nlegislation to correct this problem.\n\n  Our amendment will permit the Office for Victims of Crime to serve \nthese victims better by expanding the types of assistance for which the \nVOCA emergency reserve fund may be used, and the range of organizations \nto which such funds may be provided. These changes will not require new \nor appropriated funds: They simply allow OVC greater flexibility in \nusing existing reserve funds to assist victims of terrorism abroad, \nincluding the victims of the Lockerbie and embassy bombings.\n  Our amendment will also authorize OVC to raise the cap on the VOCA \nemergency reserve fund from $50 million to $100 million, so that the \nfund is large enough to cover the extraordinary costs that would be \nincurred if a terrorist act caused massive casualties, and to replenish \nthe reserve fund with unobligated funds from its other grant programs.\n  At the same time, the amendment will simplify the presently-\nauthorized system of using VOCA funds to provide\n\n[[Page S7730]]\n\nvictim compensation to American victims of terrorism abroad, by \npermitting OVC to establish and operate an international crime victim \ncompensation program. This program will, in addition, cover foreign \nnationals who are employees of any American government institution \ntargeted for terrorist attack. The source of funding is the VOCA \nemergency reserve fund, which we authorized in an amendment I offered \nto the 1996 Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act.\n  Finally, our amendment clarifies that deposits into the Crime Victims \nFund remain available for intended uses under VOCA when not expended \nimmediately. This should quell concerns raised regarding the effect of \nspending caps included in appropriations bills last year and this. I \nunderstand the appropriations' actions to have deferred spending but \nnot to have removed deposits from the Fund. This provision makes that \nexplicit.\n  I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her support and assistance on \nthis initiative. Senator Feinstein cares deeply about the rights of \nvictims, and I am pleased that we could work together on some \npractical, pragmatic improvements to our federal crime victims' laws. \nWe would have liked to do more. In particular, we would have liked to \nallow OVC to deliver timely and critically needed emergency assistance \nto all victims of terrorism and mass violence occurring outside the \nUnited States and targeted at the United States or United States \nnationals.\n  Unfortunately, to achieve bipartisan consensus on our amendment, we \nwere compelled to restrict OVC's authority, so that it may provide \nemergency assistance only to United States nationals and employees. It \nseems more than a little bizarre to me that the richest country in the \nworld would reserve emergency aid for victims of terrorism who can \nproduce a passport or W-2. I will continue to work with OVC and \nvictims' organization to remedy this anomaly.\n  I regret that we have not done more for victims this year, or during \nthe last few years. I have on several occasions noted my concern that \nwe not dissipate the progress we could be making by focusing \nexclusively on efforts to amend the Constitution. Regretfully, I must \nnote that the pace of victims legislation has slowed noticeably and \nmany opportunities for progress have been squandered.\n  I am hopeful that we can make some progress this year by passing our \namendment to S.1796, and I look forward to continuing to work with the \nAdministration, victims groups, prosecutors, judges and other \ninterested parties on how we can most effectively assist victims and \nprovide them the greater voice and rights that they deserve.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in just a moment we will hear the maiden \nspeech of the new junior Senator from Georgia. First, I want to say he \nis certainly going to have an excellent senior Senator from Georgia \nwith whom to work. I hope he will follow Senator Cleland's admonition \nto ``go for the max'' every day.\n  We extend our congratulations and our hearty welcome to the new \njunior Senator from Georgia, Mr. Zell Miller. We spoke briefly, and he \nknows we have heavy hearts still for our friend, Senator Paul \nCoverdell, but we appreciate the way in which he has approached this \nposition already.\n  He is one of our colleagues. He is a Senator. We welcome him, and we \ncommit to him to work with him on behalf of the people of Georgia and \nthe United States.\n  Congratulations and welcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I join the majority leader and my \ncolleagues in welcoming the newest Member of the Senate, Senator Zell \nMiller of Georgia.\n  Two things bring Zell Miller to the Senate. The first is the sudden \ndeath of our friend Paul Coverdell which has left us all very deeply \nsaddened. The other thing that brings Zell Miller to the Senate is his \nown profound sense of duty to his State and his Nation.\n  Zell Miller did not seek this job. In fact, he did not want it. Two \nweeks ago, he and his wife Shirley were living in his hometown, a tiny \nspeck on the map, a place called Young Harris in the mountains of north \nGeorgia. They were living in the same house his mother built herself \nnearly 70 years ago with yellow stones she hauled out of a nearby \nriver.\n  He was teaching history and politics at Young Harris College where he \nbegan his working life more than 40 years earlier and where his father \nhad taught before him. He was happier than he could ever recall being. \nHe had no intention of ever holding public office again and certainly \nno intention of moving to Washington.\n  Then came the awful shock of Senator Coverdell's death. In the days \nthat followed, when he was asked if he would serve out the term, Zell \nMiller realized there was something that had a stronger claim on his \nheart than that old yellow stone house and hills surrounding it; that \nwas serving the people of Georgia.\n  Zell Miller has spent more than 40 years doing exactly that. He began \nhis public life in 1958 when he ran for mayor of his hometown. In 1960, \nhe was elected to the Georgia State Senate at the age of 28. In 1974, \nhe won his first statewide race for Lieutenant Governor, an office he \nheld for 16 years. In 1990 and again in 1994, the people of Georgia \nchose him to be their Governor.\n  During his first term as Governor, Zell Miller guided Georgia through \na serious recession without raising taxes or cutting vital services. \nThroughout his years as Governor, Zell Miller invested heavily in all \nlevels of Georgia's public education system, including statewide \nprekindergarten, school technology, and new school construction. A \ncornerstone of his legacy as Georgia's Governor is the HOPE Scholarship \nProgram, which covers college tuition for every Georgia student who \ngraduates high school with a B average or better.\n  Years before others, he saw how technology could bring new hope and \nopportunities to rural communities. In his\n\n[[Page S7731]]\n\nfirst 2 years as Governor, he established a long-distance learning \nprogram and a telemedicine network in Georgia. He cut taxes for working \nfamilies and oversaw the passage of tougher penalties for violent and \nrepeat criminals. Through it all, he remained Georgia's most popular \nGovernor since political polling began. When he left the Governor's \noffice in 1999, polls showed him with an approval rating of about 85 \npercent.\n  One reason he was such a successful Governor is that, like Paul \nCoverdell, Zell Miller builds bridges, not walls; like Senator \nCoverdell, he is committed to bipartisan progress. They are not from \nthe same party, but in some fundamental ways they are cut from the same \ncloth.\n  Zell Miller's success is that he has always taken the long view. As \nhe once told a reporter:\n\n       I'm enough of a history professor to know that your real \n     judge is not your contemporaries, but history.\n\n  In deciding public policy, he has said, the most important question \nis not, How will this affect my chances in the next election? The \nproper question is, What will this mean for my grandchildren?\n  Mr. President, I can't think of a better standard by which to judge \nour decisions in this body, nor can I think of a better person to fill \nthe seat vacated by our friend Paul Coverdell.\n  Senator Miller, welcome to the Senate. We are honored to have you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7731-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, to the distinguished Members of the \nSenate, first let me say how much I appreciate those very generous \nwelcoming remarks.\n  I do not rise this morning to tell you more about myself or to \nintroduce myself to you because there will be time enough for that \nlater. I rise instead to add my voice to the remarkable chorus that has \nechoed forth from this floor to the marble floors under Georgia's \nCapitol dome, a chorus of praise for Paul Coverdell. The pain and the \nlove that the majority leader showed as he made that terrible \nannouncement on the Senate floor touched many hearts in Georgia. The \neloquence of Senator Moynihan's tribute still rings in our ears. And \nthe personal tribute from Senator Gramm, a native son of Georgia, I \nfound especially moving. When he spoke of Paul as a man with a thin \nbody, a squeaky voice, but the heart of a lion, heads were nodding and \neyes were misting up from the Potomac River to the Chattahoochee River.\n  Then this morning, I sat in the gallery and listened to the \noutpouring of love and praise you had for Senator Coverdell.\n  On behalf of the people of Georgia, I thank you. I thank you for your \nwords and your tears and your testimony to one of Georgia's finest \nsons.\n  You who served with Paul knew him well. I served with Paul and knew \nhim well also. I served with him when he was an up-and-coming State \nSenator and I was the Senate President--Paul, a Republican; I, a \nDemocrat. Yet Paul impressed me with his ability and his integrity and \nhis bipartisan commitment to serving the people first and politics \nsecond that I named him as one of the first Republican committee \nchairmen since Reconstruction in our heavily Democratic State senate.\n  In that job and in that State senate, Paul flourished. He reached \nacross party lines to build coalitions to reform education, improve our \nschools, and open up our government to the people.\n  Later, as the Director of the Peace Corps, Paul's dignity and decency \ninspired countless young people to serve their fellow man; and then his \nservice in this Senate, where in less than 8 years he rose to be one of \nthe most influential, respected, and beloved Members of this august \nbody.\n  Now, when I think of Paul Coverdell, I am reminded of St. Paul's \nletter to Timothy. It is as if it were written by Senator Paul rather \nthan St. Paul: I have fought a good fight. I have finished my course. I \nhave kept the faith.\n  Today it is up to us to take up that fight, to continue that course, \nto keep that faith.\n  You are, of course, aware of Paul's tireless work here in this body \non behalf of the schoolchildren of this country. Yet his work here was \njust an extension of his lifelong commitment to education. We served \ntogether as trustees on the board of that tiny college, Young Harris \nCollege, in the tiny village that is my hometown.\n  Paul Coverdell had faith in education, and I intend to keep that \nfaith. In Georgia, Paul was a leader early on of a reform movement that \nbelieved that sunlight was the best disinfectant. So working together \nacross party lines, we opened up the Senate Chambers and the smoke-\nfilled rooms and gave government back to our people. Paul Coverdell had \na faith in open, honest government, and I will keep that faith.\n  In the Peace Corps and in the Senate, Paul was convinced that as the \nbeacon of freedom for all the world, America could not hide her light \nunder a bushel. And so he worked to keep America strong, to keep \nAmerica engaged in the world, to ensure that she is always an ally to \nbe trusted and an adversary to be feared. Paul Coverdell had limitless \nfaith in America, and I intend to keep that faith.\n  In addition to what he accomplished, Paul will always be remembered \nfor how he accomplished it. He was as committed a Republican as I am a \ndedicated Democrat. Yet he was always looking for ways to get things \ndone across party lines. He did so not by abandoning his principles but \nby heeding and listening to the proverb:\n\n       A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir \n     up anger.\n\n  I am a different man from Paul Coverdell. I have rarely been accused \nof giving soft answers and, in my day, I suppose I have uttered more of \nmy share of grievous words that have stirred up anger. But I also have \nthe commitment to getting things done for my State and our Nation, a \ncommitment to work with anyone, regardless of party, who shares that \ncommitment. Paul Coverdell had a powerful faith in bipartisan progress, \nand I intend to keep that faith.\n  Let me repeat to this Senate the pledge I made to my Governor and to \nthe people of Georgia when I accepted this mission. I will serve no \nsingle political party but, rather, 7.5 million Georgians, and every \nday I serve I will do my best to do so in the same spirit of dignity, \nintegrity, and bipartisan cooperation that were the hallmarks of Paul \nCoverdell's career.\n  Thank you.\n  [Applause.]\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7731-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise once again to address the issue of \npork-barrel spending in an appropriations bill, in this case the \ndefense appropriations conference report. This bill will pass by an \noverwhelming margin and with minimal debate. It will occasion the \nrelease of innumerable press statements attesting to our individual \nsuccesses in bringing home the bacon.\n  As we worship at the altar of pork-barrel spending, let's reflect a \nbit on the merits of our activities with respect to the practice of \nadding unrequested programs to the defense budget for parochial \nreasons. When the defense appropriations bill first emerged from \ncommittee, some of us found interesting the inclusion of language \nurging the Secretary of Defense to ``take steps to increase the \nDepartment's use of cranberry products.  . . .'' What I referred to at \nthe time as ``the cranberry incident,'' Mr. President, in retrospect \nrepresented the high point of the process by which this conference \nreport was assembled.\n  There are over $7 billion in unrequested member-adds in this bill--\nover $7 billion. That does not just represent a continuation of \nbusiness as usual pork-barrel spending; it represents an egregious \nexpansion of a practice that drains vital resources from a military \nthat has witnessed a multitude of readiness problems while deploying at \nrecord-high levels. As we struggle with answers to such problems as how \nto modernize tactical aviation, maintain a fleet of sufficient size and \ncapability to execute its mission, and fund ongoing and unforeseen \ncontingencies, it is less than reassuring to read through the defense \nspending bill and see $1.8 million earmarked for development of a \nhandheld holographic radar gun, although Trekkies across the nation \nwill no doubt be pleased by this project.\n  It is tiresome to scan these bills every year and see the annual \nmember-adds of millions of dollars for spectral hole burning \napplications and for free electron lasers. And it is particularly \ntiresome, right after passing an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill that included an executive jet for the commandant of the Coast \nGuard, to see in this bill a $60 million earmark for a new 737 for \nCINCPAC--an important command but $60 million for an aircraft that was \nneither requested nor required constitutes just one of many \nquestionable additions to this bill.\n  We have finally reversed 15 years in declines in defense spending, \nbut for what purpose. To transfer $10 million to the Department of \nTransportation to realign railroad tracks in Alaska? To transfer $5 \nmillion to the National Park Service for repair improvements at Fort \nBaker in northern California? To transfer another $5 million to the \nChicago Public Schools to convert a former National Guard Armory? Was \nour objective in increasing defense spending to allow us to more freely \nearmark funding for such endeavors as the $500,000 for Florida Memorial \nCollege for funding minority aviation training; $21 million for the \nCivil Air Patrol; to continue to fund a weather reconnaissance squadron \nin Mississippi that the Air Force has been trying to get rid off for \nmore years than I can remember? There is over $4 million in this bill \nfor the Angel Gate Academy. There is the now annual allocation to \npreserve Civil War-era vessels at the bottom of Lake Champlain, this \nyear in the amount of $15 million. There is $2 million for the Bosque \nRedondo Memorial in New Mexico and the usual $3 million for \nhyperspectral research.\n  If a project is so worthy of Defense Department support, why doesn't \nit ever show up in a budget request? Why do we need to add money every \nsingle year for the National Automotive Center and its prize off-shoot, \nthe Smart Truck Initiative. With another $3.5 million in the fiscal \nyear 2001 defense bill for Smart Truck, I'm beginning to wonder if the \nintellect of this truck will be such that it will not only be capable \nof heating up a burrito, but will also perform advanced calculus while \nquoting Kierkegaard. When I look through this bill, I begin to lose \nsight of its fundamental purpose. The distinction between the defense \nbill and the Health and Human Services bill gets lost when you see $8.5 \nmillion for the Gallo Center for Alcoholism Research, $4 million for \nthe Gallo Cancer Center--see a pattern emerging?--another $1.5 million \nfor nutrition research, $1.5 million for chronic fatigue syndrome \nresearch, and, of course, $1 million for the Cancer Center of \nExcellence--this latter add a reminder that if you call something a \n``center of excellence'' you are assured of being a beneficiary of \nCongress's largess.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not take issue with research into important \nhealth problems affecting millions of Americans. But the abuse of the \ndefense budget grows every year. It has long been used as a cash-cow \nfor pet projects, but did that have to extend to the allocation of \nmillions of dollars for programs of such exceedingly low priority that \nthey don't even show up on already politicized unfunded priority lists?\n  Astronomical Active Optics, Mr. President, were deemed worthy of over \n$3 million in defense funds, as was coal based advanced thermally \nstable jet fuel. Fifteen million dollars for the Maui Space \nSurveillance System, another annual add, $5 million for the Hawaii \nFederal Health Care Network, $8 million for the Pacific Island Health \nCare Referral Program, $1 million for the Alaska Federal Health Care \nNetwork, $1.5 million for AlaskAlert, $7 million for MILES 2000 \nequipment at Fort Wainwright, Alaska, $7.5 million for a C-130 \nsimulator for the Alaska National Guard, the annual $10 million\n\n[[Page S7733]]\n\nfor utilidor repairs at Eielson Air Force Base and Fort Wainwright, \nAlaska, and $21 million for an unmanned threat emitter system for \nEielson, and $7 million to sustain operations at Adak Naval Air \nStation, an installation of apparently marginal utility or the Navy \nwould include it in its funding request. Re-use of Fort Greely, Alaska, \nreceives $7 million for airfield improvement. One of my favorites, \n$300,000 for the Circum-Pacific Council for the Crowding the Rim Summit \nInitiative, represents a new addition to this list.\n  The inclusion of so-called ``Buy American'' provisions continue to \nwaste billions of dollars every year. These out-dated protectionist \npolicies serve neither U.S. nor allied interests. It goes against the \nbasic logical policy of getting the best product for the best price for \nthe men and women who wear our nation's uniform. Additionally, these \nprovisions, for example, the requirement to purchase only propellers \nmanufactured in the United States, were added in conference--a practice \nwith which I take strong exception and will discuss further in a \nminute.\n  I have repeatedly addressed the growing perversion of the process by \nwhich budget requests and service Unfunded Priority Lists are put \ntogether. It has been clear for several years now that the services are \nunder considerable political pressure from Capitol Hill to include in \ntheir budget requests or, at a minimum, on the Unfunded Priority Lists, \nunnecessary and unwanted items. Funding for the ubiquitous LHD \namphibious assault ship for Mississippi is the classic example of this \nphenomenon. Indeed, the Defense Department and the Navy's rejection in \nthe past of proposals to incrementally fund ships has given way to \nunrelenting pressure from members of Congress to so fund the LHD. \nSimilarly, C-130s and passenger jets are routinely added to the UFR \nlists solely as a result of political pressure. In effect, then, my \nefforts at highlighting pork-barrel spending have resulted to some \ndegree in the problem being pushed underground. That's called progress \nin Congress. It's called deception everywhere else.\n  The fiscal year 2001 defense appropriations conference report takes \nthe problem a major step further. The integrity of the budget process \nis under a new and devastating assault by the Appropriations Committee. \nThere is in this conference report language specifying the very weapon \nsystems the committee expects to see included in future budget \nsubmissions. It is a long list prefaced with the warning that ``the \nconferees expect the component commanders to give priority \nconsideration to the following items . . . ,'' which it then goes on to \ndetail.\n  Finally, I would like to address the equally fascinating tendency of \nthe Appropriations Committees to arrive at final budget numbers that \nexceed what was in either House or Senate bill. It is my understanding \nthat conference is a process whereby differences between respective \nbills are the subject of negotiations resulting in agreements that \neither match one of the two numbers in question or find a compromise in \nbetween. I find it interesting, therefore, that this conference report \nhas 166 instances of final numbers exceeding those that were in either \nbill. In many instances, funding was added in conference for which none \nwas included in either chamber's bill. For example, $17 million was \nadded in conference for a capital purchase plan for Pearl Harbor, and \n$10 million materialized for modifications to M113 armored personnel \ncarriers. There is $10 million in the conference report which was in \nneither bill to continue the artificial issue of test firing Starstreak \nmissiles, and $1 million for natural gas microturbines. In this bill \nvital for our national defense is $1.7 million for the South Florida \nOcean Management Center and $1 million for Community Hospital \nTelehealth Competition. And, of course, the $60 million for CINCPAC's \nnew 737 was added in conference. For none of these programs, totaling \nover $200 million, was funding included in either the House or the \nSenate bill.\n  The total dollar amount for the entire category of conference items \nfor which no funding was included in either chamber's bill or for which \nthe final number exceeds what was in either bill is over $2 billion. \nTwo billion dollars, Mr. President, in unrequested, unnecessary items \nthat emerged miraculously in conference. I've heard of the fog of war \nresulting in horrendous casualties, but I'm perplexed by this fog of \nnegotiating that results in horrendous budgets.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, I could go on for another hour. I think, \nhowever, that I have made my point. The $7 million in the defense bill \nfor the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico, combined with the \naforementioned adds for Astronomical Active Optics and the Maui Space \nSurveillance System leads me to ponder the universe of pork-barrel \nspending at a higher philosophical plane than in the past. We are \nadding millions of dollars every year to the defense bill so that we \nmay better scan the heavens, perhaps as part of an ultimately futile \neffort to better understand our place in the cosmos. Only by applying \nsuch logic to the process of reviewing spending bills upon which we \nvote, however, can I hope to understand the phenomenon by which we \nregularly send billions of dollars down a black hole. At the end of the \nday, I guess Einstein's theory of relativity, as well as Newtonian laws \nof gravity, are at the center of the budget process. The practice of \npork-barrel spending has been out of control for years; only now can we \ntake it to a cosmic level never before contemplated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list to which I \nreferred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CONFERENCE REPORT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001 OUT OF SCOPE ITEMS (THOUSANDS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Program                                  Budget     House      Senate   Conference\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDefense Acquisition University.....................................   $100,331   $100,331   $100,331    $102,331\nDefense Finance & Accounting Service...............................      1,416      1,416      1,416       2,416\nArmy National Guard Information Mgt................................     20,115     25,115     20,115      27,315\nUH-60 Blackhawk Helicopter.........................................     64,651    183,371    120,451     189,601\nTH-47 Kiowa Warrior Helicopter.....................................          0      1,800          0      24,000\nM113 Armored Personnel Carrier Upgrades............................          0          0          0      10,000\nSpecial Purpose Vehicles...........................................      1,021      1,021      1,021       6,671\nNational Guard Multi-role Bridge Co.'s.............................          0          0          0       1,000\nLaunched Grapnel Hooks.............................................          0          0          0       1,000\nAV-8B Litening Targeting Pods......................................     40,639     40,639     81,139     120,639\nShoulder-fired Lightweight Assault Weapon 83 mm HEDP...............          0          0          0       5,000\nCapital Purchase Plan (Pearl Harbor)...............................          0          0          0      17,000\nAir Traffic Control On-board Trainer...............................          0      3,000          0       4,000\nShipboard Programmable Integrated Communication Terminals..........          0          0          0       3,000\nF/A-18 Technical Manual Digitization...............................          0          0          0       5,200\nAdvanced Technical Information System..............................          0          0          0       2,000\nBoeing 737 for CINCPAC Executive Jet...............................          0          0          0      60,000\nIntegrated Bridge System for NSW Rigid Inflatable Boat.............          0          0          0       4,000\nNatl Guard WMD Civil Support Team Equip............................          0          0          0         900\nEmergency Support Heli-Basket......................................          0          0          0       2,500\nTank Trajectory Correctable Munition...............................          0          0          0       3,000\nAir Force Cntr of Acquisition Reengineering........................          0          0          0       2,000\nAir Force Knowledge Management Project.............................          0          0          0       2,000\nHandheld Holographic Radar Gun.....................................          0          0          0       1,000\nEnvironmental Quality Technology...................................     13,994     54,494     19,994      60,994\nElectronics and Electronic Devices.................................     23,869     40,969     34,469      41,269\nDefense Research Sciences..........................................    132,164    132,164    136,414     137,914\nMaterials Technology Research......................................     11,557     15,557     24,557      27,557\nEW Technology Research.............................................     17,310     17,310     17,310      22,310\nMissile Technology Research........................................     47,183     69,183     55,183      70,683\nModeling and Simulation Technology.................................     30,479     32,479     35,479      36,479\nVehicle and Automotive Technology..................................     63,589     68,589     87,089      89,089\nCountermine Systems................................................     12,386     17,786     17,786      17,886\nMedical Technology.................................................     75,729     98,729    102,229     112,729\nWarfighter Advanced Technology.....................................     15,469     17,469     20,469      21,969\nVehicle and Automotive Adv.

$2.2 Billion.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not intend to take all of my time. I \nwould like to have Senator Gramm use some of his time.\n  I would like to say I am not proud to be here on the floor. This bill \nprobably ranks up with the two or three of the most outrageous pork-\nbarrel spending bills that I have observed in my years here since 1987. \nI should have demanded that the bill be read and I should be doing \neverything I can to block it. I intend to explain why.\n  This bill, I say in all respect--in all respect to the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, and my good friend from Hawaii--is a \ndisgrace. This bill has had $2 billion added on in conference--added on \nin conference. Not a single Member of this body who was not part of the \nconference had anything to say about $2 billion--B, billion--that was \nadded in conference. As I say, I have not seen anything quite this \nbad--or perhaps I have, but it is very rare. This is a remarkable \ndocument. It has millions and millions and millions of dollars devoted \nto projects that have nothing to do with national defense.\n  Mr. President, there is $4 million--excuse me--$8.5 million for the \nGallo Center for Alcoholism Research. What is the Gallo Center for \nAlcoholism Research? That was added in the conference.\n  It has $4 million for the Gallo Cancer Center, $1.5 million for \nchronic fatigue syndrome research, $1 million for the Cancer Center of \nExcellence. What does the Cancer Center of Excellence have to do with \nnational defense?\n  Mr. President, there are $4 million in this bill for the Angel Gate \nAcademy. What is the Angel Gate Academy? There is now an allocation to \npreserve Civil War-era vessels at the bottom of Lake Champlain, this \nyear in the amount of $15 million; $2 million for the Bosque Redondo \nMemorial.\n\n  I am one of the few Members who know what the Bosque Redondo Memorial \nis. That is when we marched the Navajo Nation to Canyon de Chelle and \nkilled thousands of the Navajo Nation. What does that have to do with \ndefense?\n  Mr. President, $3 million for hyperspectral research; astronomical \nactive optics were deemed worthy of over $3 million in defense funds, \nas was coal-based advanced thermally stable jet fuel. Coal-based jet \nfuel? What do we have, a guy in the back of the plane shoveling coal?\n  Mr. GRAMM. The Germans tried that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, $7 million--of course Alaska is here, of \ncourse Hawaii is here. There is $5 million for the Hawaii Federal \nHealth Care Network. I say to the Senator, my dearest friend, what in \nthe world is the Pacific Island Health Care Referral Program? The \nHawaiian Islands Federal Health Care Network? Alaska Federal Health \nCare Network? $1.5 million for AlaskAlert, $7 million for equipment at \nFort Wainwright, $7.5 million for the C-130 simulator.\n  There is a gift for CINCPAC, Commander in Chief of the U.S. Forces in \nthe Pacific. Perhaps he needs a new $60 million airplane. Perhaps he \nneeds it, I don't know. We will never know because it was not in the \nHouse bill, it was not in the Senate bill, and it was put in in \nconference, $60 million.\n  This is a remarkable document. I have submitted for the Record a \nfour-page document. Many pages show: Budget, zero; House, zero; Senate, \nzero; Conference--a Capital Purchase Plan at Pearl Harbor: Budget, \nzero; House,\n\n[[Page S7735]]\n\nzero; Senate, zero; Conference, $5 million. What is that all about? \nWhat is that all about? Was it ever discussed on the floor of the \nSenate? Was it ever discussed at a hearing? Was it ever, dare I say, \ndiscussed in the Senate Armed Services Committee, which is the \nauthorizing committee for these projects? Was it ever? No.\n  This is quite remarkable. Air Force Center of Acquisition \nReengineering: Budget, zero; House, zero; Senate, zero; Conference, $2 \nmillion.\n  There is a Handheld Holographic Radar Gun--I repeat that--a Handheld \nHolographic Radar Gun: Budget, zero; House, zero; Senate, zero; \nConference, $1 million.\n  Is there anyone in this body besides the appropriators, besides the \nappropriators in this body, who is going to vote $1 million of the \ntaxpayers' money who knows what in the world a Handheld Holographic \nRadar gun is? Perhaps the Presiding Officer knows. He is a very smart \nguy. Perhaps Senator Gramm--he is an economist; he is a former college \nprofessor--perhaps he knows.\n  Here is one. Information Networking Systems: Budget, zero; House, \nzero; Senate, zero; Conference, $12.5 million. What does that mean?\n  Intelligent Power Control Vehicle Systems: House, zero; Senate, zero; \nBudget, zero; Conference, $4.1 million. What does that mean?\n  One of my annual favorites--here is one that really is puzzling. Air \nVehicle Dem/Val Bridge Contracts: Budget, zero; House, zero; Senate, \nzero; Conference, $88,984,000.\n  My friends, you are going to vote to appropriate $88,984,000 of \ntaxpayers' dollars for an Air Vehicle Dem/Val Bridge Contract.\n  Here is another one, Advanced Food Service Technology: Budget, zero; \nHouse, zero; Senate, zero; $2.5 million for Advanced Food Service \nTechnology. Mr. President, Advanced Food Service Technology? Again, \nwhat is that all about? Was it ever requested by the administration?\n  The answer is no.\n  Compass Call--I will not go into the Compass Call.\n  NTW missile defense radar competition. That may be very important. \nBudget, zero; House, zero; Senate, zero; conference, $80 million. I say \nto my friends, $80 million will be spent on NTW missile defense radar \ncompetition which, again, never had a hearing in the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, was never discussed on the floor of the Senate, \nnever discussed on the floor of the House, and 80 million of taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  Here is another one. Information Technology Center. Budget, zero. For \nthe uninitiated, ``budget'' means requested by the administration. The \nadministration requested no money for it. The House put in no money for \nit in their Defense appropriations bill. The Senate put zero dollars in \ntheir bill. Yet it emerged from conference: Information Technology \nCenter, $20 million; $20 million is now being spent on the Information \nTechnology Center which none of us knows what in the world it is, \nexcept for a chosen few.\n  What is happening here is that Members of the Senate and House who \nare not members of the Appropriations Committee are being deprived of \ntheir rights to knowledge and voting and discussing, debating, and \nmaking judgment on programs. And we are talking about big money here. \nWe are talking about $2 billion--B, billion--that have been added in \nconference which neither House ever debated, discussed, nor amended.\n  I think it is wrong, and I will return to something I said several \ntimes, both publicly and privately. It is time we made some tough \ndecisions around here: Abolish the authorizing committees or abolish \nthe appropriations committees. I am told by the distinguished chairman \nof the Senate Armed Services Committee that $600 million was \ntransferred out of Navy accounts into Army accounts--$600 million--by \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  We all know how the system is supposed to work. The authorizing \ncommittees authorize, and then the Appropriations Committee allows \ncertain amounts of money which, in their best judgment, is needed. Now \nwe are shifting hundreds of millions of dollars and adding $2 billion. \nWe are inaugurating programs that have no relation--no relation \nwhatsoever--to national defense.\n  What in the world does a Gallo Research Center have to do with \nanything that is regarded defense?\n  Mr. President, $7 million for the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New \nMexico--what does the Magdalena Ridge Observatory in New Mexico have to \ndo with national defense?--combined with the aforementioned adds for \nAstronomical Active Optics and the Maui Space Surveillance System.\n  Some months ago, I completed a failed Presidential campaign. I \nlearned a lot of things in that campaign, but I also found that many \nAmericans who did not vote in the 1998 election--in fact, we had the \nlowest voter turnout in history of the 18-to-26-year-old voter in the \n1998 election, and all of the predictions now are that we will have an \neven lower voter turnout in the year 2000 Presidential campaign.\n  They said, particularly young people: You don't represent me anymore; \nyou don't respond to my hopes, dreams, and aspirations. I think these \nyoung people have another complaint: You don't have anything to do with \nthe expenditure of my tax dollars.\n  It is controlled by a few and, in many cases, those few are \ncontrolled by special interests. Recently, there was a fundraiser \nconducted by the Democratic Party where one could pay $500,000 and buy \na ticket. When I first came to the House in 1983, if someone had told \nme that, I would have said: You're crazy.\n  Here we are in a process where I am not able to represent the people \nof my State, much less the other young Americans who thought that I was \na decent public servant. How can I represent the taxpayers of my State \nwhen $2 billion is put in, in a conference about which I have no input? \nHow can we call ourselves their representatives when they add money \ninto an appropriations bill in a conference? Most Americans think $2 \nbillion is a lot of money.\n  I will tell my colleagues this right now: We are not taking care of \nthe men and women in the military. We have pilots leaving at the \nhighest rate. We cannot retain them. We have young men and women \nleaving in the highest numbers we have ever experienced since the \n1970s. We are not meeting our recruiting goals. Yet we can spend $7 \nmillion for the Magdalena Ridge Observatory; we can spend money for the \nLHD amphibious assault ship in Mississippi; C-130s and passenger jets \nare routinely added. The list goes on and on.\n  I will have more to say because I have asked for the time, but it is \nnot fair to the people of this country. I tell my appropriator friends \nnow: You risk losing the confidence of the American people when you \ncarry out these kinds of procedures. You risk and deserve the \ncondemnation and criticism of average citizens when you use their \ntaxpayer dollars in such fashion in a bill that says ``Defense \nappropriations bill'' and we give money to some Gallo outfit. It may be \na good and worthy cause, but so much of this has nothing to do with \nnational defense, and the procedure that is being used is not \nacceptable.\n  I tell the appropriators now, and I want to make them very well \naware, if next year this kind of behavior and these kinds of \nparliamentary procedures are pursued, I will do whatever one Senator \ncan do to block passage of this bill. I say that not only because of my \noffense at this kind of procedure that has taken place, but I say that \non behalf of the men and women who serve in the military today who are \nnot having their basic needs met.\n  We still have thousands of young men and women on food stamps. We \nstill have marines recapping tires so they can buy additional \nammunition with which to practice. We still have men and women in the \nmilitary living in barracks that were built in World War II, and we \nwill spend $2 billion that has nothing to do with their health, \nwelfare, and benefit.\n  I have that obligation, and that obligation clearly supersedes that \nof my obligation to my dear friends in the Senate. It has to stop. I \nwas discussing this with my friend--and he is my dear friend--the \nSenator from Alaska. I said: This is terrible, all the things that have \nbeen put in.\n  He said: You should have seen what they tried to put in.\n  In all due respect to the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, it is not good enough.\n\n[[Page S7736]]\n\n  I see the Senator from Texas has more to say. I reserve the remainder \nof my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, my dad was a sergeant in the Army. I have \nalways believed in a strong defense, and I have always prided myself on \nthe fact that at least, in my opinion, no one in the Senate was a \nstronger supporter of national defense and a stronger supporter of the \nmen and women who wear the uniform of this country and who keep us \nfree. I, therefore, thought it was incumbent on me to explain why I am \ngoing to vote against this Defense appropriations bill.\n\n  Let me start by giving you a little history because I think it \nexplains why we are at this extraordinary point with a bill that seems \nso very hard to explain. It started with President Clinton. It is, \nunfortunately, a standard pattern that, from time to time, we have \nPresidents who come into office and cut defense, and then as they are \non the verge of waving goodbye, they propose massive increases in \ndefense spending.\n  My dear colleague from Arizona will remember that the largest period \nof increases in defense spending in the peacetime history of the \ncountry did not start while Ronald Reagan was President. It, in fact, \nstarted the last year Jimmy Carter was President, even though Jimmy \nCarter cut national defense expenditures consistently during his \nPresidency.\n  President Clinton, in the first 5 years he was President, cut defense \nspending every single day. In the first year of his Presidency, real \ndefense spending fell by 5.8 percent. In 1994, real defense spending \nagain fell by 5.8 percent. In 1995, it fell by 4.7 percent; in 1996, \n4.9 percent; in 1997, 0.5 percent; in 1998, 2.8 percent. In every one \nof those years, real resources that we committed to national security \nand to the well-being of the men and women who defend America declined.\n  Then, in 1999, finally, as we were looking at the 1999 budget, the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff finally stopped toeing the line for President \nClinton, stopped apologizing for the decimation of the military, and \npointed out that the military had been hollowed by Bill Clinton. It was \na revelation that was late in coming, and it is a shame on the Joint \nChiefs of Staff that they let it run for so long.\n  So in 1999, led, I am proud to say, by the Republican Congress, we \nactually increased defense spending in real terms for the first time \nsince Bill Clinton had been President.\n  Now, in his final budget submission, President Clinton, as he is \nheading toward the exit, having cut defense consistently since he \nbecame President--even counting the increase Congress added last year, \nreal defense outlays have been cut by 17 percent--now, in his parting \nbudget, President Clinton proposed $16 billion of increases in defense \nspending.\n  We might have celebrated that fact--having written a budget that \nadded $16 billion and expanded our modernization programs, improved \nhealth care for our active duty military and for our retirees--there \nare many good things we could do with that $16 billion--but Congress \nwas not going to be outdone. How dare Bill Clinton, in the final hours \nthat he has in the White House, submit a massive increase in defense \nspending and have Congress just say yes.\n  So remarkably, we find ourselves today in a situation where the \nPresident proposed a $16 billion increase, Congress has raised that by \nanother $14 billion, and, as a result, we have over a 10-percent \nincrease in defense spending in 1 year. I would submit that this is \npolitical upmanship that makes absolutely no sense. What has happened \nis, the surplus is literally burning a hole in our pockets.\n  The picture is actually worse because there are all kinds of gimmicks \nin the bill that would allow more to be spent. You might wonder how $2 \nbillion that nobody voted on in either House of Congress could be added \nin conference. Let me explain how it happened. In fact, I am sure \npeople wonder: Where do these emergencies come from? Every week or so \nnow, they are seeing Congress pass an emergency funding bill. And they \nmight ask: Where do these emergencies come from?\n  On page 54 of this Defense appropriations bill, we have an emergency \ncreated. This is how it happened. The Appropriations Subcommittee on \nDefense, in section 8166, cut spending for the Overseas Contingency \nOperations Transfer Fund by $1.1 billion.\n\n  They took the $1.1 billion out of the appropriations bill, and then, \nin title IX, they added it back, but this time as an emergency. So, in \nthe middle of page 54, an emergency is created, by taking money away \nfrom needed expenditures on American overseas contingency operations--\nwe take the money away in the middle of page 54--then we spend this \nmoney on all of these programs that Senator McCain is talking about, \nand then, at the bottom of page 54, we add it back because we have an \nemergency.\n  Well, where did the emergency come from? The emergency came from the \nfact that they took the money from overseas operations to spend on \nother things. That is where the emergency came from.\n  So they created the emergency in the middle of page 54, and then at \nthe bottom of page 54, having created a crisis--we might have to bring \ntroops home from Kosovo as a result of the money taken in the middle of \npage 54--so at the bottom of page 54, having created the emergency in \nthe middle of the page, they then solve the emergency by taking exactly \nthe same amount of money, declaring it an emergency so it does not \ncount under the budget, and adding it back.\n  It, I think, speaks volumes that Senator McCain looked at this bill, \nand I looked at this bill, and we both came up with a list of programs \nthat we thought were indefensible. We never talked about our choice of \nprograms, but there is not a single overlap on our lists. That tells me \nwe were picking from a large bushel basket full of add-ons.\n  Let me give you a few that I think deserve a prize. Five million \ndollars is earmarked out of Army operations and maintenance. I remind \nmy colleagues, this is an area where we have a critical shortage of \nfunding, where we have provided emergency money in the past. In clear \nviolation of the base closing law--which says, when you close a \nmilitary base you can't keep building infrastructure on that military \nbase; when you have closed it, when you have transferred it to the \ncivilian sector, you can't keep spending defense money on it--in clear \nviolation of the base closing law, we provide $5 million, which we \ntransfer to the National Park Service, to build infrastructure on a \nbase that has been closed.\n  No. 2, we provide $4 million to monitor desert tortoise populations. \nRemember, we are taking $4 million out of the defense budget. In fact, \nwe declared an emergency when we took the money away from overseas \noperations, and then we put it back in for an emergency so we could \nfund programs such as monitoring desert tortoise populations.\n  It is interesting, when you press, to learn what the justification \nis. The justification, you will be happy to know, is that we may, at \nsome point, want to expand a military base, and the desert tortoise \npopulation might be relevant.\n  I remind my colleagues, we are closing military bases. Nevertheless, \nin this bill, with all of our needs, we found room to provide defense \nmoney to monitor the desert tortoise population in California.\n  Because we have a huge backlog in depot maintenance for our ships in \nthe Navy, this Congress has provided $362 million of emergency money to \ntry to deal with this backlog in ship maintenance so our ships can \nperform their missions. In this bill, we take $750,000 out of that \nemergency money and use it for renovations on the U.S.S. Turner Joy. \nSenator McCain will be one of the few people here who will remember the \nU.S.S. Turner Joy. It is a destroyer. It is well known because it was \ninvolved in the Tonkin Gulf action that got us deeper into Vietnam. But \nit has been out of the Navy since 1982. We are providing $362 million \non an emergency basis to catch up with ship maintenance, and yet we are \nbasically giving a tourist bureau money to do renovation on a ship that \nhas been out of the Navy since 1982.\n  There is $5.5 million for an Army research and development project. \nThis is money meant for modernization so if we have to send men and \nwomen into combat, they will have technological superiority. We use \nthis $5.5 million for laser vision correction. Laser vision\n\n[[Page S7737]]\n\ncorrection is a miracle. They can come in and do it, and you don't have \nto wear glasses anymore. But the point is, what does that have to do \nwith national defense? Why are we funding medical research out of the \nnational defense budget?\n  Then there is $2.8 million to buy new office furniture for the \nDefense Language Institute in Monterey, CA. At first you might say, OK, \nwe built a new building; we have to buy new furniture. But there isn't \na new building. We are not building a new building at the Defense \nLanguage Institute in Monterey, CA. The question is: Why do we need new \nfurniture now? What is wrong with the old furniture? The answer: The \nsurplus is burning a hole in our pocket. This is a grab bag. It is like \none of these sales you see on television where they dump the clothes on \na table and they are on sale, and everybody grabs a piece of it.\n  Finally, $3.5 million is added in Army research, development, test, \nand evaluation for artificial hip research. Now look, artificial hip \nresearch is important. There are people who have deteriorating joints. \nWe fund research at the National Institutes of Health to deal with \nhealth problems. What are we doing taking $3.5 million out of defense \nto fund this kind of activity?\n  I will conclude on this: We took $1.1 billion out of defense. We \ndeclared an emergency because we didn't have enough defense money. \nThen, having declared an emergency and gotten the money, then we take \nthe $1.1 billion that was supposed to be spent on defense and spend it \non other things. As a result, we literally have an almost endless list \nof projects exactly like these. You have to ask yourself, is this \nreally the best use for the taxpayers' money?\n  I say to my colleagues, I am going to vote against this Defense bill \nbecause this is runaway spending at its worst. I voted against other \nbills because of the obscene way we literally are throwing money at \nthese appropriated accounts. In this election year, with many close \nelections, we literally are spending money on anything that might have \na constituency. This process has got to stop. I think it undermines the \ngood work we are doing.\n  I thank Senator Stevens. We have been working to resolve a \ndisagreement over two unnecessary pay shifts. Senator Stevens has \nagreed--graciously, I might add--to fix that. But I am going to vote \nagainst this bill on the basis under which we are today considering it. \nI am going to vote against this bill because you cannot defend this \nkind of runaway spending. The only defense I've heard is that, in a big \nbill, you are going to take on some spending. I don't think that is \ngood enough.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Gramm for his efforts and \nhis discussion of a bill that, obviously, is going to be passed by \noverwhelming numbers. Again, I point out, this is a Defense \nappropriations bill--appropriations. It is supposed to be for the \nmoney, not for making policy or authorizing.\n  One of the more egregious practices that has crept in lately, that \ndoesn't have a lot to do with money but has a great deal to do with \nnational policy and in the end costs taxpayers enormous amounts of \nmoney, is the Buy American provisions. We started out with a couple. \nNow we have more and more and more. I will mention a couple of them.\n  You have to buy only American products related to welded shipboard \nanchor and mooring chain. You can only buy American relating to carbon \nalloy or armor steel plate for use in any Government-owned facility or \nproperty under the control of the Department of Defense, specifications \nto be determined by the American Iron and Steel Institute. There are \nBuy American restrictions related to the procurement of vessel \npropellers and ball and roller bearings.\n  I am told that a request for proposal, so-called RFP, to people to \nbid on vessel propellers that would have been opened to, certainly, our \nNATO allies was recently published and, strangely enough, this was put \nin the bill. There is a requirement for the use of U.S. anthracite as \nthe baseload energy for municipal district heat for U.S. military \ninstallations in Germany. I have remarked on this before because it has \nbeen there a long time. It is the classic example of taking coal to \nNewcastle. We have to take American coal, put it on a ship, and \ntransport it to Germany to be used in Germany. I have never gotten an \nestimate as to how many millions that costs Americans.\n  It exempts the construction of public vessels, ball and roller \nbearings, food, clothing or textile materials from Secretary of Defense \nwaiver authority relating to the Buy American requirements involving \ncountries with which the United States has reciprocal agreements. In \nother words, the United States has a reciprocal agreement, particularly \nwith some of our NATO allies, and the Secretary of Defense cannot give \nany waiver for the purchase of clothing or textile materials. This is \nprotectionism at its most egregious.\n  It prohibits the development, lease, or procurement of ADC(X) class \nships unless the main propulsion diesel engines and propulsors are \nmanufactured in the United States by a domestically operated entity.\n  It transfers $5 million to the National Park Service for repair \nimprovements at Fort Baker in northern California; $500,000 for Florida \nMemorial College for the purposes of funding minority aviation \ntraining. It is a worthy program. I would support it, if it were not in \na Defense appropriations bill. It transfers $34 million to the \nDepartment of Justice for the National Drug Intelligence Center. We \nhave an appropriations bill upon which that would have been entirely \nappropriate. Then they go on to restrict the center's ability to \nestablish its own personnel levels.\n  There are restrictions on the ability of the Department of Defense to \ncontract out any activity currently performed by more than 10 \nDepartment of Defense civilian employees.\n  This is an appropriations bill, Mr. President. Now the Department of \nDefense cannot contract out any activity, no matter how much money it \nwould save the taxpayers, under any circumstances, if there are no more \nthan 10 DOD civilian employees. It doesn't matter if there are a \nthousand military people. More than 10 Department of Defense civilian \nemployees. That is offensive, to have that kind of language in a DOD \nappropriations bill.\n  It prohibits reduction to disestablishment of the 53rd Weather \nReconnaissance Squadron, Air Force Reserve, Mississippi. We all know we \nhave the capability to monitor weather, thanks to modern technology.\n  It mandates continued availability of funds for the National Science \nCenter for Communications and Electronics in Georgia.\n  It requires the Army to use the former George Air Force Base, \nCalifornia, as the airhead for the National Training Center.\n  We could not let the Army or Department of Defense make that \ndecision. We require the U.S. Army, no matter what it may cost, to use \nGeorge Air Force Base as the airhead for the National Training Center.\n  It authorizes the Secretary of Defense to waive reimbursement \nrequirements relating to the costs to the Department of Defense \nassociated with the conduct of conferences, seminars, and other \neducational activities of the Asia-Pacific Center.\n  It is well to note that the Asia-Pacific Center is located in Hawaii. \nWhy don't we waive reimbursement requirements for any center in America \nor the world? Why just for the Asia-Pacific Center?\n  It transfers $10 million to the Department of Transportation to \nrealign railroad tracks at Elmendorf Air Force Base and Fort \nRichardson, Alaska.\n  I wonder if there are railroad tracks that need to be realigned at \nother defense facilities in America. I would imagine so.\n  It mandates that funds used for the procurement of malt beverages and \nwine for resale on a military installation be used to procure such \nbeverages from within that State.\n  Suppose they could get those beverages at a lower cost from some \nother State?\n  It earmarks $5 million for the High Desert Partnership in Academic \nExcellence Foundation, Inc., for the purpose of developing, \nimplementing, and evaluating a standards- and performance-based \nacademic model at schools administered by the Department of Defense \nEducation Activity.\n  What makes the High Desert Partnership the place to get the $5 \nmillion?\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\nWas there ever a hearing on it? Did the Personnel Subcommittee or Armed \nServices Committee ever look at it? No.\n  It earmarks $115 million to remain available for transfer to other \nFederal agencies.\n  That is $115 million; just transfer it to other Federal agencies. \nWhy?\n  It earmarks $1.9 million for San Bernadino County Airports Department \nfor installation of a perimeter security fence at Barstow-Daggett \nAirport, California.\n  It earmarks $20 million for the National Center for the Preservation \nof Democracy.\n  It earmarks $7 million for the North Slope Borough.\n  It earmarks $5 million to the Chicago Public Schools for conversion \nand expansion of the former Eighth Regiment National Guard Armory.\n\n  I argue, Mr. President, that there are guard armories all over \nAmerica that could be converted.\n  It earmarks $1 million for the Middle East Regional Security Issues \nProgram.\n  It earmarks $2 million, subject to authorization, for the Bosque \nRedondo Memorial in New Mexico.\n  It earmarks $300,000 for the Circum-Pacific Council for the Crowding \nthe Rim Summit Initiative.\n  It earmarks $10 million for the City of San Bernadino, contingent on \nresolution of the case of City of San Bernadino v. United States.\n  Mr. President, it is obvious that this procedure in the Congress of \nthe United States of authorizing and appropriating has lurched \ncompletely and entirely out of control. When you are earmarking $2 \nbillion out of an appropriations bill which has neither been examined \nnor voted on by either body, we have a case that has got to be \nremedied, and we have obviously wasted billions of dollars of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  The American people deserve better. I say again to the distinguished \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee, with whom I have an excellent \nand warm personal relationship, this cannot stand. Next year, if this \nkind of practice continues, then I will have to do everything in my \npower to stop it, as I said before, not only because of my obligation \nto the taxpayers, which is significant, but my obligation to the men \nand women in the military who are being shortchanged by these \nprocedures and, indeed, neglected in many respects.\n  I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. STEVENS. How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 20 minutes remaining for Senator \nByrd and 6 minutes for Senators Stevens and Inouye.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall use half of that 6 minutes, if I \nmay be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4576, the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Appropriations Act was endorsed by \nall the Senate conferees, and enjoys the full support of our \ndistinguished ranking member Senator Inouye.\n  This bill, in combination with the emergency supplemental bill passed \nlast month, provides a true jump start to restore the readiness, \nquality of life, and modernization of our Armed Forces.\n  The Senate considers this conference report at the earliest point in \nthe year since 1958--which means the Department of Defense can plan now \nto execute the funds provided by Congress for the full fiscal year.\n  Our adoption of this conference report today would not have been \npossible without the extraordinary effort and leadership of House \nChairman, Jerry Lewis.\n  In partnership with the former House Chairman, and current ranking \nmember, Jack Murtha, they reported the bill in early May, and presented \nit to the Senate in time for us to act prior to the July 4th recess.\n  Both committees set the FY 2001 bill aside to complete work on the FY \n2000 supplemental in late June. That bill provided $6.5 billion to \nrepay the Army for operations in Kosovo, and to address critical \npersonnel, medical, and fuel cost increases.\n  This bill extends those initiatives, providing needed funds for new \nmedical benefits for military retirees, real property maintenance, \ndepot maintenance, and environmental restoration.\n  The most significant initiative contained in the conference report is \nthe nearly $1 billion increase for the Army transformation effort.\n  Last October, Gen. Eric Shinseki, the new Chief of Staff of the Army, \nestablished a new vision for the Army--a more mobile, lethal and \nflexible force for the 21st century.\n  In this bill, funding is provided to procure the first two brigade \nsets of equipment for the new ``transformation'' force.\n  We are determined that this new force be equipped as rapidly as \npossible, and intend to maintain this pace of funding in fiscal years \n2002 and 2003.\n  Meeting our national strategic priorities, the bill establishes a new \nnational defense airlift fund, to procure C-17 aircraft.\n  The centerpiece of how our Nation can maintain its global leadership \nposition is strategic mobility. As our force is as small, to meet our \nnational commitments, we must be able to respond to crises anywhere on \nthe globe--the key to that is the C-17.\n  Finally, this bill accelerates development, and seeks to reduce \ntechnical risk, on the full spectrum of our missile defense programs.\n  The conference worked to keep the airborne laser, space-based laser, \nnational missile defense, and Navy theater-wide programs on track, and \nprovide additional funds for the Arrow Joint Development Program with \nIsrael.\n  It is again my privilege this year to join my colleague from Hawaii \nin presenting this bill to the Senate. We simply could not have \ncompleted our work without his leadership, guidance, and partnership. I \nwould now like to yield to Senator Inouye for his comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. the Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I want to begin by informing the Senate \nthat, at $287.9 billion, this act represents the largest defense \nspending measure in history.\n  The act is $176 million more than was recommended by the Senate and \n$706 million below the House level.\n  The conference agreement is a fair compromise between the two Houses. \nFunding for many items of priority of each of the bodies have been \nincluded, but concessions were also required of each Chamber.\n  Our chairman and his House counterpart should be given great credit \nfor this measure.\n  I am confident the funding contained in this act will allow our \nmilitary to meet their most critical readiness and modernization needs \nin the coming year.\n  However, Senators should be advised that the bill does not provide a \nblank check to the Pentagon.\n  It includes reductions in some programs that, such as in the Navy's \nLPD-17, are behind schedule, over budget, or simply not ready to \nproceed.\n  In addition, the conferees concurred with the House, terminating the \nDiscoverer II and Sadarm programs.\n  Mr. President, these were difficult decisions, but by making these \ntough choices the conferees were able to identify sufficient resources \nto protect those programs which are truly critical to the support of \nour military forces.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that the No. 1 priority in this bill \nis to protect near-term readiness.\n  The men and women willing to go into harm's way to protect the rest \nof us simply must be provided the tools they need to defeat any threat.\n  To help meet our readiness requirements, the conference agreement \nincludes the following among its many accomplishments:\n  (1) Fully funds a 3.7 percent military pay raise;\n  (2) Provides an increase of more than $400 million for real property \nmaintenance;\n  (3) Provides an increase of $234 million for depot maintenance; and\n  (4) Provides funding for a new pharmacy benefit for our older \nretirees.\n  At the same time, the bill provides sufficient funding for \nmodernization programs so that future readiness will also be protected. \nWe must continue to invest for the future to ensure we are never caught \nunprepared.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conferees were able to provide \nnearly\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\n$1.4 billion in support the Army's newest initiative commonly referred \nto as ``transformation.''\n  These funds will allow the Army to begin to outfit its first two \ninterim combat brigades with new equipment to test out this \nrevolutionary concept.\n  This is the highest priority of the Army Chief of Staff and is \ncritical to supporting our Army.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the many items included in this \nbill to ensure that our defense forces remain second to none.\n  Mr. President, this is a very good compromise agreement. I strongly \nencourage all my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, a process of this nature, which involves \nappropriations in excess of $275 billion, is a result of many hours and \nmany days of collaboration and consultation with hundreds of people, \nincluding the President, the various Secretaries, committee staff \nmembers, Senators, and Representatives. A measure of this magnitude, \nobviously, will be supported by some and criticized by others. One can \nnever come forth with a ``perfect'' bill. It is just not possible.\n  However, I believe it is important that certain clarifications be \nmade. I know, for example, that my dear friend from Arizona spoke of \nthe Navy Theater-Wide Missile Defense Program and suggested that the \nHouse had not sought the funds, and neither did the President of the \nUnited States nor the Senate of the United States. However, I am \ncertain the Senator would have noted, if he studied the report \ncarefully, that this was debated on this floor for very many minutes. \nIt was debated in the House, it was debated in the Appropriations \nCommittee and in the authorization committee. The only difference was \nthat the House provided $130 million to be designated for very specific \npurposes. In the Senate, for the same program, we provided $50 million \nfor the whole program itself.\n  When the compromise was reached, we decided to let the Department of \nDefense make its allocations. So we drew a new line item. The new line \nitem obviously was not requested by the President, nor by the House, \nnor by the Senate. But the matters debated and compromised were fully \ndebated by this body. That can also be said for many other programs.\n  I wish to advise my colleague that as far as I am concerned, this \nmeasure is a good one. It addresses the needs of our military. It \nprovides the funds that are necessary to feed, clothe, and adequately \nand appropriately arm our men so they can stand in harm's way with some \nconfidence that they will be protected.\n  I commend my chairman, the Senator from Alaska, for his leadership on \nthis matter. It is not easy.\n  I am the first to admit that there must be some waste in a measure of \nthis magnitude. There are some that we may disagree with as to its \nmerit and it relevance to do defense. But that is my view. Others may \ndisagree with me. But I think overall this is a fine bill and it is \nworthy of support by the Members of the Senate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                              sar facility\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to engage the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and my colleague from Florida in a brief \ncolloquy concerning the South-Florida based Advanced Tropical Remote \nSensing Center and its Synthetic Aperture Radar [SAR] facility.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I'd like to join Chairman Stevens and my \ncolleague from Florida in this colloquy to address this important \nissue.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to address this important topic with \nSenator Mack and Senator Graham. I am pleased to confirm that this \nconference agreement provides $4.9 million dollars for remote sensing \nresearch and development activities in the RDT Defense-Wide \nUniversity Research Initiatives account.\n  Mr. MACK. I am very pleased to have this confirmation, and to know \nthe Senators' personal interest and support. As the Senator is aware, \none of our major objectives for this center, an objective supported by \nthe leadership of SOUTHCOM, is to greatly enhance our nation's drug \ntraffic interdiction capability.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This will be the only SAR facility of its kind in the \neast, and the Department of Defense has indicated to us, its' strong \ninterest in developing this capability further in South Florida. It was \nfor this reason that we asked the Senate to approve, which it did, an \namendment for up to an additional $5 million dollars specifically for \ndrug interdiction activities at the facility.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I know that Senator Mack and Mr. Graham intend that the \nDepartment of Defense drug interdiction officials provide all \nappropriate support possible on this important objective. Addressing \nthe shortage of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance coverage \nis an important step in strengthening DoD's drug interdiction efforts.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, it was for the purpose of securing a \nclarification of their intent on this matter that I sought this \ncolloquy. I thank them for their support, interest, and leadership.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator \nMack and Chairman Stevens to secure funding for this important project.\n\n\n                            Crusader Program\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise to ask my friend, the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, for clarification on the \nlanguage in the Defense appropriations conference report concerning the \nCrusader program. The language states that fifty percent of the funding \nfor the Crusader program cannot be obligated or expended until thirty \ndays after the Secretary of Defense submits the Congress a \ncomprehensive Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) on the Crusader program. I \nwould ask the Chairman, is this language intended to delay the \ncontinuing development of the Crusader program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Oklahoma \nthat the language in the statement of managers is not intended to delay \nthe continued development of Crusader. I would also state that Senator \nInouye and I expect that the AOA should be completed and delivered to \nthe Congress by December 15th of this year.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Chairman is correct.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I believe that it is not the intent of the \nconferees to require that the Department of Defense prepare a weapon \nsystem analysis AOA as required for the Department of Defense \nDirectives for system milestone reviews. Instead, I believe what is \nneeded is a quicklook analysis that evaluates the capabilities and \ncosts of Crusader and comparable weapons system alternatives to support \nthe Army's Transformation Initiative to include the counterattack corps \nand brigade combat teams.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                       longbow apache helicopters\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will the Senator from Alaska, the \ndistinguished chairman of our Defense Appropriations subcommittee, \nengage in a colloquy with me on the topic of proposed international \nsales of Longbow Apache helicopters?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to engage in such a colloquy with my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator for his time and compliment our \ndistinguished Chairman for skillfully guiding this bill through the \nchallenging process of mark-up and conference. As the Chairman is well \naware, the Stinger air defense missile and the Apache Longbow are two \nprograms of great interest to me and to the state of Arizona. Over \n41,000 Stinger missiles have been delivered and over $4 billion has \nbeen invested in Stinger weapons and platforms, and over 1,200 Apaches \nhave been delivered to the U.S. and our allied forces.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am aware of the Senator's interest and of the \nStinger's and Apache's capabilities. They are fine systems and have \nreceived the support of this committee for years.\n  Mr. KYL. And I thank the Chairman for the committee's report. Sales \nof Apache Longbow and Stinger, however, apparently are being \njeopardized by what I believe is a misinterpretation of congressional \nlanguage contained in the FY00 DoD conference report. Therefore, I am \nseeking his help in clarifying the intent of Congress with regard to \nthat provision.\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\n  In the FY00 DoD Appropriations bill, section 8138 directs the Army to \n``conduct a live fire, side-by-side operational test of the air-to-air \nStarstreak and air-to-air Stinger missiles from the AH-64D Longbow \nhelicopter.'' The provision further states that the Army is ``to ensure \nthat the development, procurement or integration of any missile for use \non the AH-64 [Apache] or RAH-66 [Comanche] helicopters . . . is subject \nto a full and open competition which includes the conduct of a live-\nfire, side-by-side test as an element of the source selection \ncriteria.'' My understanding is that the intent of this provision was \nto direct the Army to conduct a test of two systems in order to ensure \nthat its helicopters are fielded with the best possible air-to-air \nmissile.\n  The problem, is that the Army has interpreted this provision so \nbroadly as to prevent the sale of Apaches equipped with a Stinger air-\nto-air capability to our allies. Apparently the Army view is that they \ncannot do so until the operational test is conducted. Is it the \nChairman's understanding that this language was intended to in any way \nobstruct the potential sale of Stinger-equipped Apaches to any U.S. \nally?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I believe that the intent of Section 8138 was to require \nthe Army to conduct an operational test of Stinger and Starstreak, not \nto impede sales of the Apache.\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the distinguished Chairman for engaging in this \ncolloquy and for his insight, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Abrams-Crusader Common Engine Program\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I commend Senator Stevens for his \nleadership and work on this important bill. Clearly, America has a \ncontinuing need to maintain a robust, well equipped military that is \ncapable of defending freedom and preserving the peace. This bill \nadvances the Department of Defense and our military services toward \nthis objective.\n  One element of this bill involves the U.S. Army's innovative effort \nto improve the Operation and Support cost of our M-1 Abrams main battle \ntank and the new Crusader Mobile Artillery system. For several years, \nthe Army has recognized that the maintenance and support cost of the \npresent M-1 tank was excessively high. Concurrently, the Army was \ndeveloping the next generation of mobile artillery systems--to be \ncalled the Crusader.\n  Late last year, the Army made a bold decision to pursue a \nconsolidation of the engine component of both the M-1 and Crusader \nprogram. This consolidated effort is called the Abrams-Crusader Common \nEngine (ACCE) program. By consolidating the engine procurement for both \nvehicles, the goal is to reduce the costs to the Army for both \nvehicles.\n  Mr. President, I noticed that the Senate version of this bill reduced \nthe amount of funds available for the ACCE program by $48 million. I \nlearned the committee had concerns over the Army's interest in \ndeveloping a new engine for these two vehicles. This conference report, \nhowever, restores $20 million to the ACCE program. I would ask the \nchairman of the committee if the restoration of this $20 million \nreflects a change in the committee's view of the program or do you \nremain concerned that the program is too costly and adds concurrency to \nthe Crusader system?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the assistant majority leader for his kind words \nand note that I have very good support and participation on the defense \nsubcommittee with Members from both sides of the aisle, so I share his \nkind words with my colleagues on the committee.\n  Regarding the ACCE program, the Senator is correct: this conference \nreport restores $20 million to the ACCE program. He is also correct \nthat the Senate bill had a larger cut to the program and that the cut \nreflected substantial reservations over the cost of a new developmental \nengine for both the M-1 and the Crusader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for that \nexplanation. It is encouraging to once again recognize that the \nChairman--while a vigorous advocate for a robust defense capability--is \nconstantly vigilant to ensure that the money we spend for defense is \nalso a sound investment.\n  The Army's initiative to re-engine the M-1 is a good idea. \nMaintenance and fuel costs associated with operation of the M-1 are \nvery high; perhaps as much as 60 percent of the M-1's total O cost. \nReplacing the current gas turbine engine with a more fuel-efficient and \nreliable engine has the potential to save substantial amounts for the \nArmy. However, the cost to develop a new engine could be quite high. \nThere is even one press article citing a Defense Department official \nindicating the development costs could approach a half billion dollars. \nSo, while the Army initiative is a good one, the costs associated with \nthe program are prohibitive.\n  Regarding the Crusader program, the engine selection will be critical \nto the overall performance and success of the vehicle program. If the \nArmy were to proceed with the consolidated ACCE program, it is clear \nthat concurrency in the Crusader program would be higher than if the \nArmy selects an engine already developed and currently in production.\n  As a final question for the Chairman, does the cut reflected in this \nconference report for the ACCE program indicate a lack of support for \nthe M-1 re-powering effort or the Crusader system?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this conference report contains funds to \nsupport both the Crusader vehicle and the M-1 re-powering effort. These \nefforts are supported in the final bill. The final funding levels \nreflect the substantial concern over the cost to develop a new engine, \nas well as the desire to see the Army pursue an NDI solution.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I appreciate the time and attention of \nthe Chairman to my concerns related to the Crusader system and the ACCE \nprogram, in particular.\n\n\n                              Bayonet 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to ask the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee a question regarding the \ndefense appropriations conference report for fiscal year 2001. I \nnoticed that the conference report retained a very important project to \nbuy new bayonets for the Marine Corps. Is the funding within the Marine \nCorps Procurement line in fact for Bayonet 2000?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. The conference report includes \n$2 million for Bayonet 2000 in the Marine Corps procurement account.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I also concur with Chairman Stevens.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the distinguished Chairman, and the \ndistinguished Ranking Member for that clarification, and appreciate \ntheir hard work on the conference report.\n\n\n                                 MTAPP\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to query my distinguished \ncolleague from Alaska, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, on \na program of importance to my constituents. Mr. Chairman, is it the \nintention of the conference committee that of the $4,000,000 \nappropriated in the Air Force's operation and maintenance title for the \nManufacturing Technical Assistance Pilot Program (MTAPP), $2,000,000 \nshall be expended during fiscal year 2001 only for the continued \nexpansion of the program into Pennsylvania through the National \nEducation Center for Women in Business at Seton Hill College? As the \nChairman may know, half of the appropriated FY2000 funds are not being \nprovided to the program in Pennsylvania, and I seek to ensure that \nduring FY2001 the funds are allocated between the two MTAPP programs.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania is correct \nthat the conference committee intends that $2,000,000 of the Fiscal \nYear 2001 appropriation for MTAPP be expended in Pennsylvania through \nthe National Education Center for Women in Business at Seton Hill \nCollege. Further, it is my understanding that FY2000 monies intended to \nbe spent in Pennsylvania pursuant to last year's appropriations bill \nhave yet to be obligated. Therefore, I wish to express to the Senator \nmy clear intent to ensure that FY2000 and FY2001 monies fund the MTAPP \nin the manner this committee and the Congress intend.\n\n\n                       Electronic Warfare System\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I was wondering if the distinguished \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nwould rise to engage in a brief colloquy.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to accommodate the Senator.\n  Mr. GREGG. I congratulate the Chairman on a strong bill that will \nimprove our national security. As a conferee I understand the many \nchallenges he faced in putting this bill together. While I support the \noverall bill, I would like to express my deep concern over a provision \nof this conference report that reduces funding for an important \nelectronic warfare system for the F/A-18E/F. The conference report \nreduces funding for the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasure \n(IDECM) program by $29.6 million in the F/A-18E/F procurement account. \nI understand that this reduction may provide insufficient funding for \nLow Rate Initial Production, significantly increase the risk to full \nrate production, and may mean that operationally deployed F/A-18E/F \naircraft will not have adequate protection against radio frequency \nguided missile threats. Therefore, I would like to ask the Chairman for \nhis support in addressing this issue for FY01.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the Senator's concerns. My understanding is \nthat the Navy planned to buy 30 Low Rate Initial Production units. \nHowever, testing of the IDECM system occurs throughout fiscal year \n2001. The operational evaluation of the IDECM System will not be \ncomplete until early in fiscal year 2002. The conferees were concerned \nabout a large LRIP buy proceeding ahead of the test program. The \nconference recommendation still allows the Navy to buy 20 units, more \nthan the number required for the operational deployment. I will work \nwith you to review the test results and to ensure that the LRIP program \nis appropriate.\n\n\n                          alcoholism research\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee and my colleague from Alaska in a brief \ncolloquy concerning the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program that is \nfunded again this year in the Defense appropriations bill. Would \nresearch proposals related to alcoholism be appropriate for \nconsideration under the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct. The conference report includes \n$50 million in funding for the Department of Defense to conduct a Peer \nReviewed Medical Research Program to pursue medical research projects \nof clear scientific merit and direct relevance to military health. \nAlcoholism research would be an entirely appropriate candidate for \nfunding consideration.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the statement of the managers to accompany \nthe conference report on H.R. 4576 included a table to delineate the \nprojects recommended for funding in the Defense Health Program. \nUnfortunately, the information included in the Congressional Record and \nprinted in House Report 106-754 deleted one line from the recommended \nlist of projects. To clarify the agreement of the conferees, I ask \nunanimous consent that a table taken from a copy of the official papers \nwhich lists the actual agreement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    EXPLANATION OF PROJECT LEVEL ADJUSTMENTS\n                                            [In thousands of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                              Budget        House        Senate      Conference\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOperations and Maintenance:\n    Government Computer-Based Patient Records............  ...........

Mr. President, at my request, the conferees added a $2 \nmillion item to match a program that the House had included. This \nprogram, under the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy \nAppropriation, is listed under the Human Systems Technology Program as \n``Maritime Fire Training/Barber's Point''.\n  This funding is to be available to enhance the ability of the \nDepartment of Defense to meet its civilian crewing demand and assist in \nmaintaining a cadre of qualified seafarers for times of national \nemergencies.\n  The Department of Defense is facing a significantly smaller pool of \nMerchant Mariners than existed in the past. In recent Senate testimony, \nVice Admiral Gordon Holder, Commander of the Military Sealift Command, \nidentified the issue of Merchant Mariner availability as a key issue to \nhis command. Admiral Holder testified that ``MSC's difficulty in \nrecruiting and retaining a professional cadre of civil service merchant \nmariners also extends to the U.S. Commercial Merchant Fleet.'' \nMoreover, a recent study by the National Defense Transportation \nAssociation has identified potential merchant mariner shortages. The \nnew requirements of the standards of training, certification, and \nwatchkeeping will have an impact on our ability to maintain a qualified \npool of seafarers.\n\n[[Page S7742]]\n\n  The Pacific Theater is the fastest growing sector for civilian U.S. \nMerchant Mariners, with at least 2,500 civilian seafaring jobs coming \nonline over the next three years. To assist the Department of Defense \nin meeting its civilian merchant mariner requirements, the conferees \nprovided this funding. It is contemplated that the funds will be used \nfor a maritime fire training facility at the Hawaii National Guard \nFacilities at Barber's Point. The facility will be used to train \nservice component and civilian merchant mariners.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you for your hard work on this bill. This will \nprovide the funding necessary for a strong military. I rise today to \ndiscuss one item contained in the Defense Appropriations Conference \nReport\n  The Conference Report includes language under Drug Interdiction and \nCounter-Drug Activities, Defense, National Guard Counterdrug Support \ndirecting that of the funding provided in the Drug Interdiction and \nCounter-Drug Activities account, $2,000,000 above the state allocation \nbe provided to the Nevada National Guard to allow for the Counterdrug \nReconnaissance and Interdiction Detachment unit in northern Nevada to \nexpand operations to southern Nevada.\n  I would like to clarify that the funds for this project should be \nmade available from the overall ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug \nActivities, Defense account of $869,000,000 and not from the money \nallocated to the National Guard Counter-Drug support program, sometimes \ncalled the Governor's State Plan, which was also separately increased \nby $20,000,000 in the bill. I believe that this is reasonably clear \nfrom the language of the report, but I wanted to ensure there was no \nconfusion. Is my description of the breakdown of the funding correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, your interpretation of the language is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your clarification \nand again would like to thank you for your good work on this bill and \nsupport of the military.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Department of Defense appropriations \nconference report that the Senate will pass today does not reflect the \nrealities of the post-Cold War world in which our men and women in \nuniform serve this country.\n  I want to state very clearly, Mr. President, that my opposition to \nthis bill should not be interpreted as a lack of support for our men \nand women in uniform. Rather, what I cannot support is the Cold War \nmentality that continues to permeate the United States defense \nestablishment.\n  I strongly support our Armed Forces and the excellent work they are \ndoing to combat the new threats of the 21st century and beyond. \nHowever, I am concerned that we are not giving our forces the tools \nthey need to combat these emerging threats. Instead, this bill clings \nto the strategies and weapons that we used to fight--and win--the Cold \nWar.\n  I say again today what I have said so many times before. The Cold War \nis over, Mr. President. It is time we stopped fighting it.\n  For example, as my colleagues know, I strongly support terminating \nproduction under the Navy's Trident II submarine-launched ballistic \nmissile program. During the recent consideration of the Department of \nDefense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001, I offered an amendment \nthat would have terminated production of this Cold War-era weapon, \nwhich was designed specifically to be a first-strike strategic missile \nthat would attack targets inside the Soviet Union from waters off the \ncontinental United States.\n  I deeply regret that the Senate did not adopt this amendment, and \nthat production of the Trident II missile will continue for at least \none more year. This conference report includes more than $433 million \nto purchase 12 more of these missiles, as well as another $9.5 million \nin advanced procurement funds for additional missiles the Navy hopes to \nbuy in future years.\n  It is beyond my comprehension why the Navy needs more of these \nmissiles when it already has 372 in its arsenal. Despite the fact that \nit already has ten submarines that are fully equipped with this \ndevastating weapon, the Navy wants to backfit four of its older Trident \nI submarines with these newer weapons. To achieve this, the Navy wants \nto have a total of 425 of these missiles, so the President continues to \nrequest them in his budget. And the Congress continues to spend the \ntaxpayers' money on acquiring more Trident II missiles even as the \nUnited States negotiates further arms reductions with Russia.\n\n  I also continue to be deeply concerned about the Pentagon's \nprocurement strategy for tactical aircraft. This conference report \nincludes nearly $2.8 billion for the multi-year procurement of 42 of \nthe Navy's FA-18E/F aircraft. My opinion on this program is well known. \nI have not been shy about highlighting the program's myriad flaws, not \nleast of which is its inflated cost compared to the marginal at best \nimprovement over the FA-18C/D aircraft. I am troubled that the \nDepartment of Defense and the Congress are committing $2.8 billion in \ntaxpayer money to purchase 42 of these aircraft when there are still so \nmany design problems that need to be overcome. And this is just the \nfirst installment for the taxpayers. The Navy hopes to eventually have \na fleet of 548 of these aircraft.\n  The General Accounting Office concluded in a report issued in May \n2000 that the noise and vibration problems with the aircraft's wings, \nwhich the Navy has known about since September 1997 but has not \ncorrected, are sufficient cause to delay multi-year procurement of the \nFA-18E/F. GAO argued that if this problem is not corrected before full-\nrate production, costly retrofitting and redesign of the wings will \nlikely be necessary later. The GAO report also outlined serious \nproblems with the plane's engine. Despite GAO's recommendation, and \ndespite the fact that, in a February 2000 report, the Department of \nDefense's own Commander of the Operational Test and Evaluation Force \nfound that there are 27 major and 88 minor deficiencies in the \naircraft, and that five of the major deficiencies concern its \naerodynamic performance, the Pentagon has chosen to move forward with \nthis costly multi-year procurement.\n  In my view, Mr. President, the Department of Defense should have been \nabsolutely sure this aircraft's design problems were addressed before \nbeginning a multi-year procurement process. I continue to have serious \nconcerns with the safety, effectiveness, and cost of this plane. I will \ncontinue monitor closely this procurement, including attempts to \nresolve the problems outlined by GAO, and I will continue to scrutinize \nfuture appropriations requests for this program.\n  The Cold War-era Trident II missile and the new FA-18E/F aircraft are \njust two of the many examples of questionable spending in this bloated \nDefense Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. President, this debate is really one about priorities. Of course \nall of the members of this body would agree that we must maintain a \nstrong national defense. Our debate should be about how we can best \nmaintain a strong defense, modernize our forces to respond to the new \nthreats of the 21st century, adequately compensate our men and women in \nuniform, and reign in the out of control defense spending that \ncontinues to line the pockets of contractors around this country.\n\n  And it is high time that the Pentagon rethink its priorities. I am \nutterly appalled that at a time when members of our Armed Forces are on \nfood stamps that this body tabled, by a 65-32 vote, an amendment \noffered by the Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] to strike a \nprovision in the Senate version of this bill which would allow the \nSecretaries of the Army and the Navy to spend taxpayers' money to lease \nnine so-called ``operational support aircraft.'' These aircraft are \nactually luxury jets that are used to transport high-level military \nofficers. This provision, which was included in the pending conference \nreport, will allow nine more of these jets to be leased, three each for \nthe Army, Navy, and Marine Corps. The General Accounting Office has \nargued that such a lease is costly and unnecessary.\n  Mr. President, this bill exceeds the fiscal year 2000 level by nearly \n$20 billion. The Congress has given the Pentagon $3.3 billion more than \nit says it needs to defend this country. The Congress has added \naircraft and ships that\n\n[[Page S7743]]\n\nthe Pentagon did not request, and added spending in other areas, and \nsomehow has not yet managed to fully fund the National Guard.\n  Mr. President, as I have said time and time again, there are millions \nupon millions of dollars in this bill that are being spent on out-dated \nor questionable or unwanted programs. This money would be better spent \non programs that truly improve our readiness and modernize our Armed \nForces instead of on programs that continue to defend us against the \nhammer and sickle that no longer looms across the ocean. This money \nalso would be better spent on efforts to improve the morale of our \nforces, such fully manning and adequately compensating our National \nGuard; ensuring that all of our men and women in uniform have a decent \nstandard of living; or providing better housing for our Armed Forces \nand their families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to voice my objection to a particular \nprovision of the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Appropriation Act. Overall, I \nbelieve this legislation does much to meet the needs of the U.S. \nmilitary. However, I believe that a provision relating to the \nprocurement of C130Js sets a dangerous precedent which may jeopardize \nthe military readiness of our nation.\n  The Air Force requested two C130J aircraft in the FY01 budget. No \nother aircraft presently in the Air Force inventory can do what the \nC130 does. It is capable of taking cargo into small, unimproved \nairfields where larger, jet engine aircraft are not capable nor \ndesigned to go. The C130 is our only ``intra theater'' airlift, unlike \nthe C17s, C141s and C5 which are ``inter theater'' airlift.\n  Each year that the Air Force has received appropriations for C130Js, \nit has assigned the aircraft to those units in its total force which \nwere in greatest need. In 1978, the Air National Guard even developed \nsound guidelines, based on objective criteria, to ensure that the units \nwith the most aged and corroded aircraft received replacements first. \nThis allocation method has been fair and effective and ensured that all \nunits of our Air Force are modernized in an appropriate manner.\n  For the past twenty-one years the Air Force has had the authority to \ndetermine where newly acquired aircraft were assigned--and the units \nmost in need received the planes. However, many units are still flying \nplanes which first flew in Vietnam and are rapidly reaching the end of \ntheir useful service life.\n  This year, however, the Defense Appropriations Act directs that the \ntwo C130Js go to Western States Air National Guard units for \nfirefighting. First, let me say that I am sympathetic to anyone at risk \nfor forest fire damage. However, I question whether firefighting should \nbe the determining factor for the allocation of military aircraft, \nparticularly when the aircraft in this bill would be used to replace \nexisting firefighting aircraft. Secondly, the designation of these \naircraft for Western States deviates from the guidelines which the \nNational Guard designed and has followed for the past twenty years. \nThese aircraft units are not at the top of the Air Force's priority \nreplacement plan. Lastly, and most importantly, the inclusion of this \ndirective language could set a very bad precedent. This would be the \nfirst time Congress has usurped the authority of the Air Force in \ndetermining which units should receive new C130 aircraft.\n  It is my hope that this provision is an exception to the rule and \nthat next year the Congress will not override the decision of the Air \nForce to allocate aircraft based on an objective evaluation of need. I \nhope that, and will work to ensure that, Congress allows the Air Force \nto exercise its judgement in deciding which units should be modernized \nwith any aircraft approved in the budget process. To do otherwise \nraises serious doubts about our commitment to military readiness.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am supporting the fiscal year 2001 Defense \nAppropriations Act with a very mixed sense of frustrated resignation \nand expectant hope for the way we are resourcing our national defense. \nA major source of frustration this year is that we will have missed yet \nanother opportunity through the decision made in the budget process to \nmeet our new, growing or neglected national security requirements.\n  We should have been able to fix our military medical health care \nsystem and keep our promise of health care to thousands of military \nretirees who feel they have been cheated by the nation. We should have \nbeen able to raise the pay of our service members to bring it more in \nline with the private sector faster. We should have been able to fund \nour dangerous ship and aircraft maintenance backlogs. We should have \nbeen able to lay the foundation for increasing our ship construction \nrate to ensure we keep our 300-ship Navy strong and ready. We should \nhave been able to increase our funding of basic science and technology \nto set the conditions for the rapid development of the next generations \nof ships, aircraft, and land combat forces.\n  It is a source of continuing disappointment to me that there is still \ntoo much parochial, pork-barrel spending in the defense appropriation \nprocess. Last year, the Defense Appropriations bill was so overburdened \nwith pork, I voted against it in protest. Increasing defense spending, \nso necessary to the demands of our national security today and into the \nfuture, will not improve our military capability and readiness if money \nis funneled into projects that serve parochial interests, not the \nnational interest.\n  My views on the need to increase defense spending and my objections \nto pork-barrel spending are well known and I regret the missed \nopportunity this appropriation represents. Yet, having said that, there \nare many elements of this defense appropriations act that are \ncritically important and which I fully support. This appropriation \ncontinues the trend and our commitment in the Congress to increase \nspending for our national defense--$15 billion above last year's \nappropriation and $3.3 billion above the President's request. Most \nimportantly, it does more to take care of our most important national \nsecurity resource--people. This appropriation increases pay for our \nservice men and women by 3.7 percent, increases housing allowances for \nmilitary families, increases quality of life enhancements, and \nincreases enlistment and retention bonuses to deal with critical \nchallenges in personnel.\n  This appropriation supports important ship construction and \nmaintenance requirements to keep our Navy strong and ready. It provides \nfull funding, $4.1 billion, for our next aircraft carrier CVN-77 and \n$1.7 billion for procurement of a third Virginia Class for New Attack \nsubmarines. Very importantly, this appropriation increases the \nPresident's request for ship depot maintenance by $142 million, and \nappropriately makes these funds immediately available to the Navy as a \nmatter of emergency to deal with a critical ship repair backlog.\n  We need to take a lesson from this session's consideration of how \nCongress provides for the common defense. We need to take advantage of \nhistoric budget surpluses to objectively and aggressively deal with the \nchallenges of defending America's interests in a still very dangerous \nworld. We need take advantage of a political and popular willingness to \ninvest in today's and tomorrow's security and ensure that we fully \nresource our armed force's requirements for a good quality of life, \ntraining, equipment, maintenance, and modernization. Finally, Mr. \nPresident, we need to take advantage of an opportunity to keep our \npromise of health care to the thousands of military retirees who gave \nthe best years of their lives to the defense of this nation. I regret \nwe missed this opportunity, but on balance, this bill satisfies many of \nour national security requirements, and merits support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my concern and the \nconcerns of my constituents regarding Section 204 of the FY 2001 Energy \nand Water Appropriations legislation now before us, the provision which \naffects the conservation of the silvery minnow. News of the showdown \nbetween federal and state agencies over the conservation of this fish \non the Rio Grande has reached my state. My constituents are now \nconcerned, Mr. President, about the impact this language will have on \nthe future survival of this species, as well as the precedent that \nlanguage of this type will have on the implementation of the Endangered \nSpecies Act in Wisconsin and across the country. They are so concerned, \nthat on July 22, 2000 a constituent drove from Madison to a fair in \nWaukesha to speak to me about this matter and missed me by minutes. \nWhen constituents are that concerned, I have to bring it to the \nattention of other members of this body.\n  The White House on Friday threatened to veto the Energy and Water \nDevelopment bill, in part because of this provision that could prevent \nprotection of the endangered Rio Grande silvery minnow.\n  I am concerned, Mr. President, that we would be seeking to take this \naction in this bill because, while we are here in Washington, in \nAlbuquerque, federal, state, and environmental lawyers are continuing a \nfederal court-ordered mediation. This mediation is seeking something \nmuch more important than legislative ink on the page, Mr. President, \nrather it seeks river water for the minnow before its critical habitat \nruns dry--unfortunately it could run dry potentially as soon as next \nweek.\n  The Department of Interior, through its U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService and Bureau of Reclamation, is trying to keep the minnow from \noblivion.\n  Let me explain my concerns, Mr. President. They are concerned that \nSection 204 would prevent the Bureau of Reclamation from using any \nfunds to open irrigation dams. It is the opening of those dams that \nwould provide direct river flow to sustain the minnow. I understand \nthat earlier this month, the Bureau of Reclamation caused concern \nwithin the irrigation district with its legal opinion that the \ngovernment owns the dams.\n  I understand that legal ownership and contractual and other water \nrights issues in the West are extremely contentious. I am grateful to \ncome from a riparian water rights state, and to avoid these kinds of \ndisputes in Wisconsin. But, I'll tell you, Mr. President, Wisconsinites \nexpect that Congress will stay out of this legal wrangling when a \nspecies' survival is at stake.\n  These dams help divert the flow of the river to some 10,000 farmers \nof the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District. The conservancy district \nholds long-standing rights to the water under state law, which does not \nrecognize in-stream flow for fish as a beneficial use. But the Bureau \nof Reclamation has told the conservancy district that the dams must be \noperated so an in-stream flow of at least 300 cubic feet per second can \nsustain a ``last stand'' surviving population of minnows downstream.\n\n  The White House has said ``the Administration strongly objects to \nprovisions included in the Senate bill'' that would ``severly \nconstrain'' the government's efforts to protect and sustain the minnow. \nMoreover the Office of Management and Budget has said that ``adequate \nflows'' must be ensured on the Rio Grande and warned that a ``failure \nto protect the minnow this year could lead to its extinction.''\n  Mr. President, my constituents want the water managers and \nenvironmentalists to continue the court ordered mediation they have \nbegun. The parties to the mediation are environmental groups; the \nconservancy district; the Bureau of Reclamation; the state water \nengineer; and the city of Albuquerque.\n  The Rio Grande silvery minnow occurs only in the middle Rio Grande. \nThreats to the species include dewatering, channelization and \nregulation of river flow to provide water for irrigation; diminished \nwater quality caused by municipal, industrial, and agricultural \ndischarges; and competition or predation by introduced non-native fish \nspecies. Currently, the species occupies about five percent of its \nknown historic range.\n  This species was historically one of the most abundant and widespread \nfishes in the Rio Grande basin, occurring from New Mexico, to the Gulf \nof Mexico. It was also found in the Pecos River, a major tributary of \nthe Rio Grande, from Santa Rosa, New Mexico, downstream to its \nconfluence with the Rio Grande in south Texas. It is now completely \nextinct in the Pecos River and its numbers have severely declined \nwithin the Rio Grande.\n  Decline of the species in the Rio Grande probably began as early as \nthe beginning of the 20th century when water manipulation began along \nthe Rio Grande. Elephant Butte was the first of five major dams \nconstructed within the silvery minnow's habitat. These dams allow the \nflow of the river to be manipulated and diverted for the benefit of \nagriculture. As times this manipulation resulted in the dewatering of \nsome river reaches and elimination of all fish. Concurrent with \nconstruction of these dams, there was an increase in the abundance of \nnon-native and exotic fish species, as these species were stocked into \nthe reservoirs created by the dams. Once established, these species \noften out competed the native fish.\n  The only existing population of minnow continues to be threatened by \nannual dewatering of a large percentage of its habiat. My constituents \nwant to be assured that their future survival is not threatened by \nlegislative action. That is why I have strong concerns about this \nprovision and would like to see that it is removed from the bill.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7744-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7744-S7747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 2912\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate proceed to the consideration of \nS. 2912.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Illinois, I \nobject.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am disappointed that there has been an \nobjection, but I am not surprised.\n  I say to my friend from Massachusetts, who is on the floor, who has \nbeen a leader on these issues for 35 years--that is, in trying to \nestablish some fairness in immigration policy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would be good enough to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join my colleagues in introducing \nthe ``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000.'' This important \nlegislation will help re-establish fairness and balance in our \nimmigration laws by making it fairer to apply for green cards, \nadvancing the date for registry from 1972 to 1986, and providing equal \ntreatment for Central American and Haitian immigrants.\n  Our legislation will also provide fairness for immigrants from \nCentral American countries and Haiti. In 1997, Congress granted \npermanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled from \ndictatorships in those two countries. But it excluded many other \nCentral Americans and Haitians facing similar conditions. The \nlegislation will eliminate this unfair disparity by extending the \nprovisions of the 1997 Act to all immigrants from Central America and \nHaiti.\n  By providing parity, we will help individuals such as Gheycell, who \ncame to the United States at the age of 12 with her father and sister \nfrom worn-torn Guatemala. She went to school here, and became active in \nher community. In high school, she formed a club that helped the \nhomeless in Los Angeles. She is now attending college. Her\n\n[[Page S7745]]\n\nfamily applied for asylum and all were given work permits. They now \nqualify for permanent residence. But because Gheycell is 21, she no \nlonger qualifies, and risks being deported to Guatemala. Under our \nproposal, she will be able to remain in the United States with her \nfamily and continue her education.\n  The legislation will also change the registry cut-off date so that \nundocumented immigrants who have been residing in this country since \nbefore 1986 can remain in the United States permanently. The registry \ndate has periodically been updated since the 1920's to reflect the \nimportance of allowing long-time, deeply-rooted immigrants who are \ncontributing to this country to obtain permanent residence status and \neventually become citizens.\n  These issues are matters of simple justice. The Latino and Immigrant \nFairness Act is strongly supported by a broad coalition of business, \nlabor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations. \nConservative supporters include Americans for Tax Reform and Empower \nAmerica. Labor supporters include the AFL-CIO, the Union of \nNeedletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service \nEmployees International Union. Business supporters include the National \nRestaurant Association and the American Health Care Association.\n  All of the major Latino organizations support the bill, including the \nMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National \nCouncil of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and \nthe National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. \nReligious organizations supporting the bill include the U.S. Catholic \nConference, the Anti-Defamation League, and the Lutheran Immigration \nand Refugee Services. Members of these groups agree that immigrants are \nan important asset for the economy, and that by enabling them to become \npermanent residents, they will be freed from exploitation.\n\n  This legislation will adjust the status of thousands of workers \nalready in the U.S. and authorize them to work. This policy is good for \nfamilies and good for this country. It will correct past government \nmistakes that have kept countless hard-working immigrant families in a \nbureaucratic limbo far too long. In taking these steps, Congress will \nrestore fairness to our immigration laws and help sustain our economic \nprosperity.\n  I understand, we are coming into the last day of this particular \nsession of this Congress. We will have approximately 4 weeks when we \nreturn. But we are running into the last days.\n  The Senator from Nevada was asking for consideration--since we have \nbeen in a quorum call, we probably do have the time to deal with these \nissues, which are not new issues--that we take the steps to try to \nprovide some simple justice for many of our fellow citizens and workers \nhere in the United States who have, because of the failure of action by \nCongress, or because of the particular decisions of the courts, been \ndenied fairness in their treatment before the law.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada if he remembers the time, \nabout 3 years ago, when we saw action taken in order to permit \npermanent resident status for Nicaraguans and Cubans. And yet, at least \nat that time, there were solemn guarantees that we were going to be \nable to have similar consideration for Guatemalans, El Salvadorans, \nHaitians, the other Central Americans who have been involved in similar \nkinds of conflict.\n  There was a unified position within the community that--because of \nthe turmoil, because of the dangers to many of those people in \nreturning to their country, dangers of retribution--that we ought to \ngive them at least the opportunity for permanent resident status. A \ndecision was made at that time to only do it for the Nicaraguans and \nthe Cubans. But there was the promise that we were going to do it for \nthe rest of the Central Americans.\n  This effort by the Senator from Nevada basically says: we made the \npromise. We gave the guarantee to these individuals. This is an effort \nby the Senator from Nevada to make sure that Nicaraguans, Cubans, \nHaitians, Guatemalans, and El Salvadorans are treated fairly and \ntreated the same.\n  Is that one of the efforts that the good Senator is attempting to \nachieve?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Massachusetts, that is true. We \nwere promised. It was not a question that we would work on it. We were \ngiven every assurance that Haitians, Central Americans, people who \nlived under some of the most oppressive regimes in the history of their \ncountries, would be granted the same privileges that the Cubans and \nNicaraguans received. I was happy that the Cubans and Nicaraguans \nreceived basic fairness.\n  However, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, we are not asking for \nanything that is outlandish or new. This is the way America has been \nconducting its immigration policy since the birth of our republic. Is \nthat not true?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. At this time, our fellow \ncitizens ought to understand that if you are Guatemalan, El \nSalvadoran--someone who has been involved in the conflict in that \nregion over the years and is now in the United States--you go off to \nwork in the morning, and you may be married to an American wife, and \nyou may have children who are Americans, and you can be picked up and \ndeported, while the person who is working right next to you in the same \nshop may have been born 5 miles away but will have the protections of \nlaw.\n  Does that seem fair to the Senator from Nevada?\n  Mr. REID. No, it does not seem fair, I say to my friend \nfrom Massachusetts. It does not seem any more fair than a story I will \ntell the Senator, which he has heard me tell before. It is a story that \nis embedded in my heart and which has prompted me to speak out on these \nissues.\n\n  Secretary Richardson and I visited a community center in Las Vegas. \nWe were told to go in through the backdoor because there were people \noutside who were demonstrating. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nwe decided that we would not going through the backdoor.\n  These people that were demonstrating were good American people who \nwere there saying: I am married to someone from Mexico, or El Salvador, \nor Guatemala. They were saying: We have children who have been born in \nthis country. They have taken my husband's work card away from him. He \ncan no longer make payments on our house, our car.\n  Other people I talked to, they had lost their houses, they had been \nevicted from their homes, they had lost their jobs. And those jobs are \nnot that easy to fill in Las Vegas.\n  I say to my friend, I believe that justice calls out for this. We \nhear terms such as ``fairness'' and ``social justice.'' Those terms are \nspoken on this floor a lot. But sometimes they are only words. To the \npeople Bill Richardson and I met with in Las Vegas, however, these are \nmore than words. These people, if the legislation we are trying to \nconsider today was passed, would be able to have the satisfaction that \ntheir husbands or wives could go back to work, that their children \nwould have parents who were legally employed, that they could live in \ntheir own home, and pay their taxes.\n  So I say to my friend from Massachusetts, who, I repeat, has been a \nleader on these issues for more than 30 years, that we not only have to \ndo something about NACARA, which would give parity to Central Americans \nand Haitians, but also the legislation which I have introduced which \nwould change the date of registry from 1972 to 1986. We have people \nhere who have kids who have graduated from high school--American \ncitizens. They are deporting the fathers and mothers of these children.\n  I would also say to my friend from Massachusetts that the date of \nregistry has been in effect in this country for decades. Since 1929, we \nhave changed the date of registry several times. I repeat, this isn't \nsomething we are doing that is unique or outlandish or bizarre. It is \nsomething that has been done for decades upon decades in this country.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The part of this proposal that the Senator was trying to \nhave before the Senate is really to equalize the treatment of those in \nCentral America and Haiti with those from Nicaragua and Cuba because of \nthe assurances that were given.\n  The Senator has talked about the registry which has been periodically \nupdated since the 1920s, to reflect the importance of allowing long-\ntime,\n\n[[Page S7746]]\n\ndeeply rooted immigrants who are contributing to the country to obtain \npermanent resident status and eventually become citizens.\n  Consider the case of Adriana, who came to the United States with her \nparents in 1981. In 1986, her family became eligible for legalization, \nsince they had arrived here before 1982. They completed their \napplications and attempted to submit them to the INS. However, the INS \nerroneously declared them ineligible because they had briefly left the \ncountry in 1985. That year, Adriana and her parents had returned to \ntheir native land to visit her dying grandmother. They returned to the \nUnited States on tourist visas. In 1989, Adriana learned that the INS \nhad been wrong in denying their right to apply for legalization. They \nsuccessfully challenged the INS action, but because of changes in 1996, \nthe family is still in legal limbo. Adriana's dream of becoming a \nspecial education teacher is on hold, and every day she lives in fear \nof deportation.\n  Here is a person who, under the law, under the holdings, should be \npermitted to remain in the United States permanently but is being \ndenied that because of some legal impediments. I understand that the \nSenator's proposal effectively says to those who have been adjudicated \nin courts of law, which is the basis of this legislation, that those \ncourts of law holdings should be upheld legislatively here in the \nSenate. Isn't that effectively what the second provision of the \nSenator's proposal would do?\n  Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. The Senator graphically painted a \npicture for us of Adriana. The sad part about that story is, it doesn't \nend with Adriana.\n  I went to a little place in rural Nevada a number of years ago called \nSmith Valley, a farming community in northwestern Nevada. After I gave \nmy speech to the high school students, this very attractive, very \nbright-eyed young lady said: Senator, could I speak to you alone? I \nsaid: Sure. And this young lady proceeded to tell me what her family \nhad gone through and how she, one of the top two or three kids in her \ngraduating class, now could not go to college because she couldn't get \nloans because her parents' status needed to be readjusted. The story of \nAdriana is one of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of stories of \nunfairness faced by people in this country.\n  We in America pride ourselves on being fair. This is unfair. What we \nare doing to these people is un-American. These are people who are \nalready American in many ways: They have spouses. They are families: a \nhusband, a wife, a father, a mother who are American; many of the \nchildren are American citizens. In the process, somebody has been left \nout. We want to bring them in. We pride ourselves on doing everything \nwe can to be family friendly. It would truly be family friendly to \nunite some of these immigrant families.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There are three major provisions in the legislation. The \nother important part of the bill is what is called 245(i), which was a \nsection of the immigration bill that should not have been allowed to \nexpire in 1997. It had been in effect for years. Then it was allowed to \nexpire. All we are trying to do is give it some life again because it \nhad been so successful prior to that time. This provision would permit \nimmigrants eligible to become permanent residents to apply for green \ncards here in the United States for a $1,000 fee, instead of being \nforced to return to their native land to apply. The fee was a \nsignificant source of funds for INS enforcement and for the processing \nof applications. Section 245(i) is pro-family and pro-business. It \nallows immigrants with close family members in this country to remain \nhere and apply for permanent residence. It enables businesses to keep \nvaluable employees, and it provides INS with millions of dollars in \nadditional revenues each year, at no cost to taxpayers.\n\n  Restoring the ability to apply for green cards in this country also \nalleviates other unnecessarily harsh provisions in the law which bar \nthese immigrants from returning to the United States for up to 10 \nyears.\n  Consider the case of Norma, who entered the United States from \nMexico, settled in North Carolina, and married a U.S. citizen. They \nhave been married for 2 years, have a child, and are expecting another \nthis fall. They recently purchased a new home for their growing family. \nNorma and her husband are troubled over what to do about her \nimmigration status. She can stay here and risk being deported. Or she \ncan return to Mexico to apply for an immigrant visa, but she would be \nbarred from re-entering the United States for 10 years. That is the \ncurrent law, 10 years. The restoration of section 245(I) will allow \nthis new family to stay together. Until then, she remains here in legal \nlimbo, unable to become a permanent resident.\n  Section 245(I) had been in effect for 8 years without any kind of \nabuses. I remember the hearings we had on the 1996 act. I was amazed \nwhen this was added. I fought it, voted against it, but it was put into \nlaw. The restoration of section 245(I) will allow this new family to \nstay together. Until then, she remains here in legal limbo, unable to \nbecome a permanent resident, and risks being deported.\n  We describe it as 245(I), but this is a real family. These are real \ncases, real cases of family unity. It is something that is closely \nrelated to how parents are going to be able to deal with their \nchildren.\n  In talking about the registry, these are individuals who should be \nentitled to remain here under court order because they comply legally, \nbut because there was a mix-up in the INS, they have been denied that \nopportunity. We are trying to bring justice to them, justice and \nfairness to Central Americans, and treat them equally. These don't seem \nto me to be very complex issues. These issues do not demand a great \ndeal of time in order to be able to understand them or to debate them. \nThese issues, it seems to me, should be very comprehensible to Members \nof the Senate.\n  I understand the Senator from Nevada is attempting to say: as we come \nto the end of this session we have been unable to get these matters to \nthe floor because of a range of different activities. Now, in the final \ndays, as a matter of simple fairness, as a matter of family policy, as \na matter of common sense, as a matter of continuing our commitment to \nthese individuals, and as a matter of basic and fundamental justice, we \nought to take this action. Is that the position of the Senator from \nNevada?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know the case of Norma. The Senator \nhas again painted a very vivid picture. I personally have been \nacquainted with case after case out of my Las Vegas and Reno offices, \nthe same kind of cases. We can change the name, but they are tragic \nstories. Remember, we are not saying grant citizenship to somebody who \nis not entitled to it. We are saying, don't send them back to the \ncountry they go to for a silly clerical revisit. We think the law \nshould be that if they are eligible for citizenship, let them apply, \nand remain in the United States with their families and loved ones.\n  If we look at our own personal backgrounds, these issues become \npretty personal. My father-in-law was born in Russia, my grandmother in \nEngland. People need to be treated fairly. Thank goodness my father-in-\nlaw and his family were able to work through the bureaucratic programs \nwe have here in the United States and, as a result of that, my wife is \nan American citizen.\n  We are dealing with people's lives, people such as my father-in-law. \nAll they wanted to do was come to America. They were oppressed in \nRussia.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is a very moving story.\n  I see others who want to address the Senate. Let me ask the Senator a \nfinal question. Does the Senator hope the Republican leadership will \ncome and either explain their objection to considering and taking \naction on these issues, or at least that the Republican leadership will \ngive the Senator the assurance that we will bring this up after the \ncompletion of the debate on the China trade issue by, say, mid-\nSeptember? The Senator would certainly welcome that, would he not? And \nif we are not able to get those kinds of assurances, the silence by the \nRepublican leadership in addressing this issue, I think, would be very \nsignificant indeed.\n  We all know what is happening around here. I think if the leadership \ngave assurances to the Senator from\n\n[[Page S7747]]\n\nNevada and most importantly, to the many families in this country \naffected by our unfair immigration laws, that we will consider this \nlegislation--would the Senator not agree with me--that that would be an \nenormous step forward and magnificent progress? But if we are not able \nto get those assurances, how does the Senator interpret the silence of \nthe leadership on this issue?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would go one step beyond what my friend \nfrom Massachusetts has said. I call upon Governor George W. Bush, who \ngoes around the country and even speaks in Spanish once in a while, \ntalking about how compassionate he is, and how important the priorities \nof the Latino community are to him. I want him to speak out and say to \nmy colleagues, the Republican leadership in the Congress, let's vote on \nthese issues because they are about fairness. Let's take up and pass \nthese reasonable provisions. If he is really compassionate, there is no \narea that deserves more compassion than what we are trying to do in \nthis legislation. Not only do I call upon the Republican leadership to \nallow us to vote on these matters, I call upon the Republican nominee \nfor President of the United States to speak out publicly. Is he for or \nagainst what we are trying to do?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is the Senator suggesting he'll call upon Governor Bush \nand the Republican leadership in the House and Senate and say that this \nis something that needs to be supported, that this is something that is \na priority with 4 weeks left in this session and that he hopes very \nmuch that the leadership will bring this up for final action?\n  Mr. REID. The Vice President of the United States has put it in \nwriting that he supports this. Vice President Gore put it in writing \nthat he supports the provisions of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness \nAct.\n  I hope we can move forward with this legislation. There has been much \ntalk about H-1B visa, and I believe that this legislation is very \nimportant. We live in a high-tech society. We want to move forward to \ntry to meet our obligations. But let's not think we are going to lay \nover on these issues, which are issues of basic fairness, because of \nthreats on the other side that we are not going to be able to do H-1B. \nBasic fairness dictates that we do both of them. And, we can if the \nRepublicans would just allow us to move forward.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I agree. I think we can and we should do both of them. \nWe can do them very quickly. We have had the hearings in the Judiciary \nCommittee. The Judiciary Committee members understand these issues. \nThey can help provide information to our colleagues if they are in \ndoubt. But the compelling need for action in these areas is just \nextraordinary.\n  I hope my friend and colleague from Nevada is not going to just end \nwith this challenge. I hope he will continue to work, and I certainly \nwill join him, as many colleagues will, and try to get action. We are \nunable to get the action today, but we have time remaining. I want to \nsay I look forward to working with him to make sure we get action one \nway or another, hopefully with the support of the Republican \nleadership. But if we are not able to have that support, I hope at \nleast they will get out of the way so we can give justice to these very \nfine individuals.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. I close by publicly expressing my appreciation to the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his clear and consistent understanding \nof what fairness is. Also, I assure him that we have just begun to \nfight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for several years the people of the \nPacific Northwest have been working to save several wild salmon and \nsteelhead runs that are currently threatened with extinction.\n  Today, the administration presented a number of proposals for how we \ncan recover these species.\n  Specifically, the administration released its draft biological \nopinion for technical review by the four affected States and the \nregion's tribes.\n  The administration also released an updated All-H paper--also known \nas the Basin-wide Recovery Strategy.\n  This paper details proposals in the areas of hatchery reform, harvest \nlevels, hydroelectric power generation, and habitat recovery.\n  I take this opportunity to talk about how we can work together to \nrestore the threatened and endangers species of the Columbia Basin.\n  From the ancient history of Native Americans to the explorations of \nLewis and Clark nearly 200 years ago, the natural bounty of the Pacific \nNorthwest has always been a source of pride.\n  We have been blessed with great rivers--including the Columbia, the \nYakima and the Snake. Over the years, we have drawn from these rivers.\n  Dams have provided us with vital hydroelectric power--forever \nimproving the quality of life in our region and providing an engine for \nour robust economic development.\n  These rivers have helped generations of farmers from Longview to \nWalla Walla by providing water for irrigation. And, they have provided \na watery highway, allowing us to bring our products to market.\n  Clearly, Washington state has benefitted from our rivers and natural \nresources.\n  I am proud that today we are home to the best airplane manufacturer \nin the world. We are home to the best software company in the world. We \ngrow the best apples. Mr. President, our future is bright.\n  But Mr. President, this progress has come at a price. Our wild salmon \nstocks are struggling. In fact, the National Marine Fisheries Service \nhas listed 12 wild salmon and steelhead stocks in the Columbia basin as \nthreatened or endangered.\n  In addition, several butt-trout and sturgeon populations are also \nthreatened.\n  Let me be clear. Those listings mean that right now--we are on the \npath of extinction.\n  So the question before us is: Do we have the will to come together \nand choose a different path--the path of recovery?\n  I believe that we do. I believe that the ingenuity and optimism of \nthe people of Washington State will allow us to meet this challenge.\n  And I am proud of the tough decisions that people all across my \nState--from farmers and Native Americans to sport fishermen and the \nfishing industry--have made so far.\n  But it will be difficult. Unfortunately, the current debate about \nsaving salmon makes finding a real solution even more difficult.\n  The debate today is too short-sighted, it is too narrow, and it's too \npartisan.\n  When I say the debate has been short-sighted, I mean that this isn't \nan issue that's going to be resolved in one month or one year or even \none generation.\n  We are dealing with an issue that has a long history.\n  In the Pacific Northwest, salmon are part of our heritage, our \nculture and our economy.\n  We know from the oral history of Native Americans the significance \nthat salmon played in the lives of Northwesterners as long as 12,000 \nyears ago.\n  The question before us today is: Will salmon still spawn in these \nrivers in the next 1,000 years, the next 100 years, or even 10 years \nfrom now?\n  Salmon are a link to our past, and if they are going to be part of \nour future, we will have to find solutions that look beyond the next \nseason or the next election.\n  I am committed to make sure we take the long view when it comes to \nsaving salmon.\n  In addition, the debate has been too narrow. If someone from another \npart of the country heard the debate, they would think that only one \nthing affects salmon--dams.\n  We know that dams are just one of four factors that affect salmon. It \nmay help to think of the challenge before us as a table--a table with \nfour legs.\n  Each one of those legs must hold its share of the weight. If one leg \nis too short, the table will be out of balance.\n\n[[Page S7748]]\n\n  We know that salmon are impacted by four variables. They are \nhydropower, hatcheries, harvest, and habitat.\n  Let me start with hydropower--or dams.\n  Mr. President, I have long said that we need to develop and implement \na comprehensive recovery strategy before we consider the removal of \ndams.\n  I am pleased that the administration has taken this first step \nforward and provided the foundation for such a plan.\n  I am also pleased that in doing so the administration is clearly \nmoving us beyond the false debate of dams or no dams.\n  The issue has never been that simple. To be sure, the Ice Harbor, \nLower Monumental, Little Goose, and Lower Granite dams have--like other \ndams throughout the region--hampered the ability of salmon to migrate \nfrom their original river homes, to the ocean, and back again to spawn.\n  The reality is that we have 12 listed species throughout the Columbia \nbasin. Four of these stocks are in the Snake River. The other eight are \non the Columbia and Willamette Rivers.\n  Removal of the Snake River dams is of minimal value to the recovery \nof the eight listed Columbia and Willamette runs.\n  Furthermore, while removal of the dams would benefit the Snake runs, \nNMFS has found removal may not be necessary for recovery and that \nremoval alone would probably not be sufficient.\n  We still have to deal with the issues related to recovering these \nparticular stocks and the hydro system needs to be examined and \nupgraded to ease fish passage to and from the ocean.\n  We need to address the challenges posed dams pose for fish survival.\n  We must employ a comprehensive, basin-wide approach that, regardless \nof the ultimate decision regarding the dams, addresses all of the \ncomplex issues surrounding salmon recovery.\n  Mr. President, I fear that some who have focused solely on dam \nremoval have failed to consider what will be necessary under a \ncomprehensive recovery approach.\n  We need to, as the administration's draft plan suggests, establish \nperformance standards for recovery, and we need to achieve those goals.\n  Bypassing the dams will remain a subject to this debate if we fail to \naggressively tackle the issues related to survival of fish through the \nhydro system. It is a reality we must deal with.\n  Next I'd like to turn to the second factor that affects salmon \nrecovery--hatcheries.\n  We must minimize the impacts of hatchery practices that present \nchallenges to the wild stocks, namely: the introduction of disease; \ncompetition for food; and dilution of the gene pool.\n  Further, as the administration suggests, there is a possibility that \nwe could use hatcheries as a way to bolster weak stocks on a short-term \nbasis by using a little common sense.\n  By choosing to utilize wild, native fish stocks, hatcheries can be \ntransformed from a hindrance to recovery to a help.\n  Mr. President, reform of the hatchery program will be expensive. \nHowever, there is a fair amount of agreement on what reform is \nnecessary.\n  The Northwest Power Planning Council's report, Artificial Production \nReview, has given us a basis for action. It is now an issue of finding \nthe funds and prioritizing where these funds should be spent.\n  The next factor is harvest. This relates to several controversial \nissues that are subject to both international and tribal treaties.\n  The Pacific Salmon Treaty with Canada and the treaties with Northwest \ntribes clearly obligate us to recover salmon to harvestable levels. \nUnder those treaties we, as Americans, have obligations we must meet. \nAlready, many have sacrificed because of the declines in salmon runs.\n  The tribal fishermen who have depended on the salmon since time \nimmemorial to feed their families and celebrate their culture has \nsacrificed.\n  The sports fisherman has sacrificed with the virtual elimination of \nchinook season.\n  The commercial fishing family in Ilwaco has sacrificed.\n  In a couple of years, after completing the buy-back commitments under \nthe Pacific Salmon Treaty, there could be as few as 600 active non-\ntribal commercial licenses, compared to the roughly 10,000 licenses in \nthe 1970s.\n  As we look forward at the sacrifices we will need to make in the \nfuture to help recover the wild stocks, we should never forget those \nwho have already seen their livelihood, tradition, family, and \ncommunity impacted by the dwindling numbers of returning fish.\n  We need to promote selective fishing that allows the catching of non-\nlisted species while providing for the release of listed ones.\n  We also need to continue to support efforts to reduce the number of \nfederal and state issued fishing licenses by buying back those \nlicenses.\n  The recently signed Pacific Salmon Treaty, which Vice President Gore \nplayed such an important role in finalizing, calls for exactly these \ntypes of measures.\n  We need to redouble our efforts to prevent overfishing and manage \nthis resource in a responsible way.\n  Finally, as controversial and difficult as the issues related to the \nhydro system will be, habitat promises to be every bit as thorny and \ncomplex an issue to tackle.\n  Mr. President, in this equation, by and large, habitat equals water \nand impacts to water quality.\n  As anyone familiar with agriculture can tell you, especially in the \nWest, water is gold. It is the stuff of life.\n  It makes or breaks communities, both their ability to maintain what \nthey have and to sustain and manage their growth.\n  Water in the West is both the great opportunity provider and limiter. \nOur water law dates back to the earliest days of settlement, and it has \nstruggled to meet the demands of the modern era.\n  We need to take steps now to prevent the continued destruction of \ncritical habitat and work to restore habitat that has been degraded \nover time.\n  Mr. President, the key for fish, as it is for people, is access to \ncool, clean water. Fish require a sufficient quantity of unpolluted \nwater; that means encouraging land use practices near critical river \nhabitat that are consistent with the needs of the fish.\n  Mr. President, these are the four areas we must address. All four are \nimportant and must be part of the debate.\n  Addressing issues related to the hydro system, reforming hatchery \npractices, managing harvest, and husbanding important habitat will not \nbe easy. But we don't have a choice. Allowing salmon to become extinct \nis not an option.\n  Mr. President, at the start of my remarks, I said that the debate so \nfar has been too short sighted and too narrow, and I have explained how \nwe can take a longer view and how we can look at the broad range of \nfactors that affect salmon.\n  Before I close I would like to explain why I think that the debate \nover salmon recovery has been too political to the detriment of saving \nsalmon and doing what needs to be done to keep the families in our \nregion whole.\n  When partisan politics are injected into such a complex issue, it has \nthe effect of dividing people--rather than bringing them together.\n  Unfortunately, we have heard too many people who only say what they \ndon't want to happen, who only seek to place blame, who heighten the \nrhetoric, who lead by creating fear rather than hope, and who never \ncommit to a plan.\n  That is not going to help us save salmon or the people in the \nimpacted communities of the Pacific Northwest.\n  Saying ``no'' to everything, without offering a constructive plan, is \nnot leadership. And it will take leadership to recover our salmon \nstocks and keep our commitments to the people of the Northwest.\n  Mr. President, I commit to work in a positive fashion with anyone who \nis genuinely interested in saving salmon.\n  If you are serious about solutions, I am ready to work together to \nfind them. And I am willing to play my part in our shared \nresponsibility.\n  I will continue to seek Federal funding to support new and continuing \nprojects. I will strive to maintain my own communication with affected \ncommunities, individuals, and interest groups. In addition, I will \npromote better communication between federal agencies and other parties \nwhen this communication breaks down.\n\n[[Page S7749]]\n\n  In short, I commit to being a positive partner with all those who \nunderstand the need for tough decisions and want to move forward to \nreal recovery.\n  It is time to rise above the current debate, which traps people into \nfalse choices while letting the possibility of other solutions slip \naway from us.\n  Mr. President, this is not an issue that is going to be solved by \nNovember 7, 2000. This is an issue that will be with us for years--\nperhaps generations--to come.\n  What we need now are public servants and private citizens with both \nthe will and the vision to sit down, roll up their sleeves, and figure \nout how to move forward.\n  Right now we are on the path to salmon extinction. Anyone who delays \nprogress keeps us on that path. Anyone who divides rather than unites, \nbrings extinction closer.\n  Mr. President, as we proceed on this issue, I wish to state my \nwillingness to work with the next President, with the tribal \ngovernments, with my colleagues in the Congress, with the State and \nlocal governments, and with private citizens to address the important \nissues related to recovering wild salmon.\n  And we can make progress while maintaining our region's economic \nviability.\n  The opportunity the administration has given us today is to move \nforward in a constructive way.\n  They have presented a plan that moves beyond the debate about \nbypassing dams and onto the issues we really need to focus on.\n  While I may disagree with some of the specifics of this plan, it does \nprovide a comprehensive roadmap for how we can resolve these difficult \nissues.\n  I believe if we take the comprehensive approach, we will save salmon \nand steelhead runs; we will be able to produce essential power; we will \nbe able to meet the needs of our farmers, and we will keep water \nhealthy for our children's children.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude I want to make one final point. This \nreally isn't just about fish or dams. It is about the type of world we \nwant to live in. We have a choice about the legacy we leave for our \ngrandchildren.\n  The choice I have called for today is the choice to leave future \ngenerations clean rivers--full of salmon.\n  The choice I've called for today is the choice to show our \ngrandchildren that no matter how big our difference may appear we can \nwork together and be good stewards of our land.\n  That is the choice I hope we will make.\n  The other path leaves a far different legacy. A legacy that leaves \nour grandchildren polluted waters--resources divided from nature. and \neven worse--people divided from each other.\n  Mr. President, that is not the legacy I want to leave. We cannot \nshrink from this challenge.\n  Let's use today's reports as a tool to help us move forward toward \nreal salmon recovery.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a bill that \nwill correct severe injustices affecting thousands of immigrants to the \nUnited States, while at the same time strengthening their ability to \ncontribute to the U.S. economy and to the struggling economies of their \ncountries of birth.\n  A short time ago on the floor of the Senate a unanimous consent \nrequest was made by Senators Kennedy and Harry Reid of Nevada asking \nthat this legislation, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, be \nbrought to the floor for immediate consideration. It is very difficult \nto argue that we are so consumed with work in the Chamber of the Senate \nthat we can't consider this legislation. In fact, we have done precious \nlittle over the last several days because of an honest disagreement \nbetween the leadership on the Democrat and Republican side.\n  I do believe this legislation should be brought on a timely basis for \nthe consideration of the Senate. The bill in question is the Latino and \nImmigrant Fairness Act. It has the support of an impressively broad \ncoalition of groups and individuals, labor unions, business groups, \nhuman rights groups, religious organizations, conservative and \nprogressive think tanks. Empower America supports this bill as pro-\nfamily and pro-market. The AFL-CIO supports it because it is pro-labor.\n  The administration is committed to its passage. Perhaps the most \ncompelling reason for passing this bill is that it embraces the \nprinciples of fairness and justice that are of value to the American \nspirit and to the work we do in the Senate.\n  I recall, when we discuss the issue of immigration, one of my \nfavorite stories involving President Franklin Roosevelt. President \nRoosevelt, of course, came from a somewhat aristocratic family in New \nYork and was elected President in 1932. As the first Democratic \nPresident in many years, he was invited to speak to the Daughters of \nthe American Revolution in Washington, DC. Of course, the DAR is an \norganization which prides itself on its Yankee heritage and the fact \nmany have descended from those who came over on the Mayflower. They \nhave a history of being somewhat skeptical of immigration policy in \nthis country. When Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the DAR, his opening \nwords set the tone. He introduced himself by saying: Fellow immigrants, \na reminder to the DAR, a reminder to all of us, with the exception of \nNative Americans, who have been here for many centuries, we are all \nvirtually immigrants to this country.\n  I am a first generation American. My mother immigrated to this \ncountry at the age of 2 from the country of Lithuania in 1911. My \nfather's family dates back to before the Revolutionary War, so I really \nrepresent both ends of the spectrum of white immigration to America. \nThis bill tries to address the basic principles of immigration fairness \nand justice which we have tried to hold to during the course of this \nNation's history. I bring particular attention to the Senate to the \nplight of immigrants from Central America and Haiti who have been dealt \na severe injustice during the past 20 years, one that would be directly \naddressed by this legislation.\n  In the recent past, thousands of people from Central America and \nHaiti have been forced to flee their homes in order to save their lives \nand the lives of their families. In Guatemala, hundreds of so-called \n``extra-judicial'' killings occurred every year between 1990 and 1995; \nentire villages ``disappeared'', most probably massacred. In El \nSalvador, political violence was rampant--63,000 people were killed in \nthe 1980's by a combination of leftist guerrillas, right-wing death \nsquads, and government military actions. Ironically, an end to twelve \nyears of civil war did not mean an end to violent internal strife; the \ndeath toll in 1994 was higher than it was during the war. In Honduras, \nthe Department of State's Human Rights Reports cite ``serious \nproblems'', including extrajudicial killings, beatings, and a civilian \nand military elite that have long operated with impunity. In September \n1991, Haiti's democratically-elected government was overthrown in a \nviolent military coup de'etat that, over a three year period, was \nresponsible for thousands of extra-judicial killings.\n  Current law creates a highly unworkable patchwork approach to the \nstatus of these immigrants, one that assaults our sense of fair play. \nImmigrants from Nicaragua and Cuba who have lived here since 1995 can \nobtain green card status in the U.S. through a sensible, \nstraightforward process. Guatemalans and Salvadorans are covered by a \ndifferent, more stringent and cumbersome set of procedures. A select \ngroup of Haitian immigrants are classified under another restrictive \nstatus. Hondurans by yet another. As if this helter-skelter approach \nisn't bad enough, existing policies also treat family members of \nimmigrants--spouses and children--differently depending on where they \nlive, and under which provision of which law they are covered.\n  The United States is known around the world as the land of equal \nopportunity, but the opportunities we are affording to Central American \nand Haitian immigrants who have lived in this country for years are \nanything but equal. The current situation is untenable. Why should a \nfamily that has set down firm roots in the United States after fleeing \ndeath squads in Nicaragua be treated differently under the law\n\n[[Page S7750]]\n\nthan another family from, say, El Salvador, who left that country for \nprecisely the same reason. The point was made brutally clear when \nAmnesty International documented the case of Santana Chirino Amaya, \ndeported back to El Salvador and subsequently found decapitated. This, \nand many similar stories, led to charges that the U.S. was engaged in a \n``systematic practice'' of denying asylum to some nationals, regardless \nof the merits of their claims. A class-action lawsuit brought by the \nAmerican Baptist Churches and other faith-based organizations on behalf \nof Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants made a similar case, and was \neventually settled in favor of those seeking a fairer hearing.\n  Or consider the plight of Maria Orellana, a war refugee from El \nSalvador, who fled the country when soldiers killed two members of her \nfamily. She has lived the past ten years in the United States. \nRecently, the INS ordered her deported even though she is eight months \npregnant and even though her husband--himself an immigrant--has legal \nstatus here and expects to soon be sworn in as a U.S. citizen. When a \nnewspaper reporter asked the INS to comment on Maria's case, the reply \nwas: ``I don't know why Congress wrote it differently for people of \ndifferent countries. We're not in a position to change a law given to \nus by Congress . . . we just enforce the law as written.''\n  Well, the law, in this case, was written badly, and needs to be \nfixed. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would resolve these many \ninequities by providing a level playing field on which all immigrants \nfrom this region with similar histories would be treated equally under \nthe law. And it would address two other issues of great importance to \nthe immigrant community as well.\n  The provision to restore Section 245(i) would restore a long-standing \nand sensible policy that was unfortunately allowed to lapse in 1997. \nSection 245(i) of the Immigration Act had allowed individuals that \nqualified for a green card to obtain their visa in the U.S. if they \nwere already in the country. Without this common-sense provision, \nimmigrants on the verge of gaining their green card must return to \ntheir home country to obtain their visa. However, the very act of \nmaking such an onerous trip can put their green-card standing in \njeopardy, since other provisions of immigration law prohibit re-entry \nto the U.S. under certain circumstances. This has led to ludicrous \nsituations, like the forced separation of married couples because one \nspouse must leave the country to obtain a visa, uncertain as to when \nthey can be reunited. Restoring the Section 245(i) mechanism to obtain \nvisas here in the U.S. is a good policy that will help keep families \ntogether and keep willing workers in the U.S. labor force.\n  Let me add, in my office in Chicago, IL, two-thirds of the casework \nwe do relates to immigration. We understand the plight of these \nfamilies on a personal basis. We meet them in our office, we meet their \nfriends and relatives, we meet members of their churches who ask why \nthe laws on immigration in America have to be so unfair and \ncontradictory. That is why this bill is so important.\n\n  The Date of Registry provision is equally important. Undocumented \nimmigrants seeking permanent residency must demonstrate that they have \nlived continuously in the U.S. since the date of registry cut-off. This \namendment updates the date of registry from 1972--almost 30 years of \ncontinuous residency--1986. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act \nrecognizes that many immigrants have been victimized by confusing and \ninconsistent INS policies in the past fifteen years--policies that have \nbeen overturned in numerous court decisions, but that have nonetheless \nprevented many immigrants from being granted permanent residency. \nUpdating the date of registry to 1986 would bring long overdue justice \nto the affected populations.\n  It is worth reviewing the recent history of immigration policy to \nunderstand how we arrived at such a highly convoluted and piecemeal \napproach. Prior to the passage of the illegal Immigration Reform and \nResponsibility Act in 1996, aliens in the United States could apply for \nsuspension of deportation and adjustment of status in order to obtain \nlawful permanent residence. Suspension of deportation was used to \nameliorate the harsh consequences of deportation for aliens who had \nbeen present in the United States for long periods of time.\n  In September of 1996, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform \nand Responsibility Act. This law retroactively made thousands of \nimmigrants ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with \nno alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation \nand established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal \nthat required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence \nas of date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being \nremovable.\n  In 1997, Congress recognized that these new provisions had resulted \nin grave injustices to certain groups of people. So in November of \n1997, the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act \nINACARA) granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block \ncountries and several Central American countries. This select group of \nimmigrants were allowed to apply for permanent residence under the old, \npre-IIRRA standards.\n  Such an alteration of IIRRA made sense. After all, the U.S. had \nallowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, \nduring which time many of them established families, careers and \ncommunity ties. The complex history of civil wars and political \npersecution in parts of Central America left thousands of people in \nlimbo without a place to call home. Many victims of severe persecution \ncame to the United States with very strong asylum cases, but \nunfortunately these individuals have waited so long for a hearing they \nwill have difficulty proving their cases because they involve incidents \nwhich occurred as early as 1980. In addition, many victims of \npersecution never filed for asylum out of fear of denial, and \nconsequently these people now face claims weakened by years of delay.\n  Correcting the inequities in current immigration policies is not only \na matter of fundamental fairness, it is good, pragmatic public policy. \nThe funds sent back by immigrants to their home countries sources of \nforeign exchange, and significant stabilizing factors in several \nnational economies. The immigrant workforce is important to our \nnational economy as well. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has \nfrequently cited the threat to our economic well-being posed by an \nincreasingly tight labor pool, and has gone so far as to suggest that \nimmigration be uncapped. While these provisions will not remove or \nadjust any such caps, it will allow those already here to move freely \nin the labor market.\n  I come to the floor disappointed because the effort for unanimous \nconsent to bring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act was denied. \nThis is an act which advances justice, keeps families together, and \nstrengthens the national and international economy. It deserves \nunqualified support and rapid passage.\n  Not that many years ago, immigrants to this country faced an \nonslaught of criticism. There were propositions in the State of \nCalifornia, speeches made by politicians, charges made by groups that \nreally caused a great deal of fear and concern among those who had \nimmigrated to this country. It is a stark reminder that, as a nation of \nimmigrants, we should continue to have a fair and consistent policy of \nimmigration.\n  This country opened its doors to my mother, her family, to give her a \nchance to leave her land and come to live here. I often think about the \ncourage involved when their family came together, her mother and three \nsmall children, to get on a boat in Germany to come to a country where \nthey did not speak a word of the language.\n  But they heard they had a better opportunity here in America, as many \nmillions before them and many millions since have heard the same thing. \nShould we not in this generation show we are compassionate \nconservatives, compassionate moderates, and compassionate liberals when \nit comes to immigration fairness? The way to show that, the way to \nprove it, is to bring to the floor this legislation as quickly as \npossible.\n  I hope on a bipartisan basis we can have Republicans and Democrats \njoin in the enactment of this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7751]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, countless Americans will be pleased to know \nthat the Senate has unanimously approved the Intercountry Adoption \nImplementation Act to implement the Hague Convention on Protection of \nChildren and Cooperation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption. This is a \ntreaty that was approved by the Foreign Relations Committee about 3 \nmonths ago--in April of this year.\n  Senator Landrieu and I had offered the Intercountry Adoption \nImplementation Act a year ago, because when this legislation becomes \nlaw it will provide, for the first time, a rational structure for \nintercountry adoption.\n  This significant legislation is intended to build some accountability \ninto agencies that provide intercountry adoption services in the United \nStates while strengthening the hand of the Secretary of State in \nensuring that U.S. adoption agencies engage in an ethical manner to \nfind homes for children.\n  Although, the majority of intercountry adoptions are successful, it \nis also a process that can leave parents and children vulnerable to \nfraud and abuse.\n  For this reason, under the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act, \nagencies will be accredited to provide intercountry adoption. Mandatory \nstandards for accreditation will include ensuring that a child's \nmedical records be available in English to the prospective parents \nprior their traveling to the foreign country to finalize an adoption. \n(The act also requires that agencies be transparent, especially in \ntheir rate of disrupted adoption and their fee scales.)\n  Moreover, under this act, the definition of orphan has been broadened \nso that more children can be adopted by U.S. parents. However, in no \nway is the power of the U.S. Attorney General (who currently has the \nauthority to ensure that all adoptions coming into the United States \nare authentic) diminished.\n  Lastly, the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act will provide \nmuch-needed protection for U.S. children being adopted abroad by \nforeigners. Under this act, it will be required that: (1) diligent \nefforts be made to first place a U.S. child in the United States before \nlooking to place a U.S. child abroad; and (2) criminal background \nchecks be conducted on foreigners wishing to adopt U.S. children.\n  Senator Landrieu and I have worked together on issues of adoption \nsince her arrival in the Senate in 1997. I am genuinely grateful for \nher leadership on this issue.\n  In addition, I thank Senator Biden, the ranking minority member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee, for his hard work (and that of his \nstaff) in finalizing the Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act.\n  I likewise extend my gratitude to Senators Gordon Smith and John \nAshcroft--both members of the Foreign Relations Committee--and Senators \nJohnson, Craig, and Lincoln for their cosponsorship of this \nlegislation.\n  Senator Brownback has been as helpful, Mr. President, in making \ncertain that small intercountry adoption agencies will be protected \nunder the implementation of this act.\n  I also thank all Members in the House of Representatives who have \nworked to enable the passage of this Act; in particular, Ben Gilman, \ndistinguished chairman of the House International Relations Committee; \nCongressman Sam Gejdenson, the ranking minority member on the House \nInternational Relations Committee; Congressmen Dave Camp and William \nDelahunt; and, last but by no means least, Congressman Richard Burr--\nwho introduced the original Senate companion bill in the House.\n  From our own family, the former legislative counsel of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, now counsel for Senate Intelligence, Patricia \nMcNerney; and my righthand lady, Michele DeKonty.\n  Mr. President, The Intercountry Adoption Implementation Act now \nawaits approval by the House of Representatives. Needless to say, we \nhope the House will move swiftly toward final passage.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as the father of five children--two of \nwhom came into our family through international adoption--I take \nspecial interest in the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. The \ntreaty signers hope to improve the international adoption system and \nprovide more homes for the children who need them.\n  Like many active adoption professionals and leaders of the American \nadoption community, I support the mission of the treaty to protect the \nrights of, and prevent abuses against, children, birth families, and \nadoptive parents, involved in adoptions. The treaty will not only \nreassure countries who send their children outside their borders, it \nwill also improve the ability of the United States to assist its \ncitizens who seek to adopt children from abroad.\n  While the treaty will provide significant benefits, I had serious \nconcerns that the proposed method of implementation would have caused \nmore harm than good. After study, it became clear to me that there are \nfew nonprofit private entities in existence that have the funding, \nstaff, and experience necessary to develop and administer standards for \nentities (agencies) providing child welfare services. Small community \nbased agencies especially would have found it costly and burdensome to \ndeal with only one or possibly two large and most likely distant \naccrediting entities. For the season, I have repeatedly expressed \nconcerns that many states, especially rural and sparsely populated \nareas, risk being left with no adoption agencies authorized to help \ntheir residents with foreign adoptions.\n  As I have stated before, I believe it is important for each state to \nregulate adoption agencies as it deems appropriate to meet the widely \nvarying needs of its families with the resources available in that \nstate. Working closely with the sponsors of this bill, I proposed an \namendment that allows public entities (other than a Federal entity), \nincluding an agency or instrumentality of State government having \nresponsibility for licensing adoption agencies, to serve as an \naccrediting entity. (In other words, a state government may serve as an \naccrediting entity).\n  In this way, States may continue to participate in intercountry \nadoption--making sure that interested parties meet the Hague \nrequirements. Giving states the option to continue to participate in \nintercountry adoption would ensure that small and medium sized agencies \nhave at least one accrediting entity choice that is local, familiar, \nand easily accessible.\n  In addition, in order to further lessen the initial burden of federal \naccreditation on small and medium sized agencies, I worked with the \nsponsors of this bill to minimally increase the temporary registration \nperiod for small and medium sized agencies. Thus, they would have more \ntime to prepare for federal accreditation--a process that may prove to \nbe costly and burdensome\n\n[[Page S7752]]\n\nbut is considered necessary by many in the adoption community.\n  My initial concerns regarding certain provisions of the implementing \nlegislation stemmed from a number of areas including my own experience \nof having recently adopted two children from other countries, and \ncontact with numerous other families who would either love to adopt a \nchild, but can't afford it, or who have adopted a child under the \npresent system and had great success.\n  Like many Americans, I am firmly committed to finding permanent, \nsafe, and loving homes for children who have been orphaned or are in \nfoster care. I am hopeful this legislation will help secure that dream \nwithout adding a significant overlay of federal bureaucracy and red \ntape.\n  At this time, I would like to recognize and thank one of my staff \nmembers, Amanda Adkins, for help on this legislation. Amanda was truly \ndiligent in her efforts to make this a better bill and to work for the \nneeds of rural Kansans. I thank her for her dedication.\n  Many families spend their entire life savings to realize their dream \nof having a child. I look forward to continuing to work with the \nsponsors of this bill as we monitor the implementation of this \nimportant treaty.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, the \nbill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and any statements relating to the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4023) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2909), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7752-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7752-S7757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COAST GUARD AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Since the Federal agency actions \n     necessary to effectuate the administrative transfer of the \n     property will further the objectives of the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) and the National Historic Preservation \n     Act of 1966, Public Law 89-665 (16 U.S.C. 470 et seq.), \n     procedures applicable to agency actions under these laws are \n     unnecessary and shall not be required.

The transfer of the \n     property shall be made subject to the review and acceptance \n     of the property by NOAA.\n       (c) Relocation of Station Scituate.--The Coast Guard may \n     lease land, including unimproved or vacant land, for a term \n     not to exceed 20 years, for the purpose of relocating Coast \n     Guard Station Scituate.

Mr. President, Senators Snowe and Kerry have an \namendment at the desk. I ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell], for Ms. Snowe, \n     for herself and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered \n     4022.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S7756]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4022) was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \nconsidering passage of S. 1089, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of \n2000. I have also filed a manager's amendment which makes a series of \nnecessary changes to the reported bill.\n  The Coast Guard has been defined as ``a unique instrument of national \nsecurity.'' But it is so much more than simply one-fifth of our Armed \nForces. The Coast Guard's peacetime missions continue to expand as our \nnation asks more and more of these 36,000 men and women who serve our \ncountry. From its traditional roles of rescuing mariners in distress \nand protecting the marine environment, to more recent responsibilities \nincluding intercepting illegal drugs and alien migrants bound for U.S. \nshores, the Coast Guard has proven time and again why this agency is so \nvaluable. Whether it is protecting mariners along the Maine coastline, \nmanaging inland waterway barge traffic on the Mississippi River, or \nenforcing fisheries conservation laws in the Bering Sea, the Coast \nGuard provides an indispensable service to our nation.\n  Despite the fact that demands on the agency continue to grow, the \nCoast Guard, like the other four military services, faces critical \nreadiness problems. In January, the Commandant of the Coast Guard was \nforced to cut back all routine, non-emergency operations by 10 percent. \nUnfortunately, on May 30, the Commandant announced a further reduction \nin missions which resulted in an overall 25 percent reduction in \nroutine operations. This cut resulted in a 20 percent reduction in \nfisheries law enforcement patrols in the Gulf of Maine and forced two \nPortland-based Coast Guard cutters to decrease their at sea time by \nnearly 65 percent this year. Mr. President, this is simply \nunacceptable.\n  Several weeks ago, the Military Construction Appropriations Bill for \nfiscal year 2001 was enacted. This bill contained $700 million in \nsupplemental emergency appropriations for the Coast Guard. It is now \nincumbent upon the Administration to declare the existing readiness \nshortfalls and reduction in operations as an emergency condition which \nrequires supplemental funding. Only then will the Coast Guard receive \nthis critical funding and be able to resume normal operations \nprotecting our coasts, our resources and our citizens.\n  Mr. President, the bill before the Senate attempts to solve the Coast \nGuard's most immediate problems and provides future funding levels and \nother readiness improvements that would restore the Coast Guard's \nability to continue operating at normal levels and prevent reductions \nin the future. S. 1089 authorizes the Coast Guard at $3.95 billion for \nfiscal year 2000, a $200 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 \nappropriated level. It also authorizes $4.75 billion for fiscal year \n2001, an $800 million increase over the fiscal year 2000 appropriated \nlevel. In addition, the bill authorizes such funds as may be necessary \nin fiscal year 2002, depending on the Administration's request. It \nfunds critical readiness areas, such as increases in military pay and \nhousing allowances as well as enhanced recruiting programs. In \naddition, the bill authorizes several important procurement projects \nincluding the Integrated Deepwater System that will recapitalize the \nCoast Guard's fleet of aging ships and aircraft over the next ten \nyears. Moreover, it authorizes the modernization of the Coast Guard's \nNational Distress and Response system, our country's 1950's era \nmaritime emergency communication system. S. 1089 also authorizes \nseveral management improvements requested by the Coast Guard to provide \nparity between Coast Guard military members and other Department of \nDefense service members.\n  The bill authorizes end-of-year military strength and training levels \nthat would address personnel shortages created by a Service that may \nhave been too aggressive in its streamlining initiatives during the \nlast decade. This bill authorizes funding to recapitalize the LORAN-C \nradio navigation system, which continues to be the primary navigation \nsystem used by many vessel and aircraft owners. It also authorizes the \nCoast Guard to operate excess Navy patrol craft in their mission to \nstop the flow of illegal drugs across the Caribbean Basin. Finally, S. \n1089 addresses various personnel management and marine safety issues to \nimprove day-to-day operations of the Coast Guard.\n  During the winter of 1999-2000, my home state of Maine experienced \nsevere freezing on our rivers and bays. Without the work of Coast Guard \nicebreakers, which cleared waterways for heating oil barges, Maine \ncould have suffered from a heating oil shortage. The work of these \nsmall cutters is critical to Maine and the entire northeast. As such, \nthis bill requires the Coast Guard to conduct an in depth study of \nfuture domestic icebreaking requirements. It further requires the Coast \nGuard to operate and maintain their fleet of harbor icebreakers until \nthe Congress has had an adequate period to evaluate the agency's \nrecommendations.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Coast Guard is up to the challenge of \nbeing the world's premier maritime organization despite the readiness \nproblems it currently faces. It is my belief this bill provides the \nCoast Guard with the support it needs to meet that challenge.\n  Let me take this opportunity to thank Senator McCain, the Chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Hollings, the ranking member on the \nCommittee, Senator Kerry, the ranking member on the Oceans and \nFisheries Subcommittee, and the other Committee members for their \nbipartisan support of the Coast Guard throughout this process. Mr. \nPresident, I urge the adoption of the manager's amendment and passage \nof S. 1089.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 2000. Charged with maintaining our national \ndefense and the safety of our citizens, the Coast Guard is a multi-\nmission agency. The Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, \nbut it is also responsible for search and rescue services and maritime \nlaw enforcement throughout our nation's waters. Daily operations \ninclude drug interdiction, environmental protection, marine inspection, \nlicensing, port safety and security, aids to navigation, waterways \nmanagement, and boating safety.\n  Recently the Coast Guard has been forced to reduce its services and \ncut its operations as a result of funding shortfalls. Earlier this \nyear, the Coast Guard reduced its non-emergency operations first by 10 \npercent and subsequently by 25 percent. Mr. President, the Coast Guard \ndeserves better, and the bill before the Senate authorizes funding at \nlevels which would restore the Coast Guard to normal operations levels \nand prevent reductions in the future. Additionally, the bill provides \nnecessary funding for cutter and aircraft maintenance including the \nelimination of the existing spare parts shortage. Simply put, S.1089 \nallows the Coast Guard to continue their critical work on behalf of our \ncountry.\n  This bill provides the funding necessary to maintain the level of \nservice and the quality of performance that the United States has come \nto expect from the Coast Guard. I commend the men and women of the \nCoast Guard for their honorable and courageous service to this country. \nThe bill authorizes $3.95 billion in FY 2000, $4.75 billion in 2001, \nand such funds as may be necessary in FY 2002, depending on the \nadministration's request.\n  One critical goal of this bill is to provide parity with the \nDepartment of Defense on certain personnel matters. Mr. President, we \nshould ensure that the men and women serving in the Coast Guard are not \nadversely effected because the Coast Guard does not fall under the DOD \numbrella. This bill provides parity with DOD for military pay and \nhousing allowance increases, Coast Guard membership on the USO Board of \nGovernors, and compensation for isolated duty.\n  In today's strong economy, maintaining high level service members is \na serious challenge. Additional funding in this bill provides for \nrecruiting and retention initiatives, to ensure that the Coast Guard \nretains the most qualified young Americans. In addition, it addresses \nthe current shortage of qualified pilots and authorizes the Coast\n\n[[Page S7757]]\n\nGuard to send more students to flight school.\n  Mr. President, the Coast Guard is the lead federal agency in maritime \ndrug interdiction. Therefore, they are often our nation's first line of \ndefense in the war on drugs. This bill authorizes the Coast Guard to \nacquire and operate up to seven ex-Navy patrol boats, thereby expanding \nthe Coast Guard's critical presence in the Caribbean, a major drug \ntrafficking area. With the vast majority of the drugs smuggled into the \nUnited States on the water, the Coast Guard must remain well equipped \nto prevent drugs from reaching our schools and streets.\n  Environmental protection, including oil-spill cleanup, is an \ninvaluable service provided by the Coast Guard. Under current law, the \nCoast Guard has access to a permanent annual appropriation of $50 \nmillion, distributed by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, to carry \nout emergency oil spill response needs. Over the past few years, the \nfund has spent an average of $42 to $50 million per year, without the \noccurrence of a major oil spill. Clearly these funds would not be \nadequate to respond to a large spill. For instance, a spill the size of \nthe Exxon Valdez could easily deplete the annual appropriated funds in \ntwo to three weeks. This bill authorizes the Coast Guard to borrow up \nto an additional $100 million, per incident, from the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund, for emergency spill responses. In such cases, it \nalso requires the Coast Guard to notify Congress of amounts borrowed \nwithin thirty days and repay such amounts once payment is collected \nfrom the responsible party.\n  This bill represents a thorough set of improvements which will make \nthe Coast Guard more effective, improve the quality of life of its \npersonnel, and facilitate their daily operations. I would like to \nexpress my gratitude and that of the full Commerce Committee to staff \nwho worked on this bill, including Sloan Rappoport, Stephanie \nBailenson, Rob Freeman, Emily Lindow, Brooke Sikora, Margaret Spring, \nCatherine Wannamaker, Jean Toal, Carl Bentzel, and Rick Kenin, a Coast \nGuard fellow whose knowledge of the Coast Guard was invaluable to the \nCommittee because he was able to give a first hand account of how this \nbill will improve the lives of the men and women who so dutifully serve \nour nation. I would also like to thank Senators Snowe, Hollings, and \nKerry for their bipartisan support of and hard work on this bill.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senate passage of \nH.R. 820, as a amended by the text of S. 1089, the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 2000. I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her \nleadership on this very important legislation, of which I am proud to \nbe a cosponsor. The legislation provides authorization of \nappropriations for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 for the U.S. Coast \nGuard, and is an important step to helping them further their \nresponsibilities that are so important to all of us.\n  It is widely recognized that the Coast Guard is critically \nunderfunded. Pursuant to the administration's request, H.R. 820 \nauthorizes a substantial increase in the two largest Coast Guard \nappropriation accounts, operating expenses and acquisition, \nconstruction, and improvement of equipment and facilities. Operating \nfunds are critically needed by the Coast Guard to protect public safety \nand the marine environment, enforce laws and treaties, ensure safety \nand compliance in our marine fisheries, maintain aids to navigation, \nprevent illegal drug trafficking and illegal alien migration, and \npreserve defense readiness.\n  H.R. 820 will also provide an increase of approximately $130 million \nfor the acquisition, construction, and improvement of equipment and \nfacilities. These funds would be used to support vital long-term \nprojects such as the Deepwater System, which the Coast Guard launched \nin 1998 to modernize its aging, and now inadequate, deepwater-capable \ncutters and aircraft. H.R. 820 specifically authorizes $42.3 million of \nthe $9.6 billion required over the next twenty years for this \nIntegrated Deepwater System.\n  Increasing authorization levels for the Coast Guard is important, but \nwe must continue to work together to ensure the increases in this bill \nbecome a reality for the agency in the coming years. The Coast Guard is \nfacing a fiscal crisis as a result of a number of budgetary pressures. \nWhile demand for Coast Guard services continues to increase, there has \nbeen no parallel increase in the amounts available for the Coast Guard \nin our budget. We are only in the beginning stages of modernizing aging \nships and aircraft through the Deepwater Project, and funding needs \nwill increase in the coming years. At the same time, the number of jobs \ncreated by the new economy has severely affected Coast Guard \nrecruitment, and it disturbs me to report that the Coast Guard is short \nnearly 1,000 uniformed personnel. Ever-increasing fuel and maintenance \ncosts, along with these escalating recruiting costs to address \npersonnel shortfalls, have placed increased pressure on Coast Guard \noperations.\n  This year, these pressures forced the Coast Guard to reduce days at \nseas and flight hours for a number of its missions such as \nenvironmental protection, fisheries enforcement, and drug trafficking; \nmeanwhile, the demands of these missions grow daily. More commercial \nand recreational vessels ply our waters today than ever before in our \nNation's history. International trade has expanded greatly, resulting \nin increased maritime traffic through our Nation's ports and harbors. \nTighter border patrols have forced drug traffickers to use the \nthousands of miles of our county's coastline as the means to introduce \nillegal drugs into our country. In a typical day the Coast Guard will \nsave 14 lives, seize 209 pounds of marijuana and 170 pounds of cocaine, \nand save $2.5 million in property.\n  The continued operation of all of the Coast Guard services is \ncritical. The men and women of the Coast Guard do their utmost for us \nevery day. We owe it to them to provide the resources necessary to \ncarry out their missions effectively and safely. H.R. 820 is a good \nfirst step, and I would hope that my colleagues will join Senator Snowe \nand me in our continuing effort to rebuild our Nation's oldest sea \nservice.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill (S. 1089), as amended, was read the third time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I further ask unanimous consent H.R. 820 be discharged \nfrom the Commerce Committee and the Senate proceed to its \nconsideration. Further, I ask all after the enacting clause be stricken \nand the text of S. 1089, as amended, be inserted in lieu thereof, the \nbill be read the third time and passed, with a motion to reconsider \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 820), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nPresiding Officer (Mr. Voinovich) appointed Mr. McCain, Mr. Stevens, \nMs. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts, conferees on \nthe part of the Senate.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Finally, I ask unanimous consent S. 1089 be placed back \non the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I speak for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  MR. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Campbell pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2950 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is in effect the anniversary of the \nonly\n\n[[Page S7758]]\n\nmeeting of the House-Senate Conference committee on the Hatch-Leahy \njuvenile crime bill. This is the last day before the August recess this \nyear and last year on August 5, Chairman Hatch convened the conference \nfor the limited purpose of opening statements. I am disappointed that \nthe majority continues to refuse to reconvene the conference and that \nfor a over a year this Congress has failed to respond to issues of \nyouth violence, school violence and crime prevention.\n  It has been 15 months since the shooting at Columbine High School in \nLittleton, Colorado, where 14 students and a teacher lost their lives \nin that tragedy on April 20, 1999. It has been 14 months since the \nSenate passed the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill by an overwhelming \nvote of 73-25. Our bipartisan bill includes modest yet effective gun \nsafety provisions. It has been 13 months since the House of \nRepresentatives passed its own juvenile crime bill on June 17, 1999.\n  Sadly, it will be 12 months next week since the House and Senate \njuvenile justice conference met for the first--and only--time on August \n5, 1999, less than 24 hours before the Congress adjourned for its long \nAugust recess.\n  Senate and House Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene \nthe juvenile justice conference and work with Republicans to craft an \neffective juvenile justice conference report that includes reasonable \ngun safety provisions, but the majority refuses to act. Indeed, on \nOctober 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees wrote \nto Senator Hatch, the Chairman of the juvenile justice conference, and \nCongressman Hyde, the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, to \nreconvene the conference immediately. In April 2000, Congressman Hyde \njoined our call for the juvenile justice conference to meet as soon as \npossible in a letter to Senator Hatch, which was also signed by \nCongressman Conyers.\n  A few months ago, the President even invited House and Senate members \nof the conference to the White House to urge us to proceed to the \nconference and to final enactment of legislation before the anniversary \nof the Columbine tragedy. But the majority has rejected his pleas for \naction as they have those of the American people. Apparently, the gun \nlobby objects to one provision in the bill, even though the bill passed \noverwhelmingly, and they will not let us proceed with the conference. \nThis lobby was not elected to the Senate or to the House of \nRepresentatives, but apparently has enormous influence.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about \nschool violence over the last two years and worried about when the next \nshooting may occur. They only hope it does not happen at their school \nor involve their children.\n  Just last week, a 13-year old student put a gun to a fellow classmate \nat Seattle middle school. Although the student fired a shot in the \nschool cafeteria, thankfully no one was hurt during this latest school \nshooting. Unfortunately, that cannot be said about the rash of recent \nincidents of school violence throughout the country. The growing list \nof schoolyard shootings by children in Arkansas, Washington, Oregon, \nTennessee, California, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Mississippi, Colorado, \nGeorgia, Michigan, and Florida is simply unacceptable and intolerable.\n  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. We should not let another school year begin without \naddressing some of the core issues of youth violence and school \nviolence. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, \neffective juvenile justice legislation, and measures to keep guns out \nof the hands of children and away from criminals.\n  It is ironic that the Senate will be in recess next week on the \nanniversary of the first and only meeting of the juvenile justice \nconference. In fact, the Senate has been in recess more than in session \nsince the one ceremonial meeting of the juvenile crime conference \ncommittee. It is beneath us. We ought to meet. We ought to get this \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7758-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7758-S7762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL JUDICIARY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to turn now to another issue. This \ntime last year, I rose to express concern about the final decisions of \nthe Supreme Court's 1998 Term, in which it struck down on federalism \ngrounds three important pieces of bipartisan legislation. Another \nSupreme Court Term has now ended, and this Term's victims include the \nViolence Against Women Act and, as applied to State employees, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act.\n  I see my distinguished friend from Delaware in the Chamber, and I \nknow he has spoken extensively on this. I believe it bears repeating.\n  We have seen a growing trend of judicial second-guessing of \ncongressional policy decisions, both in the Supreme Court and in some \nof the lower Federal courts. Most troubling to me is the encroachment \nof the Federal judiciary on the legitimate functions of the Federal \nlegislative branch in matters that are perceived by the courts to \nimpact the States.\n  We ought to all be concerned about this because it affects our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances. We ought to ask ourselves \nhow we can have a situation where an unelected group of Supreme Court \nJustices can over and over substitute their judgment for the judgment \nof the elected representatives of this country.\n  It is not a question of how we feel about an individual case. \nSometimes I vote for these bills and sometimes I vote against them. But \nwhen we have held hearings, when we have determined that there is a \nneed for Federal legislation, when we have gone forward, and then in an \nalmost cavalier and, in some cases, disdainful fashion, the Supreme \nCourt knocks it all down, something is wrong. It is time for us to join \ntogether in taking stock of the relationship between Congress and the \ncourts.\n  According to a recent article by Stuart Taylor, the Rehnquist Court \nhas struck down about two dozen congressional enactments in the last \nfive terms. That is about five per year--a stunning pace. To put that \nin perspective, consider that the Supreme Court struck down a total of \n128 Federal statutes during its first 200 years. That is less than one \nper year, and it includes the years of the so-called ``activist'' \nWarren Court.\n  Justice Scalia recently admitted that the Rehnquist Court is \n``striking down as many Federal statutes from year to year as the \nWarren Court at its peak.'' In fact, the Rehnquist Court, with its \nseven Republican-appointed Justices, is striking down Federal statutes \nalmost as fast as this Republican Congress can enact them. These cases \nevidence a breakdown of respect between the judiciary and legislative \nbranches, and raise serious concerns about whether the Court has \nembarked on a program of judicial activism under the rubric of \nprotecting State sovereignty.\n  Let me start where I left off a year ago, with the trio of 5-4 \ndecisions that ended the Court's last Term. In the Florida Prepaid \ncase, the Court held that the States could no longer be held liable for \ninfringing a Federal patent. In the College Savings Bank case, the \nCourt held that the States could no longer be held liable for violating \nthe Federal law against false advertising. And in Alden v. Maine, the \nCourt held that the States could no longer be held liable for violating \nthe Federally-protected right of their employees to get paid for \novertime work.\n  These decisions were sweeping in their breadth. They allowed special \nimmunities not just to essential organs of State government, but also \nto a wide-range of State-funded or State-controlled entities and \ncommercial ventures. They tilted the playing field by leaving \ninstitutions like the University of California entitled to benefit from \nFederal intellectual property laws, but immune from enforcement if they \nviolate those same laws. They were also startling in their reasoning, \ncasting aside the text of the Constitution, inferring broad immunities \nfrom abstract generalizations about federalism, and second-guessing \nCongress' reasoned judgment about the need for national remedial \nlegislation.\n\n  When I discussed these decisions last year, I warned that they could \nendanger a wide range of other Federally-protected rights, including \nrights to a minimum wage, rights against certain\n\n[[Page S7759]]\n\nforms of discrimination, and whatever rights we might one day provide \nto health coverage. This year's crop of 5-to-4 decisions continued the \ntrend toward restricting individual rights and diminishing the \nauthority of Congress to act on behalf of all Americans in favor of \nprotecting State prerogatives.\n  The predictions I made last year have unfortunately come to pass with \nthis year's Supreme Court decisions. In Kimel v. Florida Board of \nRegents, the Court held that State employees are not protected by the \nFederal law banning age discrimination, notwithstanding Congress' \nclearly expressed intent. Five members of the Court decided that age \ndiscrimination protections applied to the States were unnecessary. The \nCongress and the American people had it wrong when we concluded that \nage discrimination by State employers was a problem that needed a \nsolution. None of those five Justices sat in on the hearings that \nCongress held 30 years ago, they did not hear the victims of age \ndiscrimination describe their experiences, but they nonetheless decided \nthey knew better than Congress did. Justice Thomas wrote separately to \nsay that he was prepared to go even further and make it even harder for \nCongress to apply anti-discrimination laws to the States.\n  The Kimel decision could spell trouble for all sorts of Federal laws, \nincluding other laws prohibiting discrimination in the workplace and \nregulating wages and hours and health and safety standards. The Supreme \nCourt majority has now told us, after the fact, that we in Congress \nhave to ``build a record,'' like an administrative agency, before they \nwill allow us to protect State employees from discrimination, but it \nhas not made it entirely clear just how many victims of discrimination \nhave to come before us and testify before it will allow us to give them \nlegislative protection.\n  The signs, however, are ominous: the week after it decided Kimel, the \nCourt vacated two lower court decisions holding that States must abide \nby the Equal Pay Act, calling into question the ability of Congress to \noffer State employees protection from sex discrimination. Next Term, in \nUniversity of Alabama v. Garrett, the Court will decide whether States \ncan be held liable for discriminating against employees with \ndisabilities. That plaintiff in Garrett is a State employee--a nurse at \nthe University of Alabama--who was diagnosed with breast cancer, and \nwas demoted after taking sick leave to undergo surgery and \nchemotherapy.\n  The second blow this Term to congressional authority was United \nStates v. Morrison, which struck down a portion of the Violence Against \nWomen Act that provides a Federal remedy for victims of sexual assault \nand violence. The Violence Against Women Act had been our measured \nresponse to the horrifying effects of violence on women's lives \nnationwide, not only on their physical well-being but also on their \nability to carry on their lives and their jobs as they are driven into \nhiding by stalking and prevented from going out at night in some areas \nby fear of rape. After hearing a mountain of evidence detailing the \nimpact of violence on women's lives and interstate commerce, I was \nproud to work with Senator Biden, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy and \nothers in an overwhelming bipartisan consensus in 1994 to enact VAWA.\n  But the five-Justice majority was unimpressed with the evidence, and \nwith the common-sense point that violence affects women's lives, \nincluding their participation in commerce. Relying once again on \nabstract notions of federalism, the Court decided that violence against \nwomen does not affect interstate commerce enough, or rather, it affects \ninterstate commerce, but in the wrong sort of way, so Congress has no \nbusiness protecting American women from violence. One Justice said he \nwould cut even more into Congress' power, saying we had very little \nbusiness doing much of what we had done throughout the 20th century. \nFrankly, I do not want to see us turn back, in the 21st century, to a \n19th century view.\n\n  What made this latest ``federalism'' decision all the more remarkable \nis that the vast majority of the States, whose rights the Court's \n``federalism'' decision are supposed to protect, had urged the Court to \nuphold the VAWA Federal remedy.\n  The Kimel and Morrison decisions are troubling, both for what they do \nto the rights of ordinary Americans, and for what they say about the \nrelationship between Congress and the present majority of the Supreme \nCourt. State's rights and individual rights are both essential to our \nconstitutional scheme, and the Court has a constitutional duty to \nprevent the Congress from encroaching on them. I have spoken before \nabout the need to restrain the congressional impulse to federalize more \nlocal crimes. There are significant policy downsides to such \nfederalization, however, that do not apply in other areas, where each \nAmerican, no matter what State he or she lives in, should have the same \nrights and protections.\n  The legislative judgments we make that are reflected in the laws we \npass deserve more respect than the Rehnquist Court has shown. It is \ntroubling when five unelected Justices repeatedly second-guess our \ncollective judgments as to whether discrimination and violence against \nwomen and other major social problems are serious enough, or affect \ncommerce in the right sort of way, to merit a legislative response.\n  It is even more troubling when a Justice steps out of his judicial \nrole, and beyond the judgment calls inherent in individual cases, to \nexpress a generalized disdain for the legislative branch. Yet, that is \nprecisely what Justice Scalia did in a recent speech, in which he \nsuggested that the oath to uphold the Constitution that each of us \ntakes counts for nothing, and that Acts of Congress should be stripped \nof their traditional presumption of constitutionality. Justice Scalia \nis as free as the next citizen to express his mind, but that sort of \nopen disrespect for Congress coming from a sitting Supreme Court \nJustice bodes ill for democracy, and for the delicate balance of power \nbetween the Congress, the President and the courts on which our \nConstitution rests.\n  I am also fearful that Justice Scalia's remarks are becoming a \nrallying cry for Federal judges around the country who are hostile to \nCongress and to some of our efforts to protect ordinary people from \ndiscrimination, from violence, from invasions of privacy and violations \nof civil liberties, and from environmental and other health hazards. \nThe Federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia--the Fourth Circuit--\nhas the dubious honor of leading this charge with radical new legal \ntheories that cut back on Federal power and individual rights.\n  In January, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed a Fourth Circuit \ndecision invalidating a Federal law that prohibits States from \ndisclosing personal information from motor vehicle records. The Fourth \nCircuit had held that this common-sense privacy law violated abstract \nnotions of federalism. As we have seen, it takes a lot to outdo the \npresent Supreme Court in raising abstract federalism principles over \nindividual rights.\n  Also in January, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly rejected the Fourth \nCircuit's reasoning in a case involving citizen ``standing'' in Federal \ncourt to sue polluters who violate our environmental laws. The Fourth \nCircuit decision had sharply limited the ability of citizens to sue \npolluters and win civil penalties. The Supreme Court reversed that \ndecision by a 7-2 vote, with Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas \ndissenting.\n  The Fourth Circuit is even more consistently hostile to civil rights \nin matters of criminal law and civil liberties. In death penalty cases, \nfor example, it seems to have embraced a doctrine of State \ninfallibility. An article in the American Lawyer last month reported \nthat:\n\n       While condemned inmates' rates of at least partial success \n     in Federal habeas corpus actions run at close to 40 percent \n     nationally, the rate in the 4th Circuit since October 1995 \n     has been a cool 0 percent, with more than 80 consecutive \n     convictions having been upheld.\n\n  In May, a unanimous Supreme Court, a Court that itself espouses the \ngeneral belief that the rights of capital defendants are best protected \nby the State justice system that seeks to execute them, overturned two \nFourth Circuit decisions that denied habeas corpus relief to death row \ninmates who had been sentenced to death on the basis of grossly unfair \nprocedures.\n  Just last month, the Fourth Circuit lost its bid to overturn the \nSupreme\n\n[[Page S7760]]\n\nCourt's landmark decision in Miranda v. Arizona. The Fourth Circuit's \nnotion that it had the right to overturn a longstanding Supreme Court \nprecedent was unorthodox, to say the least. By a 7-2 vote, in which \nJustices Scalia and Thomas dissented again, the Court reaffirmed the \n34-year-old precedent that requires the police to inform suspects of \ntheir right to remain silent.\n  What we are seeing in the Fourth Circuit is unparalleled, but not \nunrivaled. Other Federal courts across the country are also embracing \nJustice Scalia's ``no-deference'' philosophy and busily redefining the \nrelationship of the judiciary to the other branches of government. The \nD.C. Circuit departed from a half century of Supreme Court separation-\nof-powers jurisprudence to strike down air quality standards \nestablished by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, a crucial statute \npassed during the Nixon administration that has improved the air we \nbreath for the last three decades. Meanwhile, in a striking throw-back \nto the Lochner era of economic libertarian ``natural law'' theory, the \nFederal Circuit has adopted an unusually expansive reading of the \nTakings Clause that threatens to undermine basic environmental \nprotections that Congress has established. Likewise, Federal district \ncourts in Texas have recently rendered radical decisions, limiting the \nFederal Government's authority to enforce basic food safety standards.\n  Republican detractors of the Ninth Circuit often refer to that \ncourt's high reversal rate in the Supreme Court. But about half of the \nNinth Circuit decisions that the Supreme Court reversed this year were \nwritten by Reagan and Bush appointees. Moreover, set against the \nreversal record of other circuits, the Ninth Circuit, which has the \nlargest caseload of all the Federal appeals courts, looks about \naverage. Courts with half or a third of the caseload of the Ninth \nCircuit have more than their share of reversals. The Fourth Circuit was \nreversed five times this year, as was the Fifth Circuit. The \noverwhelmingly Republican-appointed judges of the Seventh Circuit were \nreversed in five out of seven cases this year.\n  I have spoken at some length about this growing trend of judicial \ndecisions second-guessing the congressional judgments embodied in laws \nthat apply to the States because I am deeply concerned about what they \nmean for the relationship between the judicial and the legislative \nbranches and for our democracy. When a Supreme Court Justice, one held \nup by some of my Republican friends as a paragon of judicial restraint, \ndeclares that no deference, no respect, is owed to the democratic \ndecisions of Congress, Americans should be concerned.\n  We here in the Senate have a responsibility to safeguard democratic \nvalues. That does not mean that we should be strident, or \ndisrespectful; we should always cherish judicial independence even when \nwe dislike the results. We should, however, defend vigorously our \ndemocratic role as the peoples' elected representatives. When we see \nbipartisan policies, supported by a vast majority of the American \npeople, being overturned time and time again on the basis of abstract \nnotions of federalism, it is our right, and our duty, to voice our \nconcerns. And when the rights of ordinary Americans are defeated by \ntechnicalities in the courts and by abstract notions of ``State's \nrights'' that the States themselves do not support, it is our \nresponsibility to work together to find new ways to protect them.\n\n  I have tried to do that. A year ago, I voiced my concerns about the \nSupreme Court's 1999 State sovereign immunity decisions, as did some of \nmy colleagues, including Senator Biden and Senator Specter. I warned \nthen of their potential impacts on the civil rights of American \nworkers. As we have seen, my fears became a disturbing reality in the \nKimel case. I have also tried to begin work on restoring the integrity \nof our national intellectual property system, in the Intellectual \nProperty Protection Restoration Act, S. 1835, a bill I introduced last \nOctober. That bill would restore intellectual property protections \nwhile meeting all the Court's constitutional objections, however \nquestionable they are. I am delighted that a subcommittee of the House \nJudiciary Committee held a hearing today to explore ways to undo the \ndamage done to our intellectual property system by the Court's 1999 \ndecisions. I hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will consider and \nact on this important issue, which it has ignored all year.\n  These are issues we should all be working on together. Republicans \nand Democrats can agree on the importance of protecting civil rights, \nintellectual property rights, privacy and other rights of ordinary \nAmericans that recent doctrinaire judicial decisions have impaired. We \ncan also agree on the importance of protecting Congress as an \ninstitution from repeated judicial second-guessing of policy judgments \non matters that affect the States.\n  It is important for Congress, as an institution, to focus on making \nour relationship with the Federal judiciary a more constructive and \nmutually respectful one. Here in the Senate, where the Constitution \nrequires us to give our ``advice and consent'' on judicial nominations, \nwe have a special responsibility in this regard, a responsibility to \nprotect both democratic values and judicial independence. The \ndisgraceful manner in which the Senate has treated judicial nominees \ndoes not help and may be a factor in the current breakdown of respect \nbetween the legislative and judicial branches.\n  Too often, judicial nominees have been put through a litmus test by \nmy Republican colleagues to determine whether they will engage in \n``liberal judicial activism.'' In fact, I cannot remember a recent \njudicial nomination hearing in which one of my Republican friends has \nnot made a speech about ``liberal activist judges.'' Strangely, \nhowever, hardly a mention is made of traditional judicial activism--\nstriking down democratically-adopted laws with which one happens to \ndisagree based on abstract principles with no basis in the \nConstitution, as the Supreme Court did in the age discrimination case, \nor overturning the long-standing precedent of a higher court, as the \nFourth Circuit did in the Miranda case. Nor do my colleagues seem \ntroubled by Justice Scalia's disdain for Congress. But I know that my \nRepublican friends are very concerned about ``liberal judicial \nactivism.'' The terms of this test change depending on the \ncircumstances.\n  From what I can gather, the easiest way to spot ``liberal judicial \nactivists'' is by the company they keep. You might call it the \n``activist by association'' principle. Over the last few years, several \noutstanding judicial nominees have come under attack simply because, as \nyoung lawyers out of law school, they clerked for Supreme Court Justice \nWilliam Brennan. These nominees were tarred as potential activists not \nbecause of anything they had done, but because of their one-year \nassociation with a distinguished and respected member of the United \nStates Supreme Court. This test is applied only to delay or oppose \nnominees--clerking for a conservative justice like Chief Justice \nRehnquist has not helped Allen Snyder, a nominee to a vacancy on the \nD.C. Circuit who has been held up in Committee for months. Maybe \nsomeone should send a warning to the students at the Nation's top law \nschools that the Senate has become so partisan that clerking for the \nSupreme Court can damage your career.\n\n  Other nominees were challenged because of their association with \nlegal organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the \nWoman's Legal Defense Fund or for contributing time to pro bono \nactivities. Maybe we should publish a list of groups you cannot \nassociate with, and of rights and liberties you cannot work to protect \nin your private life, if you want to be a Federal judge.\n  How else can we tell if a nominee will be a ``liberal judicial \nactivist''? In the case of Margaret Morrow, it was unfounded \nallegations that she was skeptical toward California voter initiatives. \nWith respect to Marsha Berzon we were told that she would be an \nactivist judge because she had been an ``aggressive'' advocate for her \nclient, the AFL-CIO. Maybe we should advise lawyers in private practice \nwho would like to be judges to be less vigorous in pursuing their \nclients' interests. Of course, since their confirmations neither of \nthese nominees has been cited to be anything other than an outstanding \njudge.\n  Then there is the old-fashioned litmus test. As a member of the \nMissouri\n\n[[Page S7761]]\n\nSupreme Court, Justice White had committed the heresy of voting to \nreverse death sentences in some cases for serious legal error. No \nmatter that Justice White voted to uphold the imposition of the death \npenalty 41 times. No matter that other members of the Missouri Supreme \nCourt, including members of the Court appointed by Republican \ngovernors, had similar voting records and more often than not agreed \nwith Justice White, both when he voted to uphold the death penalty and \nwhen he joined with a majority of that Court to reverse and remand such \ncases for resentencing or a new trial. Maybe someone should have \nadvised Justice White to follow the Fourth Circuit model and bat a \nthousand for the State in death penalty cases, regardless of the \nevidence.\n  Another litmus test that has been dressed up as a sign of ``liberal \njudicial activism'': The nominee's willingness to enforce Roe v. Wade, \nthe Supreme Court's landmark abortion decision. I confess to some \nconfusion as to how a nominee for a lower Federal court could be \nfaulted for promising to adhere to established Supreme Court precedent. \nWhether you agree with Roe or not, it is, after all, the law of the \nland. But maybe someone should advise lower court judges to follow the \nlead of the Fourth Circuit in the Miranda case and disregard Supreme \nCourt precedent.\n  We need to get away from rhetoric and litmus tests, and focus on \nrebuilding a constructive relationship between Congress and the courts. \nWe need balance and moderation that respects the democratic will and \nthe weight of precedent. We do not need partisan delays by anonymous \nSenators because a nominee clerked for Justice Brennan or contributed \nto the legal services organization. We do not need our Federal courts \nfurther packed for ideological purity. We do not need nominees put on \nhold for years, as this Republican Senate has done, while we screen \nthem for their Republican sympathies and associations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthree recent articles about the Supreme Court's jurisprudential \ncounterrevolution, by Professor Larry Kramer of the New York University \nSchool of Law; Professor David Cole of Georgetown University Law \nCenter; and John Echeverria, Director of Environmental Policy Project \nat Georgetown University Law Center.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 23, 2000]\n\n                       The Arrogance of the Court\n\n                           (By Larry Kramer)\n\n       In 1994, after four years of very public debate, including \n     testimony from hundreds of experts in dozens of hearings, \n     Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act. This month, \n     a bare 5 to 4 majority of the Supreme Court brushed all that \n     aside and struck the law down. Why? Not because Congress \n     cannot regulate intrastate matters that ``affect'' interstate \n     commerce. On the contrary, the majority agreed that this is \n     permitted by the Constitution, reaffirming a long-standing \n     point of law. But, the court said, whether the effects are \n     ``substantial'' enough to warrant federal regulation ``is \n     ultimately a judicial rather than a legislative question, and \n     can be settled finally only by this Court.'' And the majority \n     just was not persuaded.\n       This is an astonishing ruling from a court that professes \n     to care about democratic majorities and respect the political \n     process. The justices did much more in this decision than \n     sweep the act off the books. Under a pretense of interpreting \n     the Constitution, they declared that they have the final say \n     about the expediency of an important, and potentially very \n     large, class of federal laws: not just laws under the \n     Commerce Power, which constitute the bulk of modern federal \n     legislation, but many other laws as well. For the limits of \n     all Congress's powers turn eventually on judgments about the \n     need for federal action.\n       This is radical stuff. Previous courts have exercised \n     aggressive judicial review, but never like this. Nothing in \n     the Constitution's language or history supports letting the \n     Supreme Court strike down laws just because it disagrees with \n     Congress's assessment of how much they are needed. Except for \n     a brief period in the 1930s when an earlier court tried to \n     stop FDR's New Deal and was decisively repudiated, the \n     court's role has always ended once it was clear that \n     legislation was rationally related to the exercise of a \n     constitutional power. As Alexander Hamilton observed back in \n     1792, rejecting the very same argument as that made by the \n     court today, ``the degree in which a measure is necessary can \n     never be a test of the legal right to adopt it.''\n       The Founding generation understood, in a way our generation \n     seems to have forgotten, that judicial review must be \n     contained or we lose the essence of self-government. They saw \n     that, while courts have a vital role to play in protecting \n     individuals and minorities from laws that trample their \n     rights, Congress's decisions respecting the need to exercise \n     its legislative power must otherwise be left to voters and \n     elections. They foresaw that questions would arise over the \n     limits of federal authority vis-a-vis the states. But, they \n     said (over and over again), those battles must be waged in \n     the political arena. And so they have been, until now.\n       What kind of government is it when five justices of the \n     Supreme Court, appointed for life by presidents whose \n     mandates expired long ago, can cavalierly override the \n     decision of a democratically elected legislature not on the \n     ground that it acted irrationally but because they do not \n     like its reasoning? By what right do these judges claim the \n     authority to second-guess what Justice Souter in dissent \n     accurately described as a ``mountain of data'' based on \n     nothing more than their contrary intuitions?\n       This is important. We have become way too complacent about \n     letting the Supreme Court run our lives, and the current \n     court has exploited this apathy to extend its authority to \n     unheard of lengths. Everyone in the country should be \n     incensed by this decision; not because the Violence Against \n     Women Act was so wonderful or so necessary, but because \n     deciding that it is not--and make no mistake, that is all the \n     majority did--is none of the Supreme Court's business. Yet \n     liberals will sit awkwardly by because they liked the \n     judicial activism we got from the Warren court, though that \n     court could not touch this one for activism. And, of course, \n     conservatives will gleefully hold their tongues because they \n     never much liked this law in the first place, and because \n     they adore the court's new federalism (not to mention the \n     chance to see liberals hoist by their own petard). In the \n     meantime, only democratic government suffers. Ironies this \n     thick would be comical were the stakes not so high.\n       The majority opinion is animated by a sense that the \n     Framers of our Constitution never imagined the federal \n     government enacting laws such as the violence act. I am sure \n     they are right; the Framers would be astounded at the changes \n     in society that have brought us to this juncture. But nowhere \n     near as flabbergasted as they would be at the \n     presumptuousness of five judges in casting aside the \n     considered judgment of the national legislature for no better \n     reasons than these--or at the complacency of the citizenry in \n     the face of such outrageous conduct.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From The Nation, June 12, 2000]\n\n                           Paper Federalists\n\n                            (By David Cole)\n\n       When conservatives attack Supreme Court decisions \n     (admittedly an increasingly rare event these days), they \n     inevitably charge ``judicial activism.'' Miranda warnings, \n     the right to abortion, the exclusionary rule--all are \n     condemned for having been created by judges out of whole \n     cloth, based on ``interpretations'' of the Constitution that \n     are so unconstrained as to be entirely political.\n       When it comes to ``states' rights,'' however, conservatives \n     sing a different tune. In the past few years, the \n     conservative majority on the Supreme Court has launched a \n     virtual revolution in constitutional jurisprudence, \n     invalidating a host of federal laws on the ground that they \n     violate the autonomy not of human beings but of states. The \n     Court has revived the commerce clause as a limitation on \n     federal power after some fifty-odd years of desuetude. It has \n     found implicit in the Constitution a concept of ``state \n     sovereign immunity'' that jeopardizes Congress's ability to \n     require states to follow federal law. And it has divined from \n     the ``spirit'' of the inscrutable Tenth Amendment a principle \n     of state autonomy with little textual or historical basis. In \n     doing these things, the Court's most conservative Justices--\n     Rehnquist, Scalia, Kennedy, O'Connor and Thomas--have engaged \n     in the very sort of open-ended, freewheeling constitutional \n     interpretation that they excoriate liberals for indulging in \n     on issues of individual rights.\n       This Court's activism on federalism begins with the \n     commerce clause, which for most of our history has been the \n     leading barometer of judicial attitudes toward the balance \n     between state and federal power. In the early part of the \n     twentieth century the Court frequently invoked the clause to \n     strike down labor laws regulating minimum wages, maximum \n     hours and working conditions. The Court reasoned that \n     Congress could regulate only ``commerce,'' not manufacturing \n     or production, although its actual animating principle was a \n     commitment to laissez-faire capitalism.\n       During the New Deal, the Court abandoned this approach and \n     acknowledged that in our increasingly national economy, the \n     terms of production--such as wages, hours and working \n     conditions--obviously affect interstate commerce. It \n     ultimately interpreted the commerce clause to permit Congress \n     to regulate any local activity that, aggregated nationally, \n     might substantially affect interstate trade, a reading that \n     largely took the judiciary out of the job of restraining \n     Congress and relied on the political process to do so.\n       That's where things stood until 1995, when the Court struck \n     down a federal law prohibiting the possession of guns near \n     schools.\n\n[[Page S7762]]\n\n     Then, on May 15, the Court invalidated the Violence Against \n     Women Act, a federal law enabling victims of gender-motivated \n     violence to sue their attackers. In both cases the Court held \n     that Congress may not regulate local ``noneconomic'' \n     activity. Neither gun possession nor gender-motivated \n     violence is ``economic'' activity and must be left to the \n     states to regulate. Congress's findings that violence against \n     women reduces their ability to participate in the work force \n     was insufficient to justify federal regulation. But if \n     Congress has the power to regulate conduct where it \n     ``affects'' interstate commerce, why should it matter whether \n     the conduct itself is labeled ``economic'' or \n     ``noneconomic''? The Court seems to have created a \n     distinction every bit as artificial as the long-rejected line \n     between production and commerce.\n       The Court's activism is even more pronounced in its \n     treatment of ``state sovereign immunity,'' the doctrine that \n     the sovereign--in this case a state--may not be sued. The \n     Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution does recognize a very \n     limited immunity that protects states from being sued by \n     citizens of other states in federal court, at least for cases \n     not based on federal law violations. But today's Court has \n     ignored the explicit language of the amendment to create an \n     expansive immunity that blocks virtually all private \n     suites against states, in state or federal court, under \n     state or federal law. As a result, state employees cannot \n     sue their employer--anywhere--for blatant violations of \n     federal laws, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act. The \n     only exception to this state immunity is where Congress \n     has authorized suits under the Fourteenth Amendment, but \n     the Court has also sharply limited Congress' power to \n     regulate states under that amendment.\n       A third arena for the states' rights revival is the Tenth \n     Amendment. That provision has literally no substantive \n     meaning. It states only that all powers not assigned to the \n     federal government are reserved to the states or the people. \n     The Court once dismissed it as ``a truism.'' But in recent \n     years, the conservative majority has found in its ``spirit'' \n     the authority to strike down federal statutes for requiring \n     state officers to carry out even very minimal tasks in \n     furtherance of a federal program, such as the Brady Bill's \n     requirement that local sheriffs conduct brief background \n     checks on would-be gun purchasers.\n       So why do states' rights issues drive conservative Justices \n     to abandon their cherished principle of judicial restraint? \n     There is undeniably a conservative cast to federalism in the \n     United States. States' rights have nearly always been invoked \n     in support of rightwing causes, from slavery to segregation \n     to welfare devolution. But no one would seriously suggest \n     that today's Court is using federalism as a cover to protect \n     those who carry guns near schools or rape women.\n       What really drives the conservative Justices toward states' \n     rights is their antipathy to individual rights. ``States' \n     rights'' is itself something of an oxymoron; rights generally \n     describe legal claims that people assert against government, \n     not claims of governments. Protecting states' rights nearly \n     always directly reduces protection for individual rights. The \n     Court's sovereign immunity decisions bar individuals from \n     suing states for violating their federal rights. And its \n     commerce clause and Fourteenth Amendment decisions have \n     reduced Congress's ability to create federal statutory rights \n     for individuals in the first place.\n       The link between protecting the ``rights'' of states and \n     disregarding those of individuals is illustrated even more \n     clearly in the Rehnquist Court's treatment of habeas corpus \n     and federal injunctions. The Court has consistently cited \n     deference to the states to justify shrinking the rights of \n     state prisoners to go to federal court for review of their \n     constitutional claims. And it has grandly invoked ``Our \n     Federalism'' to limit the ability of federal courts to \n     oversee and enjoin police abuse against minorities.\n       Paradoxically, then, this Court is most activist in \n     restricting its own power. The conservative Justices eagerly \n     engage in open-ended constitutional interpretation when the \n     result forecloses an avenue for rights protection but assail \n     their liberal counterparts for doing so when the result is to \n     recognize an individual right. As a result, states receive \n     far more solicitude than individuals. But the opposite should \n     be the case: The Court's highest calling is not the \n     protection of regimes but of individuals who cannot obtain \n     protection from the political process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        It's Conservatives Now Who Are Judicial Activists: Why \n                  Environmentalists Should Be Alarmed\n\n                          (By John Echeverria)\n\n       Recent federal court decisions concerning our environmental \n     laws cry out for a giant reality check on the recently \n     renewed political debate about whether federal judges should \n     be ``strict constructionists'' when it comes to deciding \n     issues of constitutional law.\n       Governor George W. Bush last month revived a familiar GOP \n     mantra when he declared that he would only appoint ``strict \n     constructionists'' as opposed to ``judicial activists'' to \n     the federal bench. This stance echoes similar statements by \n     Bob Dole, the GOP standard bearer three years ago, as well as \n     by paterfamilias George Bush I and the modern GOP's founding \n     father, Ronald Reagan.\n       Governor Bush's political declaration has a kind of \n     through-the-looking-glass quality all too familiar in modern \n     American political life. While Bush and others on the \n     political right decry judicial activism, in some arenas of \n     constitutional law, particularly those affecting our \n     environmental laws, it is GOP-appointed judges who are \n     actually the most activist.\n       On the other hand, out of a habit of supporting an \n     expansive approach to constitutional interpretation, which \n     apparently served their ideological interests in the past \n     befuddled democratic forces rise to the bait of defending the \n     judiciary against charges of ``judicial activism'' even as \n     their environmental protection gains, achieved through hard-\n     fought battles in the political arena, are being taken away \n     by GOP-appointed judicial activists.\n       Sensible conversation about the virtues and limitations of \n     a ``strict constructionist'' approach to judicial \n     interpretation calls in the first instances for an accurate \n     understanding of how the federal bench is actually deciding \n     real cases today.\n       In simplistic terms, a judge is said to be a ``strict \n     constructionist'' if she resolves constitutional cases solely \n     on the basis of the language and original understanding of \n     the constitutional text. On the other hand, a judge who looks \n     to other sources for interpretive assistance, such as some \n     particular social or economic philosophy, is said to engage \n     in judicial activism.\n       Governor Bush left undefined the specific rulings he thinks \n     reflects judicial activism. But similar GOP pronouncements in \n     the past honed in on the U.S. Supreme Court's expansion of \n     the constitutional rights of the criminally accused under the \n     leadership of Chief Justice Earl Warren in the 1950's and \n     60's.\n       Another favorite target has been the Court's decision in \n     Roe v. Wade, which interpreted the Constitution to create a \n     zone of privacy granting women the constitutional right to \n     decide whether or not to terminate a pregnancy without state \n     interference.\n       Whether or not these (now somewhat dated) judicial \n     innovations can fairly be characterized as the product of an \n     activist judiciary, it is undeniably true that the charge of \n     judicial activism can, with at least equal fairness, be \n     lodged against more recent judicial decisions that serve a \n     so-called ``conservative'' 'philosophy.\n       This is particularly true in cases involving constitutional \n     challenges to the authority of government to adopt and \n     enforce environmental regulations. Consider the following \n     examples.\n       Over the last decade, the U.S. Supreme Court has issued an \n     unbroken string of decisions expanding public liability under \n     the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment for environmental \n     and land-use regulations that impinge on private property \n     interests, undermining the ability of the government to adopt \n     new environmental protection standards.\n       The takings clause states that ``private property [shall \n     not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.'' \n     According to leading scholars on all sides of the ideological \n     spectrum, the available historical evidence unequivocally \n     shows that the drafters of the Bill of Rights intended the \n     clause to apply only to direct appropriations of private \n     property, and never intended the clause to apply to \n     regulations under any circumstances.\n       In its recent decisions, however, the Court has established \n     the takings clause as a significant new constraint on \n     environmental regulatory authority. From the standpoint of a \n     principled strict constructionist, this direction in judicial \n     thinking would be simply indefensible.\n       The same is true of recent Supreme Court decisions limiting \n     citizens' right to sue to enforce federal health and \n     environmental laws.\n       There is a general academic consensus that the drafters of \n     the Constitution intended Congress to have broad power to \n     grant private citizens the right to bring suits in their own \n     names to enforce federal laws. Nevertheless, over the last \n     decade the U.S. Supreme Court, led by Justice Antonin Scalia, \n     has erected new barriers which citizens must cross to \n     establish their right to bring suit to enforce environmental \n     laws.\n       The Court's recent decisions for example, have severely \n     undermined the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species \n     Act, and more particularly the role Congress intended for \n     citizens in enforcing those laws, a result which principled \n     advocate of a non-activist judiciary should supposedly abhor.\n       Conservatives living in glass houses might start a move \n     toward a more sensible debate by refraining from hurling \n     rocks in the direction of the federal judiciary. Or perhaps \n     liberals may wish to rethink a strategy based on warding off \n     rocks tossed by others, and may wish to consider hurling a \n     few of their own.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I recall a time very early in my career, \nnot as a Senator but when I was involved here in Washington in support \nof a particular amendment that was being debated in the House of \nRepresentatives. I sat in the gallery in the House and listened to the \ndebate and was somewhat startled when a Member of the House stood up \nand attacked the amendment as ``the General Motors amendment.''\n  He went on to thunder against big business in general, and General \nMotors specifically, and say: This amendment would take care of big \nbusiness and it would hurt everybody else.\n  After it was over--and I can report gratefully that our side \nprevailed in that particular debate--one of his colleagues went to this \nparticular Member of the House and said: What are you talking about \nwhen you are attacking General Motors on this amendment?\n  And the Member said: Well, when you don't have any substantive \narguments, you are always safe in attacking General Motors.\n  That comes to mind because, as we talk about today's energy crisis, \nand the rising price of energy at the pump, there are those who are \nattacking big oil. I think they are a little like that former Member of \nthe House. When your arguments don't have any substance, attack big oil \nand hope that the public will respond.\n  I want to talk today about why gasoline prices are so high and why a \nnameless political attack on big oil is not the answer. I do expect \nthese attacks to continue. We are in an election year. There is at \nleast one candidate for President who thinks, if he constantly attacks \nbig oil, people will not pay attention to what is really going on. I \nwant people to pay attention to what is really going on and focus on \nwhy we have energy problems in the United States.\n  I start with a memo dated June 5 of this year, sent to the Secretary \nof Energy, through the Deputy Secretary, from Melanie Kenderdine, who \nis the Acting Director of the Office of Policy in that Department.\n  She says a very startling thing. I must say, when I say startling, I \nam being sardonic about it. She says that it is due to high consumer \ndemand and low inventories. What a great revelation--high demand and \nlow supply is going to give us high energy prices. Of course it is.\n  I have said many times, and repeat here today, that one of the things \nI think should be engraved in stone around here for all of us to see \nevery day is the statement: You cannot repeal the law of supply and \ndemand.\n  We keep trying on this floor--we keep trying in the Government--to \nrepeal the law of supply and demand and make prices and costs in the \nreal economy respond to our legislative whims. But they do not. Prices \nrespond to the law of supply and demand.\n  So this internal memo, from the Department of Energy, is interesting \nin that it says the real problem is that ``high consumer demand and low \ninventories have caused higher prices for all gasoline types. . . .''\n  But then it goes on to say there are other things that have \nexacerbated the problem, made it worse. These things are, in fact, \nlegislative, or, in this case, regulatory actions taken within the \nClinton-Gore administration in response to the constituency that Vice \nPresident Gore seeks to cultivate as he pursues his Presidential \ncampaign.\n  It talks about, specifically:\n\n       . . . an RFG formulation specific to the area that is more \n     difficult to produce . . .\n\n  The ``area'' we are talking about here is the Midwest. We are talking \nabout Chicago. We are talking about the State of Michigan. We are \ntalking about the Midwest, where gasoline prices are currently over $2 \na gallon.\n  These are regulatory actions--I will not read them all--that have \nbeen taken by the Clinton-Gore administration that have raised the \nprice of gasoline simply by constricting further the supply. If we \nunderstand this, that we cannot repeal the law of supply and demand, if \nwe understand that everything that has anything to do with constricting \nsupply is going to drive up prices, we will begin to understand why we \nhave runaway prices.\n  What can we do to increase supply? That is the answer. You don't have \nto be a Ph.D. to understand that. You don't have to be smart enough to \ngo on ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire'' and name all of the foreign \nheads of state if you want to understand this. You have to understand \nthe very basic principle. If we are going to bring gasoline prices \ndown, we are going to have to increase supply.\n  As an aside, let me point out that this problem is not limited to \ngasoline prices alone. Americans are facing higher heating oil prices \nnext winter. Americans are facing higher hot water prices from natural \ngas. For any source of energy, the price is going up. Why? Because the \nsupply is not sufficient to meet the demand--economics 101.\n  Let us look at the sources of supply in this country and what the \nClinton administration--under the prodding of Vice President Gore who \nis acknowledged to be the leader on this whole subject within the \nadministration--has done to supply. Let's start with oil. What has \nhappened to the supply of oil in the United States? We find that 56 \npercent of our oil comes from foreign sources now, which is up from 35 \npercent, the level when we faced the oil crisis in the 1970s. If we are \ngoing to decrease this dependence on foreign oil, we ought to increase \nthe amount of supply in the United States. It is very simple. If we \nhave oil in the United States, let's start pumping that oil to increase \nthe supply.\n  What have we done since President Clinton has been in office? Under \nthe prodding of Vice President Gore, when there was an opportunity to \nincrease supply up in Alaska, this administration said, no, we will not \nallow you to do that. We passed legislation, both Houses of Congress, \nand sent it to the President, that would have increased supply, had \nmore oil available in the United States. Under the prodding of Vice \nPresident Gore, the President said, no, we will not allow you to drill \nfor oil in Alaska, even though there are indications there is as much \noil up there as there is in Saudi Arabia, according to some reports. \nNo, we will not allow you to increase that source of supply.\n  There are other sources of supply domestically. What about the Outer \nContinental Shelf? President Clinton said, no, you can't drill anymore, \nno more exploration on the Outer Continental Shelf until 2012. Vice \nPresident Gore, in his campaign, has pledged to stretch this \nprohibition perpetually. President Clinton says, we will prohibit you \nfrom doing it until 2012. Vice President Gore says that is not good \nenough; we will prohibit you from going further.\n  So they won't let us look for supply in Alaska. They won't let us \nlook for supply on the Outer Continental Shelf. What about the Federal \nlands? Is there oil in the Federal lands? No, we won't let you drill. \nWe won't let you explore in the Federal lands, even to find that out. \nSo we are at the mercy of foreign sources of supply. This \nadministration has determined to keep us at the mercy of foreign \nsources of supply when we are talking about oil.\n  Now let's talk about natural gas. The geologists say the United \nStates has an almost unlimited supply of natural gas. Maybe it is all \nright for us not to increase the supply of oil, even though that is \nwhat is driving up the cost of gasoline at the pump, if we can provide \nour energy through natural gas. Federal lands in the Rocky Mountain \nWest, where I come from, contain up to 137 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas. But this administration has put those lands off limits for \nexploration. We cannot even find out how much is there. No, Vice \nPresident Gore says, we can't look for natural gas on Federal lands.\n  So what other sources of energy do we have? Well, one of the major \nsources of energy in my State is hydroelectric power coming from the \nGlen Canyon Dam. The Sierra Club has said: Let's tear down the Glen \nCanyon Dam. Let's take it down and eliminate that source of power \nsupply altogether. The administration, to its credit, has said, no, we \ndon't think that is such a good idea. But the Vice President, who has \nbeen endorsed by the Sierra Club, says he endorses their agenda, which \nraises the question, if he were to become President, would he in fact \nsay, let us tear down the Glen Canyon Dam and thereby destroy that \nsource of power? They have already suggested they want to study tearing \ndown the dams on the lower Snake River, which produce hydroelectric \npower. Now, in this election\n\n[[Page S7764]]\n\nseason, we have a statement out of the administration and the Vice \nPresident that says: We will not take down these dams now. We will not \ntake these dams down in the short term. We will study it.\n  There are those who suggest that means we will wait until after the \nelection, and then we will take down the dams. If, indeed, the dams are \ntaken down, hydroelectric power goes away. Hydroelectric dams generate \nroughly 10 percent of this Nation's power.\n  So we can't drill for oil, we can't explore for natural gas, and we \nwant to dismantle some of the hydroelectric power. What about nuclear \npower? That is where most of the power comes from in Europe and in many \nother countries that don't have the hydroelectric facilities we do.\n  On April 25 of this year, President Clinton vetoed legislation that \nwould have allowed storage at Yucca Mountain of nuclear waste. Nuclear \nwaste is building up at every nuclear facility in the United States. At \nsome point we have to deal with it. The Congress thought it had dealt \nwith it by creating Yucca Mountain. The President said, no, even though \nwe have spent billions and billions of dollars preparing Yucca Mountain \nto receive this nuclear waste, we won't let it go there, thus \njeopardizing the opportunity for this country to have a long-standing, \nlong-going nuclear program.\n  All right. If we are not going to be able to handle nuclear power, if \nwe can't drill for oil and oil power, if we can't explore for natural \ngas, and if we are trying to cut back on hydroelectric, where are we \ngoing to get the power? There are those who say, well, most of the \npower in this country comes from coal. Coal, of course, has a problem \nas far as the environment is concerned.\n  I am proud to report that we have in the State of Utah some of the \nbest low-sulfur coal in the world, which, if burned, would have an \nenormous benefit for the environment. Just 4 years ago, President \nClinton, with Vice President Gore clearly identified as the driving \nforce behind the decision, shut down the possibility of ever using any \nof that coal from Utah when he created the Grand Staircase Escalante \nNational Monument, using the Antiquities Act in a way it was never \nanticipated to be used, violating all aspects of consultation as \nrequired under NEPA, refusing to even admit to elected officials in the \naffected State that he was even thinking about it. The President, with \na stroke of a pen, said, you can't use any of that low-sulfur, good-\nburning coal.\n\n  So you have to go to other kinds of coal. Fifty-five percent of our \nNation's electricity is generated by coal, and 88 percent of the \nelectricity in the Midwest comes from coal.\n  But now they are saying we must put controls and restrictions on coal \nand the activity with respect to coal--to the point we have seen the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, who represents a number of coal \nproducers, demonstrate his concern with this administration.\n  So what is left, Mr. President? What is left to increase the supply? \nWell, you can't drill for oil. You can't explore for natural gas. You \ncan't expand hydroelectric power. We hope to get that back. You can't \nuse the coal. What is left? Prayer? I believe in prayer. But I also \nbelieve that the Lord prefers those who pray to him to do a little bit \nabout it, to work at it. If I can go back again to the roots of my \nState, founded by the pioneers who came across the Plains, the story is \ntold about a wagon train that got caught in a river. One of the leaders \nof the wagon train immediately dropped to his knees. The other fellow \nwho was involved said, ``What are you doing?'' He said, ``I am \npraying.'' And the second man said, ``I said my prayers this morning. \nGet up and pull.''\n  I think if we are going to pray for divine assistance to help us \nincrease the supply for energy in this country, we better get up and \npull at the same time and recognize that saying no to the expansion of \nevery single source of energy in this country in the name of appealing \nto an environmental community, as the Vice President has historically \ndone, puts us in the position where we are going to have high energy \nprices for as far as the eye can see.\n  I hope as people address the question of why gasoline is over $2 a \ngallon in the Midwest today--and those high prices are spreading--and \nas people address the question of why fuel oil will be twice as much in \nthe winter than it has historically been, as people address the \nquestion of why the natural gas prices are continuing to go up, they \nwill understand that, once again, we cannot repeal the law of supply \nand demand. If we want to bring energy prices under control in this \ncountry, we ought to help the President and the Vice President \nunderstand that truth and say the only solution to high prices, Mr. \nPresident and Mr. Vice President, is increased supply for the demand \nthat is built into our economy. As soon as they understand that and \nwill work with this Congress to try to get increased supply in the \nvarious ways we have sent them legislation to do, we will then--and \nonly then--begin to see these high prices come down.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7764-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7764-S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the energy and water bill on \nappropriations has been held up. I understand that the distinguished \nminority leader has an objection to it. I share with Senators the \nimportance of that bill. I suggest, hopefully, that the minority leader \nrethink this because I do have some confidence that he is not \nexclusively interested in partisan politics, and that perhaps this very \ngood bill on energy and water could be passed and sent to the \nPresident; although, my hopes are dwindling.\n  Essentially, one looks at the energy and water appropriations bill, \nand while I would devote some time to the energy crisis, which my \nfriend spoke about eloquently, I will interrupt my comments to say this \nto the Senator: Incredibly, there is a position being formulated by the \nVice President's campaign to claim that George W. Bush and Dick Cheney \nwould be bad for American energy consumers. Isn't that a joke?\n  What is bad for American energy consumers, and the reason gasoline \nprices are so high, and natural gases are skyrocketing, and we are \ngrowing in dependence upon foreign countries for our very lifeblood, \nfor without energy, we have no economy. Of late, we have decided it \nmust be so clean that the only thing we are using in any increased \nabundance is natural gas. We are even shying away, in this \nadministration, from clean coal technology. Did the Senator know that \ntechnology to clean up coal is being pushed down by this administration \ninstead of up?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is correct. If I may make one other comment, \nthe comment has been made that they want wind as the source. I have \nheard environmental groups have complained that they do not want \nwindmills out on the prairies because they will damage the birds.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me tell the Senator this: I asked this \nadministration and I asked this Vice President to send to us what their \ngreat energy policy has been during the last 8 years. Every time we say \nthere is none, they say they have got one, they have had one and we \nturned it down. I would love to see it. I would like to evaluate it and \nsend it out to the energy people and ask them what would it have \nproduced had we given more money to solar and wind than we did. How \nwould that have had an impact on the consumers of America--paying this \nenormous price for gasoline, this enormous new price for natural gas?\n  Frankly, I say to my friend from Utah, if Americans don't know it--\nbecause we worry so much about Social Security and its future, Medicare \nand its future, what happens to this surplus, and what happens to the \ndebt--probably the biggest challenge to the American way of life and \nour standard of living, driving automobiles and finding jobs and \nfactories growing, is that we have no energy policy. And we are going \nto move slightly and slowly, because of this administration, into a \nposition where we are not going to have enough energy to make America \ngo, or it will be so high that Americans will wonder what in the world \nhappened to us.\n  Do you know when that will be? That will be when our dependence on \nforeign sources of energy grows some more. Americans should know that \nover 50\n\n[[Page S7765]]\n\npercent of the crude oil and crude oil products this great Nation \nconsumes comes from foreign countries, from the so-called cartel. It is \nnot all Saudi Arabia. We have South American and Central American \ncountries in there, too. But do you know what. They are not interested \nin America. They are interested in how much their oil will bring on the \nmarket to them. For a few years, they can sit back and say: America, \nAmerica, when oil prices were $10 a barrel and you were hopping along \nand we were broke and we could not pay our debts and could not borrow \nmoney--one of the closest things to a financial crisis for Saudi \nArabia, whether or not you like the sheiks--financial jeopardy was when \noil prices dropped so low. We were thrilled. What do you think they are \ngoing to think when the oil prices finally get up where they are making \na lot of money and America is crying for it? They are going to say: \nWhere were you when oil prices got down below 10 and hovered around 10 \nwhile we cried?\n  Frankly, I believe if the Vice President's campaign decides that our \nwonderful ticket for President, because one comes from a mass oil-\nproducing State, and he is proud of it--and the other one, after \nserving in the highest office in this country, is the president of a \n100,000-person corporation that happens to be involved in seeing to it \nthat we continue to get oil and gas in America by working down there in \noil patch--frankly, I don't think we ought to assume that this attack \nmakes any sense or that they will do it.\n  I think what we should do is we should attack Vice President Gore as \nbeing the mastermind, the promoter of a no energy policy for America, \nunless it is wind and solar, which all of us think is marvelous but \nclearly cannot help America through a crisis.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments. I know a lot about nuclear \npower. I am embarrassed for America that we are doing what we are doing \non nuclear power. It is so scientifically unreal and untrue, as to the \nattacks on nuclear power, and it is a shame. The greatest country on \nEarth in engineering cannot take high-level fuel rods and move them a \nlittle bit across the country and put them somewhere for safekeeping. \nWe can't do that. But 1 out of 25 American ships sails the seas, some \nwith one nuclear powerplant--as they have over there in Pennsylvania. \nSome have one, some have two. They have sailed the seas since 1954. No \nmore in America--except one in New Zealand that denies these ships with \nfuel rods safely on board access to their ports. There is no risk. \nThere has never been an accident. Here we sit because a few Americans \nare frightened to death of radioactivity--low, high, or indifferent; \njust the word ``radioactive''--while they live in an radioactive \nenvironment on average. All of us are exposed to more low-level \nradiation than most of the things we are afraid of because there is \nplenty of it around. But because of them, we sit here and cannot find a \nway to help the State of Minnesota that has fuel rods sitting there \nfrom nuclear power which have been as safe as can be, and we can't get \nenough votes here to move them across the country. Yet those boats with \nit move all over the world. We sit here with a President--probably \nsupported by the Vice President--who says no.\n\n  Look, if they like to talk about energy policy, I think we ought to \njust say: Mr. Vice President, the one thing you take into this campaign \nis that you have been part of an administration with as bad an energy \npolicy as any because, as a matter of fact, you had none.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will my friend yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would be delighted. I know I said something \nimplicitly about his State, but I didn't mean to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to ask my friend from New Mexico: \nWould George W. Bush think he would have a different policy and would \nallow the nuclear waste to go to Nevada?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know about that. We will build a short-term \nnuclear waste facility within 6 to 8 months of the next President, if \nhe is a Republican, because it is totally safe. Whether they put it in \nNevada or somewhere else, I don't know.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to say again, getting back to the \nenergy and water bill, that I hope we can work something out on his \nissue, an issue that bothers some States on his side of the aisle, \nwhile on my side of the aisle, the Missouri Senators and the \nMississippi Senators and others, have a different view. There is an \namendment to this energy and water bill that attempts to solve that \nproblem by not letting some amendments proceed with reference to a \nCorps of Engineers manual.\n  If this bill does not become law by October 1, I want to talk about a \ncouple of things that will really be bad for some States, and certainly \nfor my State will not be good.\n  In Pantex, TX, there are 2,800 employees; there are 7,300 at the \nSandia National Laboratory; there are 3,000 in the Kansas City nuclear \nweapons plant. Moving over to water, the Army Corps of Engineers has \n125,000 workers on 1,400 projects.\n  This is an important bill. I don't want to go up to October 1 and not \nhave a bill and have to say to them that because somebody would not let \nus bring up our bill--which we could have done, which we could have \ngotten passed--we are now at October 1 and can't get anything passed. \nAnd we are playing a game of who did what to whom. Who keeps the \nGovernment open? Who closes it? We could have had this completed. We \ncould have been in conference this weekend and be back from the \nconvention with it finished. It could then go to the President and be \nsigned. I don't go beyond just asking that the problem be eliminated.\n  I take Senator Daschle at his word. There is nothing to this other \nthan he is concerned about protecting a couple of States. I am \nconcerned about a couple of other States or more. I am concerned about \nkeeping in law what has been in the law for at least two previous \nyears.\n  I again thank the distinguished Senator from Utah for his comments.\n  I want to respond for a moment to a very good friend of mine from the \nother side of the aisle. I consider him a friend. For the most part, we \nrun into each other on dairy issues. People do not know that New Mexico \nis a big dairy State. But clearly, the distinguished Senator, Mr. \nFeingold, comes from a State with a lot of dairy cows. We frequently \nare on each other's side, or against each other, principally because \nthat is a farming issue. But today, in some brief remarks, Senator \nFeingold took his farming issues, and instead of being concerned about \nhis State, got over into my State and into an issue that involves \nthousands of farmers in New Mexico.\n  The issue is that thousands of farmers in New Mexico are on a river \nthat runs short of water in dry years. We are growing into a \nconfrontation as to who owns the flow of the river in a dry year, and a \nsilver minnow, which has been declared an endangered species, which \nthey think currently resides in the extreme southern regions of the \nriver close to the Texas border. Thousands of farmers use it to \nirrigate small and medium-sized farms, and there are a few large ones.\n  I hope, if the Senator's constituents, as he said, are concerned \nabout this, they are concerned about the entire problem--the problem of \ncities that own water in a dry river basin, and the river basin is not \nalways totally moist and running with water. What about the thousands \nof farmers who under our State law own the water? I think if he \nclearly understood that, he would say: I choose not to interfere in a \ncontest between the minnows and thousands of farmers and maybe two \ncities or more. And maybe he would say: I wouldn't like Senator \nDomenici getting involved in that if that were my State situation. \nThough he is entitled to and can certainly come down here and do that, \nI hope maybe before doing it--or maybe even now--he would talk with us \nabout the issue, which is a very interesting issue.\n\n  For the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks, I have been constantly in touch with the \nSecretary of Interior seeing what we could do to try to work this issue \nout. I have put on this energy and water bill something so that water \nwill not be governed totally by a Solicitor General's opinion.\n  That is the issue. I contend it shouldn't be. We might be able to \nwork that out soon because there are some very serious problems \ninvolved that ought to be worked out.\n\n[[Page S7766]]\n\n  I thank Senator Feingold for his consideration of issues that might \naffect my State. I think I have been concerned with his. I would truly \nlike to talk to him about this subject because I don't believe it is as \nsimple an issue as perhaps some of his endangered species constituents \nindicate in their request to him that he get involved in the issue of \nthousands of farmers in the State of New Mexico and whether they get \nwater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7766-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding \nrule XXII, the Senate immediately adopt the motion to proceed to H.R. \n4733 and the cloture vote regarding the China PNTR immediately occur, \nand if cloture is invoked, the 30 hours postcloture not begin until the \nSenate resumes the motion in September.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule \nXXII, at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, September 5, 2000, the Senate temporarily \nlay aside the China PNTR motion to proceed and begin consideration of \nthe energy and water appropriations bill, and the consideration of \nthese two measures continue throughout the week of September 4, 2000.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that just prior to the vote, the \nfollowing Senators be recognized for the following times: Baucus for 5 \nminutes, Hollings for 5 minutes, Moynihan for 5 minutes, and Roth for 5 \nminutes.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the allotted morning business \ntimes ordered earlier today commence immediately following the rollcall \nvote, and the yet designated Republican slot be allocated to Senator \nBob Smith for up to 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me explain, if I could, what just occurred.\n  We will have 15 to 20 minutes of time now that will be used for \nSenators to speak, those I just mentioned. That will be followed by the \nvote on the China PNTR motion to proceed. Then there will be a period \nof morning business time to follow that.\n  When we return in September, we will go during the day to the China \nPNTR debate. That will be laid aside at 6 o'clock, and we will do the \nenergy and water appropriations bill. This is classically described as \na double tracking. We will be doing the appropriations bill at night. I \nhope it won't take but a couple nights. It may take three. During the \nday, we will be debating the China PNTR.\n  I have assured Senators on both sides of the aisle that we are not \ngoing to shove this through. Senators who need time, Senators who want \nto offer amendments on the China trade bill are going to have the \nopportunity to do that. I think that is the right way to do it. We are \nnot going to do it in the wee hours of the night. We are going to do it \nin the day. This is a major international trade agreement, and it needs \nto be done carefully and with thought. The Senate has a long tradition \nof acting carefully and with dignity when it comes to important matters \nof this nature. That is the way we are going to treat it when we \nreturn. There will be no rush to judgment, but I do think the \nresponsible thing to do is to begin to make progress toward an eventual \njudgment.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Byrd, Senator \nHollings, Senator Wellstone and all, for their cooperation on this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for \nannouncing this arrangement. I thank my colleagues for their \ncooperation on this complicated but very understandable schedule. The \nmajority leader has announced there will not be any cloture\n\n[[Page S7767]]\n\nmotions filed or any rush to judgment on this issue. People will have \nthe opportunity to offer amendments. I will work with our colleagues to \nassure they have that opportunity throughout the week, for whatever \nlength of time it may take. I do hope perhaps we might be able to reach \nsome agreement on time for these amendments, and my colleagues have \nassured me they are not averse to considering a time factor as we \nconsider the order of these amendments.\n  As I understand it, that would then accommodate the opportunity for \nus to vote this afternoon. I would be interested if the majority leader \ncould comment on when that vote might take place.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, that is correct. I indicated \nthere would be 15 or 20 minutes of statements by the four Senators who \nwere identified before that vote. So I expect this vote will occur at \napproximately 4:30.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, we have one Member who has to go \nto a funeral. The latest the plane leaves is at 4:30. I am wondering, \nunder the unanimous consent that has already been entered, we have the \nfour, and Senator Wellstone wishes to speak. Could we do it immediately \nafter the vote? I am doing that for one of the Senators.\n  Mr. LOTT. We certainly can have time for statements after the vote. \nEven if the time that was included in the agreement was used, it would \nonly be 20 minutes. We would be ready to begin voting at 4:15 or 4:20. \nWe will have morning business time or we can arrange for Senators who \nwish to speak to speak right after the vote. I would be glad to \naccommodate that.\n\n  Mr. REID. May we add Senator Wellstone to that so there will be 25 \nminutes after the vote?\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator is talking about having all of the statements \nmade after the vote instead of before the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Otherwise people are missing airplanes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I have no objection to that, but part of the agreement was \nthat these four would speak before the vote.\n  Let me suggest this: In view of the request that has been made, Mr. \nPresident, I will ask an additional unanimous consent request, if \nSenator Daschle will yield me the time to do this. I ask unanimous \nconsent, of those Senators who wish to speak immediately before the \nvote, that they agree to speak immediately after the vote in the order \nthat we read them, 5 minutes each, and that be followed by Senator \nHelms for 5 minutes and Senator Wellstone for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, what was in \nthe agreement that was entered into?\n  Mr. LOTT. The agreement with regard to the vote this afternoon was \nthat we would have the vote after statements by Senator Baucus, Senator \nHollings, Senator Moynihan, and Senator Roth for 5 minutes each. Then \nwe would go to the vote. I have now asked unanimous consent to amend \nthat to add that the speeches be made immediately following the vote \nand to include Senator Helms and Senator Wellstone for 5 minutes. Those \nspeeches would occur immediately following the vote.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield to Senator Feingold.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want to clarify one point. What I understood from our \nagreement, what I believe was said was that there would be no cloture \nmotion filed during the first week we are back on China PNTR; is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. LOTT. Part of that agreement was that there would not be cloture \nduring the first week of debate. I must say, I did not intend to do it \nthat way.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No cloture motion filed during the first week?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will go ahead and make that commitment now. I won't file \nor have a vote that week. After all, it is going to be a short week, \nand we do have appropriations work to do. We will not file cloture the \nfirst week we are back on PNTR.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, did Senator Byrd wish further clarification?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I was not on the floor when the agreement \nwas entered into. I want to know what was entered into while I was not \non the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly, we want the Senator to have that information. I \nbelieve the Senator has it before him. If I could sum it up in laymen's \nlanguage so the rest of us will understand it, we would have four \nspeeches before the vote on the motion to proceed on China PNTR, to be \nfollowed by a vote on that motion to proceed; that we would then come \nback in on September 5. We would have debates on China PNTR during the \nday. At 6 o'clock on that Tuesday, we would turn to debate and action, \nperhaps, on the energy and water appropriations bill, and that we would \ncontinue the next day on China PNTR and continue that next Wednesday \nnight on energy and water, if necessary. So, basically, it was to get a \nvote on this motion to proceed this afternoon, with some prior \nstatements, and then we would work on debate on China PNTR during the \nday, as we should, and that we would double track and try to move these \nappropriations bills.\n\n  I know Senator Byrd wants us to do our work and wants our \nappropriations bills to be done. I would like to have an agreement \nbeyond this, but it is progress. We will get back on the energy and \nwater bill, which was the next bill in order. I believe Senator Reid \nand Senator Domenici will finish that bill probably in a matter of \nhours.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reclaiming the floor, let me add to the \nmajority leader's comments by saying that I have indicated to him that \nwe will work, if we cannot reach agreement on the Treasury-Postal, to \ntake that up immediately following energy and water and other \nappropriations bills as well, keeping this order in line, the \nsequencing in line until we have accommodated the debate and votes on \nall of these remaining appropriations bills.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have had discussions with my own leader \nabout PNTR and about getting on with appropriations bills. We had \nseveral discussions. I have had discussions with the minority leader's \nfloor staff as to whether or not we could get back on those two \nappropriations bills, energy and water and Treasury-Postal Service. \nThat was the reason why I wanted to know what had happened when I went \noff the floor, because I have had these several discussions. I had not \nfinally agreed to this. The agreement that has been entered into, I had \nnot finally agreed to that because I wanted some definite \nunderstandings about Treasury-Postal Service and energy and water \nbefore I agreed.\n  Mr. LOTT. If Senator Byrd will allow me to comment on that, this does \nget us started back on the appropriations bills, with energy and water. \nIt will be my intent, as soon as that is completed, to try to move to \nanother appropriations bill. I will have to consult with the chairman \nand the ranking member. We still have Treasury-Postal Service, \nCommerce-State-Justice, Housing and Urban Development, VA, and DC. I \nwant to do them all as soon as we can so they can move on to \nconference. That is four bills we need to get done as soon as we can.\n  I will continue to try to move those, but it takes consent, or I have \nto file a cloture motion, which doesn't expedite the proceedings. But \nwe will continue to work with Senator Byrd, Senator Stevens, and \nSenator Daschle to try to move on to the other appropriations bills. It \nis pretty obvious by now that I am very committed to that.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I understand it, when we get back, we are going to \noperate daily on a double track, with PNTR on the first track and \nappropriations bills on the second track.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, daily.\n  Mr. BYRD. The two appropriations bills we are specifically talking \nabout at the moment are energy and water and the Treasury-Postal \nService.\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Those two. From there, we are going to try to move other \nappropriations bills as quickly as we can. I hope we do that. I hope we \nwill push for that because I don't want to have the same old problems \nwe have been having with appropriations bills; namely, to get down to \nconference and, at the last minute, Senators have plane reservations to \ngo home and the administration comes in and is represented in the \nconference, and we have our backs to the walls and we end up\n\n[[Page S7768]]\n\nwith one major bill, as we did in fiscal year 1999, with eight \nappropriations bills and one tax bill, a $9.2 billion tax bill--all on \nan unamendable conference report, and we don't know what it is all \nabout, it has 3,980 pages in it, and we can't amend it.\n  That is a poor way to legislate. If the people of these United States \nknew what was going on here in that kind of a situation, they would run \nus all out, or they ought to. I just don't want to have that occur \nagain.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if Senator Byrd will give me the \nopportunity, I associate myself wholeheartedly with his remarks, and I \nwould like my name to be followed right after his remarks on that \nsubject. I agree with him. I have been through those experiences. They \ndon't do the institutions any good. I think they do the people a \ndisservice. I hope we can avoid that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If I may regain the floor, that is the whole idea behind \nthe sequencing arrangement we are working on today. I think we have \nmade some real progress in ensuring that we are going to take this up \nin an orderly way.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I will just add in the last moment here that we are \nalmost at the complete mercy of the executive branch in situations such \nas that. The executive branch comes in and they want a bill or two \nadded in the conference report, and I think we ought to avoid that. \nThat is what I am trying to discourage here. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. President, I will withdraw my earlier unanimous consent request. \nIn order to accommodate a Senator, and perhaps others, who are desirous \nof attending a funeral, we will move the comments to after this vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the speaking order after the vote be as \nfollows under the same time constraints: Senator Helms for 40 minutes, \nSenator Bryan for 40 minutes, Senator Bob Smith for 40 minutes, Senator \nDorgan for 40 minutes, Senator Roth for 5 minutes, Senator Moynihan for \n5 minutes, Senator Hollings for 5 minutes, Senator Baucus for 5 \nminutes, and Senator Wellstone for 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, I am curious. Before, I \nwas going to speak earlier in the line up. Now it is close to last. \nWhat happened?\n  Mr. LOTT. The other speeches by Senator Helms, Bryan, Smith, and \nDorgan were speeches that had already been ordered immediately after \nthe vote. So what we are doing is we are adding those who want to speak \nwith relation to China PNTR to that list.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. In an earlier request, I thought I heard my name at the \ntop of the list.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under the earlier request, you did.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am asking what happened between then and now.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me modify my request to put Senator \nBaucus in the order after Senator Dorgan, to be followed by Senators \nRoth, Moynihan, and Hollings.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Murkowski, Wayne Allard, Kay Bailey \n           Hutchison, Don Nickles, Bill Roth, Michael Crapo, Slade \n           Gorton, and Craig Thomas.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will vote against the cloture motion to \nproceed to the China Permanent Normal Trade Relations bill.\n  The very nature of the discussions that have been taking place on the \nChina PNTR issue demonstrates the complexity of trade, national \nsecurity, democratic and economic issues that this nation faces in \nconsidering U.S.-China relations. One of my greatest concerns about the \npassage of PNTR for China is the very intensive scurrying to neatly \npackage this deal as a ``win'' for America.\n  I will concede that, on one hand, supporters of the PNTR legislation \ncan make legitimate claims that China has, indeed, stated that it is \nwilling to cut its tariffs, to allow greater foreign investment, and to \nabide by a set of internationally approved trade rules. Certainly, the \npeople of the United States of America embrace the hope that China and \nthe Chinese people can enjoy a beneficial exchange of commerce. But, I \nam a devout believer in the principle of fair trade--I repeat fair \ntrade--rather than the so-called free trade, and I must note that \nChina's track record in adhering to agreements is much less than \nperfect.\n  I have little doubt that the vote today paves the way to rush to \napprove the PNTR measure without the deliberate, thoughtful \nconsideration that this Congress should always provide. It has been \nyears since this body gave U.S. trade policy the kind of consideration \nthat we ought and that it certainly deserves. The Congress must not \ncontinue to neglect its duty to provide meaningful debate on U.S. trade \npolicy that could plant the seeds of lasting, mutually beneficial trade \nrelations with China.\n  But, I will save my concerns about the China PNTR issue for the \nactual debate. The debate today is simply on the motion to proceed. \nNevertheless, all Senators should be put on notice that this vote is \nabout allowing the Senate to begin a hasty consideration of one of the \nmost economically important relationships of our time, which also has \nhuge national security implications. U.S.-China relations deserve \nbetter consideration from the body charged by the Constitution, as \noutlined in Article I, Section 8, with regulating commerce with foreign \nnations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to Senate \nconsideration of Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China based on \nthe bilateral trade agreement negotiated between our two nations this \npast November. Much is at stake in this vote.\n  In the bilateral agreement signed this past November China made \nsignificant market-opening concessions to the United States across \nvirtually every economic sector. For example:\n  On U.S. priority agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an \naverage of 31 percent to 14 percent by January 2004 and industrial \ntariffs on U.S. products will fall from an average of 24.6 percent in \n1997 to an average of 9.4 percent by 2005.\n  China will open up distribution services, such as repair and \nmaintenance, warehousing, trucking, and air courier services.\n  Import tariffs on autos, now averaging 80-100 percent, will be phased \ndown to an average of 25 percent by 2006, with tariff reductions \naccelerated.\n  China will participate in the Information Technology Agreement and \nwill eliminate tariffs on products such as computers, semiconductors, \nand related products by 2005.\n  China will open its telecommunications sector, including access to \nChina's growing Internet services, and expand investment and other \nactivities for financial services firms.\n  The agreement also preserves safeguards against dumping and other \nunfair trade practices. Specifically, the ``special safeguard rule'' \n(to prevent import surges into the U.S.) will remain in force for 12 \nyears and the ``special anti-dumping methodology'' will remain in \neffect for 15 years.\n  America benefits by having China follow the rules and norms of the \nglobal marketplace.\n  By some estimates, China is already the world's seventh largest \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S7769]]\n\n China's total worldwide trade grew from $21 billion in 1978 to over \n$324 billion in 1998. Trade makes up 33 percent of China's Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP), estimated at roughly one trillion dollars in \n1998.\n  China is already America's fourth largest trading partner. U.S.-China \ntwo-way trade, less than $1 billion in 1978, was roughly $85 billion in \n1998.\n  I would also like to take a few minutes to discuss why China's \naccession to the WTO is so important to California.\n  California is the nation's number one exporting State, and well over \none-fourth of California's trillion dollar economy now depends on \ninternational trade and investment. For California workers and \ncompanies, this means jobs and improved export opportunities across a \nbroad range of manufacturing, agricultural, and service industries.\n  For California, the growth of trade relations with China over the \npast two decades has been dramatic.\n  In 1998, China and Hong Kong together were California's fourth \nlargest export destination, with exports topping $6.1 billion.\n  In 1998, while California's total exports declined 4.17 percent, due \nto the Asian financial crisis, our exports to China (not including Hong \nKong) increased 9.28 percent.\n  One third of the total U.S. exports to China come from California; \nall told over 100,000 California jobs have been generated thus far by \ntrade with China.\n  California's top exports to China look a lot like a list of new and \nemerging technologies fueling California's current economic boom: \nElectronic and electrical equipment; industrial equipment and \ncomputers; transportation equipment; and instruments.\n  And China is also an important market for the traditional mainstays \nof the California economy: China and Hong Kong in 1998 received 4.9 \npercent of California's food exports and 6.4 percent of our crop \nexports.\n  No matter how you look at it, this benefits the United States.\n  Unfortunately, many people have confused this PNTR vote with a vote \nto approve China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO). It needs \nto be understood, however, that China will likely join the WTO within \nthe next year regardless. That issue will be decided by the WTO's \nworking group and a two-thirds vote of the WTO membership as a whole.\n  Under WTO rules, only the countries that have ``non-discriminatory'' \ntrade practices (PNTR) are entitled to receive the benefits of WTO \nagreements. Without granting China permanent normal trading status, the \nUnited States would be effectively shut out of China's vast markets, \nwhile Britain, Japan, France and all the other WTO-member nations would \nbe allowed to trade with few barriers.\n  If we do not grant China PNTR based on the November bilateral \nagreement--an agreement in which the U.S. received many important trade \nconcessions and gave up nothing--we effectively shoot ourselves in the \nfoot.\n  Let us also be clear about the ultimate issue at stake here today: \nThe People's Republic of China is today undergoing its most significant \nperiod of economic and social activity since its founding over 50 years \nago. The pace is fast; the changes large. In a relatively short time, \nChina has become a key Pacific Rim player and major world trader. It is \nnow a huge producer and consumer of goods and services, and a magnet \nfor investment and commerce.\n  Because of its size and potential, the choices China makes over the \nnext few years will greatly influence the future of peace and \nprosperity in Asia. But, in a very real sense, the shaping of Asia's \nfuture also begins with choices America will make in deciding how to \ndeal with China.\n  We can try to engage China and integrate it into the global \ncommunity. We can be a catalyst for positive change, as our management \nstyles, business techniques and the philosophies that underlie them \ntake root in Chinese society.\n  We can work for change in China, as the benefits of trade and rising \nliving standards bring about the goals we seek, or we can deal \nantagonistically with China and lose our leverage in guiding China \nalong paths of positive economic and social development. And we can \nsacrifice business advantage to competitor nations.\n  History clearly shows us a nation's respect for political pluralism, \nhuman rights, labor rights, and environmental protection grows in \ndirect proportion to that nation's positive interaction with others and \nas that nations achieves a level of sustainable economic development \nand social well-being. This was true in Taiwan; it was true in South \nKorea. Not too long ago, both were governed by dictatorships. Given a \nchance, it will also be true in China.\n  As I see it, America will face no challenge more important than this \nin the foreseeable future. I am convinced we will debate no issue more \nimportant than the question of China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization (WTO) and whether or not we will deal with the Chinese on \nthe basis of a permanent normal trading relationship--PNTR--and I \nintend to speak to this issue at greater length when the Senate returns \nto work this September.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to the consideration of H.R. 4444, an act to \nauthorize extension of nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade \nrelations treatment) to the People's Republic of China, and to \nestablish a framework for relations between the United States and the \nPeople's Republic of China, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Frist) \nand the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 86, nays 12, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 231 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--86\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Burns\n     Chafee, L.\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Fitzgerald\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Torricelli\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--12\n\n     Bunning\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Inhofe\n     Mikulski\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Thurmond\n     Wellstone\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Domenici\n     Frist\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). On this vote the yeas are 86, the \nnays are 12. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having \nvoted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is recognized for up to 40 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to yield 5 minutes of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware and 1 or 2 minutes, whatever he needs, to the distinguished \nSenator from New York, without losing my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for starting the \nprocess of consideration of this historic legislation and I look \nforward to the debate in September. At that point, I intend to outline \nprecisely how normalizing our trade relations with China is the single \nmost significant step we can take in promoting the broad range of \ninterests,\n\n[[Page S7770]]\n\nfrom national security to human rights, that the United States has in \nits relationship with China and Asia as a whole. For today, however, I \ndo not intend debate abstractions. Instead, I am going to start where I \nalways do when I am considering legislation. And, that is the simple \nquestion of whether normalizing trade with China is good for my \nconstituents back home in Delaware. Delaware's exports to China in many \nproduct categories nearly doubled between 1993 and 1998. Delaware's \ntrade with China now exceeds $70 million. The agreement reached with \nChina as part of its accession to the WTO would mean dramatically lower \ntariffs on products critical to Delaware's economy.\n  The economy of southern Delaware, for example, depends on poultry. \nChina is already the second leading market for American poultry \nproducts worldwide. Poultry producers in Delaware and elsewhere have \nbuilt that market in the face of both quotas and high tariffs. Under \nthe agreement with China, those quotas will now be eliminated and the \ntariffs will be cut in half, from 20 to 10 percent. In Delaware, \nchemicals and pharmaceuticals make up a significant share of my State's \nmanufacturing base. In the chemical sector, China has agreed to \neliminate quotas on chemical products by 2002 and will cut its tariffs \non American chemical exports by more than one-half. Furthermore, there \nis not a day that I come to work that I do not remember that Delaware \nis also home to two automobile manufacturing plants, one Chrysler and \none General Motors. In fact, I am told that Delaware has more auto \nworkers per capita than any other State, including Michigan. As many of \nthe auto workers in my State remember, I led the fight to ensure \nChrysler's survival. And I remain one of the strongest supporters of \nthe Chrysler and General Motors communities in Delaware.\n  Under the agreement with China, China has agreed to cut tariffs on \nautomobiles by up to 70 percent and on auto parts by more than one-\nhalf. The agreement also ensures the ability of our automobile \ncompanies to sell direct to consumers, rather than through some state-\nowned marketing office, and the ability to finance those sales directly \nas they do here in the United States. I want to give each of you a \nwebsite address where you can see the powerful positive effect this \nagreement will have on your state and on your constituents as well. You \ncan find it at  www.chinapntr.gov.\n\n  Beyond that, I want to emphasize two final points. The first thing I \nwant every member of the Senate to understand is that China is going to \nbecome a member of the World Trade Organization whether we pass this \nbill or not. What this vote is about is whether American farmers, \nAmerican businesses, and American workers--real working men and women \nback home in each of our states--will receive the benefits of an \nagreement that three Presidents from both parties have pursued with \nincredible dedication for 13 years. Or, will we reject this bill and \nsee those benefits go instead to our European and Japanese competitors? \nUnder the bilateral agreement reached this past November, China has \nagreed to open its markets farther than many of our other WTO trading \npartners even in the developed world. Indeed, to a remarkable extent, \nChina seems willing to go farther faster on agricultural subsidies and \nservices than even Japan and some of our European trading partners. \nAnd, the United States is likely to be the primary beneficiary of \nChina's historic agreement to open its markets. Voting no on this \nmotion means that American farmers, its manufacturers and its workers \nwill suffer the consequences and face a dimmer economic future as a \nresult.\n  The second point I want to make in closing has to do with the bill \nthat came to us from the House. We have reviewed the bill in the \nFinance Committee and I want to emphasize my unequivocal support for \nthe House bill. It preserves precisely what the Finance Committee hoped \nto do--which is ensure that American farmers, manufacturers, and \nservice providers would gain access to the Chinese market under the \nterms negotiated this past November. Beyond that, the House bill \nstrikes a reasonable balance in terms of Congress' ongoing scrutiny of \nChina's record on human rights and labor standards. Indeed, in my view, \nthe commission created by the House bill for those purposes offers more \nto our advocacy of human rights in China than any vote under the \nJackson-Vanik amendment ever did or ever would. What that means is \nthat, because benefits of normalizing our trade relations with China, \nand because there is now so little time left before the 106th Congress \nadjourns, I will intend to oppose all amendments to the bill. Thirteen \nmembers of the Finance Committee have joined me in that pledge and I \nknow many others that have expressed the same view to the majority and \nminority leaders. With that, let me close by simply urging my \ncolleagues to support the motion to proceed, and final passage when we \nreturn in September. Let's engage in the serious debate the bill \ndeserves and let's take action as soon as possible to secure the \nbenefits of the agreement for our farmers, manufacturers, and workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. This measure has now had its first test. It has \npassed overwhelmingly, 86-12.\n  We have trouble getting such votes on the Fourth of July \ncelebrations.\n  Here is some sense of how epic this vote will be. At the Finance \nCommittee's final hearing on China, on April 6, the former Chief \nNegotiator for Japan and Canada at the Office of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative closed his testimony thus: ``this vote is one of an \nhistoric handful of Congressional votes since the end of World War II. \nNothing that Members of Congress do this year or any other year could \nbe more important.''\n  We are asking, pleading to leave this bill untouched. We want it to \ngo out of this Chamber directly to the President at the White House \nwhere it will be signed. We do not want a conference. We do not want \nanother vote on the House floor.\n  The majority leader promised that the Senate would begin its \nconsideration of H.R. 4444, the legislation authorizing the extension \nof permanent normal trade relations, PNTR, to China before the August \nrecess. He has kept his word. We owe great thanks as well to our \nesteemed minority leader, Senator Daschle, who has been tireless on \nthis matter, and to our great Chairman, Senator Roth, whose efforts \nhave brought us to this day. Today's vote puts us on course to take up \nand pass this important legislation early in September.\n  I have no doubt that the measure will prevail--and by a wide margin. \nIt comes to us following the decisive vote in the House of \nRepresentatives on May 24--over two months ago now--237 ayes, 197 noes. \nAnd it comes to the floor with the unequivocal endorsement of the \nFinance Committee: on May 17, the Finance Committee reported out a \nsimple, 2-page bill--a straight-out authorization of PNTR. The vote was \nnearly unanimous, 19-1.\n  The House saw fit to add a few more provisions, which the Finance \nCommittee studied in Executive Session on Wednesday, June 7. Our \nconclusion was that there is nothing objectionable in it.\n  The House added the package offered by Representatives Levin and \nBereuter. It includes an import surge mechanism to implement one of the \nprovisions of the November 1999 U.S.-China agreement, fully consistent \nwith existing law. It creates a human rights commission loosely modeled \nafter the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the \nHelsinki Commission. And it authorizes appropriations to address \nChina's compliance with its WTO commitments.\n  Nothing major. Nothing troubling. It was the nearly unanimous view of \nthe Finance Committee that we ought simply to take up the House bill \nand pass it. And the sooner the better.\n  I will make two observations. First, with its accession to the WTO, \nChina merely resumes the role that it played more than half a century \nago. China was one of the 44 participants in the Bretton Woods \nConference, July 1-22, 1944, and its representatives were seated on the \nexecutive boards of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund \nwhen those two organizations came into being in 1946.\n  That same year, China was appointed to the Preparatory Committee of \nthe\n\n[[Page S7771]]\n\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Employment, which was charged \nwith drafting both the Charter for the International Trade Organization \n(ITO) and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China was one of \nthe original 23 Contracting Parties of the GATT, which entered into \nforce for China on May 22, 1948.\n  Following the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the \nRepublic of China (Taiwan) notified the GATT on March 8, 1950 that it \nwas terminating ``China's'' membership. Thirty-six years later, in \n1986, China officially sought to rejoin the GATT, now the WTO. After 14 \nyears of negotiations, it is now time.\n  My second broad observation is that the economic case for PNTR is \nunassailable. Ambassador Barshefsky negotiated an outstanding market \naccess agreement: that much is not in dispute. It is a one-sided \nagreement: it was China, and not the United States, that had to make \nsignificant and wide-ranging market access commitments.\n  Once China becomes a member of the World Trade Organization--and \nChina will become a WTO member with or without the support of the \nUnited States Congress--the concessions that China has agreed to in \nnegotiations with the United States and other countries will be \nextended to all countries that enter into full WTO relations with \nChina. This is simply a consequence of the operation of the ``normal \ntrade relations'' principle--the old ``most-favored-nation'' principle, \nto use the 17th century term.\n  But until the United States grants China permanent normal trade \nrelations, we will not be guaranteed the benefits that our own \nnegotiators secured. This is because the process of annual renewal and \nreview of China's trade status, conditioned as it is on freedom-of-\nemigration goals, violates the core principles of the WTO's General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, the General Agreement on Trade in \nServices and the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual \nProperty Rights--all of which require unconditional normal trade \nrelations.\n  A vote in support of PNTR for China is not an endorsement of China's \nrecord on human rights. To be sure, there is much to be done. But the \nannual NTR review process has simply not provided us much leverage on \nhuman rights because the sanction is too extreme--the reimposition of \nthe Smoot-Hawley tariff rates, that would choke off our trade with \nChina-- and has never been imposed.\n  The United States has extended our ``normal''--i.e. ``normal trade \nrelations'' or NTR--tariff rates to China each year for the past 20 \nyears. Since 1980. Without a break. This legislation simply recognizes \nthat this long-standing policy will continue.\n  We will have a good debate when we return in September. And then I \npredict that the Senate will pass H.R. 4444 by an overwhelming margin, \nas we ought to do.\n  I again thank our dear friend from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to make my comments from my desk seated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I know some of the \nleaders in the business community around the country--particularly \nthose who went to Shanghai last October to clink champagne glasses with \nChina's dictators and help them celebrate the 50th anniversary of \nChinese communism--these business leaders are eager for the Senate to \ndeliver to them their year 2000 Holy Grail. It is called permanent \nnormal trade relations with China, and I imagine there is a little bit \nof champagne flowing after this vote in the Senate. I say to them, just \nwait a little bit; maybe the American people will speak up a little \nmore loudly than they have thus far.\n  These business leaders would have liked the Senate to take up this \nlegislation right now and have a perfunctory debate with no amendments \nand just get it over with. They are convinced they are absolutely \nright, and I am convinced they are not necessarily right. Some of us, \nin any case, have some news for them: It is not going to happen.\n  I, for one, have just begun to discuss this issue, and there are \nother Senators who believe just as I do, that the legislation warrants \na lengthy and thorough debate about Communist China.\n  We are not going to just debate and make a bunch of speeches before \nrubber stamping PNTR. We are going to have some votes. I have been \nworking with several Senators on a series of amendments designed to \nensure that before the Senate holds its final vote on PNTR, we will \nhave voted on a gamut of issues that confront U.S.-China relations.\n  This is not just a China trade vote, as someone has attempted to cast \nit. Voting on whether or not to extend permanent normal trade relations \nto China will send a powerful message to Beijing and the world as to \nhow the United States views the behavior of the Chinese regime. That is \nwhy we must have a full debate and votes on issues such as China's \npitiful human rights record, China's brutal suppression of religious \nfreedom, China's increasingly belligerent stance toward the democratic \nChinese government on Taiwan, and China's unbroken record of violating \nagreements one after another, among other matters. You can't trust \nthem.\n  I know there are some in this Senate who argue we must not offer any \namendments to PNTR because that would send it back to the House and \nforce that other Chamber to vote again on the legislation. Well, la-di-\nda.\n  I must confess, I find that argument interesting coming from the \nDemocrat side of the aisle. Until recently, Senator after Senator on \nthe opposite side of the aisle was coming down to the floor to \nfulminate against the majority leader for his efforts to expedite \npassage of appropriations bills by restricting the number of amendments \nthat Senators can offer.\n  Now all of a sudden, when their party's President has legislation \nthat he wants to be expedited by the Senate, the leadership on the \nother side has suddenly and miraculously been transformed into \nchampions of speed and efficiency.\n  Let's hope they keep that spirit up when the Senate completes action \non the appropriations bills this fall.\n  The fact is, there is simply no argument now for opposing commonsense \namendments to PNTR. Before the House vote, supporters of PNTR were \nconcerned that amendments would somehow endanger final passage of the \nlegislation. Everyone thought the House vote would be razor thin and \nthat requiring the House to vote again now, or a little later, would \nbring final passage into question.\n\n  But, in point of fact, PNTR passed in the House by quite a \ncomfortable margin. There is simply no reason why the House could not \npass it again with certain commonsense amendments inserted on this side \nof the aisle by the Senate, and that, Mr. President, is our duty.\n  I can imagine only one reason why Senators would oppose such \ncommonsense amendments today. It is nothing but crass partisan \npolitics. There is a desire to prevent House Members from having to \nvote again on PNTR because they fear such a vote is likely to \nantagonize some of the labor union forces right before the fall \nelections. There are those who do not want to remind big labor that \neven the Democratic Party is doing the bidding of corporate America \nnow.\n  The partisan interests of either political party do not interest me \none bit. What interests me is having a full debate and making certain \nthat the Senate does not send a signal to Beijing that we are willing \nto look the other way at Communist China's belligerence toward Taiwan, \nCommunist China's proliferation to rogue states, and Communist China's \nbrutal abuses against their own people time and time again in pursuit \nof the almighty dollar.\n  I opposed the motion to proceed, but I must say I have been disturbed \nby the single-minded rush to get this vote over with. Since February, \nwe have been barraged by Chicken Little pleas to move this legislation, \nas though the world will come to an end if Congress does not pass this \nbill this year. In all likelihood, China will not enter the World Trade \nOrganization until next year at the earliest, and China can get PNTR \nonly when China joins the World Trade Organization.\n  So what is the rush? I think I know the reason for that, and it is \nthe most disturbing one to me. It was articulated by the distinguished \nminority\n\n[[Page S7772]]\n\nleader who recently admonished the Senate to expedite PNTR because the \nlonger the Senate waits, the greater the chance is that an \ninternational incident of some sort could scuttle the legislation.\n  Let's ponder that just a little bit. To what kind of incident could \nthe distinguished minority leader have been referring? Could it be he \nis concerned that China--you know that supposedly responsible reformist \npower with which we are trying to do business--might somehow cause an \ninternational incident by, say, doing business with somebody or \nlaunching an invasion of Taiwan or launching another Tiananmen Square-\nstyle crackdown in which they rode that tank over a protester, a \ncrackdown that would live in the minds of a lot of people because it \nwould be carried live by CNN on display for the entire world. They \nwould show what a despicable bunch of thugs with which we are dealing \nin this matter.\n  It speaks volumes about the depths to which we have sunk when leading \nsupporters of PNTR openly admit that they are desperate to lock in this \ntransaction before our Communist Chinese business partners do something \nso unspeakable that the American people would resent our trying to do \nbusiness with them.\n  That is why, if I have anything to do with it, we are not going to \nrush PNTR through the Senate. We are not going to rubber stamp the \nPresident's plan to reward the Chinese Communists. We are going to have \na debate. We are going to have votes. And some of us, maybe more than \n12 of us, are going to make clear to China's rulers that all Senators \ndo not and will not endorse, let alone condone, their brutality.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the next speaker was \nto be the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may go \nout of order since the Senator is not here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, there is no question, as the Senator from Delaware and \nthe Senator from New York have said--the chairman and ranking member--\nthis is highly important, but for a different reason.\n  There is no question that we are going to have trade with China. The \nobjection I have at this particular moment is with respect to the \npermanent nature of normal trade relations. I want to eliminate the \npermanence so we will have annual reviews to see exactly how our \ninvestments, our creation of jobs, our trade is coming along with \nrespect to national security.\n  Tom Donohue, down at the Chamber of Commerce, says that it is going \nto create hundreds of thousands of jobs. I am willing to bet him--and \nhe can name the odds and the amounts--that we are going to lose \nhundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  This is for an investment agreement in China, so that investments \nwill flow to China and remain undisturbed by possible U.S. retaliation, \nprotected by their joining in the WTO. And then, when we bring up \nvarious things to protect the security interests of the United \nStates,--at the WTO level, Cuba votes us out because it has an equal \nvote.\n  The important point to remember, and President Clinton acknowledged \nat the very beginning of the summer and the PNTR consideration, \nalthough he could not understand it, was what he characterized as \n``global anxiety.''\n  Let me tell him a little bit about that anxiety. Oneida Mills, in \nAndrews, SC, closed. They had 487 employees. Their average age was 47 \nyears of age. The company moved to Mexico and their 478 employees were \nout of a job. And what does Washington tell them? They say: Reeducate. \nThey almost sound like Mao Tse Tong. Reeducate, with high skills. Don't \nyou understand, in the global competition you have to have high skills.\n  Tomorrow morning we have done just that. We have 487 high-skilled \ncomputer operators. Are you going to hire the 47-year-old computer \noperator or the 21-year-old computer operator? Those 487 are ``dead-\nlined.'' They are out of a job.\n  Earlier this week I checked the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Since \nNAFTA, we have lost 39,200 textile and apparel jobs alone in the little \nState of South Carolina.\n  Anxiety--there is justified anxiety across the Nation--where we have \nlost over 400,000 textile and apparel jobs since NAFTA, with the \noutflow of the industrial strength down south and over into the Pacific \nrim.\n  They do not understand globali- zation, says the President. They do \nnot understand global competition. Global competition started back at \nthe end of World War II under the Marshall Plan in 1945. We sent over \nthe expertise, we sent over the machinery, and we sent over the money \nso they could have global competition.\n  Our southern Governors helped hasten along and expedite global \ncompetition 40 years ago. I traveled to Germany. We now have 116 German \nplants in the little State of South Carolina. So we know about global \ncompetition.\n  But what has really occurred--with the fall of the wall--is that 4 \nbillion workers have entered the workforce of the world, willing to \nwork for anything. With NAFTA and WTO, and the rise of the Internet, \nyou can transfer your technology on a computer, you can transfer your \nfinances on a satellite. With the Internet, you don't have to go to \nMexico, you don't have to go to the Pacific rim; you can operate your \nplant from a New York office. That is a wonderful operation. As a \nresult, as the Wall Street Journal said, this agreement is for \ninvestment in China and not in the United States.\n\n  There is global anxiety. There should be global anxiety. And we are \ntrying to go and develop a competitive trade policy. Every country in \nEurope, every country in the Pacific rim has controlled trade, and we, \nas children, run around still babbling ``free trade, free trade,'' \ngiving away our industrial strength.\n  We have come from that beginning, that at the end of World War II, 41 \npercent of our workforce was in manufacturing. Now it is down to 12 \npercent. And as Akio Morita, a founder of Sony, cautioned in a speech \nback in the 1980s: That a world power that loses its manufacturing \ncapacity will cease to be a world power. And that is where we are. In \nWashington, we are not discussing paying the bill. They all say, ``pay \ndown the debt,'' but the debt has gone up. I have the figures right \nhere.\n  The debt has gone up exactly $12 billion. Here it is, the public debt \nto the penny, since the beginning of the fiscal year. There is not any \nsurplus. And otherwise we need to understand the deficit and the \nbalance of trade, where we do not have anything to export.\n  We have a $350 billion deficit in the balance of trade. And little \nJapan has out manufactured the great United States of America. As we \nwaste our economic strength on spending over $175 billion a year more \nthan we take in, as we have done, since President Lyndon Johnson last \nbalanced the budget. We have drained the tub of industrial strength \nwith this naive ``free trade, free trade, free trade.''\n  No. I am a competitor. I understand the global competition. We like \nthe investments that we have. We like the global competition. But the \nUnited States has not begun to fight.\n  I would be glad to yield when I see someone come to the floor. I just \nhate to see this valuable time wasted.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I be able to continue until we see the \nnext speaker.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer because I \nthink I am going to get him to join me.\n  I have had a dynamic debate with the Senators from Washington for \nover 30-some years because they have Boeing, the outstanding export \nindustry of the United States.\n  Now, they believe in controlled trade, as I do, because they use all \nthe technology and research from our Department of Defense on the one \nhand, and they use the financing of the Export-Import Bank on the other \nhand. I believe in that Export-Import Bank, and the subsidization of \nthe Boeing sales, because we have to meet the competition of Airbus. So \nI support that. But they should not come telling me about\n\n[[Page S7773]]\n\nfree trade because we do not finance textile sales; we do not finance \nmuch textile research.\n  So we can look back to last December--a year ago--at the \ndemonstration in Seattle. There was an anarchist group that came up \nfrom Eugene, OR, but I am talking about the responsible AFL-CIO \ndemonstration there. That particular demonstration was led by the \nBoeing machinists--the premium single export industry in the United \nStates. Why? Because much of that Boeing 777 is required to be made in \nChina in order to sell in China. That is not free trade. That is \nrequiring local content provisions.\n  So as they require it there, they require it otherwise in Europe. \nThat is why we have tried, for 50 years, to set the example to have no \nsubsidies, no tariffs, no content requirements, have absolutely free \ntrade. The dynamic of the global competition is one of control for the \nsecurity interests of the nations involved.\n  I believe if I was running Japan, I would do it the same way, or if I \nwas running China. It works. In 10 years, they have gone from a $6 \nbillion-plus balance of trade with the United States to $68 billion. \nThey are cleaning our clock. With this particular PNTR, will we ever \nwake up? Our friend John F. Kennedy wrote the book ``While England \nSlept.'' I am tempted to write the book ``While America Slept.'' \nKennedy's book was how the great British empire that brought Germany to \nits knees, the conqueror, the victor was brought to its knees by the \nvanquished. That is exactly what is happening to the United States of \nAmerica. We are going the way of England.\n  They told the Brits at the end of World War II, they said: Don't \nworry, instead of a nation of brawn, you will be a nation of brains; \ninstead of producing products, you will provide services, a service \neconomy; instead of creating wealth, you will handle it and be a \nfinancial center. England has gone to hell in an economic hand basket. \nLondon is nothing more than an amusement park. Their army is not as big \nas our Marines, and they have lost their clout in world affairs. Money \ntalks.\n  So not only are we losing our middle class--as Henry Ford said, ``I \nwant to pay that worker enough to buy what he is producing,'' which \nhelped begin not only the wonderful development of a middle class in \nAmerica, the strength of our democracy--but our clout in international \nand foreign policy.\n  I thank the Chair for its indulgence. We will continue in September \nto try to get everyone's attention, so we can compete.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I think Senator Bryan is going to speak \nso I will take only 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I may take more time later on tonight, \nbut since it is not clear exactly how the schedule is going to proceed, \nlet me thank Senator Lott for his commitment to a good, thorough, \nsubstantive debate on whether or not we should or should not enter into \na review of normal trade relations with China.\n  I could speak for many hours about this, but I will have a number of \namendments. One of them will reflect the work of a very important \nreligious group, the U.S. Commission on Religious Rights and Religious \nFreedom, which we will talk about, criteria that should be met, and \nfocus on the right of people in China to practice their religion \nwithout persecution. Another will be a human rights amendment. Another \nwill deal with prison labor conditions in China. Another will deal with \nthe right of people to form unions in China. Finally, there will be a \nvery important amendment for people to organize in our own country.\n  Part of what is going on here is the concern within this sort of \nbroad international framework that quite often the message for people \nin this country is, if you organize, we are gone. We will go to China \nor another country and pay 12 cents an hour or 3 cents an hour. The \nmessage to people in these countries is, if you should dare to form a \nunion, then you don't get the investment. I want to focus on the right \nto organize and labor law reform in our own country.\n  I am an internationalist. We are in an international economy. I do \nnot want to see an embargo with China. We will trade with China. I do \nnot want to have a cold war with China. I want to see better relations. \nI think the real question is what the terms of the trade will be, who \nwill decide, who will benefit, and who will be asked to sacrifice. I \nhope this new global economy will be an economy that works, not only \nfor large multinationals but for human rights, for religious rights, \nfor the right of people to organize, for the environment, and for our \nwage earners. My amendments will be within that framework.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we consider preceding to legislation \nto grant permanent normal trade relations to China, I would like to \nalert my Colleagues to an important development. It is my understanding \nthat a frail, elderly Tibetan woman will soon see her only son, who is \nin prison in Tibet. My colleagues on the Finance Committee may remember \nmy raising my deep concern over the case of Ngawang Choephel, a former \nFulbright student at Middlebury College in Vermont who is serving an 18 \nyear sentence in Tibet on charges of espionage. As we debate entering a \nnew relationship with China, based on mutual commitments to adhere to \nan international set of principles and regulations, I was increasingly \nangered by the refusal of the Chinese government to grant Ngawang's \nmother, Sonam Dekyi, permission to visit him in prison, a right \nguaranteed her by Chinese law. I spoke out about this case during the \nFinance Committee's mark-up of this legislation.\n  I am pleased to inform my colleagues that thanks to the skillful \nintervention of the Chinese Ambassador, the Honorable Ambassador Li, \nSonam Dekyi will soon be in Tibet for a rendezvous with her son. Many \nof my colleagues have expressed their support for Sonam Dekyi's \nrequest, and I want to make sure they are aware of the Chinese \ngovernment's decision to allow this meeting. Sonam will be in Lhasa all \nnext week, and we are hoping that she will be allowed several lengthy \nvisits with her son. Because Sonam is in poor health and travel to \nTibet is very difficult for her, we are hoping that her visits will be \nof appropriate length and quality. I will be happy to share with my \ncolleagues Sonam's report of her visit upon her return to India.\n  I continue to be worried about the health of Ngawang Choephel, and I \nwill continue my efforts to obtain his release. But at this moment I \nwish to express my appreciation to the Chinese Ambassador for helping \nto make this humanitarian mission happen. I know that many Vermonters \nshare my joy at this development and my hope that this is indicative of \nfurther progress in matters of great concern to our two countries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 684, S. 2869.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2869) to protect religious liberty, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Senate in \nanticipation of its action in passing the Religious Land Use and \nInstitutionalized Persons Act of 2000. I want to express my \nappreciation specifically to the lead cosponsor of this bill, Senator \nKennedy. He and I worked together almost 10 years ago in enacting the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act. He has once again demonstrated his \ncommitment to religious liberty by his leadership and effort on this \nmeasure.\n  I also express my appreciation to Senators Thurmond and Reid. Both of \nthese Senators had strong and serious concerns about portions of this \nbill but were willing to work with us to secure passage of this \nlegislation because of their overriding commitment to religious \nfreedom.\n  Our bill deals with just two areas where religious freedom has been \nthreatened--land use regulation and persons in prisons, mental \nhospitals, nursing homes and similar institutions. Our bill will ensure \nthat if a government action substantially burdens the exercise of \nreligion in these two areas, the government must demonstrate that \nimposing the burden serves a compelling public interest and does so by \nthe least restrictive means. In addition, with respect to land use \nregulation, the bill specifically prohibits various forms of religious \ndiscrimination and exclusion.\n  It is no secret that I would have preferred a broader bill than the \none before us today. Recognizing, however, the hurdles facing passage \nof such a bill, supporters have correctly, in my view, agreed to move \nforward on this more limited, albeit critical, effort. The willingness \nof many serious and well-intentioned persons has brought us to this \nsuccessful conclusion in the Senate today and likely swift action in \nthe House of Representatives this fall.\n  I thank all persons involved in this effort. Numerous religious \ndenominations have come together with other groups in the spirit of \ncooperation to form the Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion. \nThey have joined forces and concentrated their energy on this vital \nissue--I am grateful to all of them.\n  In conclusion, I thank the staff members who devoted so much of their \ntime and who worked so hard to ensure the success of this bill. In \nparticular, I would like to thank Eric George, my former counsel, Manus \nCooney, my Chief Counsel, Sharon Prost, my Deputy Chief Counsel, and \nSam Harkness, a law clerk for the Judiciary Committee. Their collective \nwork has brought us to where we are today. Furthermore, I would like to \nexpress my gratitude to the staff of Senator Kennedy; specifically, \nMelanie Barnes and David Sutphen, who were a pleasure to work with. \nEddie Ayoob, from the office of Senator Reid, also provided valuable \nassistance. Finally, I would like to thank the dedicated professionals \nat the Department of Justice who helped in the effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following my statement and that of \nSenator Kennedy the following items be printed in the Record: A \nmanager's statement consisting of a joint statement by myself and \nSenator Kennedy; a letter received today from the administration in \nsupport of the bill; and several other letters of support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. President, I commend Chairman Canady of the House Judiciary \nCommittee. I am hopeful that the other body can promptly--even this \nevening is a possibility--pass this bill. I know Congressman Canady has \nand will continue to do everything he can do to enact this important \nlegislation.\n  Cathy Cleaver of Chairman Canady's staff has also been indispensable. \nI acknowledge her for her efforts.\n  I also thank Senators Kennedy, Reid, and Thurmond for their yeoman \nwork on this bill. This is one of the most important bills of this new \ncentury, and it is one I am so pleased to be a part of in passing.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Joint Statement of Senator Hatch and Senator Kennedy on the Religious \n           Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000\n\n\n                          summary and purpose\n\n       The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of \n     2000 (``This Act'') is a targeted bill that addresses the two \n     frequently occurring burdens on religious liberty. The bill \n     is based on three years of hearings--three hearings before \n     the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and six before the \n     House Subcommittee on the Constitution--that addressed in \n     great detail both the need for legislation and the scope of \n     Congressional power to enact such legislation.\n       The bill targets two areas: land use regulation, and \n     persons in prisons, mental hospitals, and similar state \n     institutions. Within those two target areas, the bill applies \n     only to the extent that Congress has power to regulate under \n     the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, or Section 5 of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment. Within this scope of application, the \n     bill applies the standard of the Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000bb-1 (1994): if \n     government substantially burdens the exercise of religion, it \n     must demonstrate that imposing that burden on the claimant \n     serves a compelling interest by the least restrictive means. \n     In addition, with respect to land use regulation, the bill \n     specifically prohibits various forms of religious \n     discrimination and exclusion. Finally, the bill provides \n     generally that when a claimant offers prima facie proof of a \n     violation of the Free Exercise Clause, the burden of \n     persuasion on most issues shifts to the government.\n\n\n                          need for legislation\n\n       Land Use. The right to assemble for worship is at the very \n     core of the free exercise of religion. Churches and \n     synagogues cannot function without a physical space adequate \n     to their needs and consistent with their theological \n     requirements. The right to build, buy, or rent such a space \n     is an indispensable adjunct of the core First Amendment right \n     to assemble for religious purposes.\n       The hearing record compiled massive evidence that this \n     right is frequently violated. Churches in general, and new, \n     small, or unfamiliar churches in particular, are frequently \n     discriminated against on the face of zoning codes and also in \n     the highly individualized and discretionary processes of land \n     use regulation. Zoning codes frequently exclude churches in \n     places where they permit theaters, meeting halls, and other \n     places where large groups of people assemble for secular \n     purposes. Or the codes permit churches only with \n     individualized permission from the zoning board, and zoning \n     boards use that authority in discriminatory ways.\n       Sometimes, zoning board members or neighborhood residents \n     explicitly offer race or religion as the reason to exclude a \n     proposed church, especially in cases of black churches and \n     Jewish shuls and synagogues. More often, discrimination lurks \n     behind such vague and universally applicable reasons as \n     traffic, aesthetics, or ``not consistent with the city's land \n     use plan.'' Churches have\n\n[[Page S7775]]\n\n     been excluded from residential zones because they generate \n     too much traffic, and from commercial zones because they \n     don't generate enough traffic. Churches have been denied the \n     right to meet in rented storefronts, in abandoned schools, in \n     converted funeral homes, theaters, and skating rinks--in all \n     sorts of buildings that were permitted when they generated \n     traffic for secular purposes.\n       The hearing record contains much evidence that these forms \n     of discrimination are very widespread. Some of this evidence \n     is statistical--from national surveys of cases, churches, \n     zoning codes, and public attitudes. Some of it is anecdotal, \n     with examples from all over the country. Some of it is \n     testimony by witnesses with wide experience who say that the \n     anecdotes are representative. This cumulative and mutually \n     reinforcing evidence is summarized in the report of the House \n     Committee on the Judiciary (House Rep. 106-219) at 18-24, in \n     the testimony of Prof. Douglas Laycock to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary 23-45 (Sept. 9, 1999), and in Douglas Laycock, \n     State RFRAs and Land Use Regulation, 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. \n     755, 769-83 (1999).\n       This discrimination against religious uses is a nationwide \n     problem. It does not occur in every jurisdiction with land \n     use authority, but it occurs in many such jurisdictions \n     throughout the nation. Where it occurs, it is often covert. \n     It is impossible to make separate findings about every \n     jurisdiction, or to legislate in a way that reaches only \n     those jurisdictions that are guilty.\n       Institutionalized Persons. Congress has long acted to \n     protect the civil rights of institutionalized persons. Far \n     more than any other Americans, persons residing in \n     institutions are subject to the authority of one or a few \n     local officials. Institutional residents' right to practice \n     their faith is at the mercy of those running the institution, \n     and their experience is very mixed. It is well known that \n     prisoners often file frivolous claims; it is less well known \n     that prison officials sometimes impose frivolous or arbitrary \n     rules. Whether from indifference, ignorance, bigotry, or lack \n     of resources, some institutions restrict religious liberty in \n     egregious and unnecessary ways.\n       The House Subcommittee on the Constitution heard testimony \n     to this effect from Charles Colson and Patrick Nolan of \n     Prison Fellowship, and in great detail about violations of \n     the rights of Jewish prisoners, from Isaac Jaroslawicz of the \n     Aleph Institute. The Senate Committee on the Judiciary \n     learned of examples in litigated cases: Mockaitis v. \n     Harcleroad, 104 F.3d 1522 (9th Cir. 1997), in which jail \n     authorities surreptitiously recorded the sacrament of \n     confession between a prisoner and the Roman Catholic \n     chaplain; Sasnett v. Sullivan, 197 F.3d 290 (7th Cir. \n     1999), in which a Wisconsin prison rule prevented \n     prisoners from wearing religious jewelry such as crosses, \n     on grounds that Judge Posner found discriminated against \n     Protestants ``without the ghost of a reason,'' id. at 292; \n     and McClellan v. Keen (settled in the District of Colorado \n     in 1994), in which authorities let a prisoner attend \n     Episcopal worship services but forbade him to take \n     communion. This Act can provide a remedy and a neutral \n     forum for such cases if they fall within the reach of the \n     Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause.\n       The compelling interest test is a standard that responds to \n     facts and context. What the Judiciary Committee said about \n     that standard in its report on RFRA is equally applicable to \n     This Act:\n       ``[T]he committee expects that courts will continue the \n     tradition of giving due deference to the experience and \n     expertise of prison and jail administrators in establishing \n     necessary regulations and procedures to maintain good order, \n     security and discipline, consistent with consideration of \n     costs and limited resources.\n       ``At the same time, however, inadequately formulated prison \n     regulations and policies grounded on mere speculation, \n     exaggerated fears, or post-hoc rationalizations will not \n     suffice to meet the act's requirements.'' Senate Report 103-\n     111 at 10 (1993).\n       The Prison Litigation Reform Act is working effectively to \n     control frivolous prisoner litigation across the board, \n     without barring meritorious claims equally with frivolous \n     ones. The Department of Justice reports that RFRA ``has not \n     been an unreasonable burden to the Federal prison system,'' \n     and that the federal Bureau of Prisons has experienced only \n     65 RFRA suits in six years, most of which also alleged other \n     theories and would have been filed anyway. Letter of Robert \n     Raben, Assistant Attorney General, to Senators Hatch and \n     Leahy (July 19, 2000). Other empirical studies also show that \n     religious liberty claims are a very small percentage of all \n     prisoner claims, that RFRA led to only a very slight increase \n     in the number of such claims, and that on average RFRA claims \n     were more meritorious than most prisoner claims. See Lee \n     Boothby & Nicholas P. Miller, Prisoner Claims for Religious \n     Freedom and State RFRAs, 32 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 573 (1999).\n       Constitutional Authority. The hearings also intensely \n     examined Congress's constitutional authority to enact this \n     bill in light of recent developments in Supreme Court \n     federalism doctrine. Constitutional authority to enact an \n     earlier and much broader bill is explained in the House \n     Committee Report (No. 106-219) at 14-18, 27, and in the \n     testimony of constitutional scholars to the Senate Committee \n     on the Judiciary. See Statements of Prof. Douglas Laycock 8-\n     23, 54-64 (Sept. 9, 1999); Prof. Jay Bybee (Sept. 9, 1999) \n     (doubting some aspects of the broader bill then proposed, but \n     expressing confidence that the land use provisions were \n     constitutional); Prof. Michael McConnell (June 23, 1998); See \n     also Thomas C. Berg, The Constitutional Future of Religious \n     Freedom Legislation, 20 U. Ark. Little Rock L.J. 715 (1998).\n       Spending Clause. The Spending Clause provisions are modeled \n     directly on similar provisions in other civil rights laws. \n     Congressional power to attach germane conditions to federal \n     spending has long been upheld. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. \n     203 (1987); Steward Machine Co. v. Davis, 301 U.S. 548 \n     (1937). The bill's protections are properly confined to each \n     federally assisted ``program or activity,'' which is defined \n     by incorporating a subset of the definition of the same \n     phrase in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In most \n     applications, this means the department that administers the \n     challenged land use regulation or the department that \n     administers the institution in which the claimant is housed.\n       Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause provisions require \n     proof of a ``jurisdictional element which would ensure, \n     through case-by-case inquiry, that the [burden on religious \n     exercise] in question affects interstate commerce.'' United \n     States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561 (1995). The Gun Free \n     Schools Act, struck down in Lopez, and the Violence Against \n     Women Act, struck down in United States v. Morrison, 120 \n     S.Ct. 1740 (2000), were invalid because they regulated non-\n     economic activity and required no proof of such a \n     jurisdictional element. See id. at 1750-51; Lopez, 514 U.S. \n     at 561-62. But the Court assumes that if such a \n     ``jurisdictional element'' is proved in each case, the \n     aggregate of all such effects in individual cases will be a \n     substantial effect on commerce. Camps Newfound/Owatonna, Inc. \n     v. Town of Harrison, 520 U.S. 564, 586 (1997) (``although the \n     summer camp involved in this case may have a relatively \n     insignificant impact on the commerce of the entire Nation, \n     the interstate commercial activities of nonprofit entities as \n     a class are unquestionably significant''); Lopez, 514 U.S. at \n     559-60 (1995) (explaining how small volumes of home-grown \n     wheat could, in the aggregate, substantially affect \n     commerce).\n       The jurisdictional element in this bill is that, in each \n     case, the burden on religious exercise, or removal of that \n     burden, will affect interstate commerce. This will most \n     commonly be proved by showing that the burden prevents a \n     specific economic transaction in commerce, such as a \n     construction project, purchase or rental of a building, or \n     an interstate shipment of religious goods. The aggregate \n     of all such transactions is obviously substantial, and \n     this is confirmed by data presented to the House \n     Subcommittee on the Constitution (testimony of Marc D \n     Stern (June 16, 1998).\n       Fourteenth Amendment. The land use sections of the bill \n     have a third constitutional base: they enforce the Free \n     Exercise and Free Speech Clauses as interpreted by the \n     Supreme Court. Congress may act to enforce the Constitution \n     when it has ``reason to believe that many of the laws \n     affected by the congressional enactment have a significant \n     likelihood of being unconstitutional.'' City of Boerne v. \n     Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 532 (1997). The standard is not \n     certainty, but ``reason to believe'' and ``significant \n     likelihood.'' This Act more than satisfies that standard--in \n     two independent ways.\n       First, the bill satisfies the constitutional standard \n     factually. The hearing record demonstrates a widespread \n     practice of individualized decisions to grant or refuse \n     permission to use property for religious purposes. These \n     individualized assessments readily lend themselves to \n     discrimination, and they also make it difficult to prove \n     discrimination in any individual case. But the committees in \n     each house have examined large numbers of cases, and the \n     hearing record reveals a widespread pattern of discrimination \n     against churches as compared to secular places of assembly, \n     and of discrimination against small and unfamiliar \n     denominations as compared to larger and more familiar ones. \n     This factual record is itself sufficient to support \n     prophylactic rules to simplify the enforcement of \n     constitutional standards in land use regulation of churches.\n       Both the ``General Rules'' in Sec. 2(a)(1), and the \n     specific provisions in Sec. 2(b), are proportionate and \n     congruent responses to the problems documented in this \n     factual record. The General Rule does not exempt religious \n     uses from land use regulation; rather, it requires regulators \n     to more fully justify substantial burdens on religious \n     exercise. This duty of justification under a heightened \n     standard of review is proportionate to the widespread \n     discrimination and to the even more widespread individualized \n     assessments, and it is directly responsive to the difficulty \n     of proof in individual cases.\n       Second, and without regard to the factual record, the land \n     use provisions of this bill satisfy the constitutional \n     standard legally. Each subsection closely tracks the legal \n     standards in one or more Supreme Court opinions, codifying \n     those standards for greater visibility and easier \n     enforceability.\n       The General Rules in Sec. 2(a)(1), requiring that \n     substantial burdens on religious exercise be justified by a \n     compelling interest, applies only to cases within the \n     spending power or the commerce power, or to cases where \n     government has authority to make individualized assessments \n     of the proposed uses to which the property will be put. Where \n     government makes such individualized assessments, permitting \n     some uses and excluding others, it cannot exclude religious \n     uses without compelling justification. See Church of\n\n[[Page S7776]]\n\n     the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, \n     537-38 (1993); Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, \n     884 (1990).\n       Sections 2(b)(1) and (2) prohibit various forms of \n     discrimination against or among religious land uses. These \n     sections enforce the Free Exercise Clause rule against laws \n     that burden religion and are not neutral and generally \n     applicable.\n       Section 2(b)(3), on exclusion or unreasonable limitation of \n     religious uses, enforces the Free Speech Clause as \n     interpreted in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 425 U.S. 61 \n     (1981), which held that a municipality cannot entirely \n     exclude a category of first amendment activity. Moreover, the \n     Court distinguished zoning laws that burden ``a protected \n     liberty'' from those that burden only property rights; the \n     former require far more constitutional justification. Id. at \n     68-69. Section 2(b)(3) enforces the right to assemble for \n     worship or other religious exercise under the Free Exercise \n     Clause, and the hybrid free speech and free exercise right to \n     assemble for worship or other religious exercise under Schad \n     and Smith.\n       Section 4(a) shifts the burden of persuasion in cases where \n     the claimant shows a prima facie violation of the Free \n     Exercise Clause. There are actual constitutional violations \n     in a higher percentage of the set of cases in which the \n     claimant offers such proof and government cannot rebut it; \n     there is a substantial likelihood of a constitutional \n     violation in every such case.\n       Other Constitutional Issues. The Act does not ``compel the \n     States to enact or enforce a federal regulatory program.'' \n     Printz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898, 935 (1997). It \n     preempts certain laws and practices that discriminate against \n     or substantially burden religious exercise, and it leaves all \n     other policy choices to the states. The state may eliminate \n     the discrimination or burden in any way it chooses, so long \n     as the discrimination or substantial burden is \n     actually eliminated.\n       The Act's protection for religious liberty does not violate \n     the Establishment Clause. It is triggered only by a \n     substantial burden on, a discrimination against, a total \n     exclusion of, or an unreasonable limitation on the free \n     exercise of religion. Regulatory exemptions are \n     constitutional if they lift such government imposed burdens \n     on religious exercise. Board of Education v. Grumet, 512 U.S. \n     687, 705 (1994); Corporation of the Presiding Bishop v. Amos, \n     483 U.S. 327, 335-36 (1987).\n\n\n     additional discussion on intended scope on land use provision\n\n     Not land use immunity\n       This Act does not provide religious institutions with \n     immunity from land use regulation, nor does it relieve \n     religious institutions from applying for variances, special \n     permits or exceptions, hardship approval, or other relief \n     provisions in land use regulations, where available without \n     discrimination or unfair delay.\n     Definition of religious exercise\n       The definition of ``religious exercise'' under this Act \n     includes the ``use, building, or conversion'' of real \n     property for religious exercise. However, not every activity \n     carried out by a religious entity or individual constitutes \n     ``religious exercise.'' In many cases, real property is used \n     by religious institutions for purposes that are comparable to \n     those carried out by other institutions. While recognizing \n     that these activities or facilities may be owned, sponsored \n     or operated by a religious institution, or may permit a \n     religious institution to obtain additional funds to further \n     its religious activities, this alone does not automatically \n     bring these activities or facilities within the bill's \n     definition or ``religious exercise.'' For example, a burden \n     on a commercial building, which is connected to religious \n     exercise primarily by the fact that the proceeds from the \n     building's operation would be used to support religious \n     exercise, is not a substantial burden on ``religious \n     exercise.''\n     Definition of substantial burden\n       The Act does not include a definition of the term \n     ``substantial burden'' because it is not the intent of this \n     Act to create a new standard for the definition of \n     ``substantial burden'' on religious exercise. Instead, that \n     term as used in the Act should be interpreted by reference to \n     Supreme Court jurisprudence. Nothing in this Act, including \n     the requirement in Section 5(g) that its terms be broadly \n     construed, is intended to change that principle. The term \n     ``substantial burden'' as used in this Act is not intended to \n     be given any broader interpretation than the Supreme Court's \n     articulation of the concept of substantial burden or \n     religious exercise.\n     Burden of persuasion\n       If a claimant proves a substantial burden on its religious \n     exercise, the government shall bear the burden of persuasion \n     that application of the substantial burden is in furtherance \n     of a compelling governmental interest and is the least \n     restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental \n     interest. However, the party asserting a violation of this \n     Act shall in all cases bear the burden of proof that the \n     governmental action in question constitutes a substantial \n     burden on religious exercise. In any case in which the \n     government provides prima facie evidence that it has made, or \n     has offered in writing to make, a specific accommodation to \n     relieve such a substantial burden, the claimant has the \n     burden of persuasion that the proposed accommodation is \n     either unreasonable or ineffective in relieving the \n     substantial burden.\n\n\n                           additional comment\n\n       An earlier draft of this legislation had a subsection that \n     would reversed that result in Bronx Household of Faith v. \n     Community School District, 127 F.3d 207 (2nd Cir. 1997), and \n     its progeny. Although that provision did not survive the \n     necessary consensus building that has made possible this bi-\n     partisan bill, the holding in Bronx Household is indeed \n     troubling in light of the Supreme Court's counsel in Widmar \n     v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269 n.6, 271 n.9, 272 n.11 (1981), \n     to not set parameters to public forum that require \n     differentiating between religious worship and all other forms \n     of religious speech. We trust that the federal judiciary will \n     revisit this issue at an early opportunity.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 19, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to express the Department \n     of Justice's strong support for S. 2869, the ``Religious Land \n     Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000.'' The \n     Department of Justice has consistently supported legislative \n     efforts, such as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act \n     (``RFRA''), that are designed to protect religious liberty. \n     The Department is proud to have been able to work closely \n     with staff from the House and Senate Judiciary Committees to \n     refine this important legislation. With this letter, we hope \n     to address certain questions that have been raised about the \n     bill.\n       We understand that some Members may be concerned about the \n     constitutionality of S. 2869, particularly in light of the \n     Supreme Court's evolving federalism doctrines. Because of the \n     importance of these issues, we have worked diligently with \n     Senate and House staff, as well as with representatives of a \n     wide array of private groups interested in the legislation, \n     to craft a constitutional bill. In our view, S. 2869 is \n     constitutional under governing Supreme Court precedents.\n       In addition, apparently there has been some question about \n     the potential effect of S. 2869 on State and local civil \n     rights laws, such as fair housing laws. Although prior \n     legislative proposals implicated civil rights laws in a way \n     that concerned the Department, we believe S. 2869 cannot and \n     should not be construed to require exemptions from such laws.\n       Finally, we are aware that some Members may be concerned \n     about the effect of S. 2869 on the operations of State \n     prisons. While section 3 of S. 2869 would apply to State \n     prisons, we do not believe it would have an unreasonable \n     impact on prison operations. RFRA has been in effect in the \n     Federal prison system for six years and compliance with that \n     statute has not been an unreasonable burden to the Federal \n     prison system. Since enactment of RFRA in 1994, Federal \n     inmates have filed approximately 65 RFRA lawsuits in Federal \n     court naming the Bureau of Prisons (or its employees) as \n     defendants. Most of these suits have been dismissed on \n     motions by the defendants. Very few, if any, have gone to \n     trial. With respect to RFRA, Congress emphasized that courts \n     should ``continue the tradition of giving due deference to \n     the experience and expertise of prison and jail \n     administrators in establishing necessary regulations and \n     procedures to maintain good order, security and discipline, \n     consistent with consideration of costs and limited \n     resources.'' S. Rep. No. 111, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 10 \n     (1993); see also H.R. Rep. No. 88, 103d Cong., 1st Sess. 8 \n     (1993). We presume the same would be true under section 3 of \n     S. 2869. Moreover, in our experience, RFRA claims almost \n     invariably are joined with other claims, such that the case \n     would have to be litigated even in the absence of the RFRA \n     requirement. In sum, RFRA has not created a substantially \n     increased litigation burden on the Federal Bureau of Prisons, \n     nor has it resulted in any adverse court rulings that have \n     significantly burdened the operation of Federal prisons. \n     Based on our experience at the Federal level, it seems \n     unlikely that section 3 of S. 2869 would impose significant \n     or unjustified burdens on the administration of State \n     prisons.\n       We note that the proposal contemplates both private and \n     Federal government enforcement. As is generally the case, we \n     urge that increased Federal enforcement responsibilities be \n     accompanied by appropriate resource increases.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please \n     do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that from the perspective of the Administration's program, \n     there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Robert Raben,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Coalition for the\n\n\n                                    Free Exercise of Religion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2000.\n       Dear Representative: We urge you to co-sponsor the \n     ``Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of \n     2000'' (RLUIPA) (H.R. 4862). This legislation will protect \n     important aspects of a right that is foundational in our \n     country--the right to worship free from unnecessary \n     governmental interference. It will provide critical \n     protection for houses of worship and other religious \n     assemblies from restrictive land use regulation that all too \n     often thwarts the practice of faith in our nation. The \n     legislation also will ensure that institutionalized\n\n[[Page S7777]]\n\n     persons will have the ability to exercise their religion in \n     ways that do not undermine the security, discipline and order \n     of their institutions.\n       In a series of Congressional hearings beginning in 1997, \n     evidence was presented which indicated that the \n     discretionary, individualized determinations made as a part \n     of local land use regulation result in a pattern of \n     burdensome and discriminatory actions on the activities of \n     houses of worship and other religious assemblies. A study \n     produced by law professors at Brigham Young University and \n     attorneys from the law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt has \n     shown, for example, that small religious groups and \n     nondenominational churches are greatly overrepresented in \n     reported church zoning cases. Other testimony has documented \n     the fact that some land use regulations intentionally exclude \n     all new houses of worship from an entire city, while others \n     exclude churches except if they are able to secure a special \n     use permit, meaning that zoning authorities hold almost \n     complete discretion in making these determinations. Some \n     testimony presented explicit evidence of religious and racial \n     bias associated with such land use determinations. In a \n     significant number of communities, land use regulation makes \n     it difficult or impossible to build, buy or rent space for a \n     new house of worship, whether large or small.\n       Testimony from across the nation also has demonstrated that \n     nonreligious assemblies are often treated far better by \n     zoning authorities than religious assemblies. For example, \n     recreation centers, health clubs, backyard barbecues and \n     banquet halls are frequently the subjects of more favorable \n     treatment than a home Bible study, a church's homeless \n     feeding program or a small gathering of individuals for \n     prayer.\n       After close scrutiny of this nationwide problem, members of \n     Congress have properly chosen to address it through Congress' \n     power under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment as well as \n     through the spending and interstate commerce powers, \n     consistent with recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions. RLUIPA \n     generally provides that the government shall not implement \n     land use regulation in ways that substantially burden \n     religious exercise unless such a burden is justified by a \n     compelling governmental interest that is being implemented in \n     a manner that is least restrictive of religious exercise.\n       It is important to note that RLUIPA does not provide a \n     religious assembly with immunity from zoning regulation. If \n     the religious claimant cannot demonstrate that the regulation \n     places a substantial burden on sincere religious exercise, \n     then the claim fails without further consideration. If the \n     claimant is successful in demonstrating a substantial burden, \n     the government will still prevail if it can show that the \n     burden is the unavoidable result of its pursuit of a \n     compelling governmental objection. RLUIPA also ensures that \n     the government may not treat religious assemblies and \n     institutions on less than equal terms with a nonreligious \n     assembly, discriminate against any institution on the basis \n     of religion, totally exclude religious assemblies from a \n     jurisdiction or unreasonably limit such uses within a \n     jurisdiction.\n       RLUIPA also provides a remedy for institutionalized persons \n     who are inappropriately denied the right to practice their \n     faith, including those in state residential facilities (such \n     as homes for the disabled and chronically ill) and \n     correctional facilities. Congressional testimony included \n     descriptions of instances in which a Catholic priest was \n     forced to do battle over bringing a small amount of \n     sacramental wine into prisons, and cases in which prison \n     officials not only refused to purchase matzo (the unleaved \n     bread Jews are required to eat on Passover), but refused to \n     accept even donated matzo from a Jewish organization.\n       RLUIPA used Congress' powers to spend and regulate \n     interstate commerce to address such problems. RLUIPA states \n     that the government may not impose a substantial burden on \n     the religious exercise of an institutionalized person unless \n     that burden is justified by a compelling interest that is \n     furthered by the least restrictive means. It is clear that \n     this standard is applied in a special way in prisons. This \n     provision does not require prison officials to grant \n     religious requests that would undermine prison discipline, \n     order and security. The standard set forth in RLUIPA has been \n     employed by the Federal Bureau of Prisons for many years \n     without negative impact on prison discipline, order and \n     security. Moreover, RLUIPA states on its face that it does \n     not amend or repeal the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \n     Thus, the courts will continue to be able to reject frivolous \n     lawsuits with ease. We urge you, therefore, to support the \n     legislation as introduced by Representatives Canady, Nadler \n     and Edwards and to reject an amendment thereto.\n       RLUIPA is supported by groups as different as the American \n     Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Legal Society, \n     Americans United for Separation of Church and State and \n     Family Research Council, People For the American Way and the \n     National Association for Evangelicals. These groups disagree \n     on many issues, but they agree that the fundamental right of \n     individuals and institutions to the free exercise of religion \n     should be protected as RLUIPA does. While RLUIPA is not \n     coextensive with all the free exercise issues about which the \n     we care, it does address two critical areas that are \n     continuing sources of free exercise problems in the wake of \n     the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Employment Division v. \n     Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). Thus, we urge you to co-sponsor \n     this critical piece of legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Melissa Rogers,\n\n                                                  General Counsel,\n     Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              On Civil Rights,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2000.\n     Senator Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: The Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR) is a coalition of over 180 \n     national organizations working to advance civil and human \n     rights laws and policies. The LCCR writes to express our \n     support for the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \n     Persons Act sponsored by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) and \n     Edward Kennedy (D-MA). We urge the Senate to pass this \n     important legislation without amendment.\n       In our letter to you of March 17, 2000, we expressed our \n     concern that the Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA) \n     could have unintended, yet potentially harmful effects on \n     other civil rights laws. The Religious Land Use and \n     Institutionalized Persons Act is a less sweeping version of \n     RLPA. Based on our careful review of the new legislation, we \n     do not believe that the Hatch-Kennedy bill will have adverse \n     consequences for other civil rights laws.\n       We greatly appreciate the work of the bill's sponsors in \n     drafting the consensus legislation that will provide \n     important new protections for the freedom of religious \n     exercise without the harmful consequences for civil rights \n     laws. These protections are especially important to preserve \n     the exercise of religious beliefs by adherents of minority \n     religions, who of often are in a position of having limited \n     ability to influence the political process.\n       We believe that the new legislation will ensure appropriate \n     safeguards against governmental burdens on the free exercise \n     of religious beliefs in two important areas. The legislation \n     will protect the religious exercise of persons whose beliefs \n     are burdened by zoning or landmarking laws, or by laws \n     affecting persons residing in state or locally run \n     institutions.\n       Governments have frequently applied zoning and landmarking \n     laws in ways that discriminate against, or severely limit, \n     the ability of houses of worship and individuals to use their \n     houses of worship or homes for religious exercise. The Hatch-\n     Kennedy bill will be particularly useful for those religious \n     groups whose ministries of feeding or housing low-income or \n     homeless persons have been curtailed by zoning laws.\n       The Hatch-Kennedy bill also provides an important remedy \n     for persons residing in, or confined to, state or local \n     institutions, as defined by the Civil Rights of \n     Institutionalized Persons Act. The new legislation makes \n     clear that, in governmental residential facilities such as \n     state hospitals, nursing homes, group homes, or prisons, the \n     government may not dictate whether, how, or when individuals \n     can practice their religion, unless the government has a \n     compelling interest in enforcing its regulation. The \n     legislation will help ensure that a person will not be \n     stripped of his or her ability to exercise his or her \n     religious beliefs when entering a state or local government-\n     run hospital, nursing home, group home, or prison.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our views on this \n     issue. We urge the Senate to pass the legislation without any \n     amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       Executive Director.\n     Dorothy I. Height,\n       Chairperson.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, religious freedom is a bedrock principle \nin our Nation. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act \nof 2000 reflects our commitment to protect religious freedom and our \nbelief that Congress still has the power to enact legislation to \nenhance that freedom, even after the Supreme Court's decision in 1997 \nthat struck down the broader Religious Freedom Restoration Act that 97 \nSenators joined in passing in 1993.\n  Our bill has the support of the Free Exercise Coalition, which \nrepresents over 50 diverse and respected groups, including the Family \nResearch Council, the Christian Legal Society, the American Civil \nLiberties Union, and People for the American Way. The bill also has the \nendorsement of the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights.\n  The broad support for this bill by religious groups and the civil \nrights community is the result of many months of difficult, but \nimportant negotiations. We carefully considered ways to strengthen \nreligious liberties in other ways in the wake of the Supreme Court's \ndecision. We were mindful of not undermining existing laws intended to \nprotect other important civil rights and civil liberties. It would have\n\n[[Page S7778]]\n\nbeen counterproductive if this effort to protect religious liberties \nled to confrontation and conflict between the civil rights community \nand the religious community, or to a further court decision striking \ndown the new law. We believe that our bill succeeds in avoiding these \ndifficulties by addressing two of the most obvious current threats to \nreligious liberty and by leaving open the question of what future \nCongressional actions can be taken to protect religious freedom in \nAmerica.\n  Our goal in passing this legislation is to reach a reasonable and \nconstitutionally sound balance between respecting the compelling \ninterests of government and protecting the ability of people freely to \nexercise their religion. We believe that the legislation accomplishes \nthis goal in two areas where infringement of this right has frequently \noccurred--the application of land use laws, and treatment of persons \nwho are institutionalized. In both of these areas, our bill will \nprotect rights in the Constitution--the right to worship, free from \nunnecessary government interference.\n  I commend Senator Hatch for his commitment and diligence in \ndeveloping this legislation. The consensus bill before us is in large \npart the product of his skillful leadership. Many others in the Senate \nalso deserve credit for this legislation, including Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Schumer, Senator Reid, Senator Bennett, \nSenator Hutchinson, and Senator Gordon Smith.\n  A broad array of groups also played a central role in crafting this \nlegislation. Among those deserving special recognition are the American \nCivil Liberties Union, the Baptist Joint Committee, People for the \nAmerican Way, the Union of Orthodox Congregations, the American Jewish \nCommittee, and the Christian Legal Society. Professor Douglas Laycock \nof the University of Texas School of Law had an indispensable role in \nthis process. Finally, I commend the White House and the Department of \nJustice for their guidance and expertise in developing an effective and \nconstitutionally sound bill.\n  Senator Hatch and I are including in the Record a section-by-section \nsummary of the bill along with a joint statement providing a detailed \nexplanation of the need for this important legislation. Numerous \ncommittee reports have also described numerous examples of thoughtless \nand insensitive actions by governments that interfere with religious \nfreedom, even though no valid public purpose is served by the \ngovernmental action.\n  The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 is \nan important step forward in protecting religious liberty in America. \nIt reflects the Senate's long tradition of bipartisan support for the \nConstitution and the nation's fundamental freedoms and I urge the \nSenate to approve it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2869, the \nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. Before addressing \nthe substance of this legislation, I would like to thank and \ncongratulate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, as \nwell as the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, for the \noutstanding, bipartisan efforts they have taken to produce the \nlegislation we are considering today. I am well aware of the various \ndifficulties and interests which had to be addressed, and I believe \nthey did a fine job under such circumstances.\n  Mr. President, though modified and reduced in scope in order to \nsecure its passage, S. 2869 is the most recent attempt by the Congress \nto protect the free exercise of religion. Prior to 1990, American \ncourts had generally applied a strict scrutiny test to government \nactions that imposed substantial burdens on the exercise of religion. \nAs my colleagues know, the strict scrutiny test is the highest standard \nthe courts apply to actions on the part of government. However, in \n1990, in Employment Division, Oregon Department of Human Resources, v. \nSmith, the United States Supreme Court largely eliminated the strict \nscrutiny test for free exercise cases.\n  Three years later, in direct response to the Smith decision, the \n103rd Congress enacted the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act \n(RFRA), reapplying and extending the strict scrutiny test to all \ngovernment actions, including those of state and local governments, \nthat imposed substantial burdens on religious exercise. In 1997, the \nSupreme Court ruled, in City of Boerne, Texas v. Flores, that RFRA's \ncoverage of state and local governments exceeded Congressional \nauthority.\n  In response to the City of Boerne ruling, the Religious Liberty \nProtection Act (RLPA) was introduced during the 106th Congress. RLPA \nalso reapplied a strict scrutiny standard to the actions of state and \nlocal governments with respect to religious exercise, but attempted to \ndraw its authority from Congressional powers to attach conditions to \nfederal funding programs and to regulate commerce. While the companion \nmeasure passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly in July \n1999, the legislation stalled in the Senate when legitimate concerns \nwere raised that RLPA, as drafted, would supersede certain civil \nrights, particularly in areas relating to employment and housing. These \nconcerns were most troubling to the gay and lesbian community. \nDiscrimination based upon race, national origin, and to lesser \ncertainty, gender, would have been protected, regardless of RLPA, \nbecause the courts have recognized that preventing such discrimination \nis a sufficient enough compelling government interest to overcome the \nstrict scrutiny standard that RLPA would apply to religious exercise. \nSexual orientation and disability discrimination, however, have not \nbeen afforded this high level of protection.\n  Mr. President, as I was considering the merits of the Religious \nLiberty Protection Act, these concerns weighted heavily upon my mind. I \nsay that because I was a proud supporter of the Religious Freedom \nRestoration Act, which we passed overwhelmingly during the 103rd \nCongress only to see the Supreme Court strike it down. I was, and \nremain, particularly supportive of the Land use provisions contained \nwithin RFRA, and RLPA, and which constitute the first of the two major \nsections contained within the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized \nPersons Act which we are considering today. As my colleagues may know, \nland use decisions are extremely important to many of the religious \norganizations which have joined together in the effort to get this \nlegislation passed and signed into law. With some affiliations, \nlegislation affecting land use decisions are the most important aspects \nof protecting the free exercise of religion. This is especially true \nfor the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Under current law, \nthe LDS Church maintains serious reservations about non-uniform zoning \nregulations throughout the country which, though religiously-neutral on \ntheir face, have the effect of overly-restricting the size and \nlocation, among other things, of churches and temples. Often times, \nsuch regulations simply prohibit the construction of any church or \ntemple. Under the legislation which Senators Hatch and Kennedy have \ncrafted, the strict scrutiny test contained within RLPA would apply to \nland use decisions. In other words, state and local zoning boards would \nbe required to use the least restrictive means possible to advance a \ncompelling state interest. I recognize that this is a high standard to \nmeet, certainly much higher than current law, where zoning regulations \nare rarely overturned in court on religious exercise grounds. However, \nI also believe that the free exercise of religion deserves, in fact \ndemands, such a high level of protection.\n\n  As I stated earlier, protecting hard-fought civil rights, including \nthose which prohibit discrimination based upon sexual orientation, \nplayed an important role in my desire to pursue a more narrowly-\ntailored religious freedom measure. I am proud to have had the \nopportunity to work with Senators Hatch and Kennedy to accomplish the \nworthwhile endeavor of protecting legitimate civil rights while at the \nsame time protecting the free exercise of religion involving land use \ndecisions.\n  While the first section of S. 2869 focuses upon land use, the second \nconcerns the free exercise of religion as applied to institutionalized \npersons, i.e., prisoners. As my colleagues are well aware, in 1993, \nduring the consideration of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I \noffered an amendment on the Senate floor that would have prohibited the \napplicability of RFRA to incarcerated individuals. I offered\n\n[[Page S7779]]\n\nthat amendment for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was my \nbelief, one that I continue to hold, that prisoners in this country \nhave become entirely too litigious. Frivolous lawsuits seem to be the \nnorm, not the exception to the rule. In 1993, more than 1,400 more \nlawsuits were filed by federal prisoners against the government, \nwhether it was corrections officers, prison wardens, attorneys general, \netc., than were filed by the government against criminals. That \nunbelievable situation within our federal judicial system, coupled with \nthe high costs that my home State of Nevada was incurring defending \nfrivolous prisoner lawsuits, led me to offer the amendment which would \nhave prohibited the applicability of RFRA to prisoners. Regrettably, \nthat effort failed. However, I remained a proud supporter of the \nunderlying legislation.\n  Seven years later, I am faced with a similar set of circumstances. I \nsupport the underlying legislation which protects the free exercise of \nreligion as applied to land use decisions, but I remain concerned that \nthe applicability of the strict scrutiny standard to religious exercise \nwithin our federal, state and local prisons will encourage prisoners, \nand the courts, to second guess the decisions of our corrections \nemployees and other prison officials. Furthermore, I have been \ncontacted by many corrections officers and by the American Federation \nof State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, which represents more \nthan 60,000 dedicated men and women who are on the front line in our \nnation's prisons. They have legitimate concerns about what impact this \nlegislation may have on prison security.\n  A number of corrections officers have contacted me to relay their own \npersonal experiences. These dedicated men and women have real concerns. \nIn fact, AFSCME recently alerted their corrections officer membership \nthat this legislation was coming up for a vote, and was deluged with \nphone calls from members expressing their distress about how this bill \nmight affect their ability to maintain security and protect the safety \nof the public. As you can well imagine, getting inmates to comply with \nsecurity measures in prison is no easy task. Many prisoners will use \nany excuse to avoid searches and to evade security measures instituted \nto protect prison personnel and the general public from harm.\n  While I continue to believe that we should not extend the privilege \nof a strict scrutiny standard to restrictions on the free exercise of \nreligion behind the bars of our nation's prisons, I also recognize \ncertain realities. The Prison Litigation Reform Act, PLRA, which we \npassed during the 104th Congress, has led many Senators to believe that \nmy amendment is no longer necessary. I disagree with this conclusion \ngiven that PLRA applied to RFRA from April 1996, through June 1997, and \nthere was no perceivable reduction in the number of prisoner RFRA \nlawsuits, or their corresponding burden. Furthermore, with specific \nregard to corrections employees, even when cases are screened and \ndismissed under the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, \nthose lawsuits still show up on the public record, making it much more \ndifficult for corrections employees who have been sued to obtain \nmortgages and car loans.\n  Mr. President, rather than offer an amendment to strike the \nprovisions of S. 2869 relating to Institutionalized Persons and risk \nthe certainty that this legislation would fail this year, I have \ndecided, in consultation with the managers of this legislation, to \npursue a different approach. My distinguished colleague from Utah, the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, has agreed to hold a hearing next \nyear on the impact of this legislation on our nation's penal \ninstitutions and their dedicated employees. I am hopeful that this will \nprovide the opportunity for corrections administrators and other \npersonnel to air their concerns about how this legislation may affect \nsecurity in these institutions. I would also expect several Attorneys \nGeneral, including the Nevada State Attorney General who has made \nlimiting frivolous prisoner lawsuits a priority in my home State, to \nexpress their opinions. I look forward to this debate, and I would \noffer my personal gratitude to Chairman Hatch for the commitment.\n  I also plan on joining with Senator Hatch to request that the General \nAccounting Office conduct a detailed study as to what effects the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act had on our nation's prisons, both \nbefore, during and after the application of the Prison Litigation \nReform Act, and what effects, at the appropriate time, this legislation \nwill have.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, while I retain serious reservations \nabout the inclusion of prisoners in S. 2869, I commend Senators Hatch \nand Kennedy for diligently working in a bipartisan fashion to craft a \nnarrowly-tailored religious freedom protection measure that will pass \nthis Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the assistant Democratic \nleader and the Senior Senator from Nevada, for his leadership which has \nallowed us to bring S. 2869 to the floor today. He has worked closely \nwith myself and Senator Kennedy, and I am sure he joins me in thanking \nthe Senator for his contributions to this important legislation.\n  I would also say that I recognize his commitment to reducing the \nnumber of frivolous lawsuits by prisoners, and that several of our \ncolleagues, particularly Senator Thurmond, have raised serious concerns \nrelating to the Institutionalized Persons section of the bill. I \nrespect these concerns, and, as I have already relayed to the Senator, \nI am committed to holding a hearing next year in the Judiciary \nCommittee on these matters.\n  Mr. REID. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee and I look forward to that hearing next year.\n  I also ask if it is the chairman's intention to join with me in \nrequesting that the General Accounting Office conduct a study on the \neffects that the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act has had, and \nthat the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act will have \non our nation's prisons, both at the federal and state level, including \nthe dedicated men and women who serve this country as corrections \nemployees.\n  Mr. HATCH. The Senator is correct to state that I intend to request \nsuch a study from the GAO.\n  Mr. REID. Again, I thank the distinguished chairman. I also reiterate \nmy appreciation and congratulations to him and Senator Kennedy for the \noutstanding work they have done on a bipartisan basis to bring this \nlegislation to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2869) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2869\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

JUDICIAL RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Cause of Action.--A person may assert a violation of \n     this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and \n     obtain appropriate relief against a government. Standing to \n     assert a claim or defense under this section shall be \n     governed by the general rules of standing under article III \n     of the Constitution.\n       (b) Burden of Persuasion.--If a plaintiff produces prima \n     facie evidence to support a claim alleging a violation of the \n     Free Exercise Clause or a violation of section 2, the \n     government shall bear the burden of persuasion on any element \n     of the claim, except that the plaintiff shall bear the burden \n     of persuasion on whether the law (including a regulation) or \n     government practice that is challenged by the claim \n     substantially burdens the plaintiff's exercise of religion.\n       (c) Full Faith and Credit.--Adjudication of a claim of a \n     violation of section 2 in a non-Federal forum shall not be \n     entitled to full faith and credit in a Federal court unless \n     the claimant had a full and fair adjudication of that claim \n     in the non-Federal forum.\n       (d) Attorneys' Fees.--Section 722(b) of the Revised \n     Statutes (42 U.S.C. 1988(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``the Religious Land Use and \n     Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000,'' after ``Religious \n     Freedom Restoration Act of 1993,''; and\n       (2) by striking the comma that follows a comma.\n       (e) Prisoners.--Nothing in this Act shall be construed to \n     amend or repeal the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 \n     (including provisions of law amended by that Act).\n       (f) Authority of United States To Enforce This Act.--The \n     United States may bring an action for injunctive or \n     declaratory relief to enforce compliance with this Act. \n     Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to deny, \n     impair, or otherwise affect any right or authority of the \n     Attorney General, the United States, or any agency, officer, \n     or employee of the United States, acting under any law other \n     than this subsection, to institute or intervene in any \n     proceeding.\n       (g) Limitation.--If the only jurisdictional basis for \n     applying a provision of this Act is a claim that a \n     substantial burden by a government on religious exercise \n     affects, or that removal of that substantial burden would \n     affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the several \n     States, or with Indian tribes, the provision shall not apply \n     if the government demonstrates that all substantial burdens \n     on, or the removal of all substantial burdens from, similar \n     religious exercise throughout the Nation would not lead in \n     the aggregate to a substantial effect on commerce with \n     foreign nations, among the several States, or with Indian \n     tribes.\n\n     SEC. 5. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION.\n\n       (a) Religious Belief Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to authorize any government to burden any \n     religious belief.\n       (b) Religious Exercise Not Regulated.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall create any basis for restricting or burdening religious \n     exercise or for claims against a religious organization \n     including any religiously affiliated school or university, \n     not acting under color of law.\n       (c) Claims to Funding Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act \n     shall create or preclude a right of any religious \n     organization to receive funding or other assistance from a \n     government, or of any person to receive government funding \n     for a religious activity, but this Act may require a \n     government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid \n     imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.\n       (d) Other Authority To Impose Conditions on Funding \n     Unaffected.--Nothing in this Act shall--\n       (1) authorize a government to regulate or affect, directly \n     or indirectly, the activities or policies of a person other \n     than a government as a condition of receiving funding or \n     other assistance; or\n       (2) restrict any authority that may exist under other law \n     to so regulate or affect, except as provided in this Act.\n       (e) Governmental Discretion in Alleviating Burdens on \n     Religious Exercise.--A government may avoid the preemptive \n     force of any provision of this Act by changing the policy or \n     practice that results in a substantial burden on religious \n     exercise, by retaining the policy or practice and exempting \n     the substantially burdened religious exercise, by providing \n     exemptions from the policy or practice for applications that \n     substantially burden religious exercise, or by any other \n     means that eliminates the substantial burden.\n       (f) Effect on Other Law.--With respect to a claim brought \n     under this Act, proof that a substantial burden on a person's \n     religious exercise affects, or removal of that burden would \n     affect, commerce with foreign nations, among the several \n     States, or with Indian tribes, shall not establish any \n     inference or presumption that Congress intends that any \n     religious exercise is, or is not, subject to any law other \n     than this Act.\n       (g) Broad Construction.--This Act shall be construed in \n     favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the \n     maximum extent permitted by the terms of this Act and the \n     Constitution.\n       (h) No Preemption or Repeal.--Nothing in this Act shall be \n     construed to preempt State law, or repeal Federal law, that \n     is equally as protective of religious exercise as, or more \n     protective of religious exercise than, this Act.\n       (i) Severability.--If any provision of this Act or of an \n     amendment made by this Act, or any application of such \n     provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be \n     unconstitutional, the remainder of this Act, the amendments \n     made by this Act, and the application of the provision to any \n     other person or circumstance shall not be affected.\n\n     SEC. 6. ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE UNAFFECTED.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to affect, \n     interpret, or in any way address that portion of the first \n     amendment to the Constitution prohibiting laws respecting an \n     establishment of religion (referred to in this section as the \n     ``Establishment Clause''). Granting government funding, \n     benefits, or exemptions, to the extent permissible under the \n     Establishment Clause, shall not constitute a violation of \n     this Act. In this section, the term ``granting'', used with \n     respect to government funding, benefits, or exemptions, does \n     not include the denial of government funding, benefits, or \n     exemptions.\n\n     SEC. 7.

I ask unanimous consent the reading be dispensed.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I rise today to address the serious and widespread \nproblem of international trafficking in persons, particularly women and \nchildren, for the purposes of sexual exploitation and forced labor, and \nto seek your continued support for legislation aimed at curbing this \nhorrific crime.\n  Trafficking in persons becomes more insidious and widespread \neveryday. For example, every year approximately one million women and \nchildren are forced into the sex trade against their will. A recent CIA \nanalysis of the international trafficking of women into the United \nStates reports that as many as 50,000 women and children each year are \nbrought into the United States and forced to work as prostitutes, \nforced laborers and servants. Others credibly estimate that the number \nis probably much higher.\n  Those whose lives have been disrupted by civil wars or fundamental \nchanges in political geography, such as the disintegration of the \nSoviet Union or the violence in the Balkans, have fallen prey to \ntraffickers. Seeking financial security, many innocent persons are \nlured by traffickers' false promises of a better life and lucrative \njobs abroad. However, upon arrival in destination countries, these \nvictims are often stripped of their passports and held against their \nwill, some in slave-like conditions. Rape, intimidation and violence \nare commonly employed by traffickers to control their victims and to \nprevent them from seeking help.\n  Trafficking rings are often run by criminals operating through \nnominally reputable agencies. In some cases overseas, police and \nimmigration officials of other nations participate in or benefit from \ntrafficking. In other cases, lack of awareness or complacency among \ngovernment officials, such as border patrol and consular officers, \ncontributes to the problem. Furthermore, traffickers are rarely \npunished as official policies often inhibit victims from testifying \nagainst their traffickers, making trafficking a highly profitable, low-\nrisk business venture for some.\n  In April my esteemed colleague from Kansas and I introduced separate \nbills to combat trafficking in persons. I introduced S. 2414, the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000, and he introduced S. 2449, \nthe International Trafficking Act of 2000. But, although we earlier \nintroduced these separate bills, we would like to relay to you the \ntruly bipartisan effort this has been. This effort is reflected in the \nbill we passed today.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 is a comprehensive \nbill that aims to prevent trafficking in persons, provide protection \nand assistance to those who have been trafficked, and strengthen \nprosecution and punishment of those responsible for trafficking. It is \ndesigned to help federal law enforcement officials expand anti-\ntrafficking efforts here and abroad; to expand domestic anti-\ntrafficking and victim assistance efforts; and to assist non-\ngovernmental organizations, governments and others worldwide who are \nproviding critical assistance to victims of trafficking.\n  The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 addresses the \nunderlying problems which fuel the trafficking industry by promoting \npublic anti-trafficking awareness campaigns and initiatives to enhance \neconomic opportunity, such as micro-credit lending programs and skills \ntraining, for those most susceptible to trafficking. It also increases \nprotections and services for trafficking victims by establishing \nprograms designed to assist in the safe reintegration of victims into \ntheir community, and ensure that such programs address both the \nphysical and mental health needs of trafficking victims. Further, the \nbills seek to stop the practice of immediately deporting victims back \nto potentially dangerous situations by providing them interim \nimmigration relief and the time necessary to bring charges against \nthose responsible for their condition. It also toughens current federal \ntrafficking penalties, criminalizing all forms of trafficking in \npersons and establishing punishment commensurate with the heinous \nnature of this crime.\n  This bill requires expanded reporting on trafficking, including a \nseparate list of countries which are not meeting minimum standards for \nthe elimination of trafficking. It authorizes the President to suspend \nassistance to the worst violators on the list of countries which do not \nmeet these minimum standards. This discretionary approach provides the \nflexibility needed to combat the complex, multi-faceted, and often \nmulti-jurisdictional nature of this crime, while maintaining the \nprospect of tough enforcement against governments who persistently \nignore, or whose officials are even complicit in, trafficking within \ntheir own borders. It allows Congress to monitor closely the progress \nof countries in their fight against trafficking and gives the \nAdministration flexibility to couple its diplomatic efforts to combat \ntrafficking with targeted action that can be tailored to the individual \ncountry involved.\n  Since we began working on this issue, Senator Brownback and I have \nmet with trafficking victims, after-care providers, and human rights \nadvocates from around the world who have reminded us again and again of \nthe horrible, widespread and growing nature of this human rights abuse. \nToday this Chamber has taken an important first step toward the \nelimination of trafficking in persons. We are thankful for your \nsupport.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the substitute amendment be agreed to as amended, the \nbill be read the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, the Senate then insist on its amendment, request a \nconference on the part of the Senate, and any statements relating to \nthis action be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I've come to the floor this evening to \nshare with my colleagues recent developments on the pipeline safety \nlegislation. I am frustrated that to date we've been unable to come to \nagreement on a package of amendments that would ensure this critical \nlegislation passes this year. I praise the efforts of the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator McCain, and the committee's ranking \nmember, Senator Hollings, for their steadfast resolution in dealing \nwith this issue.\n  As most of my colleagues know, I've been working for more than a year \nto improve pipeline safety standards. Millions of miles of pipelines \nrun through our communities, next to our schools and under our homes. \nAs the deadly pipeline explosion in Bellingham, WA, on June 10, 1999, \nthat killed 3 young boys, showed us, pipelines are not as safe as they \ncould be.\n  Since the Bellingham explosion, I have been working with officials at \nall levels of government, industry representatives, environmentalists, \nstate and federal regulators, and concerned citizens to identify ways \nto improve pipeline safety in our nation.\n  It has been an eye-opening experience. I've uncovered a history of \nloose regulation with insufficient safety standards, inadequately \ntrained pipeline operators, and a public that is uninformed of the \nthreat that exists.\n  To date, I have focused on the problems associated with liquid gas \npipelines. The pipe that ruptured and resulted in the tragic deaths of \nthe three young people in my state was a liquid pipeline. What most \npeople don't know is that natural gas pipelines are far more deadly and \ninjure many more people.\n  From 1986 to 1999, liquid pipeline accidents, according to the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation, resulted in 35 deaths and 235 injuries. \nIn contrast, natural gas distribution and transmission pipelines in \nthat same time period have resulted in 296 deaths and injured 1,357 \npeople. The property damage that has resulted from these incidence \ntotals nearly $1 billion.\n  Some examples of recent deadly natural gas pipelines include:\n  A 1998 natural gas explosion in St. Cloud, Minnesota that destroyed \nsix buildings, killed four people and injured 14 others:\n  A 1997 Citizens Gas natural gas pipeline in Indianapolis that \nruptured and ignited, destroying 6 homes and damaging 65 others \nproperties. One person was tragically killed. Luckily this event \noccurred mid-day while many people were at work and school, otherwise \nit is likely that more fatalities would have occurred in that family \nneighborhood; and\n  A 1994 natural gas explosion in Allentown, Pennsylvania that killed \none person and injured 66 others.\n  These are just three of many. Pipelines are dangerous, especially \nnatural gas lines. We need to reform the system and put teeth in the \nregulation to ensure that these accidents are reduced dramatically.\n  The Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 157,000 miles of \npipelines which transport hazardous liquids and more than 2.2 million \nmiles of natural gas lines throughout the country. While these \npipelines perform a vital service by bringing us the fuel we need to \nheat our homes and power our cars, they can also pose safety hazards.\n  That is why I introduced S. 2004, the Pipeline Safety Act of 2000, on \nJanuary 27, 2000. In April, the administration and Senator McCain, \nalong with myself and Senator Gorton, also introduced alternative \npipeline safety bills. All of these bills focus on expanding local \ninput in pipeline safety matters and strengthening community ``right to \nknow'' provisions, improving pipeline integrity and inspection \npractices, and increasing our research and development efforts.\n  On June 15, 2000, the Senate Commerce Committee discussed and \ndeliberated the McCain-Murray-Gorton bill. As I stated before, this \nbill incorporates most of my priorities and is a positive step toward \nimproving pipeline safety. The committee reported by bill without \ndissent.\n  Events since that time have proven less hopeful. Naturally, there \nwere concerns with the bill as reported out of committee--and again--I \nappreciate the indulgence of the chair and ranking member as we have \nsought to negotiate through these difficult issues. Working with \nSenator Gorton and the Commerce Committee, we have come very close to \ncompromise. Many issues have been resolved; there are only a few minor \nones left.\n  I fear, however, that we may be coming to an impasse in our \nnegotiations. I want my colleagues and the industry to know, I will not \nlet the interests of the few strip the many of their right to safe \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, the reforms we have called for are common sense \nmeasures. They will make our communities safer and allow everyone to \nenjoy the benefits of a modern pipeline infrastructure.\n  The reasons for delay are indefensible. I encourage my colleagues to \nconsider what the stalling on this important issue could mean to \ncommunities in their State. It means, tragically, more unnecessary \ndamage to life and property.\n  I knew this process would be difficult, but I am concerned at the \npoint where we find ourselves today. If we can't accomplish this soon, \nI want my colleagues to know, I promise I will be creative in my \napproach to achieving meaningful pipeline safety legislation this year \nand find other ways to enact these extremely important reforms.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7782-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7782-S7784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MISSOURI RIVER DAMS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this week my friend and colleague, \nSenator Bond, came to the floor to explain why he is seeking to stop \nmuch needed changes in the operation of the dams on the Missouri River \nwhich is so important to the culture and economy not only in my State \nbut so many others.\n  For the past 10 years, the Army Corps of Engineers has been working \nto update the decades-old management policies for the Missouri River. \nThat effort, conducted by scientists and professional river managers, \nis approaching fruition. This year the Fish and Wildlife Service has \ntold the Corps that changes need to take place to restore this \nmagnificent river to biological health and so that we may prevent the \nextinction of three endangered species. By doing so, we will not only \nbring environmental benefits to the river but also enhance the \nrecreational use of the river, both upstream and, I might emphasize, \ndownstream. Bringing about these needed management changes will mean \nthe environment, public relations, and health of the river will all be \nwinners.\n  But now my colleague from Missouri has inserted a rider, an anti-\nenvironmental measure, in the energy and water bill that would stop the \nCorps from changing the management of the river. I understand why my \ncolleague from Missouri has done this. He is trying to protect the \ninterests of the State. However, in the process, he would sacrifice a \nmuch larger upstream fish, wildlife, and recreation industry. I simply \ncannot let that go uncontested. Hence, we have been embroiled for now \nseveral days in a disagreement that I had hoped could be resolved.\n  Six major dams have been constructed on the Missouri River which have \nforever changed its flow and character.\n\n[[Page S7783]]\n\n  Since the last earthen dam was built in the early 1960's, we have \nwitnessed the decline of fish and wildlife along the river.\n  This has resulted largely from the management policies that were \ndeveloped in 1960 for operating the dams, and which favor the tiny $7 \nmillion downstream barge industry. These policies are established in \nwhat is known as the Missouri River Master Water Control Manual, often \ncalled the ``Master Manual.''\n  It has been four decades since the Master Manual was significantly \nupdated.\n  Therein lies the problem. The existing Master Manual, which is \ngrounded in principles relevant to conditions in the 1960's, favors the \nbarge industry, which prefers constant, level flows throughout the \nspring, summer, and fall.\n  But times and conditions have changed over 40 years. That is why the \nMaster Manual is being revised.\n  Over the years, outdated management policies have caused fish species \nto decline, as the natural high spring flows that signal fish species \nto spawn have disappeared. They have led to the endangerment of bird \nspecies that rely on exposed sandbars to nest in the summertime. The \ncorps often submerges those critical sandbars in its effort to provide \nsufficient flows for the barges.\n  That is why both the Missouri River Natural Resources Committee and \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agree that the Master Manual must be \nrevised to manage the flow of the river in a much more natural way. \nHigh spring flows, known as the ``spring rise'' need to be restored.\n  At the same time, the summer flows must be reduced to allow the \nendangered terns and plovers to nest. This is known as the ``split \nseason.''\n  In combination with the spring rise, the split season and the spring \nrise will help to restore the health of the river and recover these \nendangered species.\n  In addition to the serious environmental problems and cause by the \ncurrent Master Manual, current management policies also harm public \nrecreation. In times of drought, Missouri River reservoirs of the \nDakotas and Montana drop as low that boat ramps are left high and dry, \nand a $90 million per year recreation industry is sacrified for a $67 \nmillion per year barge industry.\n  The split season and spring rise will ensure that more water remains \nin the reservoirs in the summer, providing greater recreational \nopportunities for the public.\n  This Master Manual revision process has been underway since 1990, \nfollowing a 1989 lawsuit the corps of the State of South Dakota. Again \nthat has been a science-driver process, not a political one.\n  No one who has followed this issue will be surprised by the \nrecommendation of the Fish and Wildlife service, or can argue this is \nissue has not been studied evaluated thoroughly. Once the consultation \nbetween the corps and the Fish and Wildlife Service is completed this \nyear, the Corps will produce a revised draft environmental impact \nstatement (EIS) and provide the public with 6 months to comment on it.\n  At the end of that stage, the corps will provide a final EIS. That \ndocument will be reviewed by Corps staff in Washington, DC, a record of \ndecision will be issued, and the Master Manual will be revised.\n  That is the process set out of Federal law.\n  The question before the Senate on the Energy and Water Appropriations \nbill is whether we are going to cut off that Master manual revision \nprocess with this rider because some don't like the answers the process \nis revealing. If we do so, we will allow the river to continue its slow \ndecline that inevitably will lead to the extinction of these and \nperhaps other species.\n  Some have stated that this rider has been included in past \nappropriations bills, and therefore we should continue to include it in \nthe FY2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill.\n  But members should know that this rider was irrelevant in past years, \nbecause the corps was not close to revising the Master Manual and \nbecause the corps had not engaged in consultation with the Fish and \nWildlife Service to determine what management changes are necessary to \nprotect endangered species.\n  Since no changes to the Master Manual were planned in past years, the \neffect of the rider was at most symbolic, reflecting the opposition of \nsome along the river to changing the status quo.\n  This year, for the first time, the debate over this rider has \nmeaning.\n  This year, the corps finally has reached the point in the process \nwhere it is consulting with the Fish and Wildlife Service and is \nlearning officially that it must implement a spring rise and split \nseason to avoid driving these endangered species to extinction.\n  This year, the corps finally has a schedule to complete the process \nof revising the manual in the foreseeable future.\n  Having learned without question that certain management changes need \nto take place to restore the health of the river, Congress must decide \nwhether to override the requirements of the Endangered Species Act and \ncondemn the fish and wildlife of the river to a slow death, or to face \nthe truth and give the river new life.\n  The answer is clear. The Corps of Engineers and the Fish and Wildlife \nService should be allowed to continue to work together under the very \nFederal laws and processes that Congress has enacted, so that the corps \ncan revise this outdated Master Manual and improve the management and \nhealth of the Missouri River.\n  This is a job for the technical experts of those agencies to \ncomplete, in compliance with established procedures, and including an \nopportunity for substantial public comment and input. Congress should \nnot substitute its political judgment for this process and thereby \ncondemn this once-magnificent river to a slow death.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will allow the established process \nto move forward, let the public have its say, and take the steps that \nwe know are necessary to recover this once-impressive and biologically-\nfertile river. This anti environmental rider must be removed.\n  Mr. President, I have now been given assurances by the White House \nthat the President will veto this bill if this rider is included. Given \nthat assurance and given the importance of protecting the integrity of \nthe established process for improving the management of the Missouri \nRiver, I have agreed to allow this legislation to move forward, which \nis why we had the vote this afternoon. I will continue to work with my \nfriend, the Senator from Missouri, and I will continue to appreciate \nthe assurances I have been given by the White House that they will veto \nthis legislation were it to come to their desk with the President's \nknowledge that this legislation includes the rider. I will certainly \nwork to assure that we can sustain the veto when it comes back. That is \nessential. It is important to not only South Dakota and North Dakota, \nthe upper regions of the Missouri River, but it is important to our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated July 26, \n2000, from the Governor of South Dakota, William Janklow, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        State of South Dakota,\n\n                                        Pierre, SD, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Peter Domenici,\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     U.S. Senate, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, \n         Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Domenici and Reid: It has come to my \n     attention that Missouri's Senators Bond and Ashcroft are \n     attempting to block needed changes in the operation of the \n     Missouri River. Senator Bond has attached a provision to H.R. \n     4733, the FY2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations \n     Act. The intended effect of the provision is to prohibit any \n     funds being made available to be used to revise the Missouri \n     River Master Control Manual, if the revision is for the \n     purpose of providing for an increase in the springtime water \n     release programs during the spring heavy rainfall and snow \n     melt period in states that have rivers draining into the \n     Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.\n       This provision is an attempt to override the work of the \n     eight states that are members of the Missouri River Basin \n     Association (MRBA). After a long and arduous process, the \n     MRBA arrived at a consensus plan which seven of the eight \n     basin states could support. However, Missouri was the lone \n     state that did not sign on to the MRBA plan. They choose to \n     mount a political battle to protect their status quo related \n     to water flows.\n       Missouri and every other state must understand that no \n     state is an island.\n\n[[Page S7784]]\n\n       Interestingly, while the Missouri River reservoirs brought \n     many benefits to the downstream states, navigation never \n     developed to its original expectations. And, while no one \n     even mentioned recreation as one of the benefits back in \n     1944, it exploded as an industry on the upper basin mainstem \n     reservoirs. In fact, the Corps of Engineers' 1998 Revised \n     Preliminary Draft Environmental Impact Statement for the \n     Missouri River Master Water Control Manual credits recreation \n     with $84.6 million in annual benefits while navigation \n     creates a mere $6.9 million in annual benefits.\n       As you can see, we are at a crossroads today. The Corps \n     continues to operate the reservoirs with an outdated Master \n     Control Manual. Some of the original purposes of the Pick-\n     Sloan Plan, like hydropower and flood control, are still \n     valid today. However, the manual does not adequately address \n     the conflict between navigation and recreation. Navigation \n     takes water to support a barge channel and during times of \n     dry years and water shortages the upper basin recreation \n     industry suffers terribly. To keep a full navigation channel \n     below Sioux City, Iowa, our reservoirs are drained and our \n     boat docks left high and dry. An $84.6 million industry that \n     offers recreational benefits to hundreds of thousands of \n     people is held hostage by the $6.9 million barge industry.\n       Getting to this point in the Master Manual revision has \n     been a long and arduous trail. Basin stakeholders have held \n     countless meetings, thousands of hours have gone into \n     evaluating the different options, and, in a spirit of \n     compromise, we have agreed to allow the process to work. Too \n     much effort has been spent to derail it now. To allow Senator \n     Bond's provision would sound a death knell to a difficult \n     consensus process, disregard sound biological and \n     hydrological science, and place the whole Master Manual \n     review process back into a political free-for-all pitting the \n     upper-basin-states against the lower basin states. I urge you \n     to remove Senator Bond's provision in your committee.\n           Sincerely,\n     William J. Janklow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7784-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7784-S7786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE DEMOCRATS BBA REFINEMENT AND ACCESS TO CARE PROPOSAL\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made some \npositive changes and contributed to our current $2.2 trillion on-budget \nsurplus.\n  Some of the BBA policies, however, cut providers and services far \nmore consequentially than was ever anticipated, and that has created \nextraordinary problems for health care providers all over the country.\n  I have been hearing from providers in South Dakota about the burdens \nthat BBA created now for almost 3 years.\n  Just this week, community leaders in Sturgis, SD, have been meeting \nto decide the fate of an important clinic we have there. The \nadministrators in Sturgis say the cuts we made in 1997 mean that they \nhave been losing money every year. We may actually see the clinic close \nas a result. That clinic is not alone. There are clinics, there are \nhospitals, there are providers throughout my State and throughout the \ncountry who are facing the same fiscal demise if something is not done. \nAnd their demise spells problems for the people who depend on them for \ncare.\n  Last year, we made the first step. Thanks to a united Democratic \neffort, we put forth a bill largely endorsed by our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and passed the first installment of relief from the \nBBA. It was an effort to try to stave off further closings and \nfinancial harm to critical community health care facilities. We didn't \ngo far enough. Communities are still struggling in spite of our best \neffort last year.\n  Senate Democrats believe that we cannot ignore the crisis this year \neither. We need to act to ensure that beneficiary access to quality \nhealth care remains, regardless of circumstances, regardless of \ngeography, regardless of whether we are talking about a rural area or \nan inner city.\n  I want to thank Senator Patrick Moynihan, our ranking member, Senator \nMax Baucus, and so many other members of the Senate Democratic Caucus \nand the Finance Committee for their leadership in developing the \nresponse to this crisis that we will be introducing shortly upon our \nreturn.\n  The Senate Democrats, under their leadership, are now proposing a \npackage of payment adjustments and other improvements to beneficiary \naccess that total $80 billion over 10 years.\n  This $80 billion will be used to help stabilize hospitals, home \nhealth agencies, hospices, nursing homes, clinics, Medicare+Choice \nplans, and other providers.\n  Our plan pays special attention to rural providers, which serve a \nlarger proportion of Medicare beneficiaries and are more adversely \nimpacted by reductions in the Medicare payment.\n  It includes targeted relief for teaching hospitals that train our \nhealth providers and conduct cutting-edge research.\n  And it includes improvements to Medicaid that could mean \nsignificantly improved access to health care for a number of uninsured \npeople.\n  The proposal also includes improvements that directly help \nbeneficiaries.\n  Senate Democrats continue to believe that passage of an affordable, \nvoluntary, meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit is of highest \npriority.\n  We will continue to press for passage of a prescription drug benefit \nin September as we fight for the important provisions in this proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent that our proposal outline be printed in the \nRecord, which goes through in some detail each of the areas that we \nhope to address, why we hope to address them, and the reasons we are \naddressing them in the bill that we will be introducing immediately \nupon our return from the August recess.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSenate Democrats' BBA Refinement and Access to Care Proposal, July 27, \n                                  2000\n\n       The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 made some important \n     changes in Medicare payment policy, improved health care \n     coverage, and contributed to our current period of budget \n     surpluses through significant cost savings in Medicare. CBO \n     originally estimated Medicare spending cuts at $112 billion \n     over 5 years. Some of the policies enacted in the BBA, \n     however, cut payments to providers more significantly than \n     expected--in some cases more than double the expected \n     amount--and threaten the survival of institutions and \n     services vital to seniors and their communities throughout \n     the country. Senate Democrats believe that, in light of the \n     projected $2.2 trillion on-budget surplus over the next 10 \n     years and the problems facing vital health care services, the \n     Congress should enact a significant package of BBA \n     adjustments and beneficiary protections. Senate Democrats \n     therefore propose a package of payment adjustments and access \n     to care provisions amounting to $80 billion over 10 years.\n       Hospitals. A significant portion of the BBA spending \n     reductions have impacted hospitals. According to MedPAC, \n     ``Hospitals' financial status deteriorated significantly in \n     1998 and 1999,'' the years following enactment of BBA. The \n     Senate Democrats' BBA refinement proposal addresses the most \n     pressing problems facing hospitals by:\n       Adjusting inpatient payments to keep up with increases in \n     hospital costs, an improvement that will help hospitals.\n       Preventing further reductions in payment rates for vital \n     teaching hospitals--which are on the cutting edge of medical \n     research and provide essential care to a large proportion of \n     indigent patients. Support for medical training and research \n     at independent children's hospitals is also included in the \n     Democratic proposal.\n       Targeting additional relief to rural hospitals (Critical \n     Access Hospitals, Medicare Dependent Hospitals, and Sole \n     Community Hospitals) and making it easier for them to qualify \n     for disproportionate share payments under Medicare.\n       Providing additional support for hospitals with a \n     disproportionate share of indigent patients.\n       Home Health. The BBA his home health agencies particularly \n     hard. Home health spending dropped 45 percent between 1997 \n     and 1999, while the number of home health agencies declined \n     by more than 2000 over that period. MedPAC has cautioned \n     against implementing next year the scheduled 15% reduction in \n     payments. The Senate Democrats' BBA refinement proposal:\n       Prevents further reductions in home health payments, takes \n     into consideration the highest cost cases, and addresses the \n     special needs of rural home health agencies.\n       Improves payments for medical equipment.\n       Rural. Rural providers serve a larger proportion of \n     Medicare beneficiaries and are more adversely affected by \n     reductions in Medicare payments. The proposal addresses the \n     unique situation faced in rural areas through a number of \n     measures, including establishing a capital loan fund to \n     improve infrastructure of small rural facilities, providing \n     assistance to develop technology related to new prospective \n     payment systems, creating bonus payments for providers who \n     serve independent hospitals, and ensuring rural facilities \n     can continue to offer quality lab services to beneficiaries.\n       Hospice. Payments to hospices have not kept up with the \n     cost of providing care because of the cost of prescription \n     drugs, the therapies now used in end-of-life care, as well as \n     decreasing lengths of stay. Hospice base rates have not been \n     increased since 1989. The Senate Democrats' BBA Refinement \n     proposal provides additional funding for hospice services to \n     account for their increasing costs.\n\n[[Page S7785]]\n\n       Nursing Homes. The BBA was expected to reduce payments to \n     nursing homes by about $9.5 billion. The actual reduction in \n     payments to SNFs over the period is expected to be \n     significantly larger. A significant number of skilled nursing \n     providers have gone into bankruptcy in the past two years. \n     The Senate Democrats' BBA Refinement proposal:\n       Allows nursing home payments to keep up with increases in \n     costs.\n       Further delays caps on the amount of therapy a patient can \n     receive.\n       Medicare+Choice. Senate Democrats are committed to ensuring \n     that appropriate payments are made to Medicare+Choice plans. \n     In addition, for beneficiaries who have lost Medicare+Choice \n     plans in their area, Senate Democrats have included \n     provisions that strengthen fee-for-service Medicare and \n     assist beneficiaries in the period immediately following loss \n     of service.\n       Other Provisions. Access to other types of care and \n     services are adversely affected by existing policy. The \n     Senate Democrats' proposal will address high priority issues, \n     including adequate payment for dialysis to assure access to \n     quality care for end stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, \n     training of geriatricians, and others.\n       Beneficiary Improvements. In addition to ensuring access to \n     vital health care providers, the proposal includes \n     refinements to Medicare that directly help beneficiaries. \n     Senate Democrats continue to believe that passage of a \n     universal, affordable, voluntary, and meaningful Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit is of highest priority. Other \n     improvements for beneficiaries include:\n       Lowering beneficiary coinsurance in hospital outpatient \n     departments more quickly.\n       Removing current restrictions on payment for \n     immunosuppressive drugs for organ transplant patients.\n       Allowing beneficiaries to return to the same nursing home \n     after a hospital stay.\n       Medicaid and SCHIP. Improvements to the BBA as well as to \n     immigration and welfare reform legislation that passed in \n     1996 could mean significantly improved access to health care \n     for a number of uninsured people. Improvements in the \n     proposal include:\n       Giving states the option to cover legal immigrant children \n     and pregnant women.\n       Improving eligibility and enrollment processes in SCHIP and \n     Medicaid.\n       Extending and improving the Transitional Medical Assistance \n     program for people who leave welfare for work.\n       Giving states grants to develop home and community based \n     services for beneficiaries who would otherwise be in nursing \n     homes.\n       Creating a new payment system for Community Health Centers \n     to ensure they remain a strong, viable component of our \n     health care safety net.\n\n  Mr, DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished Democratic \nLeader Senator Daschle on his statement and join him in supporting the \nDemocratic BBA Refinement and Access to Care Proposal. As the Leader \nsaid, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) has cut Medicare spending \nfar more than had been intended. Our Democratic proposal would spend \n$80 billion over 10 years to mitigate the unintended effects of the BBA \non our nation's health care providers and beneficiaries.\n  In particular, I want to highlight that our package would prevent \nfurther reductions in payments to our Nation's teaching hospitals. The \nBBA, unwisely in my view, enacted a multi-year schedule of cuts in \npayments by Medicare to academic medical centers. These cuts would \nseriously impair the cutting edge research conducted by teaching \nhospitals, as well as impair their ability to train doctors and to \nserve so many of our nation's indigent.\n  Last year, in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA), we mitigated \nthe scheduled reductions in fiscal years 2000 and 2001. The package we \nare proposing today, would cancel any further reductions in what we \ncall ``Indirect Medical Education payments,'' thereby restoring nearly \n$7 billion to our Nation's teaching hospitals.\n  I have stood before my colleagues on countless number of times to \nbring attention to the financial plight of medical schools and teaching \nhospitals. Yet, I regret that the fate of the 144 accredited medical \nschools and 1416 graduate medical education teaching institutions still \nremains uncertain. The proposals in our Democratic BBA refinement \npackage will provide critically needed financing in the short-run. In \nthe long-run, we need to restructure the financing of graduate medical \neducation along the lines I have proposed in the Graduate Medical \nEducation Trust Fund Act that I have introduced in the last 3 \nCongresses. That legislation would require the public and private \nsectors to provide support for graduate medical education. More on that \nlater.\n  My particular interest in this topic goes back to 1994 when the \nFinance Committee took up the President's Health Security Act. As \nChairman of the Committee I asked Paul Marks, then President of \nMemorial Sloan-Kettering, Cancer Center to arrange a ``seminar'' for me \non health care issues. We convened on Wednesday, January 19, 1994 in \nthe Laurance S. Rockefeller Boardroom at 10 a.m. At about a quarter \npast the hour I was told that the University of Minnesota might have to \nclose its medical school.\n  Whereupon my education in this began. Minnesota is where the \nScandinavians (Swedes) settled. They don't close medical schools; they \nopen medical schools. What was going on? It was simple enough: managed \ncare had reached the high plains. The good folk of Lake Wobegon had \ndutifully signed on, only to learn that market-based health plans do \nnot send patients to teaching hospitals, because they cost too much. No \nteaching hospital; ergo no medical school.\n  In the Clinton Administration health security plan, they assumed \nhealth care costs would continue to rise. The Administration's solution \nto this was rationing--cut the number of doctors by one quarter, \nspecialists by one-half and so on.\n  As I have described elsewhere, a dissenting paper dated April 26, \n1993, by ``Workgroup 12'' of ``Tollgate 5,'' was written by a physician \nin the Veterans' Administration. Workgroup 12 was part of the 500 \nperson Clinton health care task force. The paper began:\n\n                         FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\n\n       Subject: Proposal to cap the total number of graduate \n     physician (resident) entry (PGY-1) training positions in the \n     U.S.A. to 110 percent of the annual number of graduates of \n     U.S. medical schools.\n       Issue: Although this proposal has been presented in toll-\n     gate documents as the position of Group 12, it is not \n     supported by the majority of the members of Group 12 . . . \n     .\n       Reasons not to cap the total number of U.S. residency \n     training positions for physician graduates.\n       1. This proposal has been advanced by several Commissions \n     within the last two years as a measure to control the costs \n     of health care. While ostensibly advanced as a man-power \n     policy, its rationale lies in economic policy. Its advocates \n     believe that each physician in America represents a cost \n     center. He not only receives a high personal salary, but is \n     able to generate health care costs by ordering tests, \n     admitting patients to hospitals and performing technical \n     procedures. This thesis may be summarized as: To control \n     costs, control the number of physicians.\n\n  Despite the lack of support for this proposal in the task force, the \nClinton Administration moved ahead anyway with its workforce proposals. \nIn the 1,362 page bill (S. 1775) that I introduced for the Clinton \nAdministration, this appeared:\n\n       . . . the National Council [on Graduate Medical Education] \n     shall ensure that, of the class of training participants \n     entering eligible programs for academic year 1998-99 or any \n     subsequent academic year, the percentage of such class that \n     completes eligible programs in primary health care is not \n     less than 55 percent (without regard to the academic year in \n     which the members of the class complete the programs).\n\n  The Clinton Administration also proposed to limit the number of \nresidents based on the number of graduates from American medical \nschools. Although there was no explicit cap in the bill that I \nintroduced for the Clinton Administration, subsequent legislation, such \nas that offered by Senator Mitchell, included a cap of 110 percent.\n  As this was all done in secret--and buried in a 1,362 page bill--\nthere was no national debate on this Clinton Workforce proposal. When \nall else fails, the press is supposed to step in. It did not. The 1993-\n1994 Nexis tabulation for the Times, East Coast and West Coast \nuncovered only 3 articles pertaining to the Clinton workforce proposal \ncompared to thousands of articles on health reform.\n  Not surprisingly, the Finance Committee went in a different \ndirection. Charles J. Fahey, on behalf of the Catholic Health \nAssociation, told us that we were witnessing the ``commodification of \nmedicine.'' Further down the witness table we were told that a spot \nmarket had developed for bone-marrow transplants in Southern \nCalifornia. In other words we need not worry about rising costs, \ncompetition would depress prices. Indeed, Medicare costs actually \ndeclined in 1999.\n  But take note--there would be side effects. Markets do not provide \npublic goods so teaching hospitals would be at risk. Everyone benefits \nfrom public\n\n[[Page S7786]]\n\ngoods but no one has any incentive to pay. It follows that for the most \npart teaching hospitals have to be paid for by the public, indirectly \nthrough tax exemption or directly through expenditure.\n  On June 29, 1994, the Finance Committee Chairman's Mark--as we refer \nto these things--of the Health Security Act provided for a Graduate \nMedical Education and Academic Health Center Trust Fund to be financed \nby a 1.5 percent tax on all private health care premiums. An additional \nlevy of .25 percent was added on to pay for medical research as \nproposed by Senator Hatfield. A motion to strike the 1.75 percent \npremium tax failed by 13 votes to 7. And we were not bashful about \ncalling this assessment a tax, to wit:\n\n       ``(a) Imposition of Tax.--There is hereby imposed--\n       ``(1) on each taxable health insurance policy, a tax equal \n     to 1.75 percent of the premiums received under such policy, \n     and\n       ``(2) on each amount received for health-related \n     administrative services, a tax equal to 1.75 percent of the \n     amount so received.\n  The bill, as reported out of the Finance Committee, set a goal of \ncovering 95 percent of Americans through subsidies to help low-income \npeople buy health insurance, as well as reforms in the private health \ninsurance market. A National Health Care Commission was to make \nrecommendations for reaching:\n\n       95 percent health insurance coverage in community rating \n     areas that have failed to meet that target.\n\n  I might note that the Senate Finance Committee was the only committee \nthat reported a bill that was actually taken up on the Floor. However, \nupon taking up the Finance Committee bill, Senate Majority Leader \nGeorge Mitchell offered his own substitute health reform plan which \nbecame the focus of the ultimately fruitless Senate debate.\n  Future prospects, for these fine institutions, are not all that they \nshould be. During negotiation of the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of \n1999 Senator Roth and I, with assistance from my good friend \nCongressman Rangel, were able to forestall some of the scheduled deep \ncuts in indirect medical education payments, but, I'm afraid, only \ntemporarily.\n  There were proposals about--for example by the Bipartisan Commission \non the Future of Medicare, Chaired by Senator Breaux--that would \nsubject Graduate Medical Education payments to the appropriations \nprocess. Fifty-five of my colleagues, including Senators Stevens and \nByrd, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Appropriations Committee, \njoined with me to oppose this approach.\n  In a February, 1999 letter, we pointed out the critical role of \nAmerica's teaching hospitals in clinical research and health services \nresearch.\n\n       Teaching hospitals play a vitally important role in the \n     nation's health care delivery system. In addition to the \n     mission of patient care that all hospitals fulfill, teaching \n     hospitals serve as the pre-eminent setting for the clinical \n     education of physicians and other health professionals. . . . \n     In order to remain the world leader in graduate medical \n     education, we must continue to maintain Medicare's strong \n     commitment to the nation's teaching hospitals.\n\n  I'm happy to report that in the final version of the Commission's \nreport, they seem to have relented somewhat recommending that:\n\n       Congress should provide a separate mechanism for continued \n     funding [of Graduate Medical Education] through either a \n     mandatory entitlement or multi-year discretionary \n     appropriation program.\n\n  What is needed is explicit and dedicated funding for these \ninstitutions, which will ensure that the United States continues to \nlead the world in this era of medical discovery. The Graduate Medical \nEducation Trust Fund Act would require that the public sector, through \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the private sector through an \nassessment on health insurance premiums, provide broad-based financial \nsupport for graduate medical education. The Clinton Administration \nproposed something similar as part of the Health Security Act. Funding \nfor Graduate Medical Education would come from Medicare and from \ncorporate and regional health alliances--but there was no way anyone \ncould have known it as they attempted to trace the flow of money \nbetween and among these corporate and regional health alliances.\n  My bill would roughly double current funding levels for Graduate \nMedical Education and would establish a Medical Education Advisory \nCommission to make recommendations on the operation of the Medical \nEducation Trust Fund, on alternative payment sources for funding \ngraduate medical education and teaching hospitals, and on policies \ndesigned to maintain superior research and educational capacities.\n  After this year, I will not be there fighting in the last hours of a \nlegislative session to preserve funding for Graduate Medical Education. \nThe vehicle to preserve that funding, I would maintain, remains the \ntrust fund legislation that I first introduced in June 1996.\n  As I said at the opening of my statement, I am pleased that the $80 \nbillion package the Democratic Leader has announced today, would cancel \nscheduled cuts in ``Indirect Medical Education'' payments to our \nNation's teaching hospitals, restoring about $7 billion over 10 years \nto those institutions. But this is only an interim step. I strongly \nurge that we take the next step which would be to enact my proposal for \na Medical Education Trust Fund, which would ensure an adequate, stable \nsource of funding for these vital institutions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMontana is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7786-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7786-S7787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MISSOURI RIVER RIDER\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to join the minority leader and \nothers who have expressed strong opposition to section 103 of the \nenergy and water appropriations bill, which affects the management of \nthe Missouri River.\n  From the debate that we've had thus far, you might think that this is \npretty straightforward. Upstream states against downstream states, in a \nconventional battle about who gets water, how much they get, and when \nthey get it.\n  I'm not going to kid anybody. That is a big part of the debate. I'm \nfrom an upstream state. We believe that we've been getting a bad deal \nfor years. We want more balanced management of the system. That will, \namong other things, give more weight to the use of the water for \nrecreation upstream, at places like Fort Peck reservoir in Montana.\n  Under the current river operations, there are times when the lake has \nbeen drawn down so low that boat ramps are a mile or more from the \nwater's edge.\n  Our project manager at Fort Peck, Roy Snyder, who does a great job at \nthat facility, has talked to me about how much healthier the river \nwould be with a spring rise/split season management.\n  But it's not just a conventional battle over water. There's more to \nit. A lot more.\n  You wouldn't necessarily know that from the text of the provision \nitself. It says that none of the funds made available in the bill:\n\n       . . . may be used to revise the Missouri River Master Water \n     Control Manual when it is made known to the Federal entity or \n     official to which the funds are made available that such \n     revision provides for an increase in the springtime water \n     release program during the spring heavy rainfall and snow \n     melt period in States that have rivers draining into the \n     Missouri River below the Gavins Point Dam.\n\n  That's what the bill says.\n  Here's what it does.\n  Simply put, it prohibits the Secretary of the Army from obeying the \nlaw of the land. Specifically, it prohibits the Secretary from \ncomplying with the Endangered Species Act.\n  Let me explain. Like any other Federal agency, the Army Corps of \nEngineers has a legal obligation, under section 7 of the Endangered \nSpecies Act, to operate in a way that does not jeopardize the existence \nof any endangered species.\n  That's just common sense. After all, private landowners have to \ncomply with the Endangered Species Act. Why should federal agencies get \na free pass?\n  They shouldn't. The federal government should do its part. That's why \nsection 7 is a fundamental part of the ESA. Without section 7, the ESA \nwould be unfair to private landowners and, in many cases, would provide \nno protection for endangered species whatsoever.\n  Let's turn to the Missouri River. The river provides habitat for \nthree endangered species: The pallid sturgeon, the piping plover, and \nthe least interior tern.\n  Accordingly, in developing its new master manual, which will govern \nthe\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\noperation of the river, the Corps is legally required to propose a \nmanagement approach that protects the habitat for these three species.\n  Now, under section 7, when there's a pretty good chance that a \nfederal agency's actions might jeopardize a species, the agency must \nconsult with the Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  That's the right approach. When it comes to the nuts and bolts of \nrunning a river system, the Corps is the expert. But, when it comes to \nthe nuts and bolts of protecting a species, the Fish and Wildlife \nService is the expert. No question.\n  So, as it is legally required to do, the Corps has consulted with the \nFish and Wildlife Service, initially under what's called the ``informal \nconsultation process.''\n  There have been problems. Serious problems.\n  When the Corps issued the first Environmental Impact Statement for \nthe Master Manual, back in 1994, the Fish and Wildlife Service issued a \ndraft opinion saying that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation \nwould jeopardize the three species.\n  In 1998, the Corps issued a revised EIS. Once again, the Fish and \nWildlife Service said that, in it's judgment, the proposed operation \nstill would jeopardize the three species.\n  Then we made progress. On March 30 of this year, the Corps announced \nthat it was entering into a formal consultation with the Fish and \nWildlife Service and would rely on the Service's biological judgment to \npropose an alternative that does not jeopardize the species. In other \nwords, it would fully comply with the ESA.\n  We expect the Fish and Wildlife Service to issue it's biological \nopinion any day now. That opinion will explain, based on the best \nscientific information available, how to provide the needed protection \nfor the recovery of the 3 endangered species on the river.\n  Nobody outside the agency knows for sure what the biological opinion \nwill say. But, based on all of the scientific discussion that's gone on \nso far, there's a good likelihood that it will require more releases of \nwater in the spring, to maintain the instream flows necessary to \nprovide habitat for the sturgeon, plover, and tern.\n  That probably will mean fewer releases in the summer which, some will \nargue, could affect barge traffic downstream.\n  That's where section 103 of the bill comes in. It prevents the Corps \nreleasing more water in the spring.\n  In other words, if the biological opinion comes out the way most \nfolks expect it to, section 103 prevents the Corps from complying with \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  So, again, this debate is not just about the allocation of water \nbetween upstream and downstream states.\n  The debate is also, fundamentally, about whether, in one fell swoop, \nwe should waive the application of the Endangered Species Act to one of \nthe largest rivers in the country. The river, I might add, that is the \nwellspring of the history of the American west.\n  I suggest that the answer is obvious.\n  We should not.\n  Mr. President, let me also respond to a point that some of the \nsupporters of section 103 have made.\n  They argue, in essence, that we've lost our chance. Sort of like the \nlegal notion of estoppel. This provision has been in the bill for \nseveral years, they argue. We've never tried to delete it before.\n  So, I suppose they're trying to imply, it's somehow inappropriate for \nus to raise it now.\n  This argument is a red herring. A distraction.\n  Up until now, we've never been in a situation in which there was an \nimpending biological opinion under the endangered Species Act. So, by \ndefinition, the earlier provisions did not override the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  What's more, in the absence of a biological opinion, there was no \nreal likelihood that the Corps would implement a spring rise.\n  So the provision was theoretical. Symbolic. It had absolutely no \npractical effect.\n  Now, Mr. President, it most certainly will. That's why we are raising \nthe issue.\n  One final point. If we pass section 103, and the Corps is directed to \noperate the system in violation of the Endangered Species Act, there \nwill be a lawsuit.\n  That will have two effects. First, it will slow things down. Second, \nit may well put us in the position of having the river operated, in \neffect, by the courts rather than by the Corps.\n  We've seen this happen along the Columbia Snake River system, and \nit's not been an easy experience for anyone.\n  In closing, I suggest that there's a better way. After all, once a \nbiological opinion is issued, there will be an opportunity for public \ncomment, so this decision will not be made in a vacuum.\n  In fact, there have been countless public meetings and forums on the \nrevision of the Master Manual over the years. And that's as it should \nbe.\n  So let's not create a special exemption for the Corps. Let's require \nthem to abide by the same law that we apply to everybody else.\n  Let's allow the regular process to work. Let's allow the agencies to \ncontinue to consult and figure out how to strike the balance that's \nnecessary to manage this mighty and beautiful river: for upstream \nstates, for downstream states, and for the protection of endangered \nspecies; that is, for all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7787-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7787-S7788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  PNTR\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am very glad the Senate has voted to \ninvoke cloture and will finally get to the bill granting China \npermanent normal trade relations status. That bill will come up in \nSeptember. That legislation has the strong support of at least three-\nquarters of the Members of this body, and it is deeply in our national \ninterests. We should have rapidly disposed of it months ago. But later \nis better than never. I hope very much when we bring it up in September \nthat we have a very large vote--at least three-quarters, as I earlier \nstated.\n  When we make that vote, it will be a profound choice. The question \nwill be, Do we bring China into the orbit of the global trading \ncommunity with its rule of law? Or do we choose to isolate and contain \nChina, creating a 21st century version of a cold war in Asia?\n  China is not our enemy. China is not our friend. The issue for us is \nhow to engage China, and this means engagement with no illusions--\nengagement with a purpose. How do we steer China's energies into \nproductive, peaceful, and stable relationships within the region and \nglobally? For just as we isolate China at our peril, we engage them to \nour advantage.\n  The incorporation of China into the WTO--and that includes granting \nthem PNTR--is a national imperative for the United States of America.\n  I might add that when the debate comes up on PNTR in September, \nvarious Senators will offer amendments, as is their right, to that \nlegislation. I think it is essential that we maintain the integrity of \nthe House-passed bill. Many of those amendments that will be coming are \nvery worthy amendments, and in another context they should pass. I \nwould vote for them. But to maintain the integrity of the House-passed \nbill, I will strongly urge my colleagues to vote against amendments \nthat are added on to the PNTR legislation, as worthy as they are, even \nthough Senators certainly have a right to bring them up, because if \nthose amendments were to pass, we would no longer be maintaining the \nintegrity of the House-passed bill. But the bill would have to go back \nto conference, and that would, in my judgment, jeopardize passage of \nPNTR to such a great degree that we should take the extraordinary step \nof not passing those amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recognize my colleague from Minnesota \ntoday, for legislation that he and I have been working on together has \npassed this body. It previously passed the House, and now will go to \nconference. It is The Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000. It is \na bill--one of the first perhaps in the world--to address the growing \nugly practice of sex trafficking where people are traded into human \nbondage--again, into the sex and prostitution business around the \nworld. It is an ugly practice that is growing. More organized crime is \ngetting into it. It is one of the darker sides of globalization that is \ntaking place in the world.\n  It is estimated that the size of this business is $7 billion \nannually, only surpassed by that of the illegal arms trade on an \nillegal basis. If those numbers aren't stark enough, the numbers of the \nindividuals involved is stark enough.\n  Our intelligence community estimates that up to 700,000 women and \nchildren--primarily young girls--are trafficked, generally from poorer \ncountries to richer countries each year, and sold into bondage; raped, \nheld against their will, locked up, and food withheld from them until \nthey submit to this sex trade. That is taking place in our world in the \nyear 2000. Our intelligence community estimates that 50,000 are \ntrafficked into the United States into this ugly traffic.\n  I had a personal experience with this earlier this year. In January, \nI traveled to Nepal and met with a number of girls who had been \ntrafficked and then returned. They had been tricked to leave their \nvillages. Many of them were told at the ages of 11, 12, or 13: Come \nwith us. We are going to get you a job as a housekeeper, or making \nrugs, or some other thing in Bombay, India, that will be much better \nthan what you are doing now.\n  Their families don't have the wherewithal to pay their livelihood. \nTheir families are poor as can be. They are not able to feed them, and \nthe families say: Go ahead.\n  They then take them across the border. They take their papers from \nthem. They force them into brothels in Bombay or Calcutta or somewhere \nelse and force them into this trade.\n  Some of these girls make their way back at the age of 16 or 17 years \nof age. Two-thirds of them now carry AIDS and/or tuberculosis. Most of \nthem come home to die.\n  It is one of the ugliest, darkest things I have seen around the \nworld.\n  The Senate took the step today to start to deal with this practice \nthat is occurring around the world, and that is occurring in the United \nStates.\n  My colleague, Senator Wellstone, and I worked this legislation \ntogether to be able to get it moved through this body.\n  I am so thankful to him and other people who have worked greatly on \nthis legislation to get it passed.\n  I particularly want to recognize, on my staff, Sharon Payt, who has \nleaned in for a long time to be able to get this done.\n  This is the new, modern form of slavery.\n  Trafficking victims are the new enslaved of the world. Until lately, \nthey have had no advocates, no defenders, no avenues of escape, except \ndeath, to release them from the hellish types of circumstances and \nconditions they have been trafficked into. This is changing rapidly--a \nnew movement of awareness is forming to wrench freedom for the victims \nand combat trafficking networks. This growing movement runs from \n`right' to `left,' from Chuck Colson to Gloria Steinem, and from Sam \nBrownback to Paul Wellstone. Our legislation, which passed today, is \npart of that movement, providing numerous protections and tools to \nempower these brutalized people toward re-capturing their dignity and \nobtaining justice, and getting their lives back.\n\n  Trafficking has risen dramatically in the last 10 to 15 years with \nexperts speculating that it could exceed the drug trade in revenues in \nthe next few decades. It is coldly observed that drugs are sold once, \nwhile a woman or child can be sold 20 and even 30 times a day. This \ndramatic increase is attributed also to the popularizing of the sex \nindustry worldwide, including the increase of child pornography, and \nsex tours in Eastern Asia. As the world's dark appetite for these \npractices grows, so do the number of victims in this evil manifestation \nof global trade.\n  The victims are usually transported across international borders so \nas to `shake' local authorities, leaving them defenseless in a foreign \ncountry, virtually held hostage in a strange land. Perpetrating further \nvulnerability, often they are ``traded'' routinely among brothels in \ndifferent cities. This deliberate ploy robs them of assistance from \nfamily, friends, and authorities.\n\n  The favorite age for girls in some countries is around 13 years of \nage. I have a 14-year-old daughter and it almost makes me cry to think \nof somebody being taken out of the home at that age and submitted and \nsubjected and forced into this type of situation. Thirteen is the \nfavorite age. There is a demand particularly for virgins because of the \nfear of AIDS. Now, imagine, your daughter, your sister, your \ngranddaughter in that hellish condition.\n  International trafficking routes are very specific and include the \nEastern European states, particularly Russia and the Ukraine, into \nCentral Europe and Israel. Other routes include girls sold or abducted \nfrom Nepal to India--the Nepalese girls are prized because they are \nbeautiful, illiterate, extremely poor with no defenders, and compliant, \nmaking it easy to keep them in bondage. In Eastern Asia, most abductees \nare simple tribal girls from isolated mountain regions who are forced \ninto sexual service, primarily in Thailand and Malaysia. These are only \na few of the countless but repeatedly traveled routes.\n  One of two methods, fraud or force, is used to obtain victims. Force \nis often used in the cities wherein, for example, the victim is \nphysically abducted and held against her will, sometimes in chains, and \nusually brutalized through repeated rape and beatings. Regarding \nfraudulent procurement, typically the ``buyer'' promises the parents \nthat he is taking their daughter away to become a nanny or domestic \nservant, giving the parents a few hundred dollars as a ``down payment'' \nfor the future money she will earn for the family. Then the girl is \ntransported across international borders, deposited in a brothel and \nforced into the trade until she is no longer useful having contracted \nAIDS. She is held against her will under the rationale that she must \n``work off'' her debt which was paid to the parents, which usually \ntakes several years, if she remains alive that long.\n  A Washington Post article, Sex Trade Enslaves East Europeans, dated \nJuly 25th, vividly captures the suffering of one Eastern Europe woman \nwho was trafficked through Albania to Italy: ``As Irina recounts the \nnext part of her story, she picks and scratches at the skin on her \nface, arms and legs, as if looking for an escape . . . she says the \nwomen were raped by a succession of Albanian men who stopped by at all \nhours, in what seemed part of a carefully organized campaign of \npsychological conditioning for a life of prostitution.'' This insidious \nactivity must be challenged, and our legislation would do exactly that. \nThat is what this body has passed today.\n  This legislation establishes, for the first time, a bright line \nbetween the victim and perpetrator. Presently, most existing laws \ninternationally fail to distinguish between victims of sexual \ntrafficking and their perpetrators. Sadly and ironically, victims are \npunished more harshly than the traffickers, because of their illegal \nimmigration status and lack of documents (which the traffickers have \nconfiscated to control the victim).\n  In contrast, our legislation punishes the perpetrators and provides \nan advocacy forum to promote international awareness, as well as \nproviding the following:\n  Criminal punishment for persons convicted of operating as traffickers \nin the U.S.\n  Creates a new immigration status termed a ``T'' visa for trafficking \nvictims found in the U.S., to promote aggressive prosecution of \ntraffickers.\n  Directs USAID, as well as domestic government agencies to fund \nprograms\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\nfor victim assistance and awareness to help stop this practice, both \noverseas and domestically.\n  Establishes an annual reporting mechanism to identify trafficking \noffenders, both individual and country-specific.\n  Advances rule of law programs to promote combating of international \nsex trafficking.\n  Authorizes grants for law enforcement agencies to investigate and \nprosecute international trafficking, and assist in drafting and \nimplementation of new legislation.\n  In closing, there is a unique generosity in the American people, who \nare defined by their vigilance for justice. As we challenge this \ndehumanizing practice, an inspired movement is growing in America and \nworldwide. Sparking this awareness are courageous groups which deserve \nacknowledgment, including the International Justice Mission with Gary \nHaugen, and the Protection Project with Dr. Laura Lederer, among \nseveral others. Both Senator Wellstone and I hope this legislation is \nthe beginning of the end for this modern-day slavery known as \ntrafficking.\n  Mr. President, we had five major health organizations come together \nand identify the violence in our entertainment that is harming our \nchildren. The organizations include the American Medical Association, \nAmerican Psychological Association, American Academy of Child and \nAdolescent Psychiatry, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and \nthe American Academy of Pediatricians.\n  I turn the floor back over to my colleague from Minnesota. Today, his \ninterest has culminated in this legislation passing this body. This is \nthe most significant human rights legislation we have passed this \nCongress, if not for several years. This is going to save lives. It \nwill start identifying this pernicious, ugly, dark practice around the \nworld for what it is. We are going to start saving people's lives as a \nresult of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senate tonight passed the \nTrafficking in Victims Protection Act of 2000. Similar legislation \npassed the House. The conference committee is committed to this \nlegislation. I don't think there is any question but that the Congress \nis going to pass this bill. This was a huge step forward.\n  I thank Senator Brownback who for 3\\1/2\\ years, at least, has been \nworking on this. It started with my wife Sheila, who brought this to my \nattention. I remember meeting with women from Ukraine--which is where \nmy father was born--describing what had happened to them.\n  Senator Brownback is absolutely right. This is one of the brutal \naspects of this new global economy. It supplements drug trafficking, \nexcept quite often it is more profitable, believe it or not, because \nthe women--girls--are recycled over and over again. We are talking \nabout close to 1 million women and girls, the trafficking of these \nwomen and girls for purposes of forced prostitution or forced labor.\n  We are talking about the trafficking of some 50,000 women, girls, to \nour country. Two miles away, in Bethesda, there was a massage parlor \nwith a group of girls from Ukraine. The country is in economic \ndisarray. They thought this was an opportunity. They came to our \ncountry. Their passports were taken away. They were isolated. Senator \nBrownback talked about the isolation. They were beaten up. They were \nraped. They were forced into prostitution. In our country, in the year \n2000, this goes on in the world, and in the United States of America.\n  This legislation would never pass without the leadership of Senator \nBrownback and the leadership of Sharon Payt. I thank Wes Carrington, \nwho is on the floor with me, and Jill Hickson, two fellows who have \nbeen gifts from Heaven, and Charlotte Moore, who has been working on \nthis, and my wife Sheila.\n\n  I could talk for hours about this, but I will emphasize a couple of \nkey aspects. First, prevention, a focus on doing the public information \nwork in these countries and work with the consulates so these girls \nhave some understanding of what their rights are, so they are warned \nabout the dangers of this when the recruiters are out there to try to \nprevent this from happening in the first place; and an emphasis on how \nyou can get economic development from microenterprise to opportunities \nfor women. Part of the problem is the way in which women are so \ndevalued in too many nations. Also, the grinding poverty.\n  Second, protection. The bitter, bitter, bitter irony, colleagues, is \nthat quite often the victims are the ones who are punished, and these \nmobsters and criminals who are involved in the trafficking of these \nwomen and girls with this blatant exploitation get away with literally \nmurder.\n  One of the problems is that these girls and women can't step forward \nbecause then they will be deported. So we have an extension of \ntemporary visas for up to 3 years for the women, girls, and a final \ndecision is made as to whether or not they can stay in the country.\n  In addition, there is some help for them. We have in Minnesota the \nCenter for the Treatment of Torture Victims. It is a holy place. It is \na spiritual place. Most of these women and men come from Africa. They \nhave been through a living hell. We read about child soldiers. We read \nabout what is happening. It takes a long time for people to be able to \nrebuild their lives when they have been through this, when they have \nbeen tortured.\n  There are 120 governments today in the world that are engaged in this \nsystematic use of torture today; the same thing for these women and \ngirls. Imagine what it is like for them. There is help for them.\n  Finally, prosecution, and taking this seriously, treating it as a \ncrime so, for example, if you are trafficking a young girl under the \nage of 14 and forcing her into prostitution, you face a life sentence \nin prison.\n  And finally, not automatic sanctions but a listing of those \ngovernments which are involved in the trafficking, which have turned \ntheir gaze away and refused to do anything about it. With it being up \nto a President, be he Democrat or Republican or she a Democrat or \nRepublican, in the future, as to whether or not there is an action to \nbe taken.\n\n  It is a good piece of legislation. I think Senator Brownback is \nright. I think it is the human rights legislation to pass the Congress. \nIt will pass. Mr. Koh, Assistant Secretary of Human Rights at the State \nDepartment, has been great. The administration has been supportive. We \nhave had a lot of support from Democrats and Republicans here, and I \nreally feel good about it.\n  I said to Senator Brownback, I think Senator Bennett can appreciate \nthis because I think he is like this--the first part I don't want to \nsay is his view--but there are some days where I just cannot decide \nwhether or not I have really been able to help anybody. You try, but \nyou just sometimes get so frustrated. I think this piece of legislation \nwe passed will help a lot of people. I really do, I say to Senator \nBrownback. I think it is a good model for other governments, other \ncountries. I am not being grandiose here. I think we can get this out \nto a lot of fellow legislators in other nations and other NGOs. I know \nthere is a lot of interest.\n  I rise to speak about this bill, to tell my colleague from Kansas, \nSenator Brownback, I appreciated working with him, and to say to the \nSenate--all the Senators; after all, this passed by unanimous consent--\nthank you, thank you for your support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7789-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7789-S7791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE DEBATE ON CHINA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if it is OK with Senator Brownback, I \nwant to briefly respond to my colleague from Montana. I will do it \nunder 10 minutes, to anticipate the debate we are going to have on \nChina.\n  I think some of this debate has already become confused. My father \nwas born in Odessa, Ukraine, then moved to Russia in the Far East \nSiberia. His father was a hatter trying to stay ahead of the czarist \ntroops--Jewish. He then moved to Harbin, then to Peking, then came over \nto the United States of America when he was 17, in 1914, 3 years before \nthe revolution. He then was going to go back, because first it was the \nSocial Democrats but then the Bolsheviks, the Communists, took over, \nand his family told him not to come back. I believe his father lost all \nof his family to Stalin. I think they\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\nwere all murdered, because all the letters stopped.\n  My father is no longer alive. He spoke 10 languages fluently and was \nreally--you would have liked him, Mr. President.\n  My father taught me that we should value human rights. Our country is \na leader in this area. When we turn our gaze away from the persecution \nof people and the violation of human rights of people in the world, we \ndiminish ourselves.\n  This debate we are going to have after Labor Day is not about whether \nor not we should have trade with China. We have trade with China. We \nhave a tremendous amount of trade. In fact, we have a huge trade \ndeficit, I think to the tune of about $70 billion.\n  It is not about whether we should have an embargo of China like an \nembargo of Cuba. I don't think the embargo of Cuba makes much sense, \nand certainly no one I know is recommending an embargo of China.\n\n  It is not about whether or not we want to isolate China. China is not \ngoing to be isolated. China is very much a part of the international \neconomy.\n  The debate is about whether or not we maintain for ourselves the \nright to annually review trade relations with China so we at least have \nsome small amount of leverage when it comes to human rights.\n  According to the State Department report last year on human rights in \nChina:\n\n       The Government's poor human rights record deteriorated \n     markedly throughout the year, as the Government intensified \n     efforts to suppress dissent, particularly organized dissent. \n     Abuses includes instances of extrajudicial killings, torture, \n     mistreatment of prisoners, and denial of due process.\n\n  The Commission on Religious Freedom chaired by David Saperstein \nrecommended that we not automatically grant normal trade relations with \nChina because of the religious persecution in China and laid out a \nseries of criteria that should be met, and that will be the first \namendment I will introduce.\n  Yes, to us giving China most favored nation status. But not until \nthey at least meet basic, simple, elementary criteria so the people in \nChina have the right to practice their religion. Are we going to turn \nour gaze away from that?\n  According to Amnesty International, ``throughout China mass summary \nexecutions continue to be carried out. At least 6,000 death sentences \nand 3,500 executions were officially recorded last year.''\n  The real figures are believed to be much higher.\n  In the debate, I will talk about Wei Jingsheng and Harry Wu--people, \nin addition to these statistics. But let me be clear to my colleagues. \nAfter all the discussion about all the economic relations having led to \nopening up society and it has all changed, the human rights record has \ndeteriorated. There is not one Senator who can come to the floor and \nmake the argument that, because of trade relations--I understand \ninvestment opportunities making a lot of money--the human rights record \nhas improved in China, or that the situation in Tibet has improved, or \nthat people now can practice their religion. It is not true. Don't we \nwant to maintain just a little bit of leverage and just say we have the \nright to annually review our trade relations with China?\n  One other point. I think what you are going to see is not more \nexports to China. I am going to hold every single Senator and I am \ngoing to hold the administration accountable as well.\n  The President came to my State of Minnesota. He said we were going to \nhave all these exports in agriculture, and it was going to help out \nfamily farmers who were struggling to survive. I don't know if that is \ngoing to be the case. There are 700 million farmers in China. I do know \nthis. What is more likely to happen is there will be more exports in \nChina and multinational corporations will go to China and China will \nbecome even more of a low-wage export platform or, for that matter, you \nwill have large grain companies producing corn in China well below the \ncost of production for family farmers in our own country.\n  Wal-Marts pay 14 cents an hour. Other U.S. companies pay 5 cents and \n6 cents an hour. If you should try to organize a union in China, you \nwould wind up in prison.\n  So I will have three other amendments, and I will yield the floor on \nthis. I will have an amendment that deals with forced prison labor \nconditions in China and says: Enough of this, if we are going to have \nnormal trade relations. I will have another amendment that says the \npeople in China should have the right to form independent unions and \nnot wind up in prison. And I will have a final amendment that will \nbasically say that in our State, our workers should have the right to \norganize; there should be labor law reform; no longer should it just be \nthe company that gets to talk to employees during an organizing drive; \nno longer should companies be able to illegally fire workers, have it \nbe profitable, and not have to pay stiff back penalties, back fines.\n  We are forever being told now that we live in a global economy. And \nthat is true. But the implications of that statement are seldom \nrecognized. To me that means, if we truly care about human rights, we \ncan no longer just be concerned about human rights at home. If we live \nin a global economy and we truly care about religious freedom, then we \ncan no longer just be concerned about religious freedom at home. If we \nare in a global economy and we truly care about the rights of \norganizers to organize and be able to make a decent living so they can \ntake care of their families, then we have to be concerned not just \nabout the rights of organizers in our country but organizers in the \nworld. And if we truly care about the environment, then we can no \nlonger concern ourselves with just environmental protections at home, \nbut environmental protections in other countries as well.\n  Do you know that a large majority of the Senate is all for this--\nautomatically extending normal trade relations with China or most \nfavored nation trade status? Do you know what the polls show? The polls \nshow Americans oppose eliminating any review of China's human rights \nrecord by 65 to 18 percent; 67 percent oppose China's admission to the \nWTO, although that is not what this debate will be about; and 83 \npercent of the people in our country support inclusion of strong \nenvironmental and labor standards in future trade agreements.\n  My colleague--1 minute left--my colleague from Montana, whom I enjoy, \nsaid: I am going to call on all Senators to vote against all \namendments.\n  I am going to tell Senators a lot of these amendments are substantive \nand they are serious. Look at what we had happen on several of these \ntax bills, the majority leader came out after we had passed amendments \nand then introduced an amendment that wiped out all those amendments.\n  I am going to remind Senators of that precedent. I am going to remind \nSenators that you cannot go back home and explain with much credibility \nto the people you represent that you would not vote for the people in \nChina to have the right to practice their religion; you would not vote \nfor basic support for human rights; you would not vote for people to \norganize a union and not wind up in prison; you would not vote for \nlabor law reform because you said: Oh, well, you see, we had to go into \nconference committee and we had to keep it clean and I could not vote \nfor that.\n  A, that is not true; B, it is the ultimate Washington insider \nargument. One has to vote for what one thinks is right. One has to vote \nfor the substance of each one of these amendments. That is the \nchallenge I present to my colleagues. I look forward to this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

Mr. President, on June 15, under the leadership of \nChairman McCain, the Senate Commerce Committee passed a bill \nreauthorizing and amendment the Pipeline Safety Act. This bill is, in \nmy view, the single most important piece of legislation the committee \nwill address this session. Following a June 10, 1999, accident in \nBellingham, WA, that killed three children, blackened a magnificent \ncity park, and sent shock waves through the community and State, \nSenator Murray and I have been working in front of and behind the \nscenes to see the Federal law regulating the operation of pipelines is \nchanged: that communities and citizens are better informed about \npipelines; that States can obtain a clear role in the oversight of \ninterstate pipelines; that the Federal Office of Pipeline Safety adopts \nmore meaningful safety standards; and that funding is increased for \nFederal and State pipeline safety operations.\n  While we are well on our way to accomplishing this last goal--the \nSenate has provided a significant increase in funding for the Office of \nthe Pipeline Safety, and I have earmarked matching Federal funds for \nWashington State to supplement the funds appropriated by the State \nlegislature for expanded safety activities--securing passage of the \nauthorizing legislation has proven more difficult. I come to the floor \nto tell my colleagues that I will not rest in seeking the enactment of \nmeaningful legislation this year. I am by nature a determined man, and \nmy resolve on this issue has been strengthened by the example set by \nthe Mayor of Bellingham, whose interest in this matter has not been \nhalf-hearted or expedient, but who has devoted and continues to devote \ntime, resources, and thought to what we can do to make pipelines safer. \nI am committed to seeing that his efforts and my own are not in vain.\n  The bill that passed the Commerce Committee is a good one. It makes \nmeaningful changes in Federal law. S. 2438 requires the Federal Office \nof Pipeline Safety to implement the recommendations of the Inspector \nGeneral of the Department of Transportation by completing rulemakings \nthat are long overdue, collecting better information to determine the \ncauses of pipeline accidents, and providing better training to OPS \ninspectors. It accelerates the deadline for operators to prepare plans \nfor training and qualifying their employees. It requires that \ninformation about pipeline incidents and safety-related conditions be \nmade available to the public and that operators work with local \ncommunities to educate them about the location and risks of pipelines \nand what to do in case of an accident. The bill increases fines for \nviolations, and explicitly provides a role for States in the oversight \nof interstate pipelines. It provides more funding for the Office of \nPipeline Safety and direction on areas of research and development to \nfocus on to improve safety.\n  In addition, the bill imposes on operators of pipelines of any \nlength--not just longer pipelines as suggested by the administration--\nan obligation to conduct risk analyses and to adopt integrity \nmanagement plans for high consequence areas--plans that provide for \nperiodic assessments of pipelines' integrity. S. 2438 ensures that OPS \nwill have easier access to operator information, and lowers the liquid \nspill reporting threshold to 5 gallons. It creates a national database \nof pipeline events and conditions. The bill contains protections for \nwhistle blowers. Significantly, the bill also authorizes the Secretary \nto create a pilot program for State safety advisory committees to allow \nfor meaningful citizen input into safety issues of local and State \nconcern, and to monitor the performance of the Office of Pipeline \nSafety.\n  The bill, in summary, substantially improves current law. \nUnfortunately, in its current form, I am told, the bill will be stopped \nby a pipeline industry that can prevent its passage by getting any \nsingle Member to place a ``hold'' on the bill once the committee report \nis filed. At another time, however, when the Senate is able to debate \nthe measure, the reforms could be much less palatable to industry. It \nhas already been over a year since the fatal accident in Bellingham, \nand the public should not have to wait longer for improvements to the \nfederal pipeline law.\n  While I led the effort to defeat amendments offered in the Commerce \nCommittee that I thought undermined this legislation, I recognized \nthen, as I do now, that some of the issues raised by industry should be \nand must be addressed if we are to enact legislation this year.\n  I have tried, since the committee passed the bill, to understand and \naddress industry concerns in a reasonable manner. While I think we are \ngetting close on a number of issues, I am growing impatient, \nparticularly with the industry's continued opposition to allowing State \nand local input on pipeline safety issues of local concern. At some \npoint--and this point will come very soon after our return from the \nAugust recess--I will ask my colleagues, one by one if necessary, to \njoin me in voting for S. 2438 and a sound manager's amendment. I trust \nby that time they will be satisfied that the pipeline industry has had \na fair opportunity to work out a reasonable compromise and that the \ntime has come for Congress to act in the interest of all Americans.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7793-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S7793]]\n\nSenate\n\n                         IMPROVING FUEL ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am here to cheer the announcement by the \nFord Motor Company that it will voluntarily improve the fuel economy of \nits fleet of sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over a period of 5 \nyears. At a time when gas prices are skyrocketing and sales of SUVs are \nincreasing, this announcement couldn't come at a better time. Ford's \ndecision to make SUVs more fuel efficient is welcome news. I have long \nsaid that the industry has existing technology to allow cars to go \nfarther on a gallon of gas and to save consumers money at the gas pump. \nFord has set an example that other auto manufacturers should follow \nimmediately. I am anxiously awaiting a response from the remaining two \nof the big three and hope they will join Ford in its pursuit of \ncleaner, more efficient vehicles.\n  I hope the manufacturers, now having pledged to improve fuel \nefficiency, will join me in my efforts to study an increase in \ncorporate average fuel economy standards. As my colleagues know, I have \nlong been an advocate of raising CAFE standards and scored a \nbreakthrough victory earlier this year that paves the way for the \nDepartment of Transportation and the National Academy of Sciences, once \nagain, to study fuel efficiency standards and their relationship to \nsuch issues as vehicle safety and to recommend the findings to Congress \nby July 1, 2001. I look forward to working with the automotive industry \nto ensure that this study is fair and balanced.\n  Many constituents and colleagues are surprised to learn of my \nadvocacy for CAFE standards. My motivation is a simple one and is based \non the success of the original CAFE standards statutes. I have never \nbeen swayed by doomsday predictions from automakers that claim they \nwould be forced to manufacture a fleet of subcompact cars if we allowed \nthe Department of Transportation to study and impose an increase in \nCAFE standards. We have come a long way from absolute opposition to a \nstudy of the issue to today's major announcement by the Ford Motor \nCompany that will be of tremendous benefit to consumers who want \ncleaner, more efficient SUVs. This announcement reaffirms my faith in \nthe ability of American automobile manufacturers to produce fuel-\nefficient vehicles that are the envy of the world. The debate over \nraising CAFE standards has come a long way, and I look forward to \ncontinuing this debate when Congress returns from its August recess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7793-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7793-S7794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BREACHING COLUMBIA AND SNAKE RIVER DAMS\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on a third and separate subject, during \nthe course of this past week, four Northwest Governors, two Republicans \nand two Democrats--the Governors of Montana, Idaho, Washington, and \nOregon--released a framework that shows great promise toward the \nrecovery of endangered salmon on the Columbia and Snake Rivers. They \nhave done so without recommending that any dams on the Columbia and \nSnake Rivers be breached and destroyed. I agree wholeheartedly with the \nfollowing statement from their plan:\n\n       The region must be prepared in the near term to recover \n     salmon and meet its larger fish and wildlife restoration \n     obligations by acting now in areas of agreement without \n     resorting to breaching the four Snake River dams.\n\n  That is a reasonable statement. Unfortunately, it is not one which \nVice President Gore and the Federal agencies now concerned with salmon \nenhancement endorse in their countervailing recommendations of today to \nkeep moving forward with plans to destroy those dams.\n  I agree with the bipartisan Governors' plan in many of its elements, \nincluding the principle that performance standards must be \nscientifically based, subject to scientific peer review, reasonably \nobtainable, and measurable. I agree with the Governors that the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service should work together with local, \nState, and tribal governments and private landowners on what specific \nimprovements are needed for recovery. I agree with the Governors that \nwe need real leadership and that the President of the United States \nshould appoint one official in the region who will be accountable and \nwho will efficiently oversee Federal agency fish recovery efforts.\n  Over the past decade, we have squandered more than a billion dollars \nand commissioned dozens of studies that have done little to promote a \nconsensus on how best to save salmon. The Governors and I agree that \nlocal salmon recovery plans that avoid Federal methods of duplication \nand top-down planning are a much more effective method of saving \nsalmon. I agree with the Governors that States should move ahead to \ndesignate priority watersheds for salmon and steelhead plans that are \nto be developed within 1 year and that the Federal agencies should have \nclear numerical goals so that success may be measured in those \nwatersheds.\n  The appropriations subcommittee of this Congress last year directed \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service to provide numerical goals for \nall of the listed fish in the Puget Sound and Columbia River regions \nand a schedule for all other areas and to provide this information to \nCongress by July 1 of this year. Instead of fulfilling this request, \nthose agencies have said they will not have any goals until the fall of \n2001 and that they have only begun the technical recovery planning for \nany species of fish they seek to recover. In other words, once again \nthe administration says what we ought to do without knowing what those \nsteps are designed to accomplish.\n  I agree with the Governors and their recommendation that the Army \nCorps\n\n[[Page S7794]]\n\nof Engineers, the National Marine Fisheries Service, and the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service must develop a long-term management plan to \naddress predation by fish-eating birds and marine mammals, including \nseals and sea lions, and do so by the end of the year. I agree with the \nGovernors that the National Marine Fisheries Service should work with \nthe region to conduct an intensive study to address the role of the \nocean in fish recovery and ask that the management of fish and fresh \nwater reflect new information about the ocean as it is developed.\n\n  In short, I believe the Governors have a plan that will work. I have \nsupported millions of dollars in salmon recovery money to be given to \nthe States and to local volunteer groups and will work with them.\n  On the other hand, today the National Marine Fisheries Service has \ncome out with its top-down recommendations, recommendations that, I \nwant to point out, once again call for very specific measures and steps \nto be taken but do not state any goals for recovery and do not allow us \nto know what they believe success will be or how that success will be \nmeasured.\n  In the course of the last week or 10 days, the newspapers in the \nPacific Northwest have been filled with statements that the Federal \nGovernment had abandoned the idea of dam removal as an element in \nsalmon recovery at least for a decade. And the implication was that \nthey had abandoned it forever.\n  Not so, Mr. President. What does the biological opinion that was \nissued today say in that respect?\n  It says:\n\n       The reasonable and prudent alternative requires that \n     further development of breaches as an option is necessary, \n     and it requires the Corps of Engineers by fiscal year 2002 to \n     seek appropriations to complete preliminary engineering and \n     design work by 2005 for potential removal of the four lower \n     Snake River dams.\n\n  It does that in spite of the fact that:\n\n       There is considerable uncertainty in assessing the status \n     of listed fish under current conditions, and the alternative \n     of breaching dams is highly dependent on the degree to which \n     there is delayed mortality associated with juvenile fish \n     passage at the dams and whether breaching would help even to \n     answer these uncertainties.\n\n  Well, we have a set of Federal agencies that have disagreed with one \nanother. The Corps of Engineers, a year ago, reached the conclusion \nthat dam removal was a poor idea. It did so in spite of vastly \nunderestimating, according to the General Accounting Administration, \nthe adverse impacts on the society, the economy, and the environment of \nthe Pacific Northwest. That recommendation was deleted from its formal \nopinion by orders of the White House.\n  Vice President Gore has visited the State of Washington on three or \nfour occasions during the course of this year. Each time he has been \nasked to state his opinion on dam removal, including a specific request \nby one of his supporters, the Governor of Oregon. He has ducked, \ndodged, and defied any attempt to get him to reach a conclusion on that \nparticular subject. But I think this biological opinion released by the \nadministration today shows what that opinion is. It is very simple: We \nwill fool the people of the Pacific Northwest by saying we have \nprobably abandoned the idea between now and the 8th of November, and \nthen under these recommendations we can change our mind very rapidly \nwhen they won't have a direct say over who will manage the next \nnational administration.\n  Contrast that position with the forthright and unconditional pledge \nof Governor Bush that the removal of our dams, the destruction of our \nphysical infrastructure, is not an option; that we can and will recover \nthe salmon resources in the Pacific Northwest by the use of our \nimaginations and by following the advice of the people whose lives are \naffected by these decisions--a view that I believe is entirely \nconsistent with the recommendations this week of the four Governors--\ntwo Republicans and two Democrats, as I have already pointed out--from \nthe Pacific Northwest itself.\n  Well, we do have something to say about this issue. I pledge I will \ndo everything I can between now and the adjournment of this Congress in \nlate September or early October to see to it this administration is not \nallowed to waste any more money--not a single dollar--on further \nstudies to remove dams on the Columbia-Snake River system. We will call \nthem to account for their own policies. Their own policies now say this \ndecision should be moved down the road. Fine. We will move the whole \ndecision down the road and hope that we will have a President who will \nbe mindful of the views of the people of the Pacific Northwest and, in \nthe meantime, we are not going to let them waste money to build a case \nfor removing dams that ought to stay in place.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today the Senate is \ntaking up, as an amendment to the reauthorization of the Breast Cancer \nResearch Stamp, the Semipostal Act, an amendment I sponsored with \nSenators Feinstein and Hutchison.\n  My amendment is very similar to the McHugh bill that we sent to the \nPresident yesterday, which establishes the authority to issue \nsemipostals in the U.S. Postal Service. However, it is different in \nthat it requires the Postal Service to recoup the full costs associated \nwith the stamp. This bill will ensure that the Postal Service recovers \nits costs before funds are made available to the agency to carry out \nthe designated program. We do not want the Postal Service using its own \nbudget to fund contributions to causes designated by semipostals. Only \nthe true net profit from the sale of the semipostals will be made \navailable to\n\n[[Page S7803]]\n\nthe appropriate agency. This bill also gives the Congress the power to \nreject a stamp proposal chosen by the Postal Service, if for example, \nthe stamp subject is deemed inappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that we are giving the authority to issue \nsemipostal stamps to the Postal Service, which is where these decisions \nbelong.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4029\n\n (Purpose: To grant the United States Postal Service the authority to \n            issue semipostal stamps, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate now proceed to the consideration of H.R. 3291.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3291) to provide for the settlement of water \n     rights claims of the Shivwits Band of the Paiute Tribe of \n     Utah, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will pass the Shivwits \nBand of the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah Water Rights Settlement Act and \nsend this legislation to the President. This is an important day for \nthe citizens of Washington County, Utah, and the members of the \nShivwits Band. This legislation will finally provide a settlement of \nwater rights issues of the Santa Clara\n\n[[Page S7804]]\n\nRiver in Washington County, the driest county in the second driest \nstate in the Union.\n  The Santa Clara is a fairly small river running through the Shivwits \nBand's reservation near the city of St. George, Utah. This water is \nshared by the Washington County, the Washington County Water \nConservancy District, St. George, the town of Ivins, the town of Santa \nClara, and the Shivwits Band. Last, but not least, Mr. President, this \nwater is also used by the Virgin Spinedace, an endangered fish species \nresiding in the river. This water settlement meets the needs of all of \nthese interested parties.\n  This legislation will also establish the St. George Water Reuse \nProject. This project will provide 2,000 acre-feet of water for the \nShivwits Band. It will also create the Santa Clara Project. This \nproject will provide a pressurized pipeline from the nearby Gunlock \nReservoir to deliver 1,900 acre-feet of water to the Shivwits Band.\n  I was pleased to be the sponsor of this bill in the Senate, and I \nwould like to express my deep appreciation to Chairman Campbell and \nVice Chairman Inouye of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee for their \noutstanding support for this legislation. Without their help and the \nhelp of their staffs, this legislation would not have progressed as \nsmoothly as it has. I also express my appreciation to my good friend, \nSenator Bennett, a cosponsor of this bill, for his support.\n  Finally, however, I want to give due credit to the Administration, \nthe local officials of Washington County, and the members of the \nShivwits Band for constructing this agreement. I am a firm believer in \na collaborative process and the inclusion of local officials and \ncitizens in it. I believe that legislation--both before and after \npassage--can be far more successful than when local input is missing \nfrom a bill's development.\n  Again, I want to thank all Senators for their support of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Their protection and \n     promotion is the first responsibility of government'';\n       Whereas in the 1991 Document of the Moscow Meeting of the \n     Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE, the \n     participating states ``categorically and irrevocably \n     declare[d] that the commitments undertaken in the field of \n     the human dimension of the CSCE are matters of direct and \n     legitimate concern to all participating States and do not \n     belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State \n     concerned'';\n       Whereas in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the \n     participating states committed themselves ``to build, \n     consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of \n     government of our nations'';\n       Whereas the 1999 Istanbul Charter for European Security and \n     Istanbul Summit Declaration note the particular challenges of \n     ending violence against women and children as well as sexual \n     exploitation and all forms of trafficking in human beings, \n     strengthening efforts to combat corruption, eradicating \n     torture, reinforcing efforts to end discrimination against \n     Roma and Sinti, and promoting democracy and respect for human \n     rights in Serbia;\n       Whereas the main challenge facing the participating states \n     remains the implementation of the principles and commitments \n     contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents \n     adopted on the basis of consensus;\n       Whereas the participating states have recognized that \n     economic liberty, social justice, and environmental \n     responsibility are indispensable for prosperity;\n       Whereas the participating states have committed themselves \n     to promote economic reforms through enhanced transparency for \n     economic activity with the aim of advancing the principles of \n     market economies;\n       Whereas the participating states have stressed the \n     importance of respect for the rule of law and of vigorous \n     efforts to fight organized crime and corruption, which \n     constitute a great threat to economic reform and prosperity;\n       Whereas OSCE has expanded the scope and substance of its \n     efforts, undertaking a variety of preventive diplomacy \n     initiatives designed to prevent, manage, and resolve conflict \n     within and among the participating states;\n       Whereas the politico-military aspects of security remain \n     vital to the interests of the participating states and \n     constitute a core element of OSCE's concept of comprehensive \n     security;\n       Whereas the OSCE has played an increasingly active role in \n     civilian police-related activities, including training, as an \n     integral part of OSCE's efforts in conflict prevention, \n     crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation; and\n       Whereas the participating states bear primary \n     responsibility for raising violations of the Helsinki Final \n     Act and other OSCE documents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress \n     calls upon the President to--\n       (1) issue a proclamation--\n       (A) recognizing the 25th anniversary of the signing of the \n     Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe;\n       (B) reasserting the commitment of the United States to full \n     implementation of the Helsinki Final Act;\n       (C) urging all signatory states to abide by their \n     obligations under the Helsinki Final Act; and\n       (D) encouraging the people of the United States to join the \n     President and the Congress in observance of this anniversary \n     with\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\n     appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities; and\n       (2) convey to all signatory states of the Helsinki Final \n     Act that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \n     democratic principles, economic liberty, and the \n     implementation of related commitments continue to be vital \n     elements in promoting a new era of democracy, peace, and \n     unity in the region covered by the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7805-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONDEMNING PREJUDICE AGAINST ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLAND ANCESTRY\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 346, \nintroduced earlier today, recognizing the achievement of the 1951 \nUniversity of San Francisco Dons football team and acknowledging the \nwrongful treatment endured by the team.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 346) acknowledging that the \n     undefeated and untied 1951 University of San Francisco Dons \n     football team suffered a grave injustice by not being invited \n     to any post-season Bowl game due to racial prejudice that \n     prevailed at the time and seeking appropriate recognition for \n     the surviving members of the championship team.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this past week, our nation and the world \nhave been privileged to witness two dramatic triumphs by American \nathletes. Lance Armstrong won his second consecutive Tour de France, \nand Tiger Woods became the youngest person ever to capture golf's Grand \nSlam by winning the British Open. These are truly historic \nachievements. Both men are deserving of all the praise and \ncongratulations they are receiving, not only for their exceptional \nperformances, but also for the dignified way they have represented \ntheir country and respective sports.\n  With the example of these modern day champions in mind, today I am \nintroducing a resolution to honor a similarly outstanding group of \nathletes from years ago.\n  The 1951 University of San Francisco football team, the Dons, went \nundefeated and untied. By almost any account, the Dons were among the \nmost gifted college football teams ever. Ten of the team's players were \ndrafted by the NFL. Of these, eight actually played professionally. Of \nthese, five played in a least one Pro Bowl. And of these five, three, \nBob St. Clair, Ollie Matson and Gino Marchetti, were inducted into the \nProfessional Football Hall of Fame.\n  But despite the team's irrefutable ability and qualifications, the \nDons were not invited to participate in any post season bowl games. The \nreason why the players and coaches were denied this once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to prove themselves as a team before a national audience is \nas simple as it is tragic. Two of the Dons' players Ollie Matson and \nBurl Toler, were African-American.\n  In 1951, it would have been expected of a team with the Dons record \nto compete for the national championship in the Orange Bowl. When an \ninvitation to this bowl did not materialize, everyone knew why. At this \ntime the unwritten but well understood rule was that bowl games were \nstrictly off limits to teams with African American players.\n  Although the Dons were not invited to play in the Orange Bowl, they \ndid receive an invitation to participate in another bowl game, The only \nhitch was that they would have to play without their two teammates. To \ntheir enduring credit, the team did not think twice about standing by \nOllie and Burl and emphatically rejected the offfer.\n  Refusing this offer was a heroic act, but not the only one for this \nteam. Several members of the squad fought in WWII and in the Korean \nWar.\n  Considered perhaps the best player on the team, Burl Toler suffered \nan injury during a college All Star game which prevented him from \njoining the NFL as a player. Instead, he went back to school, received \nhis master's degree, became the City of San Francisco's first black \nsecondary school principal, and later the director of services for the \nSan Francisco Community College District. He did this while also \nserving for 25 years as one of the NFL's most respected referees. In \nfact, Burl Toler was the NFL's first black official, a position offered \nto him by a fellow classmate at USF, former NFL Commissioner Pete \nRozelle.\n  Now almost 50 years later, I hope my colleagues will agree that it is \nentirely appropriate that this truly special collection of athletes \nreceive the national attention and accolades they once earned but were \ndenied. The resolution I will introduce today calls on the Senate to \nrecognize the team for its achievements on the field as well as the \nintegrity of players and coaches off it. It also calls on this body to \nacknowledge that the discriminatory treatment endured by the Dons and \nother teams and individuals at that time was flatly wrong.\n  With the Olympics approaching, and as we celebrate Lance Armstrong \nand Tiger Woods for their victories and the obstacles they and others \nhad to overcome for them to reach the pinnacle of their sports, I hope \nwe also make the effort to honor the 1951 USF Dons--a team whose \ncombination of talent and courage we may never see again.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Those opposed will rise and stand \nuntil counted.\n  On a division, two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in the \naffirmative, the resolution of ratification is agreed to.\n  The resolution of ratification agreed to is as follows:\n\n       Resolved (two-thirds of the Senators present concurring \n     therein),\n       That the Senate advise and consent to the ratification of \n     the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, adopted and \n     opened for signature at the Specialized Conference of the \n     Organization of American States (OAS) at Caracas, Venezuela, \n     on March 29, 1996, (Treaty Doc. 105-39); referred to in this \n     resolution of ratification as ``The Convention'', subject to \n     the understandings of subsection (a), the declaration of \n     subsection (b), and the provisos of subsection (c).\n       (a) Understandings.--The advice and consent of the Senate \n     is subject to the following understandings, which shall be \n     included in the instrument of ratification of the Convention \n     and shall be binding on the President:\n       (1) Application of article i.--The United States of America \n     understands that the phrase ``at any level of its hierarchy'' \n     in the first and second paragraphs of Article I of the \n     Convention refers, in the case of the United States, to all \n     levels of the hierarchy of the Federal Government of the \n     United States, and that the Convention does not impose \n     obligations with respect to the conduct of officials other \n     than Federal officials.\n       (2) Article vii (``Domestic Law'').--\n       (A) Article VII of the Convention sets forth an obligation \n     to adopt legislative measures to establish as criminal \n     offenses the acts of corruption described in Article VI(1). \n     There is an extensive network of laws already in place in the \n     United States that criminalize a wide range of corrupt acts. \n     Although United States laws may not in all cases be defined \n     in terms or elements identical to those used in the \n     Convention, it is the understanding of the United States, \n     with the caveat set forth in subparagraph (B), that the kinds \n     of official corruption which are intended under the \n     Convention to be criminalized would in fact be criminal \n     offenses under U.S. law. Accordingly, the United States does \n     not intend to enact new legislation to implement Article VII \n     of the Convention.\n       (B) There is no general ``attempt'' statute in U.S. federal \n     criminal law. Nevertheless, federal statutes make \n     ``attempts'' criminal in connection with specific crimes. \n     This is of particular relevance with respect to Article \n     VI(1)(c) of the Convention, which by its literal terms would \n     embrace a single preparatory act done with the requisite \n     ``purpose'' of profiting illicitly at some future time, even \n     though the course of conduct is neither pursued, nor in any \n     sense consummated. The United States will not criminalize \n     such conduct per se, although significant acts of corruption \n     in this regard would be generally subject to prosecution in \n     the context of one or more other crimes.\n       (3) Transnational bribery.--Current United States law \n     provides criminal sanctions for transnational bribery. \n     Therefore, it is the understanding of the United States of \n     America that no additional legislation is needed for the \n     United States to comply with the obligation imposed in \n     Article VIII of the Convention.\n       (4) Illicit enrichment.--The United States of America \n     intends to assist and cooperate with other States Parties \n     pursuant to paragraph 3 of Article IX of the Convention to \n     the extent permitted by its domestic law. The United States \n     recognizes the importance of combating improper financial \n     gains by public officials, and has criminal statutes to deter \n     or punish such conduct. These statutes obligate senior-level \n     officials in the federal government to file truthful \n     financial disclosure statements, subject to criminal \n     penalties. They also permit prosecution of federal public \n     officials who evade taxes on wealth that is acquired \n     illicitly. The offense of illicit enrichment as set forth in \n     Article IX of the Convention, however, places the burden of \n     proof on the defendant, which is inconsistent with the United \n     States Constitution and fundamental principles of the United \n     States legal system. Therefore, the United States understands \n     that it is not obligated to establish a new criminal offense \n     of illicit enrichment under Article IX of the Convention.\n       (5) Extradition.--The United States of America shall not \n     consider this Convention as the legal basis for extradition \n     to any country with which the United States has no bilateral \n     extradition treaty in force. In such cases where the United \n     States does not have a bilateral extradition treaty in force, \n     that bilateral extradition treaty shall serve as the legal \n     basis for extradition for offenses that are extraditable in \n     accordance with this Convention.\n       (6) Prohibition assistance to the international criminal \n     court.--The United States of America shall exercise its \n     rights to limit the use of assistance it provides under the \n     Convention so that any assistance provided by the Government \n     of the United States shall not be transferred to or otherwise \n     used to assist the International Criminal Court agreed to in \n     Rome, Italy, on July 17, 1998, unless the treaty establishing \n     the Court has entered into force for the United States by and \n     with the advice and consent of the Senate, as required by \n     Article II, section 2 of the United States Constitution.\n       (b) Declaration.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following declaration:\n       Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in Condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and Condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the Document Agreed Among \n     the State Parties to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces \n     in Europe, approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (c) Provisos.--The advice and consent of the Senate is \n     subject to the following provisos:\n       (1) Enforcement and monitoring.--Not later than April 1, \n     2001, and annually thereafter for five years, unless extended \n     by an Act of Congress, the President shall submit to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives, a report that sets out:\n       (A) Ratification.--A list of the countries that have \n     ratified the Convention, the dates of ratification and entry \n     into force for each country, and a detailed account of U.S. \n     efforts to encourage other nations that are signatories to \n     the Convention to ratify and implement it.\n       (B) Domestic legislation implementing the convention and \n     actions to advance its object and purpose.--A description of \n     the domestic laws enacted by each Party to the Convention \n     that implement commitments under the Convention and actions \n     taken by each Party during the previous year, including \n     domestic law enforcement measures, to advance the object and \n     purpose of the Convention.\n       (C) Progress at the organization of american states on a \n     monitoring process.--An assessment of progress in the \n     Organization of American States (OAS) toward creation of an \n     effective, transparent, and viable Convention compliance \n     monitoring process which includes input from the private \n     sector and non-governmental organizations.\n       (D) Future negotiations.--A description of the anticipated \n     future work of the Parties to the Convention to expand its \n     scope and assess other areas where the Convention could be \n     amended to decrease corrupt activities.\n       (2) Mutual legal assistance.--When the United States \n     receives a request for assistance under Article XIV of the \n     Convention from a country with which it has in force a \n     bilateral treaty for mutual legal assistance in criminal \n     matters, the bilateral treaty will provide the legal basis \n     for responding to that request. In any case of assistance \n     sought from the United States under Article XIV of the \n     Convention, the United States shall, consistent with U.S. \n     laws, relevant treaties and arrangements, deny assistance \n     where granting the assistance sought would prejudice its \n     essential public policy interest, including cases where the \n     Central Authority, after consultation with all appropriate \n     intelligence, anti-narcotic, and foreign policy agencies, has \n     specific information that a senior government official who \n     will have access to information to be provided under this \n     Convention is engaged in a felony, including the facilitation \n     of the production or distribution of illegal drugs.\n       (3) Supremacy of the Constitution.--Nothing in the \n     Convention requires or authorizes legislation or other action \n     by the United States of America that is prohibited by the \n     Constitution of the United States as interpreted by the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7809-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7809-S7810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 106-38\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Upon entry into force, the Treaty will replace the \noutdated Extradition Treaty between the Government of the United \nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the \nUnited States of America, signed at London, June 8, 1972, entered into \nforce on October 21, 1976, and made applicable to Belize on January 21, \n1977. That Treaty continued in force for Belize following independence. \nThis Treaty will, upon entry into force, enhance cooperation between \nthe law enforcement communities of the two countries.

The Treaty was signed at \nWashington on June 9, 2000. The report of the Department of State is \nalso enclosed for the information of the Senate.\n  The purpose of the Treaty is to establish a continental shelf \nboundary in the western Gulf of Mexico beyond the outer limits of the \ntwo countries' exclusive economic zones where those limits do not \noverlap. The approximately 135-nautical-mile continental shelf boundary \nruns in a general east-west direction.

Throughout the history of our Nation, the Army \nChaplaincy has dedicated itself to enriching our soldiers' spiritual \nlives and ensuring the free exercise of religion.\n  Many Chaplains and Chaplain Assistants have demonstrated their love \nfor their fellow soldiers by risking their lives so that their comrades \nmight live. I would like to acknowledge these dedicated individuals who \nhave gallantly served in the Army Chaplaincy, and who continue to \nselflessly minister in the face of adversity, uncertainty, and anxiety \nso that soldiers might be brought closer to God. By their sacrifices, \nChaplains and Chaplain Assistants have proven themselves in both peril \nand peace to love our soldiers, our Army, and our Nation above \nthemselves. For this, our Nation is grateful. Again, I congratulate the \nUnited States Army Chaplains Corps for 225 years of loyal service and \npray that it will continue to serve our Army until nations shall beat \ntheir swords into plowshares and war shall cease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7810-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7810-S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE HORRIBLE VIOLENCE IN INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an urgent issue \nof great concern to me. Over the past eighteen months, terrible \nviolence has occurred and is still taking place in Indonesia's Moluccan \n(Maluku) Islands, focused in the provincial capital of Ambon, and no \nend is in sight. In this Indonesian province, religious conflict \nbetween Christians and Muslims has led to the loss of up to 10,000 \nlives and the displacement of up to 500,000 people. To my great dismay, \nthe Indonesian government has had little success in protecting \nChristians. In the Moluccas in the last two years almost 10,000 \nbuildings and churches have been burnt and mass killings go largely \nunpunished.\n  Since, the situation has intensified with the arrival of members of \nthe Laskar (Jihad) Force. The Laskar Jihad is a group of over 2,000 \nMuslim militants who sailed to the Moluccas from the main island of \nJava. Efforts by the United States to keep this group out was in vain. \nIndonesia adhered to her open inter-island immigration policy and the \ngroup was allowed to go to the Moluccas. Due to internal political \nunrest and continuing economic depression, the police forces and \nmilitary are unable or unwilling to restore order. The necessity to \nbring the populace under the rule of law and order has intensified due \nto some reports that the Muslim Jihad Force has given the Christians in \nthe city of Ambon until July 31st to vacate the city. If they do not \nleave in compliance with this ultimatum, they probably will be \nmurdered.\n  Mr. President, the Molucca islands, known previously as the Spice \nIslands, have had a long history of contact and trade with Europe. The \nSpice Islands\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nwere greatly valued for their nutmeg and clove production. Due to this \nprolonged and extensive contact, the Moluccas have a much higher \npercentage of Christians than other parts of Indonesia. Indonesian \nPresident Abdurrahaman Wahid supports a policy of tolerance between the \ntwo religions, but such cooperation is not forthcoming. A history of \nheavy-handed authoritarianism, practiced by the Indonesian military \nunder ex-President Suharto, resulted in the suppression of a range of \ndisputes between the two groups. When Suharto's rule collapsed, these \narguments were vented, and sectarian violence soon erupted. The spark \ncame in January of 1999, the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan, when a \nminor incident on Ambon led to 160 deaths and villages burned to the \nground. The violence escalated leading to a greater frequency of \nkillings and the destruction of churches and mosques. To further \ncomplicate this horrendous situation, the military has not acted \nconsistently neutral in this conflict, aiding Muslims militants against \nthe Christians in several disturbing instances. The situation is \ndesperate.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank our Secretary of State, Ms. \nMadeline Albright, for her continuing work with the Indonesian \ngovernment to alleviate this horrible religious strife in Indonesia. It \nis important for the United States to vigilantly and immediately \npressure the Indonesian government to continue to take steps to restore \ncivil order, foster dialogue between the Christians and the Muslims, \nand help the communities find a way to peacefully coexist. The U.S. \nalso needs to press Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri to find both \nshort-term and long-term solutions to this problem--for she has \nexpressly been given this task. In addition, the State Department must \ncontinue its push to let humanitarian workers and the United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) into the Moluccas to \nalleviate some of the human suffering that is occurring as a result of \nthe warfare. The Indonesian government has taken several positive steps \ntowards ending the violence, including the appointment of a Hindu to \nhead the police forces in the area. This nomination, as a gesture of \nnon-partisanship, was a great stride in the right direction. However, \nwe must work to ensure that all actions taken by the police and the \nmilitary are fair, even-handed, and contribute to stopping the \nviolence. Indonesia has also, to my pleasure, recently mounted a \ncampaign to eject the Jihad Force from the Moluccas. This development \nshould alleviate some of the violence, but the basic problems remain \nunsolved. The government of Indonesia must do more. In addition, the \nUnited States must continue to immediately press for a solution to this \nbloody situation in the hopes of establishing a peace and stability \nthat would end the persecution of Christians in the Moluccans. Thank \nyou.\n\n\n                        EAST TIMOR AND INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ncontinuing crisis in Indonesia and East Timor.\n  Earlier this week, a peacekeeper from New Zealand, Leonard William \nManning, was killed while tracking a group of men whom senior officials \nin Timor have identified as militia members who had crossed into East \nTimor from Indonesia. Private Manning was serving the cause of peace, \nhis death is tragic, and I want to take this opportunity to express my \nsympathy to his family.\n  In the wake of this incident, the United Nations Security Council and \nthe ASEAN Regional Forum have called on Indonesia to disband and disarm \nthe militias operating in the refugee camps of West Timor, and to stop \nthe militias' cross-border incursions into East Timor. But Mr. \nPresident, this call has echoed around the world for months now. It is \na call that has gone unheeded.\n  The activities of Indonesian militias threaten the stability of \nIndonesia, the safety of peacekeepers and humanitarian workers, and the \nbasic human rights of Indonesians and East Timorese. It was the \nmilitia, Mr. President, that waged a brutal campaign of violence and \ndestruction immediately after East Timor's vote for independence last \nyear. It was the militia that enjoyed the direct support of the \nIndonesian military throughout that operation. And it is the militia \nthat continues to operate in the refugee camps of West Timor, where the \nmost vulnerable East Timorese are subjected to threats and \nintimidation. It is the militia that has forced UNHCR to suspend \noperations in West Timor after a series of violent assaults on its \nstaff.\n  I believe that many in the Indonesian government, including President \nWahid, want to stop the militia violence and to end the intimidation in \nthe refugee camps. But they are unable to make this happen, because too \nmany people in powerful positions in Indonesia remain unwilling to make \nit happen. And that, Mr. President, is all that this country needs to \nknow when the question of resuming military relations with Indonesia \ncomes up.\n  Ominous reports of a deeply disturbing relationship between the \nIndonesian military and the militias continue to pour out of the \nregion. Peacekeepers on the ground in East Timor have noted that the \ngroup that attacked Private Manning appeared to have benefitted from \nserious and significant military training. At one point recently, UNHCR \npersonnel witnessed militiamen beat a refugee from East Timor and rob \nseveral others while a 70-strong Indonesian military detachment \nwitnessed the incident but did not intervene.\n\n  And it's not just Timor, Mr. President. In the Moluccas, where \nsectarian violence has risen to such alarming levels that many have \npondered international intervention, reliable reports indicate the \nIndonesian military has been complicit in the conflict, and has even \nprovided support to certain factions. In Papua, or Irian Jaya, militia \ngroups have already taken violent action against community leaders.\n  The simple and unfortunate facts, Mr. President, are that a power \nstruggle continues in Indonesia, between those committed to a \nresponsible and professional military operating under civilian control, \nand those who would cling to the abusive patterns of the past. I have \nintroduced a bill, the East Timor Repatriation and Security Act of \n2000, which would codify a suspension of military and security \nrelations with and assistance to Indonesia until certain conditions are \nmet. This legislation would permit military and security programs from \nJ-CETS to military sales to resume only when the President determines \nand submits a report to the appropriate congressional committees that \nthe Government of Indonesia and the Indonesian Armed Forces are doing \nthe following--\n  Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed \nforces and militia groups against whom there is credible evidence of \nhuman rights violations;\n  Taking effective measures to bring to justice members of the armed \nforces against whom there is credible evidence of aiding or abetting \nmilitia groups;\n  Allowing displaced persons and refugees to return home to East Timor, \nincluding providing safe passage for refugees returning from West \nTimor;\n  Not impeding the activities of the United Nations Transitional \nAuthority in East Timor;\n  Demonstrating a commitment to preventing incursions into East Timor \nby members of militia groups in West Timor; and\n  Demonstrating a commitment to accountability by cooperating with \ninvestigations and prosecutions of members of the Indonesian Armed \nForces and military groups responsible for human rights violations in \nIndonesia and East Timor.\n  These certainly are not unreasonable conditions. They work in favor \nof the forces of reform within Indonesia. And by linking military and \nsecurity assistance to these benchmarks, Congress will ensure that the \nU.S. relationship with Jakarta avoids the mistakes of the past, and \nthat U.S. foreign policy comes closer to reflecting our core national \nvalues.\n  But recent events make it crystal clear that these conditions have \nnot yet been met. Mr. President, the U.S. must continue to insist on \nthem. In the pursuit of justice, in the pursuit of stability, and in \nsupport of the forces of reform, this country cannot send a signal that \nwhere we are today is somehow good enough. Again, Mr. President, I add \nmy voice to the chorus, because U.S., Indonesian, and Timorese\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\ninterests all demand that the militias be stopped and that the military \nmust be united in the pursuit of professionalism, accountability, and \ncivilian control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7812-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE CLASS ACTION FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to today announce my support for S. \n353, the Class Action Fairness Act, just reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee, and announced my intention to complement this legislation by \nintroducing legislation soon that will require lawyers representing \nplaintiffs in class actions to make preliminary disclosures estimating \nthe anticipated attorneys' fee, and an explanation of the relative \nrecoveries that both the attorney and class action clients can expect \nto receive if the claim is settled or decided favorably. My \ncosponsorship of the Class Action Fairness Act and intention to \nintroduce my own legislation is prompted by some high profile class \naction case settlements that have generated a great deal of \ncontroversy. Labeled ``coupon'' settlements, these agreements have \ninvolved the class action claimants receiving coupons for discounts on \nlater purchases of goods or services while the attorneys representing \nthe class walk away with literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, or \neven millions of dollars, in fees. Often these coupons are for \ndiscounts on the same item rejected by the claimants in the class \naction.\n  For instance, several years ago many of the nation's airlines were \nsued based upon a claim that they had fixed prices. A database that the \nairlines were using to communicate fares to the travel industry was \nsuspected of being used to compare and fix fares, and a Justice \nDepartment antitrust investigation thus ensued. The Justice Department \nsubsequently filed a civil antitrust suit in 1992 and settled the case \nin 1994. But firms specializing in class action cases also brought \ntheir own civil suits against the airlines on behalf of air travelers. \nIn fact, 37 firms were involved on the plaintiff side of the \nlitigation.\n  A settlement was eventually reached that provided $438 million worth \nof coupons to an unknown number of passengers, while the legal fees to \nplaintiffs' attorneys amounted to $16 million. In other words, the \npassengers got coupons, and the lawyers got cash. You may be thinking \nthat $438 million in coupons sounds like a pretty generous amount of \ndiscounts for the passengers, but the details indicate otherwise. Each \ncoupon was good for only a 10 percent maximum discount off an air fare. \n4.2 million air travelers recovered between $73 and $140 in coupons, \nbut, again, any one coupon was only good for 10 percent of the actual \nfare.\n  One particularly revealing fact about this settlement was that one \nairline that had not been named as a defendant actually asked to be \njoined in the suit as a defendant because they saw the promotional \nvalue of all these coupons going to air travelers. So what ostensibly \nwas a high stakes civil action degenerated into a promotional tool for \nthe airlines, a negligible recovery for the class members, and a \nfinancial boon for the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n  It's not difficult to foresee the possibility of collusion between \nplaintiffs' and defendants' attorneys when the plaintiff attorneys can \nget huge fees and defendants can eliminate the risk of a large \njudgment. It obviously is an attractive option to a defendant to settle \na case and pay large fees to a small number of people--specifically the \nattorneys--and avoid the risk of protracted litigation and lawyers \nseeking a jackpot recovery. Attorneys have a fiduciary duty to \nrepresent the best interests of their clients, but it's clear that in \nthe cases of coupon settlement usually the primary interest served is \ntheir own.\n  So we now have a problem of plaintiff attorneys searching for causes \nfor which they can bring suit, and then representing anonymous clients \nthat they don't know and to which they have no accountability. In fact, \nmany members of a class in a class action don't even know they are \nbeing represented. The windfall profits to attorneys has prompted a \ndeluge of these type of suits, and recent studies indicate that in the \nlast 36 months, some companies have faced a 300 to 1000% increase in \nthe number of class actions filed against them. And you know the \nproblem has gotten bad when the president of the Association of Trial \nLawyers of America comes out against coupon settlements.\n  The problem of coupon settlements has been manifested primarily in \nstate courts. Federal court judges generally, to their credit, have \nbeen more vigilant in policing such ``sweetheart settlements.'' The \nproblem of the proliferation of this type of litigation in state courts \nprompted Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The Judiciary recently \nmarked up the Class Action Fairness Act, which moves many of these \nlarge, multi-state claims to the federal courts where they belong. Many \nof the class action trial lawyers have worked the system to keep their \nclaims in state court, where they know there is not the expertise nor \nstaff to handle the issues, and which provides them advantages over the \ndefendant. The bill also requires the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates to recommend best practices the courts can use to ensure \nsettlements are fair to the class members, that attorneys fees are \nappropriate, and that the class members are the primary beneficiaries \nof the settlement.\n\n  I believe that these are important reforms, and I want to take the \nreforms a step further by requiring attorneys in class action cases to \nmake an up-front disclosure about the prospects for success and also \ngive information about attorneys' fees and individual class member \nrecovery in the event of a successful conclusion to the suit. If \npotential class members are likely to receive only a small fraction of \nwhat their attorney would receive, or perhaps a coupon which they may \nor may not end up using, then they need to be appraised of that fact \nfrom the start. These types of disclosures will at least put the \npotential class members on notice that perhaps the attorneys don't have \nsome noble pursuit of justice in mind as much as they do getting a \nquick settlement that will net them huge profits, while the clients \nthey ostensibly are trying to assist receive little or nothing.\n  Again, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of S. 343, and look \nforward to introducing my own legislation to combat this abuse of our \nlegal system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7812-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I often hear from members of the public who \nfeel that the United States is spending too much on ``foreign aid.'' \nWhy are we sending so much money abroad, they ask, when we have so many \nproblems here at home?\n  This concerns me a great deal, because it has been shown over and \nover again that most Americans mistakenly believe that 15 percent of \nour national budget goes to foreign aid. In fact it is about 1 percent. \nThe other 99 percent goes for our national defense and to fund other \ndomestic programs--to build roads, support farmers, protect the \nenvironment, build schools and hospitals, pay for law enforcement, and \ncountless other things the governments does.\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\n  The United States has by far the largest economy in the world. We are \nunquestionably the wealthiest country. The amount we spend on foreign \naid totals only a few dollars per American per year.\n  What does the rest of the world look like?\n  Imagine, for a moment, if the world's population were shrunk to a \npopulation of 100 people, with the current ratios staying the same. Of \nthose 100 people, 57 would be Asians. There would be 21 Europeans. \nFourteen would be from North and South America. Eight would be \nAfricans.\n  Of those 100 people, 52 would be women, and 48 would be men. Seventy \nwould be non-White, and 30 would be White. Seventy would be non-\nChristian, and 30 would be Christian.\n  Six people would possess 59 percent of the world's wealth, and all 6 \nwould be Americans. Think about that.\n  Fifty people--one half of the population, would suffer from \nmalnutrition. 80 out of 100 would live in substandard housing, often \nwithout safe water to drink.\n  Seventy would be illiterate. Only 1 would have a college education. \nAnd only 1 would own a computer.\n  Are we spending too much on foreign aid? These statistics put things \nin perspective. I would suggest that there are two reasons to conclude \nthat not only are we not spending too much, we are not spending enough.\n  First, we are a wealthy country--far wealthier than any other. Yes we \nhave problems. Serious problems. But they pale in comparison to the \ndeprivation endured by over a billion of the world's people who live in \nextreme poverty, with incomes of less than $1 per day. Like other \nindustrialized countries, we have a moral responsibility to help.\n  Second, it is often said, but worth repeating, that our economy and \nour security are closely linked to the global economy and to the \nsecurity of other countries. Although we call it foreign aid, it isn't \njust about helping others. These programs help us.\n  By raising incomes in poor countries we create new markets for \nAmerican exports, the fastest growing sector of our economy.\n  Raising incomes abroad also reduces pressure on people to flee their \nown countries in search of a better life. One example that is close to \nhome is Mexico, where half the population survives on an income of $2 \nper day. Every day, thousands of people cross illegally from Mexico \ninto the United States, putting enormous strains on U.S. law \nenforcement.\n  Foreign aid programs support our democratic allies. There are few \nexamples in history of a democracy waging war against another \ndemocracy.\n  These programs protect the environment and public health, by stopping \nair and water pollution, and combating the spread of infectious \ndiseases that are only an airplane flight away from our shores.\n  They help deter the proliferation of weapons, including nuclear, \nbiological and chemical weapons.\n  These are but a few examples of how ``foreign aid'' creates jobs here \nat home, and protects American interests abroad.\n  The American people need to know what we do with our foreign aid, and \nwhy in an increasingly interdependent world the only superpower should \nbe doing more to protect our interests around the world, not less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7813-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7813-S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CHANGE OF COMMAND FOR THE CHIEF OF NAVAL OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. president, on July 21, 2000 our colleague Senator \nJohn McCain delivered an address at the Change of Command ceremony were \nAdmiral Jay Johnson stepped down from his distinguished career to be \nsucceeded by Admiral Vern Clark as the 27th Chief of Naval Operations.\n  I was privileged to be present, together with Roberta McCain, Senator \nMcCain's mother, to listen to his stirring remarks to our Navy-Marine \nCorps men and women-both present and serving throughout the world in \nthe cause of freedom. Our colleague has a long and distinguished career \nin and with our military. His heartfelt delivery was genuine and his \nmessage was inspirational. I ask unanimous consent that his remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Senator John McCain Speech for CNO Retirement July 21, 2000\n\n       Thank you, Admiral Johnson, Secretary Cohen, Secretary \n     Danzig, General Shelton, Admiral Clark, the Joint Chiefs, \n     Medal of Honor recipients, members of Congress, members of \n     the Naval Academy Board of Visitors, distinguished flag and \n     general officers of the U.S. and Allied Forces, guests, \n     families and friends. And thank you, midshipmen of the Class \n     of 2004.\n       I am greatly honored to be here today, and to participate \n     in this wonderful ceremony as the men and women of the United \n     States Navy officially welcome their new Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Admiral Vernon Clark, and say farewell and thank \n     you to the man who has led you so well for more than four \n     years, my good friend, Admiral Jay Johnson.\n       It has never been enough that an officer of the Navy should \n     be a capable mariner. He must be that, of course, but also a \n     great deal more. He should be, and I quote, ``a gentleman of \n     liberal education, refined manners, punctilious courtesy, and \n     the nicest sense of personal honor.'' End quote.\n       For those of you who know your plebe rates, you recognize \n     that those words were written by a man who is buried here at \n     the Naval Academy, underneath the Chapel dome. John Paul \n     Jones had a clear vision for the qualifications of a Naval \n     Officer over 220 years ago, qualifications that Admiral \n     Johnson and Admiral Clark not only meet, but exceed.\n       Admiral Johnson and I have known each other for a long \n     time. We both served on the USS ORISKANY during the Vietnam \n     War. He flew an F8 Crusader in two combat cruises, trying to \n     finish the war so those of us who weren't as good a pilot as \n     he was could come home a little earlier. And for that I am \n     extremely grateful!\n       Of the many lessons I learned from Vietnam, one that I \n     value highly is the realization that although Americans have \n     fought valiantly in many noble causes, we are not assured \n     that the battle will always be necessary or the field well-\n     chosen. In the end, Americans at war, professional and \n     conscript alike, always find their honor in their answer, if \n     not their summons. My friend, Admiral Johnson found much \n     honor in his answer to our country's call to arms.\n       In better times, Admiral Johnson and I again worked \n     together on behalf of the service we both want to see \n     succeed. As a member of Congress, I have admired his meteoric \n     rise as an Air Wing, Battle Group, Joint Task Force and Fleet \n     Commander. As the Vice Chief and then Chief of Naval \n     Operations, Jay's frank counsel on issues affecting the \n     defense of our country has been of great value to me, and \n     other members of Congress.\n       Applying his philosophy that emphasizes Operational \n     Primacy, Leadership, Teamwork and Pride, Admiral Johnson has \n     guided the Navy for the past four years, skillfully balancing \n     mandated reductions in force with dramatically increased \n     operational tasking.\n       He has been a champion of reform. He improved the Inter-\n     Deployment Training Cycle--the period between deployments--\n     the largest quality-of-life initiative of the past decade, by \n     reducing at-sea time and ensuring that sailors could spend \n     more time in port with their families. His improvements \n     included empowering the Navy's commanding officers by \n     removing redundant inspections and burdensome paperwork and \n     raising morale among the sailors, while giving commanders the \n     opportunity to truly lead their ships, squadrons, submarines \n     and SEAL teams.\n       Admiral Johnson also led the Joint Chiefs of Staff in \n     calling for the largest personnel pay increases in the past \n     decade. He was the first Chief to step forward and support \n     food stamp relief for our most needy sailors, soldiers, \n     airmen, and marines. In addition, he led the charge for Pay \n     Table Reform, which increased our sailors' pay beginning this \n     month. He was instrumental in restoring full retirement pay \n     for military retirees, and in pushing for larger increases in \n     annual military pay raises. The dramatic improvements in this \n     years' defense authorization bill, which passed the Senate \n     last week are, in large part, due to Jay Johnson's influence.\n       The men and women he has commanded have responded to his \n     outstanding leadership by performing superbly themselves in \n     combat in Iraq and the Balkans. They have kept the peace and \n     have won the wars, and for that, we are forever indebted to \n     our sailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines and to people \n     like Admiral Clark who has been involved in every Navy \n     conflict over the past 32 years.\n       Admiral Johnson's skill in working with people clearly \n     reflects his close family relationships. This year, Admiral \n     Johnson was aptly deemed Father of the Year by the National \n     Father's Day Committee.\n       The Class of 1968 has asked me to announce at today's \n     ceremony that they have chosen Admiral Jay Johnson to be the \n     honoree of the Class of 1968 Leadership Award that will endow \n     a gift to the Superintendent of the Naval Academy for the \n     Leadership and Ethics Curriculum. Congratulations Jay.\n       Admiral Clark, we welcome you and Connie to the helm of \n     this great Navy. I am confident that the Navy will continue \n     to flourish under your leadership.\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n     You have already demonstrated that the key to your strength \n     as a leader is in supporting the people of the U.S. Navy. I \n     was heartened to hear you openly back programs like food \n     stamp relief for service members, and testify at your Senate \n     confirmation hearing this spring about the sailors that, I \n     quote,\n       ``We know that nothing is impossible with them. We can't do \n     readiness. We can't successfully complete missions. No, we \n     can't be victorious without them. And so nothing is more \n     important to me than them.'' End quote.\n       The Navy has selected an outstanding 27th Chief of Naval \n     Operations, another Vietnam combat veteran, a Destroyer-man \n     who brings an outstanding breadth of command and joint \n     leadership. Admiral, it is clear that you are more than \n     capable of continuing the strong, insightful leadership \n     provided by Admiral Johnson, leadership which will be \n     required to guide the Navy with the vigilance and courage \n     needed to implement reforms.\n       Forty-five years ago this August, when I was a youngster at \n     the academy, I stood in Dahlgren Hall to hear the words of \n     Admiral Arleigh Burke as he became the New Chief of Naval \n     Operations. He went on to serve an unprecedented, \n     distinguished three terms as CNO.\n       The uncertainties and challenges of the age we live in \n     stand in stark contrast to the moment in which Admiral \n     Arleigh Burke summoned his destroyer squadron and ordered \n     them into battle against a superior Japanese fleet. They had \n     to attack at the Bougainville coast to protect the landings \n     in progress at Empress Augusta Bay. Defeat--a mathematical \n     probability if not certainty--would have led to a loss of the \n     battle and left vulnerable nearly all naval defenses of the \n     Southern Pacific.\n       What compelled Admiral Burke to take what seemed such a \n     desperate gamble by committing the little ships of Destroyer \n     Squadron 23, the Little Beavers, against the immense strength \n     of the Japanese fleet? What explains his firm faith in the \n     reliability of the intelligence upon which he based the \n     supposition of his ships and his confidence in the men who \n     would command them in battle? How was he sure that the \n     Americans whom he ordered into harm's way would obey his \n     orders and reward his trust with such courage and \n     resourcefulness?\n       He believed in his people. He believed in their courage and \n     their ability. He knew that they, like he, were empowered by \n     the justice of their cause, by a love of America expressed in \n     action, and in sacrifice. Trust, derived from his \n     appreciation of his countrymen's virtues, and his wisdom and \n     confidence about how they would discharge their duties in a \n     desperate battle was the essence of Admiral Burke's \n     extraordinary leadership.\n       By memorializing Admiral Burke, we memorialize the very \n     finest virtues of our blessed country. We also pay tribute to \n     the attributes of leadership embodied in the service of \n     Admiral Johnson and Admiral Clark, attributes that are \n     reflected in their actions to support the men and women under \n     their command.\n       The greatness of our destiny rests in the hands of every \n     man and woman blessed to call America home. That's why \n     Admiral Johnson has taken so seriously his responsibilities \n     to his sailors. He knew that together they shared equally in \n     the honor of defending a great nation. Admiral, you will be \n     the first to direct all praise to the men and women under \n     your command. But I know that they would direct it back to \n     you--the man at the helm.\n       Jay, you have served your Navy and your nation well. I want \n     to thank you and Garland for your many years of exemplary \n     service to America, and bid you fair winds and following \n     seas, for I know we will see you again. I know you will find \n     new ways to serve the Navy and America, and I will always \n     rely on your wise counsel.\n       Admiral Clark and Connie, congratulations and welcome. I am \n     confident that you will both distinguish the noble tradition \n     you inherit today. Admiral, I look forward to working with \n     you as you lead the Navy toward its always magnificent \n     destiny.\n       I would like to close by speaking directly to the women and \n     men of the U.S. Navy. As we stand here this morning, our \n     sailors are risking their lives above, on, and below the \n     ocean.\n       But this risk is not without reward--the reward of serving \n     a cause greater than one's own self-interest. I commend your \n     service in the Navy. I hold the Navy closer to my heart than \n     any other human institution that I have ever been a part of--\n     save my family. The Navy for many years was the only world I \n     knew. It is still the world I know best and love most.\n       I trust in your willingness and ability to uphold the honor \n     of your Navy and your country, for I have seen the best of \n     America in my travels over the last year and know that \n     America deeply appreciates your service. I recognize that we \n     still have many miles to sail to ensure that you are properly \n     rewarded for your continued sacrifice and service to our \n     nation.\n       Make the most of these days, for you will never forget the \n     honor of your service in this Navy. Nor will your country \n     forget the honor you gave her in seas where so many \n     Americans, like Admiral Burke and Admiral Johnson, fought for \n     the love of their country. Admiral Johnson, I thank you for \n     the honor of inviting me to return to a place I love so well. \n     Admiral Clark, I offer my best wishes and look forward to \n     working with you. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7814-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     GUN DEATHS AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this week we received some positive news \nfrom the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center \nfor Health Statistics. According to newly released statistics, firearm \ndeaths among young people decreased in 1998.\n  The new report shows that firearm deaths among children and \nadolescents under 20 dropped 10 percent--from 4,223 in 1997 to 3,792 in \n1998. Perhaps even more significant, in 1998, deaths among young people \nwere down 35 percent since 1994, when firearms led to the deaths of \n5,833 young people.\n  It is no coincidence that firearm casualties have been reduced by 35 \npercent since 1994, the year the Brady Law went in to effect. The Brady \nLaw, which requires licensed firearms sellers to conduct criminal \nbackground checks on prospective gun purchasers, has successfully kept \nguns out of the hands of hundreds of thousands of criminals and youths.\n  Although we can rejoice that fewer youths are subject to the danger \nof guns, we should still be dismayed that 10 of our young people (on \naverage) die from guns every day. 10 children and adolescents as well \nas 74 adult Americans suffered gun-related deaths daily in 1998, and \nthat is far too many.\n  Congress must do more to protect our children and loved ones from \nthese gun tragedies. We can start by strengthening the Brady Law by \nclosing the gun show loophole. That loophole allows perpetrators of \nviolent crimes to buy guns from non-licensed or private sellers, who \nare not required to conduct criminal background checks. This loophole \nundermines the successes of Brady by arming those who would otherwise \nnot be permitted to purchase firearms. In May of 1999, the Senate \npassed legislation to close this loophole by extending criminal \nbackground checks to guns sold at gun shows and pawn shops, but \nopponents of this common sense provision have kept it from becoming \nlaw.\n  It is disheartening to know that Congress has not yet passed sensible \ngun laws--laws designed to protect American lives. Without addressing \nthis issue, America will continue to lose 10 young people a day to \nguns, and that is 10 too many.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7814-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7814-S7816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             A COMPILATION OF INFORMATION ON ETHANOL ETHERS\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr President, I would like to note the release of a \nrecent publication that all members of Congress should read. This new \npublication was produced by the Clean Fuels Development Coalition and \nit includes a presentation of facts about ethanol-based ethers.\n  As we attempt to deal with the water contamination problems resulting \nfrom leaking underground storage tanks, much of the debate is focusing \non methanol-based ethers, i.e. MTBE. While MTBE has played an important \nrole in reducing ozone throughout the U.S., the problems of water \ncontamination have lead many to advocate limiting or even banning this \nproduct.\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\n During this debate a few of our colleagues have expressed confusion \nabout the technical characteristics of ethanol-based ethers, like ETBE. \nSome have assumed that ethanol-based ethers have characteristics \nidentical to MTBE. As both the Senate and House examine this issue, it \nis important to be aware of the significant differences between the two \nproducts.\n  For example, ethanol is a renewable, biodegradable product. When \nconverted into ether, ETBE has many favorable characteristics in terms \nof the way it reacts in soil, water, and air, when compared to MTBE. In \nthe event ETBE escapes into the atmosphere or our water supplies, it \ncan be cleaned up much more efficiently than MTBE. ETBE is far less \npersistent than MTBE and remediation technologies have shown to be very \neffective.\n  Understanding the attributes of ETBE is also important at a time when \nevery citizen is painfully aware of our dependence on imported \npetroleum and the relationship of supply and price. It may be possible \nto use ETBE in volumes up to 22 percent in gasoline. This addition of a \nclean, domestic fuel could significantly impact our gasoline supply \nsituation, particularly in our most heavily populated and polluted \nurban areas.\n  I have long been a supporter of ETBE and while there are a number of \ntechnical and market challenges remaining before this fuel reaches full \ncommercialization, its promise is undeniable. The petroleum industry, \nenvironmental groups, ethanol producers, and the auto industry have \nlong recognized the superior qualities of ETBE. For that promise to be \nrealized we need to ensure that ETBE is not included in any ban or \nlimitation of fuels that result from leaking underground storage tank \nproblems. I commend the Clean Fuels Development Coalition for their \ncontinued support of this important fuel as well as my own state of \nNebraska which has more than a decade of experience in ETBE \ndevelopment.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof the Clean Fuels Development Coalition fact book on ETBE be entered \ninto the Congressional Record.\n\n\n                             ETBE FACT BOOK\n\n       The U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information \n     Administration projects U.S. Oil imports could grow to nearly \n     60-70 percent of total U.S. Oil consumption by the year 2010 \n     if new U.S. Policies are not adopted to reverse current \n     trends or if world crude oil prices decline. According to the \n     American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Is currently dependent \n     of foreign oil for 51.8 percent of its energy needs. \n     Currently, 46.7 percent of the imports come from OPEC \n     countries, with 19.1 percent originating from the Persian \n     Gulf region.\n       Historically, market prices have been the primary argument \n     driving the dependence on cheap crude oil imports and the \n     perceived aversion to the alternative fuels. The market price \n     of crude oil can be very misleading because it excludes \n     external costs associated with its use, such as environmental \n     and military costs. The actual cost of oil, including \n     external costs, is estimated to be over $100 per barrel or \n     about $3-$5 per gallon of gasoline, according to the U.S. \n     General Accounting Office.\n       R. James Woolsey, former director of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, believes that the world's dependence on \n     oil from the Middle East and the Caspian Basin is one of the \n     three major threats to America's national security, along \n     with attacks from rogue nations and terrorism.\n       According to General Accounting Office estimates, at \n     current capacity, fuel ethanol and other oxygenates could \n     displace about 305,000 barrels of petroleum per day used to \n     produce gasoline. The total amount of petroleum that ethanol \n     could displace would be approximately 3.7 percent of \n     estimated U.S. Gasoline consumption in 2000. New presidential \n     and Congressional initiates envision tripling these \n     percentages by 2010.\n       Energy production and use accounts for 80 percent of air \n     pollution and 66 percent of the human contribution to global \n     warming. Gasoline obviously accounts for a majority of \n     energy, and specifically, oil consumption. Displacing \n     gasoline with a renewable, less toxic, CO2-\n     friendly, domestically produced fuel represents good \n     environmental policy.\n       Each bushel of corn used to produce ethanol is 100 percent \n     pure profit for the country. The ethanol industry makes $4.50 \n     worth of products out of a $2.25 bushel of corn, doubling its \n     value, enriching the national economy and displacing foreign \n     oil. This improves the U.S. balance of trade payments by \n     several billion dollars, and increases the value of U.S. \n     Grain production. In the future, emerging cellulose \n     conversion technology will make it possible for the entire \n     country to function as a transportation fuel producer using \n     alternative energy crops--switchgrass in Montana, sorghum in \n     Oklahoma, sycamores in Louisiana, poplars in Vermont and \n     waste biomass in New York.\n       In addition to stimulating the economy, ethanol helps \n     reduce the federal deficit. The United States General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) issued a report stating that a \n     doubling of ethanol production would save the federal \n     government $500 million to $600 million annually.\n       Despite ethanol's benefits, it has had problems entering \n     the U.S. Gasoline pool. Due to difficulties with \n     transportation regional fuel specifications and a increase in \n     fuel vapor pressure, ethanol blends have been used mostly in \n     the Midwest. But there is a way to combine the benefits of \n     ethanol into a fuel additive that would be better accepted by \n     the nation's refiners--producing ethyl tertiary butyl ether, \n     ETBE.\n       By combining ethanol with isobutylene, which is derived \n     from natural gas liquids or petroleum products, ETBE offers \n     refiners, agriculture and policy makers another avenue to get \n     the benefits of ethanol into gasoline and minimize many of \n     its current obstacles.\n       The vast majority of ethanol is sold in the Midwest region \n     of the United States. Ethanol blends are doing a great job \n     reducing carbon monoxide and air toxic pollution. However, \n     the more populated cities on the East and West Coasts face \n     tougher emission standards that are primarily based on \n     reducing the vapor pressure of gasoline. ETBE has the lowest \n     vapor pressure of oxygenates available in the marketplace and \n     a high octane level. Compared to other additives, including \n     ethanol alone, it reduces more evaporative and tailpipe \n     emissions, and lowers toxics and carbon monoxide. The U.S. \n     Department of Energy found ``significant benefits'' to using \n     ETBE made from biomass, especially in California.\n       Each gallon of ETBE displaces a barrel of imported oil and \n     reduces the amount of oil that refiners use to make gasoline. \n     Each gallon of ETBE helps the U.S. reduce its $52 billion oil \n     import bill, stimulates the national economy and improves our \n     balance of trade. Turning lower-valued domestic natural gas \n     into high valued liquid fuel products can help areas of the \n     country that have suffered from America's dramatic decline in \n     crude oil production. American agriculture, working in \n     cooperation with domestic natural gas producers to produce \n     leaner domestic fuels, is a powerful combination of allies \n     and resources.\n       Making ETBE can stretch our domestic fuel supplies. Using \n     our natural gas resources and increasing the output of our \n     domestic refineries is an important part of our energy \n     security strategy. Using natural gas as a liquid in existing \n     vehicles will displace imports much faster than waiting for \n     consumers to switch to dedicated natural gas fuel vehicles.\n       Recent University of Nebraska-Lincoln studies indicate that \n     ETBE is several times less soluble than MTBE, and several \n     times more biodegradable. Compared with MTBE, ETBE, and/\n     ethanol mixtures are less likely to reach groundwater \n     supplies, and are more easily removed by natural attenuation \n     and bioremediation, according to preliminary study results.\n       As automakers continue to be burdened with reducing \n     emissions, their ability to provide car that are cleaner, yet \n     still guaranteed to perform, is challenged. ETBE helps \n     automakers get cleaner fuels that have lower sulfur, less \n     toxics and improved driveability index. While ethanol blends \n     help in this area, automakers prefer the use of ethers such \n     as ETBE.\n       The idea of ETBE is not new. In an effort to reduce the \n     dangerously high levels of pollution in Paris, the French \n     Parliament voted to have a renewable content standard for its \n     gasoline. The choice to meet the new renewable standard--\n     ETBE. Lyondell Chemical Company is the world leader in ETBE \n     production technology. Other companies have also produced and \n     sold ETBE in limited quantities in the United State. Amoco \n     produced and sold ETBE at its Yorktown, VA, refinery for \n     several years and marketed the blends on the East Coast. \n     Lyondell Chemical, formerly Arco Chemical Co., the world's \n     largest methyl tertiary butyl ether producer, has produced \n     ETBE several times at its MTBE plants in the U.S. In fact, \n     all of the MTBE plants in the United States could easily \n     produce ETBE with only minor adjustments to optimize \n     performance.\n       The use of MTBE in the reformulated gasoline program has \n     resulted in growing detections of MTBE in drinking water. The \n     majority of these detections to date have been well below \n     levels of public health concern. Detections at lower levels \n     have, however, raised consumer concerns about taste and odor.\n       The EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates considered the fuel \n     applications and technical characteristics of MTBE and other \n     ethers during public sessions in 1999. The panel concluded \n     that ETBE and other ethers have been used less widely and \n     studied less than MTBE. The panel's final report states that, \n     ``To the extent that they have been studies, they (other \n     ethers) appear to have similar, but not identical, chemical \n     and hydrogeologic characteristics. The panel recommends \n     accelerated study of the health effects and groundwater \n     characteristics of these compounds. . .''\n       In response to anticipated questions abut the hydrogeologic \n     characteristics of ETBE, the Department of Chemical \n     Engineering at the University of Nebraska conducted \n     preliminary research into the behavior of ETBE in water. The \n     preliminary research suggests that ETBE's ubiquity properties \n     are less\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\n     than half those of MTBE. In addition, a preliminary report by \n     the University notes that existing literature suggests a \n     faster degradation rate for ETBE than MTBE. The Nebraska \n     Ethanol Board and several federal agencies have proposed \n     additional research on the properties of ETBE.\n       Starting this year, federal Phase II reformulated gasoline, \n     RVG, must deliver a four percent to seven percent reduction \n     in NOX emissions relative to the 1990 baseline \n     gasoline. ETBE is particularly well suited for meeting this \n     requirement because ETBE can reduce aromatic content in RFG. \n     Automobile NOX emissions decrease with increasing \n     octane number and with decreasing aromatics content. ETBE \n     fills the bill on both counts.\n       ETBE's higher octane--110-112 (R+M)/2--enables an RFG \n     blender to substitute ETBE for aromatics, including benzene, \n     as a source of RFG octane. Reducing aromatics content, in \n     turn, reduces emissions of NOX and toxics, \n     while improving driveability performance.\n       For U.S. Refiners, this means more reduction--via \n     dilution--in the levels of aromatics, olefin, and sulfur, all \n     of which are undesirable in RFG.\n       Petroleum use for transportation will remain one of the \n     largest contributors of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. \n     Through the year 2020, according to projections by the U.S. \n     Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration. In \n     2020, petroleum will account for 42 percent of greenhouse gas \n     emissions in the U.S., mostly for transportation use, \n     according to the report. Overall, carbon emissions from \n     energy use will increase at an average annual rate of 1.3 \n     percent due to rising energy demand and slow penetration of \n     renewable, DOE said in its Annual Energy Outlook: 2000 \n     report.\n       Because ETBE is made from renewable ethanol and natural gas \n     feedstock, it is superior in reducing greenhouse gas \n     emissions. In addition, because the use of ETBE often \n     replaces aromatics from the gasoline pool, its ability to \n     reduce the harmful pollutants as well as greenhouse gas \n     emissions from gasoline are improved.\n       As a result of the addition of renewable ethanol, ETBE is \n     an oxygenated fuel. In addition, ETBE has a higher octane \n     rating and lower Reid vapor pressure, RVP, than its \n     competitor, MTBE. ETBE blended gasoline has several benefits:\n       The oxygen reduces carbon monoxide emissions.\n       The lower Rvp lessens pollution that forms ozone.\n       Simply through volumetric displacement, ETBE reduces \n     sulfur, toxic substance and other harmful elements of \n     gasoline.\n       The high octane rating reduces the need for carcinogenic \n     hydrocarbons used to increase octane such as benzene, which \n     cause cancers.\n       Due to ethanol's positive energy balance when produced from \n     grain (1 to 1.3) and cellulose (1 to 2), it reduces \n     greenhouse gases.\n       One of the primary reasons ethanol has difficulty competing \n     in the federal RFG program is that it increases the \n     volatility of gasoline. By turning ethanol into ETBE, this \n     concern is eliminated. ETBE's blending properties are an \n     excellent match for both engine and emissions performance, \n     much better than replacing MTBE with more alkylates.\n       Another issue with ethanol is transportation. Currently in \n     the U.S., ethanol blended gasoline cannot practically be \n     shipped to markets via pipelines--the most common method of \n     transportation for petroleum products. Gasoline blended with \n     ETBE is compatible with the current gasoline distribution \n     system, can be pipelined and stored with gasoline and will \n     reduce the transportation and storage costs associated with \n     ethanol usage.\n       ETBE can be blending at volumes of up to 17 vol%, with the \n     possibility of the maximum blending being increased to 22 \n     vol%, while straight ethanol is capped at 10 vol% and MTBE is \n     limited to 15 vol%. This means that blending gasoline with \n     ethanol can stretch our nation's gasoline supply further.\n       The higher allowable volume of ETBE means:\n       ETBE blends may prove to be the most cost-effective means \n     of bringing the use of alternative fuels to the market place, \n     consistent with new environmental and energy policy, EPACT, \n     demands being placed on U.S. refiners.\n       ETBE blends contain more volume derived from renewable, \n     domestic energy sources.\n       While ethanol plays an important role in the federal RFG \n     program, its use is mostly confined to the few RFG areas in \n     the Midwest. Through ETBE, ethanol use could expand to play a \n     larger role in the RFG program as a whole.\n       If ETBE could capture only a small portion of the U.S. \n     Gasoline market--for example a percentage of the RFG demand \n     in the Northeast, where little of no ethanol is currently \n     used--the increase in ethanol used in gasoline would be \n     significant.\n       As much as 350 million gallons of new ethanol demand would \n     be created if just 60 percent of the oxygenates used in the \n     eight states of the Northeastern States for Coordinated Air \n     Use Management, NESCAUM, were to use ETBE.\n       Along with the increase in ethanol use comes a likely \n     increase in corn demand to produce the ethanol. More than 140 \n     million bushels of corn would be required to meet the \n     aforementioned ETBE demand.\n       ETBE has been in commercial production in Europe since the \n     early 1990s. While France is the European leader for both the \n     production and consumption of ETBE, other European countries \n     are following. European policy makers prefer ETBE to MTBE \n     because of its overall greenhouse gas reductions that come \n     from its renewable ethanol content. ETBE is preferred over \n     ethanol by European refiners because of better logistics and \n     improved gasoline and drive ability quality.\n       In addition, more ether demand is expected with the new \n     European cleaner-burning fuel legislation taking effect in \n     2000 and 2005.\n       The Clean Fuels Development Coalition is a non-profit \n     organization dedicated to the development of alternative \n     fuels and technologies to improve air quality and reduce U.S. \n     Dependence on imported oil. The broad CFDC membership \n     includes ethanol and ether producers, agricultural interests, \n     automobile manufacturers, state government agencies, and \n     engineering and new technology companies. Since its beginning \n     in 1988, the coalition has become a respected source of \n     information for state, local, and federal policy makers as \n     well as private industry on a range of transportation, \n     energy, and environmental issues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7816-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7816-S7819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO RE-ENGAGE WITH THE INDONESIAN MILITARY\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, colleagues, I rise today to draw \nattention to a recent decision by the Administration to reinitiate \nmilitary ties with the government of Indonesia. Despite congressional \nconcerns, the U.S. navy, marines, and coast guard last week began a 10-\nday joint military exercise known as CARAT, Cooperation Afloat \nReadiness and Training, with their Indonesian military counterparts. \nAlthough the Administration sees this mission as a routine good-will \nmission, it is in fact the first time U.S. and Indonesian armed forces \nhave worked together since the United States cut military ties with \nIndonesia last year. Colleagues, in case you don't recall, we cut those \nmilitary ties after East Timor was devastated by Indonesian troops. We \ncut those ties because Indonesian soldiers are reported to have been \nactive participants in a coordinated, massive campaign of murder, rape, \nand forced displacement in East Timor.\n  The administration's decision to go forth with a CARAT exercise again \nthis summer is simply indefensible. Given the human rights violations \ncommitted by the Indonesian military in East Timor and the lack of \naccountability for them, and the Indonesian military's continued ties \nto militias in West Timor, one must ask not only the question why we \nare so eager to re-engage with this military at all, but why we feel \ncompelled to do so now. Now is not the time to conduct joint exercises \nwith the Indonesian military; now is the time to demand its \naccountability. To do otherwise is to tacitly condone its conduct.\n  Conditions continue to deteriorate in East Timorese refugee camps in \nWest Timor and throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Up to 125,000 \nEast Timorese still languish in militia-controlled refugee camps in \nWest Timor almost one year after the people of East Timor voted \noverwhelmingly for independence from Indonesia. Many of the refugees \nwish to return home but are afraid to do so. Today refugee camps remain \nhighly militarized, with East Timorese members of the Indonesian \nmilitary living among civilian refugees. And despite promises by the \nIndonesian government to disarm and disband militias, there are \ncredible reports of Indonesian military support for militia groups. \nThese same militias have easy access to modern weapons. Earlier this \nmonth the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees had to suspend refugee \nregistration indefinitely due to violent militia assaults on its staff, \nvolunteers and refugees, and though UNHCR has continued its work in \nother areas, UNHCR and other aid workers continue work under extremely \ndangerous conditions.\n  There has also been an upsurge in militia border incursions into East \nTimor with attacks on U.N. Peacekeepers and civilians. I regret to say \nthat earlier this week a peacekeeper from New Zealand was shot and \nkilled. Militia leaders, the Indonesian military, and the West Timorese \npress continue to sponsor a mass disinformation campaign alleging \nhorrific conditions in East Timor and abuse by international forces. \nFurther, Indonesia has yet to arrest a single militia leader or member \nof its military accused of human rights violations in East Timor. \nInstead of reinitiating joint military exercises and allowing the sale \nof certain\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\nspare military parts, the Administration should increase its pressure \non the government of Indonesia to fulfill past promises to disarm and \ndisband militias in West Timor, and insure today that the Indonesian \nmilitary is not linked to such militias. Militia leaders must be \nremoved from refugee camps and those accused of human rights violations \nmust be held accountable. Furthermore, Indonesia must make real its \npledge to provide international and local relief workers safe and full \naccess to all refugees.\n\n  There is currently considerable unrest throughout the Indonesian \narchipelago. Reports abound about the direct involvement of the \nIndonesian military in much of the violence. In the past nineteen \nmonths thousands of people in Maluku, also known as the Moluccan \nIslands, have been killed in fighting between Christians and Muslims. \nIt is known that members of the Indonesian military supported and, in \nsome cases, caused the violence. On July 18, Indonesia's Minister of \nDefense Juwono Sudarsono admitted that there were ``some or even many'' \narmy members who have become a ``major cause of clashes'' in Ambon. \nCredible human rights organizations also report an escalation of \nviolence in West Papua with the Indonesian military actively supporting \nEast Timor-style militias there. Moreover, the Indonesian military has \nrepeatedly broken a cease-fire in the province of Aceh.\n  Conditions in Indonesia are deteriorating. On Sunday U.N. Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Annan told Indonesia's President Wahid that U.N. \npeacekeepers may be needed for the archipelago but President Wahid said \nhis government could end the conflict by itself. He did note, however, \nthat Indonesia's overstretched military might need logistical aid from \nfriendly countries such as the United States. I worry that the decision \nthe Administration has made to re-initiate military ties with Indonesia \nis sending the wrong signal to President Wahid. It should be made very \nclear to President Wahid that the U.S. will not provide assistance to \nIndonesia to do what it did before in East Timor.\n  Although I believe we should support Indonesia, we must recognize \nthat the type of support we provide will directly influence the shape \nIndonesia takes in the future. The Administration has not only \nproceeded with the CARAT exercise despite congressional concerns but is \nmoving ahead with ``Phase I'' of a three phase program of re-engagement \nwith the Indonesian military. This could include the sale of certain \nspare military parts to Indonesia. Given the deteriorating conditions \nin Indonesia and the human rights record of Indonesian soldiers, do we \nreally want to do this?\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to voice their opposition to the \nCARAT exercise and to oppose any proposal for strengthening military \nties with Indonesia in the near future. Again, I would like to make \nvery clear that I believe the U.S. should support Indonesia but we must \nrecognize that the type of support we provide now will directly \ninfluence the shape Indonesia takes in the future. Resuming a military \nrelationship now not only threatens any future reforms in Indonesia but \njeopardizes efforts already made to subjugate the Indonesian military \nto civilian authority. U.S. policy towards Indonesia should support \ndemocratic reform and demand accountability for those responsible for \nalleged human rights violations in East Timor and elsewhere. I fail to \nsee how the CARAT exercise or lifting the embargo on military sales to \nIndonesia does either.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to talk about inter-generational \nissues related to Federal budget spending. We will never have a better \ntime to consider such issues as inter-generational equity than now \nduring a time of large projected surpluses. These large projected \nsurpluses provide us with a great deal more flexibility in choosing \namong priorities and in determining our legacy to future generations.\n  Until recently, we were not so lucky. For more than thirty years, the \nbudget projection reports from the Congressional Budget Office and the \nOffice of Management and Budget were a source of growing despair for \nthe American people. As each year went by, CBO and OMB would present \nworse news: larger deficits, larger national debt levels, and larger \nnet interest payments. As the government's appetite for debt expanded, \nfewer and fewer dollars were available for private investment.\n  In the beginning, experts explained that deficits were a good thing \nbecause they stimulated economic growth and created jobs. Over time, \nhowever, the voices of experts opposed to large deficits grew louder; \nthey argued that deficits caused inflation, increased the cost of \nprivate capital, mortgaged away our future--just at the time when we \nneeded to be preparing for the retirement of the large Baby Boom \ngeneration. As the opinions of the experts shifted, so did public \nopinion.\n  During the 1980s and 1990s, the federal deficit became public enemy \nnumber one. Great efforts were made to understand it, to propose \nsolutions to reduce it, and to explain how much better life would be \nwithout it. During election season, the air-waves were filled with \npromises and plans to get rid of the deficit and pay off the national \ndebt. Editorial page writers reached deep into their creative reservoir \nto coin new phrases and create new metaphors to describe the problem. \nBooks were published. Nonprofit organizations were created. \nConstitutional amendments were called for. There was even a new \npolitical party created on account of the deficit.\n  In the 1990s--and at great political risk--we finally started taking \naction to control the size of the deficits and the growth of the \nnational debt. I am proud to have participated in and voted for three \nbudget acts--in 1990, 1993, and 1997--which have radically altered the \nfiscal condition of the Federal government and the debate about how the \npublic's hard-earned tax dollars should be spent.\n  The enactment of these three budget acts--particularly the 1993 and \n1997 budget acts--coupled with impressive gains in private sector \nproductivity and economic growth led to a remarkable reversal of our \ndeficit and debt trends. Deficits started shrinking in 1994. We \ncelebrated our first unified budget surplus of $70 billion in 1998. \nOver the next 10 years, if we maintain current spending and revenue \npolicies, CBO projects an eye-popping unified budget surplus of $4.5 \ntrillion. I am proud that we are able to celebrate the fruits of our \nfiscal restraint because we had the sheer will and political courage to \nput ourselves on a spending diet.\n  Today, however, I want to call your attention to what could be called \nthe ``unintended consequences'' of our fiscal responsibility. Not only \nhave we allowed total Federal spending to dip below 20% of GDP levels \nnot seen since the mid-1970s), but we are also on course to let \nspending drop to 15.6% of GDP by 2010. We have not seen spending levels \nthis low since the 1950s. At the same time as total spending is \ndeclining as a percentage of GDP, the make up of our Federal spending \nis continuing to shift insignificant ways. An increasingly larger \nproportion of our spending is used for mandatory spending programs \ncompared to discretionary spending programs. These numbers have \nimportant implications for the measurement of inter-generational \nequity.\n\n  Now that we have constrained spending and eliminated our budget \ndeficits, the budget debate has shifted to questions about how to spend \nthe surplus: on debt reduction, on tax cuts, on new discretionary \nspending programs, on fixing Social Security, or on creating a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit?\n  I favor all of these things to varying degrees, as I suspect most of \nyou do. The trick is to find the right balance among these initiatives. \nIn finding the right balance, I believe one of the most important \ncriterion in determining how to use these surpluses should be measuring \ninter-generational equity. Not only do we need to assess the amount of \nmoney we invest on our seniors versus our children, but we also need to \nassess the trends of mandatory versus discretionary spending.\n  Let me start with my own assessment of Federal spending on children \nand seniors. Today, the Federal government spends substantially more on \nseniors over the age of 65 than it does on children under the age of \n18. For example, in 2000, the Federal government spent roughly $17,000 \nper person on programs for the elderly, compared with only $2,500 per \nperson on programs for children. This means that at the Federal level, \nwe are spending seven times\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\nas much as people over the age of 65 as on children under the age of \n18.\n  Even when we consider that states are the primary funders of primary \nand secondary education, the combined level of State and Federal \nspending still shows a dramatic contrast in spending on the old versus \nthe young. At the state and Federal level, we are still spending 2.5 \ntimes the amount of money on people over the age of 65 as on children \nunder the age of 18.\n  Given these discomforting facts, it might seem logical that most of \nthe current proposals for spending surplus dollars would be for \ninvestments in our children. Instead, this Congress has been proposing \nand voting to spend a major portion of the surpluses on the most \npolitically organized voting bloc in the nation--those over the age of \n65.\n  In the Senate alone, we have either acted on, or are expected to act \non, the following proposals which directly benefit seniors only:\n  Eliminating the Social Security earnings test for workers over the \nage of 65 (10-year price tag: $23 billion)\n  Allowing military retirees to opt out of Medicare and into TriCare or \nFEHBP (10-year price tag: $90 billion)\n  Creating a new universal Medicare prescription drug benefit for \nseniors (10-year price tag: $300 billion)\n  Medicare provider ``give-backs'' package (10-year price tag: $40 \nbillion)\n  Increasing the Federal income tax exemption provided to Social \nSecurity beneficiaries (10-year price tag: $125 billion)\n  If Congress actually enacted all of these popular provisions into \nlaw, spending for seniors over the next 10 years would increase by $578 \nbillion--an amount equivalent to this year's entire discretionary \nspending budget.\n\n  At the same time as we are proposing, voting in favor of, and \nenacting legislation to improve benefits and tax cuts for seniors, we \nwill be lucky to get legislation passed that will spend only an \nadditional $10 billion on children under the age of 18.\n  Why? The answer is not simply because seniors are politically \norganized voters and children are not. We also have to look at how most \nprograms for seniors are funded versus programs for children. As the \nmembers of the Senate are well aware, most programs for seniors are \nfunded through mandatory/entitlement spending. Spending increases in \nthese programs are not subject to the annual appropriations process and \nare protected by automatic cost-of-living-adjustments (COLA) each year.\n  The spending programs that primarily benefit our children, on the \nother hand, are discretionary, which means they are subject to the \nannual appropriations process. There are no automatic spending \nincreases when it comes to programs for our kids. Instead, most \nprograms for kids are held victim to politics and spending caps.\n  As a result, the proportion of Federal government spending on \nmandatory versus discretionary spending has undergone a dramatic shift. \nBack in 1965, the Federal government spent the equivalent of 6% of GDP \non mandatory entitlement programs like Social Security and 12% of GDP \non discretionary funding items like national defense, education, and \npublic infrastructure. Put another way: 35 years ago, one-third of our \nbudget funded entitlement programs and two-thirds of our budget funded \ndiscretionary spending programs.\n  The situation has now reversed. Today, we spend about two-thirds of \nour budget on entitlement programs and net interest payments and only \none-third of our budget on discretionary spending programs.\n  I am particularly troubled by the decline in spending on \ndiscretionary spending initiatives. Although our tight discretionary \nspending budget caps were a useful tool in the past for eliminating \ndeficits and lowering debt, they are not useful today in helping us \nassess the discretionary budget needs of the nation. Today, \nappropriated spending is contained through spending caps that are too \ntight for today's economic reality. We are left with a discretionary \nbudget that bears little relationship to the needs of the nation and \nthat leaves us little flexibility to solve some of the big problems \nthat still need to be addressed: health care access for the uninsured, \neducation, and research and development in the areas of science and \ntechnology.\n  The downward pressure on discretionary spending will become worse \nduring the retirement of the Baby Boom generation--when the needs of \nprograms on the mandatory spending side will increase dramatically. The \ncoming demographic shift towards more retirees and fewer workers is NOT \na ``pig in a python'' problem as described by some commentators whose \neconomics are usually better than their metaphors. The ratio of workers \nneeded to support each beneficiary does not increase after the baby \nboomers have become eligible for benefits. It remains the same.\n  In 10 years, the unprecedented demographic shift toward more retirees \nwill begin. The number of seniors drawing on Medicare and Social \nSecurity will nearly double from 39 million to 77 million. The number \nof workers will grow only slightly from 137 to 145 million. Worse, if \nwe continue to under-invest in the education and training of our youth, \nwe will have no choice but to continue the terrible process of using H-\n1B visas to solve the problem of a shortage of skilled labor.\n\n  One of the least understood concepts regarding Social Security and \nMedicare is that neither is a contributory system with dedicated \naccounts for each individual. Both are inter-generational contracts. \nThe generations in the work force agree to be taxed on behalf of \neligible beneficiaries in exchange for the understanding that they will \nreceive the same benefit when eligible. Both programs are forms of \nsocial insurance--not welfare--but both are also transfer payment \nprograms. We tax one group of people and transfer the money to another.\n  The proportion of spending on seniors--and the proportion of \nmandatory spending--will most surely increase as the baby boomers \nbecome eligible for transfer payments. Unless we want to raise taxes \nsubstantially or accrue massive amounts of debt, much of the squeeze \nwill be felt by our discretionary spending programs. The spiral of \nunder-investment in our children and in the future work force will \ncontinue. Our government will become more and more like an ATM machine.\n  What should we do about this situation?\n  I recommend a two step approach. Step one is to honestly assess \nwhether can ``cut our way out of this problem''. Do you think public \nopinion will permit future Congresses to vote for reduction in the \ngrowth of Medicare, Social Security, and the long-term care portion of \nMedicaid? At the moment my answer is a resounding ``no''. Indeed, as I \nsaid earlier, we can currently heading the opposite direction.\n  Step number two is to consider whether it is time for us to rewrite \nthe social contract. The central question is this: Do the economic and \nsocial changes that have occurred since 1965 justify a different kind \nof safety net? I believe they do. I believe we need to rewrite and \nmodernize the contract between Americans and the Federal government in \nregards to retirement income and health care.\n  We should transform the Social Security program so that annual \ncontributions lead all American workers--regardless of income--to \naccumulate wealth by participating in the growth of the American \neconomy. Whether the investments are made in low risk instruments such \nas government bonds or in higher risk stock funds, it is a mathematical \ncertainty that fifty years from now a generation of American workers \ncould be heading towards retirement with the security that comes with \nthe ownership of wealth--if we rewrite the contract to allow them to do \nso.\n  Not only should we reform Social Security to allow workers to \npersonally invest a portion of their payroll taxes, but we should also \nmake sure those account contributions are progressive so that low and \nmoderate income workers can save even more for their retirements. At \nthe same time, it is important to make the traditional Social Security \nbenefit formula even more progressive so that protections against \npoverty are even stronger for our low income seniors. Finally, it is \nimportant to change the law so that we can keep the promise to all 270 \nmillion current and future beneficiaries--and that will mean reforming \nthe program to restore its solvency over the long-term.\n  In addition to reforming Social Security, we should end the idea of \nbeing uninsured in this nation by rewriting\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nour Federal laws so that eligibility for health insurance occurs simply \nas a result of being a citizen or a legal resident. We should fold \nexisting programs--Medicare, Medicaid, VA benefits, FEHBP, and the \nincome tax deduction--into a single system. And we should subsidize the \npurchase of health insurance only for those who need assistance. \nEnacting a Federal law that guarantees health insurance does not mean \nwe should have socialized medicine. Personally, I favor using the \nprivate markets as much as possible--although there will be situations \nin which only the government can provide health care efficiently.\n  One final suggestion. With budget projections showing that total \nFederal spending will fall to 15.6% of GDP by 2010, I urge my colleague \nto consider setting a goal of putting aside a portion of the \nsurpluses--perhaps an amount equivalent to one-half to one percent of \nGDP--for additional discretionary investments. Investments that will \nimprove the lives of our children both in the near future and over the \nlong term--investments in education, research and development, and \nscience and technology.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7819-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7819]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    U.S. STRATEGIC INTERESTS IN ASIA\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, following the recent G-8 meeting in Okinawa \nand as we move closer to a vote on Permanent Normal Trading Relations \nwith China, I want to briefly remind my colleagues of the importance of \nhaving a regional strategy for Asia.\n  There is a tendency to look at the Korean situation, the relationship \nbetween Taiwan and China, our presence in Japan, our presence in Guam, \nthe situation in Indonesia, and so on as independent problems. Or, to \njust react to one situation at a time, with no overall understanding of \nhow important the regional links and interests that exist are in \nshaping the outcome of our actions.\n  If we want to play a role in creating more stable allies in South \nKorea and Japan, and in ensuring that an ever-changing China is also a \nnon-threatening China, then we must recognize that any action we take \nin one part of the region will have an impact on perceptions and \nreality throughout the region.\n  I do not intend to give a lengthy speech on this right now, instead I \njust want to draw my colleagues attention to an excellent letter that I \nreceived from General Jones, Commandant of the United States Marine \nCorps. He wrote to discuss just this need for a regional and a long-\nterm perspective as we evaluate our presence in Okinawa.\n  I agree with him that we cannot shape events in the Asia-Pacific \nregion if we are not physically present.\n  So, as we engage in debate over what the proper placement and numbers \nfor that presence are, I urge my colleagues to approach that debate and \nthe debate on China's trade status with an awareness of the interests \nof the regional powers and an awareness of our national security \ninterests both today and in the future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from General Jones be printed \nin the Record following this statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    July 21, 2000.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Biden, As the G-8 Summit approaches, the eyes \n     of the world have turned to the Pacific island of Okinawa. \n     Opponents of U.S. military presence there may seize the \n     opportunity to promote their cause. I am well acquainted with \n     the island, having visited it frequently, and wish to convey \n     to you my sincere belief in its absolute importance to the \n     long-term security of our nation.\n       Okinawa is strategically located. The American military \n     personnel and assets maintained there are key to preservation \n     of the stability of the Asia-Pacific region and to \n     fulfillment of the U.S.-Japan bilateral security treaty. \n     Okinawa's central location between the East China Sea and \n     Pacific Ocean, astride major trade routes, and close to areas \n     of vital economic, political, and military interest make it \n     an ideal forward base. From it, U.S. forces can favorably \n     shape the environment and respond, when necessary, to \n     contingencies spanning the entire operational continuum--from \n     disaster relief, to peacekeeping, to war--in a matter of \n     hours, vice days or weeks.\n       We have long endeavored to minimize the impact of our \n     presence. Working hand in hand with our Okinawan hosts and \n     neighbors, we have made significant progress. In 1996, an \n     agreement was reached for the substantial reduction, \n     consolidation, and realignment of U.S. military bases in \n     Okinawa. Movement toward full implementation of the actions \n     mandated by the Special Action Committee on Okinawa Final \n     Report continues and the commitment to reduce the impact of \n     our presence is unabated.\n       Recent instances of misconduct by a few American service \n     members have galvanized long simmering opposition to our \n     presence. While those incidents are deplorable, they are \n     fortunately uncommon and do not reflect the full nature of \n     our presence.\n       Often lost in discussions of our presence on Okinawa, are \n     the positive aspects of that presence. We are good neighbors: \n     our personnel are actively involved in an impressive variety \n     of community service work, we are the island's second largest \n     employer of civilians, we infuse over $1.4 billion dollars \n     into the local economy annually, and most importantly, we are \n     sincerely grateful for the important contributions to \n     attainment of our mission made by the people of Okinawa. We \n     are mindful of our obligation to them.\n       It is worth remembering that U.S. presence in Okinawa came \n     at great cost. Battle raged on the island for three months in \n     the waning days of World War II and was finally won through \n     the valor, resolve, and sacrifice by what is now known as our \n     greatest generation. Our losses were heavy: twelve thousand \n     killed and thirty-five thousand wounded. Casualties for the \n     Japanese and for Okinawan civilians were even greater. The \n     price for Okinawa was indeed high. Its capture in 1945, \n     however, contributed to the quick resolution of the Pacific \n     War and our presence there in the following half a century \n     has immeasurably contributed to the protection of U.S., \n     Japanese, and regional interests.\n       As you well know, challenges to military basing and \n     training are now routine and suitable alternatives to \n     existing sites are sorely limited. Okinawa, in fact, is \n     invaluable. We fully understand the legitimate concerns of \n     the Okinawan people and we will continue to work closely with \n     them to forge mutually satisfactory solutions to the issues \n     that we face. We are now, and will continue to be, good \n     neighbors and custodians for peace in the region.\n           Very Respectfully,\n                                                   James L. Jones,\n     General, Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7819-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7819-S7820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  THE INNOCENCE PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, at the beginning of this year, I spoke to \nthe Senate about the breakdown in the administration of capital \npunishment across the country and suggested some solutions. I noted \nthen that for every 7 people executed, 1 death row inmate has been \nshown some time after conviction to be innocent of the crime.\n  Since then, many more fundamental problems have come to light. More \ncourt-appointed defense lawyers who have slept through trials in which \ntheir client has been convicted and sentenced to death; more cases--43 \nof the last 131 executions in Texas according to an investigation by \nthe Chicago Tribune--in which lawyers who were disbarred, suspended or \notherwise being disciplined for ethical violations have been appointed \nto represent people on trial for their lives; cases in which \nprosecutors have called for the death penalty based on the race of the \nvictim; and cases in which potentially dispositive evidence has been \ndestroyed or withheld from death row inmates for years.\n  We have also heard from the National Committee to Prevent Wrongful \nExecutions, a blue-ribbon panel comprised of supporters and opponents \nof the death penalty, Democrats and Republicans, including six former \nState and Federal judges, a former U.S. Attorney, two former State \nAttorneys General, and a former Director of the FBI. That diverse group \nof experts has expressed itself to be ``united in [its] profound \nconcern that, in recent years, and around the country, procedural \nsafeguards and other assurances of fundamental fairness in the \nadministration of capital punishment have been significantly \ndiminished.''\n  I have been working with prosecutors, judges and defense counsel, \nwith death penalty supporters and opponents, and with Democrats and \nRepublicans, to craft some basic common-sense reforms. I could not be \nmore pleased that Senators Gordon Smith, Susan Collins, Jim Jeffords, \nCarl Levin, Russ Feingold, and others here in the Senate, and \nRepresentatives Ray LaHood, William Delahunt, and over 60 other members \nof both parties in the House have joined me in sponsoring the Innocence \nProtection Act of 2000.\n  The two most basic provisions of our bill would encourage the State \nto at\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nleast make DNA testing available in the kind of case in which it can \ndetermine guilt or innocence and at least provide basic minimum \nstandards for defense counsel so that capital trials have a chance of \ndetermining guilt or innocence by means of the adversarial testing of \nevidence that should be the hallmark of American criminal justice.\n  Our bill will not free the system of all human error, but it will do \nmuch to eliminate errors caused by the willful blindness to the truth \nthat our capital punishment system has exhibited all too often. That is \nthe least we should demand of a justice system that puts people's lives \nat stake.\n  I have been greatly heartened by the response of experts in criminal \njustice across the political spectrum to our careful work, and I would \nlike to just highlight one example. A distinguished member of the \nFederal judiciary, Second Circuit Judge Jon O. Newman, has suggested \nthat America's death penalty laws could be improved by requiring the \ntrial judge to certify that guilt is certain. I welcome Judge Newman's \nthoughtful commentary, and I ask unanimous consent that his article, \nwhich appeared in the June 25th edition of the Harford Courant, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. It is my hope that the national debate on the death \npenalty will continue, and that people of good conscience--both those \nwho support the death penalty and those who oppose it--will join in our \neffort to make the system more fair and so reduce the risk that \ninnocent people may be executed.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Harford Courant, June 25, 2000]\n\n                   Require Certainty Before Executing\n\n                           (By Jon O. Newman)\n\n       The execution of Gary Graham demonstrates the need to make \n     one simple change in America's death penalty laws: a \n     requirement that no death sentence can be imposed unless the \n     trial judge certifies that the evidence establishes the \n     defendant's guilt to a certainty.\n       Under current law, a death sentence requires first a jury's \n     finding of guilt of a capital crime and then a jury's \n     selection of the death penalty. In deciding both guilt and \n     the death penalty, the jury must be persuaded beyond a \n     reasonable doubt. That is a high standard, but it is not as \n     high as a requirement that the trial judge certify that guilt \n     is certain.\n       Experience has shown that in some cases juries have been \n     persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt to convict and vote the \n     death penalty even though the defendant is innocent. The most \n     common reason is that one or more eyewitnesses said they saw \n     the defendant commit the crime, but it later turned out that \n     they were mistaken, as eyewitnesses sometimes are.\n       But when even one eyewitness testifies that the defendant \n     did it, that is sufficient evidence for a jury to find guilt \n     beyond a reasonable doubt, and neither the trial judge nor \n     the appellate judges can reject the jury's guilty verdict \n     even though they have some doubt whether the eyewitness is \n     correct.\n       Our system uses the standard of proof beyond a reasonable \n     doubt, rather than certainty, to determine guilt and thereby \n     accepts the risk that in rare cases a guilty verdict might be \n     rendered against an innocent person. Procedures are available \n     for presenting new and sometimes conclusive evidence of \n     innocence at a later time.\n       But with the death penalty, such exonerating evidence \n     sometimes comes too late. Every effort should therefore be \n     made to assure that the risk of executing an innocent person \n     is reduced as low as humanly possible.\n       Requiring the trial judge to certify that guilt has been \n     proven to a certainty before a death penalty can be imposed \n     would limit the death penalty to cases where innocence is not \n     realistically imaginable, leaving life imprisonment for those \n     whose guilt is beyond a reasonable doubt but not certain.\n       Certification of certainty might be withheld, for example, \n     in cases like Gary Graham's, where the eyewitness had only a \n     fleeting opportunity to see an assailant whom the witness did \n     not previously know, or in cases where the principal accusing \n     witness has previously lied or has a powerful incentive to \n     lie to gain leniency for himself.\n       On the other hand, certification would be warranted where \n     untainted DNA, fingerprint or other forensic evidence \n     indisputably proved guilt or where the suspect was caught in \n     the commission of the crime.\n       In state courts (unlike Connecticut's) where judges are \n     elected and sometimes succumb to public pressure to impose \n     death sentences, certification of certainty might be \n     entrusted to a permanent expert panel or might be made a \n     required part of the commutation decision of a governor or a \n     pardons board. In federal courts, the task could \n     appropriately be given to appointed trial judges.\n       Even certification of certainty of guilt will not eliminate \n     all risk of executing an innocent person. But as long as the \n     death penalty is used this is a safeguard that a civilized \n     society should require. Adding it to the innocence protection \n     bill now being considered in Congress would help that act \n     live up to its name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7820-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7820-S7821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                H1-VISAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to comment briefly on the \nissue of H1-B visas. Like most if not all Democrats, I believe that the \nnumber of H1-B visas--which are used by foreign workers wishing to work \nin the United States--should be increased.\n  I also believe that we should address other immigration priorities. \nFirst, we should ensure that we treat all people who fled tyranny in \nCentral America equally, regardless of whether the tyrannical regime \nthey fled was a left-wing or a right-wing government. Congress has \nalready acted to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans, as well it should. It \nis now time to apply the same protections to Guatemalans, Salvadorans, \nHondurans, and also Haitians.\n  Second, we should prevent people on the verge of gaining legal \npermanent resident status from being forced to leave their jobs and \ntheir families for lengthy periods in order to complete the process. \nU.S. law allowed such immigrants to remain in the country until 1997, \nwhen Congress failed to renew the provision. It is now time to correct \nthat error.\n  Third, we should allow people who have lived and worked here for 14 \nyears or more, contributing to the American economy, to adjust their \nimmigration status. This principle has been a part of American \nimmigration law since the 1920s and should be updated now for the first \ntime since 1986.\n  Vice President Gore shares these priorities, as reflected in a letter \nhe wrote on July 26 to Congresswoman Lucille Roybal-Allard. In this \nletter, he endorses an increase in the number of H1-B visas and each of \nthe three proposals I have outlined briefly here today. The Vice \nPresident's position on this issue is the right position, and it is the \ncompassionate position. I urge the Senate to take up S. 2912, the \nLatino and Immigrant Fairness Act--a bill that would accomplish each of \nthe three immigration goals I have just discussed--and pass it without \nfurther delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                           The Vice President,\n\n                                        Washington, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. Lucille Roybal-Allard,\n     Member of Congress,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Lucille: As Congress concludes this work period, with \n     few legislative days left this session, I want to communicate \n     my continued support for legislation addressing fairness for \n     legal immigrants.\n       America's economic prosperity stems in large part from the \n     hard work of American workers and the innovation offered by \n     American firms. As a result of the longest period of economic \n     growth in our history, it is not surprising that we have \n     achieved record low levels of unemployment. This positive \n     employment picture is especially true among highly skilled \n     and highly educated workers. In some sectors of the economy, \n     it appears there may be genuine shortages of highly skilled \n     workers necessary to sustain our economic growth. As a \n     result, our Administration has offered a series of proposals \n     aimed at dramatic improvements in the education and training \n     of American workers. These proposals ought to be enacted by \n     the Congress to assure that any gap between worker skills and \n     employer needs is addressed comprehensively.\n       I recognize that periodically American industry requires \n     access to the international labor market to maintain and \n     enhance our global competitiveness, particularly in high-\n     growth new technology industries and tight labor markets. For \n     these reasons, I support legislation to make reasonable and \n     temporary increases to the H-1B visa cap to address \n     industry's immediate need for high-skilled workers. However, \n     this increase must also include significant labor protections \n     for American workers and a significant increase in H-1B \n     application fees to fund programs to prepare American \n     workers--especially those from under-represented groups--to \n     fill these and future jobs.\n       In addition, I support measures that provide fairness and \n     equity for certain immigrants already in the United States. \n     Therefore, as Congress considers allowing more foreign \n     temporary workers into this country to meet employers' needs, \n     I urge Congress to correct two injustices currently affecting \n     many immigrants already in our nation. I want to urge Members \n     to pass two important immigration proposals that have long \n     been\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n     Administration priorities--providing parity to Central \n     Americans and Haitians under NACARA and changing the registry \n     date to allow certain long-term migrants to adjust to legal \n     permanent resident status. These proposals are much-needed \n     and would restore fairness to our immigration system and \n     American families. The registry date and the Central American \n     and Haitian Parity Act proposals would provide good people \n     who have developed ties to this country--families, homes, and \n     roots in their communities--the opportunity to adjust their \n     status. I am extremely disappointed that many in the \n     Congressional majority seem intent on refusing to pass or \n     even vote on these important immigration provisions. One way \n     or another, however, the Congressional majority has an \n     obligation to allow a vote on these issues and to join us in \n     passing these measures of basic justice and fairness. The \n     migrants and their families who would benefit from the \n     registry date proposal have been in immigration limbo for up \n     to two decades and are in desperate need of a resolution to \n     their efforts to become full members of American society. In \n     the case of Central Americans and Haitians, the parity \n     provision would not only provide compassion and fairness for \n     the affected immigrants, but also contribute to the stability \n     and development of democracy and peace in their native \n     countries.\n       I also urge Congress to pass and fund other Administration \n     priorities that would address the needs of immigrants. \n     Reinstatement of section 245(i) would allow families to stay \n     together while an adjustment of status application is \n     pending. The Administration's FY 2001 budget proposal would \n     fund programs to ensure that immigrants' services have the \n     resources needed to reduce the backlog of applications from \n     people seeking naturalization and adjustment of status.\n       Finally, I urge Congress to fully fund the Administration's \n     $75 million request for the English Language/Civics and \n     Lifeskills Initiative that will allow communities to provide \n     more English language courses that are linked to civics and \n     lifeskills instruction to adults with limited English \n     language proficiency. Immigrants are eager to learn English \n     and all about civic responsibility, but the demand for \n     programs outweighs the supply. We need to provide \n     opportunities for these new Americans to become full \n     participants in our society.\n       For these reasons, Congress should consider and enact these \n     legislative proposals and fund the programs we requested. I \n     commend your leadership in this area, and I look forward to \n     working closely with you to enact these important immigration \n     measures.\n           Sincerely,\n     Al Gore.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7821-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for more than 60 years, the Social Security \nprogram has been one of the most successful governmental initiatives \nthis country has ever witnessed. August 14, 2000 marks the 65th \nanniversary of the Social Security Act, signed by President Franklin D. \nRoosevelt in 1935. This historic event in 1935 changed the face of \nAmerica by providing protections for retired workers and for those who \nface loss of income due to disability or death of the family \nbreadwinner. We must look to the future to ensure a strong Social \nSecurity program for every individual in America.\n  During the time of the Great Depression, jobs were scarce and many \nwere unable to compete for new employment. President Roosevelt \nrecognized that a change was needed, he called for reform and the \nSocial Security Act was born.\n  Social Security has changed remarkably over the past six decades. \nUnder the 1935 law, Social Security only paid retirement benefits to \nthe primary worker. A 1939 change in the law added survivor benefits \nand benefits for the retiree's spouse and children. In 1956 disability \nbenefits were added. Thus, we have seen how Social Security has grown \nto meet the needs of not only retirees, but also their families.\n  For many Americans, Social Security has become a crucial component of \ntheir financial well-being. In fact, an estimated 42% of the elderly \nare kept out of poverty because of their Social Security checks. Today \nmore than 44 million people receive retirement, survivor, and \ndisability benefits through the Social Security program, 1.6 million in \nMichigan. Social Security has had an enormous effect on the lives of \nmillions of working Americans and their families.\n  As we celebrate this historic event, we remember what America was and \nhow Americans have shaped their country into the prosperous nation that \nit is today. Since 1935 Social Security has served the American people \nwell and will continue to do so into the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7821-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, today we welcome a new colleague to this \nbody, former Governor, now Senator Zell Miller. We welcome Senator \nMiller at the same time that we mourn the passing of his predecessor, \nPaul Coverdell. So it is a bittersweet moment.\n  Zell Miller isn't replacing Paul Coverdell. He can't be replaced, \nrather, I prefer to think he is following the footsteps of a consummate \nand formidable legislator. I worked closely with Senator Coverdell to \nmove legislation when people thought legislation couldn't be moved. And \nI look forward to working with Senator Miller in that same vain.\n  In thinking about what I would say about Senator Miller's arrival to \nthe senate, I ran across a quote by the great Senator J. William \nFulbright. He talked about what it takes to be both a legislator and an \nexecutive and I think it is a fitting characterization of the work of \nboth Paul Coverdell and Zell Miller.\n  Fulbright said: ``The legislator is an indispensable guardian of our \nfreedom.'' ``It is true,'' he said, ``that great executives have played \na powerful role in the development of civilization, but such leaders \nappear sporadically, by chance. They do not always appear when they are \nmost needed. The great executives have given inspiration and push to \nthe advancement of human society, but it is the legislator who has \ngiven stability and continuity to that slow and painful progress.''\n  Zell Miller, to borrow Senator Fulbright's eloquent words, appeared \nin Georgia when he was most needed. As Governor, he advanced the \nprospects of the people of Georgia by creating the HOPE scholarship \nprogram. The initiative was so successful that President Clinton and \nthe Congress made the HOPE scholarship initiative a national program. \nAs a result, not only do Georgians have the opportunity to pursue their \ndreams through higher education, so do millions of Americans.\n  Looking at his career, you learn that Zell Miller also understands \nSam Rayburn's dictum that ``you cannot be a leader, and ask other \npeople to follow you, unless you know how to follow too.'' Whether it \nwas his service in Marine Corps, his tenure in the Georgia State Senate \nor as Lieutenant Governor or Governor, he learned leadership by \nfollowing those who walked the walk before him and then by focusing on \nwhat matters most to the American people. The central focus of Zell \nMiller's career has been on what he aptly calls ``kitchen table \nissues.'' The issues that affect the daily lives of the American \npeople--education, taxes, crime, and health care.\n  Some may be surprised to learn that Zell is fulfilling a childhood \nambition of serving in the U.S. Senate. According to a recent news \nreport, he wrote to his boyhood friend, Ed Jenkins, in their high \nschool yearbook that ``we will be friends forever until and unless you \ndecide to run against me for the\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nU.S. Senate.'' His friendship with Ed Jenkins, someone with whom I \nserved in the House, is still intact, and Zell will start a new chapter \nin what has been an extraordinary career.\n  Finally, Mr. President, Zell brings the attributes of both a \nlegislator and an executive to the Senate and I believe they will serve \nhim well. And like Paul Coverdell, who through his work brought \nstability and continuity to the Senate, I know that Zell will bring \ngreat credit to this institution and will serve the people of Georgia \nwell. We welcome him to the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7822-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               H-1B VISAS\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration \nover the inability of the Senate to reach a unanimous consent agreement \nin regard to legislation that addresses the critical shortage of highly \nskilled workers in the information technology fields. On April 11, \n2000, the Senate's Judiciary Committee favorably reported out S. 2045, \nThe American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, by a vote of 16-\n2. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. Unfortunately, this legislation is now being held hostage \nbecause some of my colleagues in the Senate wish to attach unrelated \namendments to the bill.\n  There are very few remaining days left in this Congress. Before \nCongress adjourns for the year, we must pass the remaining \nappropriations bills, and have them signed into law. In addition, \nlegislation extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and \nlegislation reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nmust be considered. Consequently, there simply is just not enough time \nfor the Senate to debate numerous unrelated amendments on the H-1B visa \nbill.\n  Mr. President, our country's burgeoning economy has resulted in an \nextremely low unemployment rate nationwide. While I am proud of our \neconomy, and our low nationwide unemployment rate, there does exist a \ntight labor market in many fields, especially the information \ntechnology fields. One need only look in the classified section of the \nWashington Post to see how many high-tech jobs are available in \nNorthern Virginia. This tight labor market makes it difficult for the \nhigh-tech industry to fill job openings, and this difficulty is \ncompounded by the fact that our American education system, for one \nreason or another, is not producing enough individuals with the \ninterest and skills for employment in the information technology \nfields. If these jobs our not filled, our economy will suffer, and \nthese American companies will move overseas to fill their jobs.\n  In 1998, Congress and the President recognized the serious effects \nthat the tight labor market could have on the high-tech industry and \nour economy. In that year, Congress passed, and the President signed \ninto law, legislation increasing the annual ceiling for admission of H-\n1B nonimmigrants from 65,000 to 115,000 in fiscal year 1999 and fiscal \nyear 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001. This 1998 act also imposed \na $500 per visa fee to fund training and scholarships for U.S. workers \nand students.\n  Nevertheless, despite increasing the H-1B ceiling just two years ago, \nthat increase has proved to be woefully inadequate. In 1999, the H-1B \nvisa ceiling was reached at the end of 9 months. This fiscal year, the \nceiling was reached 6 months into the fiscal year. The effect of the H-\n1B ceiling being reached before the year's end is that these jobs will \nremain unfilled, which in turn will only hurt our economy.\n  The Senate Judiciary's Committee Report on S. 2045 states that the, \n``shortage of skilled workers throughout the U.S. economy will result \nin a 5-percent drop in the growth rate of the GDP. That translates into \napproximately $200 billion in lost output, nearly $1,000 for every \nAmerican.'' The Committee cites other studies that indicate that a \nshortage of information technology professionals is costing the U.S. \neconomy as a whole $105 billion a year. I also found Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the Senate's Banking \nCommittee quite compelling. Mr. Greenspan endorsed S. 2045 in response \nto a question from Senator Phil Gramm, and then stated that, ``The \nbenefits of bringing in people to do the work here, rather than doing \nthe work elsewhere, to me, should be pretty self-evident.''\n\n  Now, let me state clearly, it is my preference that these jobs in the \ninformation technology fields would be filled with Americans. However, \ndue to the low unemployment rate and the lack of unemployed educated \nhigh-tech workers, filling the numerous openings in the information \ntechnology fields with Americans is simply not realistic. Therefore, to \ncontinue to propel our economy forward, we must pass legislation such \nas S. 2045 to fill these critical positions in our information \ntechnology sector.\n  This legislation, though, does more than just increase the number of \nH-1B visas to temporarily fill the job openings in the high-tech \nindustry that cannot be filled by Americans. This bill contains very \nimportant provisions that continue the imposition of a $500 fee per H-\n1B visa petition. It is estimated that this fee, with the increase in \nthe H-1B ceiling, will raise roughly $450 million over three years. \nThis money will create 40,000 scholarships for U.S. workers and U.S. \nstudents, thereby helping them to choose education in these important \nfields. Our goal should be to fill these American jobs with trained \nAmerican workers. These provisions of S. 2045 takes us toward that \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I cannot overstate how important it is for \nour country's economy to raise the ceiling on H-1B visas, and to \nprovide funding for the training of Americans to fill these jobs. I \nimplore my colleagues to reconsider their demand for votes on unrelated \namendments on this legislation. At this late stage in the Congress, \ndemanding votes on unrelated amendments on this legislation will kill \nthis important bill, leave very important jobs in the information \ntechnology sector unfilled, and ultimately, hurt our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7822-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VISA WAIVER PILOT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to explain to my colleagues the \nreasons for my objection to a unanimous consent request for the Senate \nto adopt legislation to make the Visa Waiver Pilot Program permanent, \nH.R. 3767. I do so consistent with the commitment I have made to \nexplain publicly any so-called ``holds'' that I may place on \nlegislation.\n  I regret that I am compelled to object to this measure at this point \nbut I do so for reasons similar to those given previously. I believe \nthe Senate should not allow the security of millions of rural Americans \nto be ignored while we press ahead with legislation to take care of \nimmigration matters.\n  Since April, a prominent Senate Republican leader has had a de facto \nhold on a bipartisan bill of critical importance to the security of \nthose who live in rural counties, S. 1608, The Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act of 2000. But time is running out. It \nis the end of July; there are fewer than 26 legislative days left. \nPeople in rural counties across America who have strained under \ndwindling Federal resource funds need this legislation. They should not \nbe made to wait.\n  S. 1608 addresses the problems 709 rural counties in 42 states face \nin trying to fund schools, roads and other basic county services with \ndrastically declining Federal timber payments. These problems affect \nsome 800,000 school children and millions of people. For example, Grant \nCounty in eastern Oregon has lost 90 percent of its timber receipts, \nforcing it to turn to a four-day school week as a cost-saving measure.\n  This bipartisan bill provides a balanced solution to the problem. The \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee reported it by voice vote, and \nit is supported by hundreds of counties, labor organizations, education \ngroups, and the National Association of Counties. I regret having to \ntake this action but am compelled at this point in the legislative year \nto seek every opportunity to move this critically important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7822-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7822-S7823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RURAL AMERICA PROSPERITY ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of the\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\nRural America Prosperity Act of 2000. I am pleased to be a cosponsor, \nalong with my colleagues, Senators Lugar, Roberts, and Santorum. I am a \ncosponsor of this bill because it gives our farmers some of the tools \nthey need to succeed in today's economy and works to finish what was a \nkey tool in our current agriculture policy.\n  In 1996, we passed a new version of the farm bill. This legislation \nbegan the process of eliminating government control over farmers. No \nlonger did the government dictate what crops farmers could plant. \nFarmers could use their own discretion, honed by generations of living \non the land, as to how their land and finances would be managed. The \nfarm bill made numerous steps in the right direction, but there is more \nwe can do. This, I believe, is a very important step to make this \nlegislation better and more flexible.\n  This legislation takes us a few steps further down the road to better \nfarming policy. It includes three important tax provisions that I feel \nare vital to the survival of Montana's and America's farmers. The first \nis the repeal of the estate tax, which would allow farms to be passed \nalong to the next generation. Without the repeal, sons and daughters \nare forced to sell the only home they have ever known to pay the estate \ntaxes, when their parents die. Family farms are disappearing fast \nenough without this added burden.\n  The second vital tax provision is the exclusion of capital gains from \nthe sale of farmland. This simply puts farm owners on an even playing \nfield with homeowners, who already benefit from exclusion of capital \ngains. The third tax provision lies in the area of health insurance. \nFarmers, and others who are self-employed, do not have health insurance \nprovided for them. They must cover the full cost themselves. This \nlegislation would give those who are self-employed a tax deduction for \nthe cost of their insurance.\n  Farmers, more than any other sector of our economy are likely to \nexperience substantial fluctuations in income. Market forces in farming \nare very unique: drought, flooding, infestation and disease all play a \nvital role in a farmer's bottom line. And it's not often when the \nelements of mother nature allow for a profitable harvest more than once \nin several years. I believe that farmers need to be able to smooth out \nfluctuations in their income in order to offset the effect of the high \nmarginal tax rates that occur in years when both yield and prices are \nup. Income averaging is an important tool for farmers. Currently, \nalternative minimum taxes prevent many farmers from receiving the \nbenefits of income averaging. This bill would fix that. Farmers will be \nable to put up to 20 percent of their annual farm income into a FARRM \naccount that is deducted from their taxes.\n  As many of you know, while the rest of the economy is surging ahead, \nagriculture has been left behind in the dust. Prices are dropping, and \nfarmers and ranchers are going out of business. We must assist in their \nsurvival and the development of new markets is an essential part of \nthat survival. Imposing trade sanctions hurts American farmers and \nranchers. Sanctions have effectively shut out American agricultural \nproducers from 11 percent of the world market, with sanctions imposed \non various products of over 60 countries. They allow our competitors an \nopen door to those markets where sanctions are imposed by the United \nStates. In times like these our producers need every available \nmarketing option open to them. We cannot afford lost market share. \nForeign markets offer a great opportunity for our agricultural products \nand negotiating trade agreements may put life back into our rural \ncommunities.\n  The farm bill took bold steps, but we cannot stop there. This \nlegislation continues to make those steps towards a better situation \nfor our farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7823-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IT IS TIME TO UPDATE THE MISSOURI RIVER MASTER MANUAL\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to take this opportunity to \njoin my colleagues to discuss the issue of how the Missouri River \nshould be managed by the Corps of Engineers and to address the remarks \nmade earlier this week by my friends and colleagues from Missouri, \nSenators Bond and Ashcroft. This issue has come before the Senate \nbecause some of my colleagues from states downstream on the Missouri \nRiver are attempting to politicize the management of the River.\n  They are trying to politicize this issue by adding a rider to the \nEnergy and Water Appropriations bill to prevent the Corps of Engineers \nfrom changing the 40 year old Master Manual that sets the management \npolicy of the River.\n  Let me assure you and the rest of my colleagues that after 40 years, \nthe management of the Missouri River is in serious need of an update to \nreflect the current realities of the River. As the discussion--and \nsometimes, heated debate--continues with respect to the Missouri River \nand its various uses, the Army Corps of Engineers has proposed a \nrevision of the Master Manual which governs how the River is managed.\n  I was among those who first called for a revision of the Master \nManual because I firmly believed then, as I do now, that over the \nyears, we in the Upper Basin states have lived with an unfortunate lack \nof parity under the current management practices on the Missouri River. \nIt is no secret that we continue to suffer from an upstream vs. \ndownstream conflict of interest on Missouri River uses. For example, \ntraditionally, navigation has been emphasized on the Missouri River, to \nthe detriment of river ecosystems and recreational uses. I recognize \nthat navigation activities often support midwestern agriculture, \nhowever the navigation industry has been declining since it peaked in \nthe late 1970's. It is no longer appropriate to grossly favor \nnavigation above other uses of the river.\n  Those of us from the upstream states have been working for more than \n10 years to get the Corps of Engineers to finally make changes in the \n40 year old Master Manual for the Missouri River.\n  After more than 40 years, the time has come for the management of the \nMissouri River to reflect the current economic realities of a $90 \nmillion annual recreation impact upstream, versus a $7 million annual \nnavigation impact downstream. The Corps has been managing the Missouri \nRiver for navigation for far too long and it is time to finally bring \nthe Master Manual into line with current economic realities.\n  As I stated earlier, the process to review and update the Master \nManual began more than 10 years ago, in 1989, in response to concerns \nregarding the operation of the main stem dams, mainly during drought \nperiods. A draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) was published in \nSeptember 1994 and was followed by a public comment period. In response \nto numerous comments, the Corps agreed to prepare a Revised DEIS.\n  After years of revisions and updates that have dragged this process \nout to ridiculous lengths, the Corps finally came forward with \nalternatives to the current Master Manual, including the ``split \nseason'' alternative, which I strongly support, along with my \ncolleagues from the Upper Basin states. Those of us from the States in \nthe Upper Basin are determined to work aggressively for the interests \nof our region. For decades our states have made many significantly \nsacrifices which have benefited people living further south along the \nMissouri River.\n  Now is the time to finally bring an outdated and unfair management \nplan for the Missouri River up to date with modern economic realities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7823-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7823-S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MOUNT HELM BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today I rise to honor the oldest African-\nAmerican church in the City of Jackson, Mississippi, Mount Helm Baptist \nChurch. Not only is it the oldest African-American church, but it is \nalso one of the oldest churches in the State of Mississippi. Throughout \nthis year, Mount Helm will be celebrating its 165th Anniversary with a \ntheme ``Celebrating Our Heritage: Anticipating Our Future''. This \nyear's theme should be echoed in the hearts and minds of everyone. This \nchurch clearly exemplifies this theme. Mount Helm, which was founded in \n1835, has continuously been a community leader and a strong advocate \nfor Christianity and the spreading of the Gospel.\n  Prior Lee, a prominent Jacksonian, developed a deep interest in \nreligion\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nand provided the resources for the construction of the First Baptist \nChurch. After the church was completed, Lee persuaded the congregation \nto allow the African-Americans to hold their own worship services in \nthe basement of the church. The Thirteenth Amendment, which abolished \nslavery, was ratified in 1867 and African-Americans withdrew from the \nFirst Baptist Church and erected their own church home, thus forming \nMount Helm Baptist Church.\n  During its 165 years of existence, Mount Helm Baptist Church has had \nthe leadership of 21 pastors.

Mr. President, last month, the Finance Committee reported a \nbill by voice vote to provide treatment for low-income women identified \nas having breast or cervical cancer through a federal screening \nprogram. I rise today to urge the Senate to expeditiously take up and \npass this legislation.\n  In 1990, the Senate unanimously approved establishment of the \nNational Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, a CDC \nprogram which has expanded screening for these diseases to over one \nmillion women. Unfortunately, after receiving diagnosis, many of these \nwomen find themselves without health insurance and with no one to turn \nto for treatment. This is unconscionable--it's time to finish the job.\n  Earlier this summer, I hosted women's health forums in Virginia to \ndiscuss with women health concerns of priority. Breast and cervical \ncancer survivors asked me to come to you and my distinguished \ncolleagues and urge your support for swift passage of this legislation. \nI was pleased to support the bill in Committee, and I am happy to echo \ntheir words to you.\n  73 Senators have cosponsored this proposal and the House of \nRepresentatives, in May, passed companion legislation with overwhelming \nsupport. Mr. President, on behalf of all women, I urge the Senate to \ntake up and pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7824-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7824]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I would like to take the \nopportunity to say a few words of praise for an act of heroism \ndisplayed by a couple of long haul truckers earlier this month in my \nhome state of Montana.\n  I came to the floor today to not only praise the good deed but to \nalso support a mode of transportation that supports the economy of \nMontana and the entire nation.\n  As I have said, earlier this month in my home state of Montana a pair \nof truckers rescued four people from a car that had overturned in a \nditch filled with flood water. The car, containing three people, was \nsubmerged underwater for at least three minutes after skidding off an \neastern Montana highway during a flash flood which left only the car's \ntires above water.\n  Luckily for the passengers, a truck driver stopped just past the \noverturned car. The trucker backed his trailer off the road and over \nthe bank risking his own safety and property. After securing a chain \naround the bumper of his trailer, he waded into the water, secured the \nother end around the car and pulled it back up onto the road. A second \ntruck driver also stopped to assist.\n  I would like to recognize these unknown individuals for their \nheroism. Too often we take our nation's truckers for granted. It is \ncontinually becoming more and more difficult to make a living as a long \nhaul trucker in this country considering fuel prices and regulatory \nfactors. The high cost of fuel has hit this industry especially hard.\n  A proposal to drastically alter a trucker's drive and rest periods is \nbeing considered by the Administration. This proposal threatens not \nonly to increase the costs of long haul truckers, it also threatens to \nkeep them away from their families for longer durations. I think it is \nabout time we take a long hard look at the important role these \ntruckers play in our daily lives.\n  Whether it's a delivery to our local grocery or the transport of \npetroleum products, these truckers sacrifice time away from their \nfamilies to make our lives easier and better. Mr. President, I would \nlike to ask my colleagues to join me to ensure any hours of service \nproposal accomplishes three important goals: Ensure safety on our \nnation's highways; ensure truckers are not burdened with additional \ncosts; and ensure the final ruling will allow truckers to spend more of \ntheir non-driving time at home with their families. The current \nproposal fails miserably to address these matters.\n  Again, I would like to personally thank and commend the two \nindividual truckers for their heroism, but also commend all truckers \nfor their hard work and dedication to safety on our highways.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7824-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7824-S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF MR. JAMES E. KELLEY\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nhumanitarian work of James Kelley of Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n  For many years, Mr. Kelley has been known for his successes as an \nentrepreneur and philanthropist in Indiana. He founded the Kelley \nAutomotive group in 1952 which now employs over 1200 employees in both \nIndiana and Georgia. His dedication to public service has been evident \nthrough his service on the boards of the Fort Wayne Chamber of \nCommerce, Junior Achievement, Big Brothers and Big Sisters, the Boys \nand Girls Club of Fort Wayne, the YMCA, Fort Wayne National Bank, the \nFort Wayne Aviation Museum, and the Arthritis Foundation.\n  Recently, Mr. Kelley has devoted his energies to developing a grain \nbusiness in the Republic of Moldova. The Republic of Moldova is a small \ncountry approximately the size of Indiana with a population of 4.8 \nmillion people. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, \nMoldova has been struggling to successfully transition from a communist \nsystem to a democratic republic.\n  One of the greatest challenges facing this burgeoning country is that \nof economic development. In 1999 the per capita income in Moldova was \nonly $2,200 and inflation was at 43 percent. Through his purchase of a \ngrain elevator and his partnership with the farmers of Moldova, Mr. \nKelley has been able to loan local farmers feed, fertilizer, and fuel. \nIn the near future, he plans to introduce modern farming techniques \nthat will increase crop\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nyields. The Kelley Grain company is considered to be one of the primary \neconomic development initiatives in the nation, and Mr. Kelley's work \nhas been recognized by both the former and current prime ministers of \nMoldova.\n  In addition to his economic endeavors, Mr. Kelley has taken his \nphilanthropic activities abroad as well. While in Moldova, he noticed a \ndeficiency in their health care system and organized a medical team to \ntravel to Moldova. While there, this team trained physicians and nurses \nin techniques to implant pacemakers, provided much needed supplies for \ncardiovascular surgeries, provided consultation and echocardiographic \nimaging at the cardiology center, visited pediatric wards and \norphanages, and provided the rural city of Gaushen with antibiotics, \nblood pressure cuffs, and antihypertensive medications.\n  I would like to commend James Kelley for his efforts and tireless \ndedication to helping the people of this struggling country. His \nhumanitarian work in the Republic of Moldova can only enhance the \nrelationship between our two countries. I am honored to be able to \nrecognize his contributions and wish him continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7825-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING THE CALL D.C.\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, today, I rise to recognize The \nCall D.C., a group of young people who will gather in Washington, D.C. \nSeptember 2, 2000 to strengthen and renew their commitment to God, \ntheir families and their local communities.\n  The Call D.C. is a non-denominational gathering of youth and their \nparents, youth leaders, pastors, and Church leaders who are unified in \ntheir steadfast commitment to strengthening their faith in God and \ntheir concern for their local communities and our nation.\n  I have long been greatly concerned about the state of our culture, \nand the state of our society. Young people today are barraged with \nimages of violence, hate, and vulgarity that pour forth from our \nairwaves and our entertainment. The challenges young people face seem \nto grow more difficult, and more pervasive. Where once we, as a \nsociety, felt free to affirm faith in God, and adherence to high \nstandards, such beliefs are now often called into question.\n  It is thus even more exciting to see many young people, such as these \nyoung people, who are willing to lead by example and focus their \nefforts on steadily improving their families, communities and our \nnation. These young people, who represent communities and religions \nfrom around our nation, will come together on September 2 and use their \nassembly as a time to pray for strengthen their faith in God, their \ncommitment to their families through reconciling with their parents, \nand nurturing their walk with God.\n  These young people remind us of our solemn duty not just as parents, \nteachers, business leaders or public servants but as citizens of this \ngreat nation--``a nation under God . . .,'' I commend them for \nreminding us that we must first focus on God and he will strengthen us \nand enable us to build up our families, our local communities and our \nnation. I applaud all the participants of the Call D.C. and thank them \nfor their work and their commitment and their heart for God.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7825-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ON THE MARRIAGE OF MARK PRESTON AND MEREDITH RAY BONNER\n\n Mr. L.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nMark Preston and Meredith Ray Bonner on their recent wedding, which \ntook place on July 8, 2000, at the Holy Spirit Catholic Church in \nAtlanta, Georgia.

Mr. President, I rise today to join people in \nNew Jersey and throughout the nation in recognizing Colombia's 190 \nyears of independence from Spain. On July 20, 1810, the citizens of \nBogota created the first representative council to challenge Spanish \nauthority. Total independence was proclaimed in 1813, and in 1819 the \nRepublic of Greater Colombia was formed. In 1822, the United States \nbecame one of the first countries to recognize the new republic and to \nestablish a resident diplomatic mission.\n  In addition to recognizing the day of Colombia's independence, this \nis an excellent opportunity to celebrate the contributions of the \ngrowing population of Colombian-Americans in New Jersey and throughout \nthe United States. Almost 100,000 Colombian-Americans reside in \nNorthern New Jersey alone. The Colombian-American culture is vibrant \nand rich and it is important to acknowledge the impact it is having on \nour communities.\n  While Colombia boasts one of the oldest democracies in South America, \nthat democracy faces many serious challenges today. Celebrating this \nday of independence reminds us that Colombia has a long journey ahead \nas it works to overcome the problems of drug trafficking and rebel \nviolence that continue to plague its society. The United States \nCongress is committed to helping in that struggle in any way we can.\n  I commend the great accomplishments and contributions of the \nColombian-American community and as we join Colombian-Americans in \ncelebrating their nation's independence we also look to establishing \npeace and justice in their homeland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7825-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7825-S7826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      A TRIBUTE TO HENRI NSANJAMA\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to \nHenri Nsanjama, a champion of conservation who died on July 18, 2000. \nAt the time of his death, Mr. Nsanjama was serving as vice president \nand senior advisor on Africa and Madagascar for the World Wildlife Fund \nhere in Washington. Henri was an ardent supporter of measures to \nprotect Africa's elephants and of the United Nations Convention to \nCombat Desertification. I worked with him on both of these important \nissues. Henri would have been pleased to know that the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee is scheduled to vote in September to recommend that \nthe full Senate ratify the Desertification Convention. So far, 168 \ncountries have ratified the Desertification Convention and the U.S. is \nthe only major industrial nation that has not done so. Henri worked \nhard to change that and ensure that biodiversity is protected in Africa \nand other parts of the world facing desertification.\n  A native of Malawi, Henri dedicated his life to the challenge of \nlinking wildlife conservation with the needs of local communities. He \nbelieved that the most challenging aspect of his work was conserving \nwildlife without undue hardship to human beings.\n  Henri built his distinguished career through formal education and \nhands-on field work. He served as a Trainee Game Ranger in his native \nMalawi, where he recalled being inspired by the sight of more wild \nanimals than people. He attended the College of African Wildlife \nManagement in Mweka, Tanzania, and became a Warden at Kasungu National \nPark in Central Malawi.\n  Henri then moved to the United States, and earned a Bachelor's Degree \nin wildlife biology and natural resources economics at the University \nof Massachusetts at Amherst. After Amherst, Henri returned home to \nKasungu National Park and eventually was hired as Malawi's Deputy \nDirector of National Parks and Wildlife. Three years later, he attended \nthe University of Stirling, Scotland, where he received a Master's \nDegree in environmental management.\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\n  Anxious to apply his new knowledge, Henri returned home once again to \nbecome the Director of National Parks and Wildlife for Malawi. He also \nserved as the Coordinator of Wildlife Activities of the ten countries \nof the Southern African Development Coordination.\n  In 1989, Henri was nominated Chairman of the Standing Committee of \nthe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a post he \nheld for a year before beginning work with WWF in 1990. Henri led WWF's \nprogram in Africa for 10 years. During that time he focused in \nparticular on the areas of building the capacity of people and \ninstitutions to manage natural resources, community based natural \nresources management, protected areas management and species \nconservation. He was co-author of ``Voices from Africa: Local \nPerspectives on Conservation.''\n  A strong African voice for conservation, Henri also knew how to reach \nAmericans. About Henri, Kathryn Fuller, President of WWF, said, \n``Throughout his 10 years with WWF, Henri was an inspirational \nambassador for conservation with the American public and our partners \nin Africa. He was also at the forefront of efforts to include women in \nconservation and increase their educational opportunities.''\n  Beyond his professional accomplishments, Henri is remembered as a \ngifted storyteller who touched the lives of everyone he encountered. In \na profile five years ago, he was asked to describe his idea of perfect \nhappiness. He answered, ``As a Christian, it's believing in what good \nwas given to you and to be able to do good things for others. This is \nmy 19th year of working in conservation. I've never done anything else \nand I never want to.''\n  In Henri's honor, the World Wildlife Fund will establish a fund to \nensure that Africans are given the opportunity to care for and manage \ntheir natural resources, a fitting tribute for one who believed so \nstrongly in the importance of empowering Africa's people to sustainably \nmanage their natural heritage.\n  Henri's funeral in Malawi this week was attended by 3,000 people, \nincluding eight ministers of the Malawian government. He was clearly \nloved and respected by many and has left a lasting legacy of \nsustainable management of wildlife and wildlands in Africa. For this we \nshould all be enormously grateful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7826-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7826-S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CARDINAL ROGER MAHONY\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have spoken several times on the floor \nthis year about the flaws that plague our nation's administration of \nthe death penalty. I am not alone in raising this issue. The American \nBar Association, the Reverend Pat Robertson, the NAACP, the National \nUrban League, and many other organizations and individuals have added \ntheir voices to the chorus of voices supporting a moratorium on \nexecutions. A moratorium would allow time to review the system by which \nwe impose the sentence of death. The National Conference of Catholic \nBishops and United States Catholic Conference are among those groups \nwho agree that it is time to pause.\n  I rise today to share with my colleagues the statement of Cardinal \nRoger Mahony, the Archbishop of Los Angeles. At the National Press Club \nhere in Washington in May, Cardinal Mahony spoke eloquently in support \nof a moratorium on executions. He said, ``the time is right for a \ngenuine and reasoned national dialogue.'' In a letter to me, he later \nsaid, ``the obvious inequities that surround the death penalty are \ntruly shameful.''\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a moment to read his statement. And \nlet us begin the reasoned national dialogue here, in the United States \nSenate. Mr. President, I ask that the full text of Cardinal Mahony's \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n         [The National Press Club Washington, DC, May 25, 2000]\n\n      A Witness To Life: The Catholic Church and the Death Penalty\n\n     (Address by Cardinal Roger Mahony, Archbishop of Los Angeles)\n\n       Good afternoon. As I begin my remarks, I would like to \n     thank John Cushman and the Board of Governors of the National \n     Press Club for the invitation to speak before you this \n     afternoon. I would also like to acknowledge the members of \n     the United States Catholic Conference Committees on Domestic \n     and International Policy as well as staff from the United \n     States Conference who are joining me for today's program. \n     Finally, I would like to extend a special welcome to Frank \n     and Ellen McNeirney, the co-founders and co-directors of \n     Catholics Against Capital Punishment.\n       I come to this prestigious forum as a pastor who has \n     witnessed firsthand the irreparable pain and sorrow caused by \n     violence in our communities and in our nation. I have \n     presided at the funerals of police officers killed in the \n     line of duty. I have sought to console and comfort families \n     who have lost children to gang violence and drive-by-\n     shootings. I have heard the concerns and fears of parents who \n     live--day in and day out--surrounded by the violence that \n     haunts their neighborhoods.\n       As a Catholic priest, I have seen the pain of those whose \n     lives have been forever altered by the loss of a loved one to \n     senseless murder. Their own struggles have tested not only \n     their faith but the faith of those who walk with them. As \n     their own quest for healing has brought them closer to God, \n     their witness has been a light of hope to those who accompany \n     them.\n       The cost of crime and violence is real. It is measured in \n     the lives of parents, children, and families, not anonymous \n     statistics. The hopes, dreams, and human potential that will \n     never be realized are a loss to each one of us.\n       I believe the Gospel teaches that people are responsible \n     for their actions. I believe that the reality of sin demands \n     that those who injure others must make reparation. But I do \n     not believe that society is make safer, that our communities \n     are made whole, or that our social fabric is strengthened by \n     killing those who kill others. Instead, the death penalty \n     perpetuates an insidious cycle of violence that, in the end, \n     diminishes all of us.\n       For many Catholics, Pope John Paul II's visit to the United \n     States in January, 1999 was a turning point on this issue. In \n     calling the abolition of the death penalty an authentically \n     pro-life position, he challenged Catholics to protect not \n     only innocent human life, as we do in opposing abortion and \n     euthanasia, but also to defend the lives of those who may \n     have done great evil by taking the life of another. To \n     demonstrate this conviction in a dramatic and personal way, \n     he appealed for the life of Darrell Mease whose execution was \n     postponed in deference to the People's visit.\n       The words and actions of Pope John Paul II in St. Louis \n     brought renewed attention to the debate on the death penalty. \n     It provided renewed moral support to those who have worked \n     tirelessly over the last several decades for an end to \n     capital punishment, and placed the Catholic Church even \n     more squarely on the side of those calling for its \n     abolition.\n       In articulating a consistent ethic of life, the late \n     Cardinal Joseph Bernardin provided the framework for a \n     ``sustained moral vision.'' It now appears that this \n     consistent moral vision is beginning to take root and gain \n     ground. A recent article in America magazine notes that pro-\n     life Catholics are far more likely to reject capital \n     punishment than Catholics who do not embrace the Church's \n     stand on abortion. Among these pro-lifers, fifty-two percent \n     reject the death penalty while support among all Catholics--\n     in 1998--remained at around 70 percent. While we still have \n     work to do in our community, it is clear that this consistent \n     ethic of life is resonating in the pro-life community.\n       I recognize that there are distinct differences between \n     abortion and the death penalty. But like abortion, the death \n     penalty remains one of the more contentious and volatile \n     issues facing the nation. It is an issue steeped in deep \n     emotion. It is a topic that evokes visceral responses from \n     supporters and opponents alike. It is a debate that, \n     unfortunately, often generates more heat than light, more \n     passion than persuasion.\n       Among the signs that the nation as a whole may be taking a \n     new look at the death penalty is a recent ABC poll that \n     indicates support for the death penalty is a recent ABC poll \n     that indicates support for the death penalty has dropped to \n     64 percent from nearly 70 percent just a few years ago. And \n     in a Time magazine online poll, 43 percent of respondents \n     expressed support for abolition of the death penalty.\n       This gradual shift is remarkable given that virtually no \n     elected leader in the last decade has made the case against \n     the death penalty. It is worth noting that in the last two \n     elections, presidential candidates from both parties \n     supported capital punishment. In some cases, candidates went \n     to great lengths to advertise their supported capital \n     punishment. In some cases, candidates went to great lengths \n     to advertise their support throughout their campaigns. Both \n     President Clinton and Governor Bush halted their presidential \n     campaigns to reject appeals to delay executions in highly \n     publicized cases.\n       In California, 565 inmates await execution on death row. \n     Unfortunately, support for the death penalty is one of the \n     few things that unites politicians of both political parties.\n       So the fact that, in the face of almost universal support \n     among elected officials, the death penalty is slowly losing \n     support among the public at-large is hope that the tide may \n     be turning.\n       Movies such as ``Dead Man Walking'' and the ``The Green \n     Mile,'' and TV shows such as\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\n     ``The Practice'' and ``West Wing'' have brought the moral \n     complexity of the issue to a much broader audience. The \n     courage of Illinois Governor George Ryan and the work of \n     lawyers, journalists and students have focused attention on \n     the fact that innocent people are on death row.\n       In the midst of this debate, the most persuasive and \n     challenging voices continued to be the victims. One of the \n     most visible is Pope John Paul II. He has never fully \n     recovered from the gun wounds that nearly killed him. But his \n     own attack became an example for us all when he reached out \n     in forgiveness to his assailant and called for the abolition \n     of the death penalty. Other victims and families are less \n     known, but no less inspiring or heroic.\n       There is Bud Welch, a Texaco dealer who lost his only \n     daughter, Julie, in the bombing that destroyed the Oklahoma \n     City Federal Building. He turned his own anger into a search \n     for justice and reconciliation. He was denied an opportunity \n     to testify at Timothy McVeigh's trial because of his \n     opposition to the death penalty--a position that Julie \n     also shared. Undeterred, he has carried his message to \n     hundreds of groups arguing that capital punishment only \n     deepens the emotional wounds opened by the initial act of \n     violence. He has met with members of the Timothy McVeigh \n     family knowing that they also suffer terribly from their \n     son's crime.\n       The witness of Pope John Paul II, Bud Welch and others \n     strikes me as the modern day embodiment of Jesus Christ's \n     message of hope, forgiveness and reconciliation. It is an \n     affirmation that the answer to violence cannot be more \n     violence.\n       In the Catholic Church, teaching on the death penalty has \n     developed over time. For centuries, the Church accepted the \n     right of the state to take a life in order to protect \n     society. But over time and in the light of new realities, \n     Catholic teaching now recognizes that there are non-violent \n     means to protect society and to hold offenders accountable. \n     Church teaching now clearly argues for the abolition of \n     capital punishment.\n       In the Catechism of the Catholic Church, the conditions \n     under which a life can be taken--even to protect the lives of \n     others--have been narrowed significantly. Specifically, the \n     Catechism states:\n       ``If bloodless means are sufficient to defend human lives \n     against an aggressor and to protect public order and the \n     safety of persons, public authority should limit itself to \n     such means, because they better correspond to the concrete \n     conditions of the common good and are more in conformity to \n     the dignity of the human person.''\n       How do these principles that uphold human life and dignity \n     apply to the complex matter of capital punishment? In \n     reflecting on Catholic teaching, we must conclude that ``even \n     the most hardened criminal remains a human person, created in \n     God's image, and possessing a dignity, value, and worth which \n     must be recognized, promoted, safeguarded and defended.'' \n     Simply put, we believe that every person is sacred, every \n     life is precious--even the life of one who has violated the \n     rights of others by taking a life. Human dignity is not \n     qualified by what we do. It cannot be earned or forfeited. \n     Human dignity is an irrevocable character of each and every \n     person.\n       In the last decade, the Holy Father has reminded us that \n     the purpose of punishment should never be vengeance. Rather, \n     it is a ``condition for the offender to regain the exercise \n     of his or her freedom. In this way authority also fulfills \n     the purpose of defending public order and ensuring people's \n     safety, while at the same time offering the offender an \n     incentive and help to change his or her behavior and be \n     rehabilitated.\n       The Pope states that ``. . . the nature and extent of \n     punishment must be carefully evaluated and decided upon, and \n     ought not go to the extreme of executing the offender except \n     in cases of absolute necessity; in other words, when it would \n     not be possible otherwise to defend society.'' He goes on to \n     say ``. . . as a result of steady improvements in the \n     organization of the penal system, such cases are very rare, \n     if not practically non-existent.''\n       The reality is that the penal system in the United States, \n     perhaps better than all other countries, has the ability to \n     permanently isolate dangerous individuals.\n       Now, even some death penalty supporters are becoming \n     increasingly uncomfortable with the status quo. The arbitrary \n     manner in which the death penalty is sometimes applied; \n     the disproportionate number of racial and ethnic \n     minorities and low-income persons on death row; the fiscal \n     burdens borne by penal institutions; and, most \n     disturbingly, the mounting evidence that innocent people \n     have been convicted and sentenced to death--all these \n     factors have sown considerable doubt in the minds of \n     elected officials and the public at-large.\n       In many states, underfunded and overworked defense \n     attorneys struggle to keep up with large caseloads. It is \n     simply unacceptable that defendants charged with capital \n     crimes should have to rely on counsel that is underfunded, \n     inexperienced, or simply incompetent.\n       A wide range of voices is calling for an end to the death \n     penalty or a moratorium on executions. Governor Ryan of \n     Illinois, a supporter of the death penalty, suspended \n     executions in his State until its capital punishment \n     apparatus could be thoroughly examined. He has stated that he \n     will reinstate the death penalty only if the commission \n     studying the issue can provide a ``100 percent guarantee'' \n     that the Illinois system is flawless.\n       In New Hampshire, the legislature last week passed a \n     measure to ban capital punishment only to have it vetoed by \n     Governor Jeanne Shaheen.\n       And in the Supreme Court, questions have been raised again \n     about the circumstances under which death row inmates have \n     been tried and sentenced.\n       In Congress, Senator Patrick Leahy and Representatives Ray \n     LaHood and Bill Delahunt have introduced legislation that \n     would, among other things:\n       Ensure that defendants have access to exculpatory DNA \n     evidence when available;\n       Require states to provide competent defense counsel; and\n       Limit the federal government's authority to pursue the \n     death penalty for federal crimes committed in states without \n     capital punishment.\n       Senator Russell Feingold has introduced a bill to abolish \n     the death penalty at the federal level and Representative \n     Jesse Jackson, Jr. has joined him in introducing bills that \n     would institute a moratorium on the use of the death penalty.\n       We support these and other bills that would end the death \n     penalty or, at the very least, postpone or commute some \n     sentences while exposing fundamental flaws in the current \n     administration of capital punishment.\n  It is in this light that I have written today to Gray Davis, Governor \nof California, calling on him to institute a moratorium on the death \npenalty while the California system can be thoroughly assessed and the \ninequities, weaknesses, and biases in the process can be revealed \nfully.\n  All these initiatives, taken together, are signs of growing \nskepticism about the system under which the death penalty is currently \napplied. While I support these efforts, the long-term goal is not \nsimply to make the application of the death penalty free from bias, \ninequity, or human error. Instead, these efforts should be steps \ntowards a public dialogue that ultimately brings a permanent end to \nstate executions. As the campaign to ban partial birth abortions has \ncast new light on the morality of abortion, these partial steps against \nthe death penalty can create awareness of the fundamental moral \nproblems with capital punishment. The time is right for a genuine and \nreasoned national dialogue.\n       A recently formed independent commission to study issues of \n     procedure, innocence, and other legal aspects of the system \n     is significant and my fellow bishop, Cardinal William Keeler \n     of Baltimore, has agreed to serve on that commission. But we \n     must expand the dialogue beyond the legal problems to address \n     the moral and human dimensions of the death penalty. This \n     dialogue should be happening not only in commissions, but \n     also in our communities, in our churches and homes, and in \n     newspapers and other public forums.\n       In the end, we are deceiving ourselves if we believe we can \n     fix the current death penalty system to make it more humane \n     and just. Social, political and economic factors make a \n     complete overhaul of the system doubtful. Moral and ethical \n     questions make such an endeavor impossible.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As we have pointed out in previous statements, the death \n     penalty is further indication of a culture of violence that \n     haunts our nation. Sadly, we are the most violent nation on \n     earth not currently at war. It is reflected in our movies and \n     music, our television and video games, in our homes, schools, \n     and on our streets. More ominously, our society is tempted to \n     solve some of our more significant social problems with \n     violence. Consider this:\n       Abortion is promoted to deal with difficult or unwanted \n     pregnancies.\n       Euthanasia and assisted suicide are suggested as a remedy \n     for the burdens of age and illness.\n       Capital punishment is marketed as the answer to deal with \n     violent crime.\n       A nation that destroys its young, abandons its elderly, and \n     relies on vengeance is in serious moral trouble.\n       The Catholic Bishops of the United States join with Pope \n     John Paul II in a recommitment to end the death penalty. Our \n     faith calls us to be ``unconditionally pro-life.'' We will \n     work not only to proclaim our anti-death position, but to \n     persuade others that increasing reliance on capital \n     punishment diminishes society as a whole.\n       In addition, we recommit to work with our community of \n     faith to combat crime and violence, to turn our prisons from \n     warehouses of human failure and seedbeds of violence, to \n     places of rehabilitation and recovery. We will stand with \n     victims of crime and seek real justice and accountability for \n     them and their families.\n       Simple solutions rarely address difficult problems. What is \n     needed is a moral revolution that results in genuine respect \n     for every human life--especially the unborn and the poor, the \n     crime victims and even the violent offender. In the end, our \n     society will be measured by how we treat ``the least among \n     us.'' It challenges each person to defend human life in every \n     circumstance and situation. It calls on our leaders and the \n     media to\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\n     seek the common good and not appeal to our worst instincts.\n       This is a time for a new ethic--justice without vengeance. \n     Let us come together to hold people accountable for their \n     actions, to resist and condemn violence, to stand with \n     victims of crime and to insist that those who destroy \n     community, answer to the community. But let us also remember \n     that we cannot restore life by taking life, that vengeance \n     cannot heal and that all of us must find new ways to defend \n     human life and dignity in a far too violence society.\n       This will be a long struggle. It begins by raising new \n     doubts about the death penalty. It will require new and more \n     serious efforts to address crime and reform prisons. But in \n     the end, we cannot practice what we condemn. We cannot defend \n     life by taking life. We cannot contain violence by using \n     state violence.\n       In this new century, we join with others in taking a \n     prophetic stand to end the death penalty. In doing so, we \n     hope to share a new vision of society that is unambiguous and \n     consistent in its defense of life. It will demand the courage \n     and faith of many to see us through a long and challenging \n     process of dialogue and conversion. It is a challenge, \n     however, that is worth our best efforts.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7828-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MIKE AND JOANNE DUNCAN\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mike \nand Joanne Duncan of Inez, Kentucky, for the successful internship \nprogram they continue to run for students in eastern Kentucky.\n  Mike and his wife Joanne founded an innovative summer-internship \nprogram in 1977 with the hope of encouraging young people to continue \nto work and live in their home state after college. To date, more than \n100 people have participated in Mike and Joanne's program and have had \nthe opportunity to intern at local businesses or participate in other \nleadership-building projects around the community. This program has \ngiven students a place to exchange ideas with each other and community \nprofessionals to help them prepare for their career. It is through \nexperiences such as these that Mike and Joanne have helped to show \ninterns that they can make a difference in their corner of the world. \nThe program the Duncan's have created gives students an opportunity to \nsee first-hand what the real, working world is like in their hometown \nand often results in the students' desire to return home after college \nto share their talents and skills with the community of their youth.\n  Mike and Joanne's work is known and appreciated throughout eastern \nKentucky, and throughout the nation. In 1996, Mike was called the \n``Mentor to Eastern Kentucky,'' by the Journal of the Appalachian \nRegional Commission. Also, the Los Angeles Times once described the \ninternship program as being ``more akin to adoption.'' The impact of \nthe Duncan's work reaches across county and state lines, and is surely \nan example for similar programs across the United States.\n  Mike and Joanne display an unswerving commitment to the people of \nKentucky and possess the gratitude and respect of many. Their \ndedication to helping young Kentuckians succeed through countless hours \nof counseling and tutoring over the last 23 years is indeed admirable.\n  Congratulations, Mike and Joanne, on your tremendous success, and \nthank you for your many generous years of service to eastern Kentucky's \nyouth.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Heidi \nKirk Duffy upon her receipt of the Order of Merit of the Federal \nRepublic of Germany, First Class.\n  Heidi was selected to receive the Order of Merit to recognize her \n``outstanding contribution to the development of academic and economic \ninterchanges between universities and companies of the United States \nand the Federal Republic of Germany.'' The Order of Merit will be \nbestowed upon Heidi in particular recognition of her commitment to the \ncultivation of a strong relationship between the University of Rhode \nIsland's International Engineering Program and the Federal Republic of \nGermany.\n  A native of the Dusseldorf area, Heidi is currently the Chair of the \nAdvisory Board of the University of Rhode Island's International \nEngineering Program. At the conclusion of this five-year program, \ngraduates receive two degrees, one in English and the other in German. \nRecently, the University of Rhode Island has also added degrees in \nSpanish and French. This International Engineering Program is \nconsidered to be one of the most unique programs of its kind in \nAmerican higher education.\n  Under her direction, the University of Rhode Island's Engineering \nProgram provides both German and American students a global education. \nDue to Heidi's dedication and hard work, the Program has been truly \nsuccessful in strengthening a transatlantic relationship between the \nUnited States and the Federal Republic of Germany.\n  Heidi was notified earlier this year by the Consul General of the \nFederal Republic of Germany, Dr. P.C. Hauswedell, that she had been \nselected to receive the Order of Merit. The Verdienstkreuz 1. Klasse \ndes Verdlenstordens der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, as it is known in \nGerman, is one of the highest honors give to civilians by the Federal \nRepublic.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nFarmington Public School District of Farmington, Michigan, for its \noutstanding achievement in music education. It was ranked number one \n(along with Coppell, Texas) on the list of 100 best communities in \nAmerica for school music programs. This is a very special honor which \nemphasizes the importance of arts education to the lives of our \nchildren.\n  The rankings were the result of a first-ever nationwide survey of \nmore than 5,800 public schools and independent teachers, district \nadministrators, school board members, parents, and community leaders \nrepresenting communities in all 50 states. The web-based survey \nassessed many aspects of music education, such as funding, \nparticipation, student-teacher ratios, and quality of facilities. The \nresults indicate that superior programs exist both in areas that \npossess a wealth of monetary and material resources, as well as in \nthose that must rely on more innovative means of funding and \nimplementing ambitious educational endeavors. The key element of \nsuccess, found in each of the top 100 communities, is the dedication \nand support of parents, teachers, school decision-makers, and community \nleaders. This landmark survey highlights the efforts of people who \ntruly value quality music education and strive to make it a reality for \ntoday's youth.\n  The partnership that sponsored the study was comprised of the \ncountry's top organizations devoted to music and learning. National \nSchool Boards Association President, Clarice Chambers, commented on the \nsignificance of the results: ``We already know that students who \nparticipate in music programs tend to be high achievers. Now we can use \nthe data generated by this survey to identify the common \ncharacteristics of exemplary music programs. This information will be \ninvaluable to school boards and communities as they go about the work \nof raising student achievement in their own school districts.'' \nScientific research has revealed the impact of music education on a \nchild's cognitive abilities, self-discipline, communication, and \nteamwork skills. The self-confidence gained through artistic \naccomplishment encourages kids to avoid drugs and alcohol and channel \ntheir energy into positive activities. Farmington's musical education \nprogram will serve as a model for shaping young lives in school \ndistricts across the nation.\n  I applaud the City of Farmington for the wonderful music education \nprogram that it has established. It has truly earned its status as \nAmerica's best place for music education, and I am sure will be a \nleader in the cultivation of musical talent for many years. On behalf \nof the entire United States Senate, I congratulate the City of\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\nFarmington, and wish the music education program continued success in \nthe future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7829-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7829]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING DR.

He did his \nresidency in OB-GYN in Yankton, South Dakota, at the University of \nSouth Dakota Affiliated Hospital, from 1972 to 1976. He also held a \nresidency in gynecologic oncology at Duke University, from 1976 to \n1978.\n  After finishing his schooling in medicine, Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh returned \nto South Dakota where he served as the Director of the OB-GYN Student \nTeaching Program from 1981 to 1985, and an Associate Professor from \n1980 to 1985, at the University of South Dakota School of Medicine. \nWhen not practicing medicine, Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh is writing about it. He \nis the author of numerous articles on gynecology and oncology. The \ncommunity in which he practices is important to him and he has hosted \nseveral workshops and presentations as a free service to inform the \npublic and increase cancer awareness, particularly concerning women's \nhealth issues.\n  Dr. Abu-Ghazaleh is a member of the North Central Cancer Treatment \nGroup, the Gynecologic Oncology Group, and the American College of \nGynecologists. He has also been a member of the National Cancer \nInstitute. Beginning in 1985, he has continued to serve as a Fellow of \nAmerican College of Surgeons.

The members of the 1965 class have served with \ndistinction in promoting world peace and harmony and working in many \ndifferent places around the world, in a variety of professional, \nbusiness, and public service positions to promote: freedom through \ninternational cooperation and effective defense policies; prosperity by \nmeans of international trade; democracy in new and developing nations \nby helping people understand how to build socially responsible \nsocieties based on democratic principles; and justice through the \npromotion of a better global understanding of the destiny of humankind \nto live in freedom from fear, hunger, want, and disease; and\n  Many in the Class of 1965 have served both in the U.S. Foreign \nService, as well as in various positions in the U.S. Congress; and \nothers have served in a variety of capacities in federal and state \nagencies, helping the United States to fulfill its role of leadership \nand responsibility in the world community.\n  I commend the Class of 1965 for the achievements and contributions \nthat its members have made to promote better understanding among the \npeople of the world and to bring hope to those who seek a better life \nfor all the world's citizens. The United States Senate congratulates \nthe class of 1965 of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy on its 35th \nreunion and conveys best wishes to its members for good health, \nprosperity, and much happiness in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7829-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7829-S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO RICHARD CYR--JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Richard Cyr upon receiving the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis \nAward for outstanding public service.\n  In a time where random acts of kindness seem to be waning, Richard \nhas proven that kind souls are still in abundance. He has established \none of the most important volunteer efforts in the state, if not the \ncountry. Richard formed David's House, a program for the parents of \nsick children that provides much-needed support and love during \ncritical times of treatment programs. It is this tireless dedication to \nhelping others that garnered Richard a national award for this efforts.\n  Richard understood how difficult it was for families of sick children \nto remain close to their loved ones without having to add hotel costs \nto the growing number of bills. He was in the same situation himself \nwhen his foster child, David, became ill with acute lymphocytic \nleukemia. Richard spent countless nights sleeping in his car or in the \nhospital lobby to be closer to his child. After David's death, he \ndecided\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nthat a safe refuge for families was necessary during illness.\n  David's House gives parents the ability to concentrate on their \nchildren without worrying about where to sleep, eat or shower during \nhospital visits. The House is staffed entirely by volunteers and \nreceives donations from private sources. After fifteen years of \noperation, David's House has assisted hundreds of families and eased \nthe pain of coping with illness. Such stability and growth is a \ntestament of the true importance and need for institutions like David's \nHouse.\n  Richard's dedication to helping others in a grave time of need is \ntruly inspirational. It is an honor to represent him in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7830-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO THE BELKNAP COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT GROUP\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Ruth genuinely \ncares for the people of the seacoast and thinks of everyone as her \nchildren to some degree. Her unfaltering commitment to assisting those \nin need or in crisis has touched the lives of many and garnered her an \naward for her efforts.\n  Aside from participating in countless community service events and \nprograms, Ruth served on the Portsmouth School Board and the Police \nCommission. She extended her service beyond the seacoast to all of New \nHampshire by serving terms in the New Hampshire State House and Senate. \nShe currently serves as one of the governor's executive councilors. \nRuth gives one hundred percent of her time and efforts to bettering the \nlives of those less fortunate.

Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort for their designation as \none of the Businesses of the Decade by Business New Hampshire Magazine.\n  For the past ten years, under the direction of partners Joel and \nCathy Bedard, the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort has become a \ncornerstone of the White Mountain Community, providing not only a place \nfor the people of New Hampshire to rest and relax, but giving back to \nthe surrounding community as well.\n  The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort had not been locally owned \nuntil 1991, after several failed business ventures attempted to \ncapitalize on the property. The hard work and dedication of each \nindividual who worked on renovating and revitalizing the hotel is truly \ncommendable. As a result, the Mount Washington Hotel and Resort was \nsaved from demolition and currently thrives as one of New Hampshire's \ngreatest treasures.\n  The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort is the largest employer in the \nlocal economy, providing 450 jobs in the summer months and 550 \nthroughout the winter season. They are also an active member of their \ncommunity, lending their support to programs such as New Hampshire \nPublic Television, the Littleton Regional Hospital Auxiliary and other \nworthy programs and causes.\n  The Mount Washington Hotel and Resort is a true friend to the people \nof New Hampshire. Their efforts over the past ten years are truly \ncommendable, and it is an honor to represent them in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7832-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TRIBUTE TO OLDE PORT BANK--NH BUSINESS IN THE ARTS AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Olde Port Bank for its recognition as a 2000 New Hampshire \n``Business in the Arts'' award winner in the small company category.\n  Olde Port Bank proves that time and money are not the only key \nfactors necessary for the successful continuation of arts programs. \nThey have provided exhibit space in its offices and lobbies and \npromoted the activities of employees and customers who are artists as \nwell. It is this sort of personal attention and support that make \nvarious programs available to the local community. The bank also \nunderstands the importance of a strong financial backbone, and helps to \nsecure loans and credit lines so that the arts can remain part of the \nseacoast community.\n  The Children's Museum of Portsmouth is one such grateful recipient of \nOlde Port Bank's efforts. The bank has given generous financial support \nfor an endowment fund to the museum and established corporate \nmembership and sponsorship. Bank employees spend countless hours \nassisting the museum in many of its events and activities. This sort of \nhigh participation is a testament to the staff's deep dedication to \nmaking the arts more accessible to the Portsmouth community.\n  Olde Port Bank recognizes the importance of arts in education and the \ncommunity. Forty percent of the bank's contributions budget is \nearmarked for arts organizations in the Portsmouth area, and this \nsupport is consistently growing each year. This company recognizes \ntheir power to lead by example, both economically and physically.\n  Without the support of dedicated businesses like Olde Port Bank, the \narts would not be able to flourish in New Hampshire. Olde Port Bank \ntruly signifies the deep personal commitment of small businesses across \nthe state to supporting the causes that make New Hampshire one's chosen \nplace to call home. It is an honor to serve them in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7832-4", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO LILLIAN NOEL--PAUL HARRIS FELLOW AWARD WINNER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to Lillian ``Billie'' Noel for her recognition as the \nPortsmouth Rotary Club's ``Paul Harris Fellow'' award winner.\n  Billie's deep commitment to preserving New Hampshire's precious \nwoodlands is truly commendable. Instead of selling 35 acres of land to \ndevelopers, Billie sold it at a reduced price to preservationists, \nensuring the land will remain untouched for a long time. It is because \nof her dedication to assuring the future of New Hampshire's forests \nthat she was honored by the Portsmouth Rotary Club in option for \npreservation over profit.\n  Billie made the decision to sell her property for $600,000 to the \nSociety for the Protection of New Hampshire's Forests, even though it \nis worth three times that amount. This generous sale will ensure that \nthe scenic waterfront property is not touched by developers. One of the \nlast remaining undeveloped pieces of land in the fast-growing seacoast \narea, residents would have lost a treasured piece of their New \nHampshire heritage had it been sold to developers. The Society plans to \nadd walking paths and areas to picnic and bird watch, preserving the \nland's charm and scenic appeal. Billie's contribution to New \nHampshire's citizens proves that there are still people dedicated to \nsaving nature's delicacy rather than making a mere profit. It is this \ntype of private initiative which keeps New Hampshire as the beautiful \n``Live Free or Die'' state.\n  New Hampshire is lucky to have citizens like Billie who are committed \nto saving our state's beautiful lands. Our state's scenic areas are too \nprecious to lose and I commend Billie for her hard work and dedication \nto the environment. It is an honor to represent Billie in the United \nStates Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7832-5", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7832-S7833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE SUSAN B.

Carbon upon receiving the ``Frank \nRowe Kenison'' award for her contributions to New Hampshire citizens \nthrough the field of Law and Justice.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n  The ``Frank Rowe Kenison'' award was established to recognize those \nindividuals who, through the administration of justice, the legal \nprofession or the advancement of legal thought, have worked towards \nimproving the lives of New Hampshire citizens.\n  Susan has bettered the life of hundreds if not thousands of New \nHampshire citizens through her pursuit of justice. Her personal and \nprofessional journeys have inspired her to seek an end to family \nviolence.\n  As president of the New Hampshire Bar Association, Susan was \ninstrumental in establishing the Family Violence Conference. She has \nalso served as a member of the Executive Committee for the Governor's \nCommission on Domestic & Sexual Violence and a trustee for the National \nCouncil of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. This involvement has \nallowed her to combat domestic violence on a national level.\n  Susan's tireless dedication to domestic violence prevention is a \ntestament to the philosophy of Frank Rowe Kenison, who stated ``The \nSupreme Court and the Judiciary of this State will continue to maintain \nand guard its house justice for the humble as well as the powerful, for \nthe poor as well as the rich, for the minority as well as the majority \nand for the unpopular as well as the popular.''\n  In her many years in the legal profession, Susan Carbon has carried \nout Rowe's vision of justice. She has turned to the most sacred and \npowerful groups within society and the family in order to ensure that \neach individual is able to live without the fear of impending violence.\n  Susan's dedication to her profession, ending domestic violence and to \nher surrounding community is remarkable. It is both an honor and a \ngreat pleasure to represent her in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7833-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO WALTER GALLO UPON HIS RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

He has been active with the Council for the \nAdvancement and Support of Education, the National Society of Fund \nRaising Executives, Catholic Medical Center, New Hampshire Center for \nthe Preforming Arts, the National Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, \nNew Horizons for New Hampshire, the Manchester Diocese School \nDevelopment Committee and the Bedford Library Foundation.\n  Walter Gallo is truly an extraordinary individual. He has worked \ntirelessly and selflessly for Saint Anselm's College, the surrounding \ncommunities, the state and several national organizations while still \nfinding time for his family and his personal hobbies which include \nItalian culture, reading, carpentry and sports.\n  I commend Walter and wish him the best upon his retirement.

A bill to clarify that certain penalties provided for in the \nOil Pollution Act of 1990 are the exclusive criminal penalties for any \naction or activity that may arise or occur in connection with certain \ndischarges of oil or a hazardous substance; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n        Strict Criminal Liability Reform for Oil Spill Incidents\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \naddress a long-standing problem which adversely affects the safe and \nreliable maritime transport of oil products. The legislation I am \nintroducing today will eliminate the application and use of strict \ncriminal liability statutes, statutes that do not require a showing of \ncriminal intent or even the slightest degree of negligence, for \nmaritime transportation-related oil spill incidents.\n  Through comprehensive Congressional action that led to the enactment \nand implementation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, commonly referred \nto as ``OPA90'', the United States has successfully reduced the number \nof oil spills in the maritime environment and has established a \ncooperative public/private partnership to respond effectively in the \ndiminishing number of situations when an oil spill occurs. Nonetheless, \nover the past decade, the use of the unrelated strict criminal \nliability statutes that I referred to above has undermined the spill \nprevention and response objectives of OPA90, the very objectives that \nwere established by the Congress to preserve the environment, safeguard \nthe public welfare, and promote the safe transportation of oil. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will restore the delicate balance of \ninterests reached in OPA90, and will reaffirm OPA90's preeminent role \nas the statute providing the exclusive criminal penalties for oil spill \nincidents.\n  As stated in the Coast Guard's own environmental enforcement \ndirective, a company, its officers, employees, and mariners, in the \nevent of an oil spill ``could be convicted and sentenced to a criminal \nfine even where [they] took all reasonable precautions to avoid the \ndischarge''. Accordingly, responsible operators in my home state of \nLouisiana and elsewhere in the United States who transport oil are \nunavoidably exposed to potentially immeasurable criminal fines and, in \nthe worst case scenario, jail time. Not only is this situation unfairly \ntargeting an industry that plays an extremely important role in our \nnational economy, but it also works contrary to the public welfare.\n  Most liquid cargo transportation companies on the coastal and inland \nwaterway system of the United States have embraced safe operation and \nrisk management as two of their most important and fundamental values. \nFor example, members of the American Waterways Operators (AWO) from \nLouisiana and other states have implemented stronger safety programs \nthat have significantly reduced personal injuries to mariners. Tank \nbarge fleets have been upgraded through construction of new state-of-\nthe-art double hulled tank barges while obsolete single skin barges are \nbeing retired far in advance of the OPA90 timetable. Additionally, AWO \nmembers have dedicated significant time and financial resources to \nprovide continuous and comprehensive education and training for vessel \ncaptains, crews and shoreside staff, not only in the operation of \nvessels but also in preparation for all contingencies that could occur \nin the transportation of oil products. This commitment to marine safety \nand environmental protection by responsible members of the oil \ntransportation industry is real. The industry continues to work closely \nwith the Coast Guard to upgrade regulatory standards in such key areas \nas towing vessel operator qualifications and navigation equipment on \ntowing vessels.\n  Through the efforts of AWO and other organizations, the maritime \ntransportation industry has achieved an outstanding compliance record \nwith the numerous laws and regulations enforced by the Coast Guard. Let \nme be clear: responsible carriers, and frankly their customers, have a \n``zero tolerance'' policy for oil spills. Additionally, the industry is \ntaking spill response preparedness seriously. Industry representatives \nand operators routinely participate in Coast Guard oil spill crisis \nmanagement courses, PREP Drills, and regional spill response drills. \nYet despite all of the modernization, safety, and training efforts of \nthe marine transportation industry, their mariners and shoreside \nemployees cannot escape the threat of criminal liability in the event \nof an oil spill, even where it is shown that they ``took all reasonable \nprecautions to avoid [a] discharge''.\n  As you know, in response to the tragic Exxon Valdez spill, Congress \nenacted OPA90. OPA90 mandated new, comprehensive, and complex \nregulatory and enforcement requirements for the transportation of oil \nproducts and for oil spill response. Both the federal government and \nmaritime industry have worked hard to accomplish the legislation's \nprimary objective--to provide greater environmental safeguards in oil \ntransportation by creating a comprehensive prevention, response, \nliability, and compensation regime to deal with vessel and facility oil \npollution. And OPA90 is working in a truly meaningful sense. To prevent \noil spill incidents from occurring in the first place, OPA90 provides \nan enormously powerful deterrent, through both its criminal and civil \nliability provisions. Moreover, OPA90 mandates prompt reporting of \nspills, contingency planning, and both cooperation and coordination \nwith federal, state, and local authorities in connection with managing \nthe spill response. Failure to report and cooperate as required by \nOPA90 may impose automatic civil penalties, criminal liability and \nunlimited civil liability. As a result, the number of domestic oil \nspills has been dramatically reduced over the past decade since OPA90 \nwas enacted. In those limited situations in which oil spills \nunfortunately occurred, intensive efforts commenced immediately with \nfederal, state and local officials working in a joint, unified manner \nwith the industry, as contemplated by OPA90, to clean up and report \nspills as quickly as possible and to mitigate to the greatest extent \nany impact on the environment. OPA90 has provided a comprehensive and \ncohesive ``blueprint'' for proper planning, training, and resource \nidentification to respond to an oil spill incident, and to ensure that \nsuch a response is properly and cooperatively managed.\n  OPA90 also provides a complete statutory framework for proceeding \nagainst individuals for civil and/or criminal penalties arising out of \noil spills in the marine environment. When Congress crafted this Act, \nit carefully balanced the imposition of stronger criminal and civil \npenalties with the need to promote enhanced cooperation among all of \nthe parties involved in the spill prevention and response effort. In so \ndoing, the Congress clearly enumerated the circumstances in which \ncriminal penalties could be imposed for actions related to maritime oil \nspills, and added and/or substantially increased criminal penalties \nunder the related laws which comprehensively govern the maritime \ntransportation of oil and other petroleum products.\n\n  The legislation we are introducing today will not change in any way \nthe tough criminal sanctions that were imposed in OPA90. However, \nresponsible, law-abiding members of the maritime industry in Louisiana \nand elsewhere are concerned by the willingness of the Department of \nJustice and other federal agencies in the post-OPA90 environment to use \nstrict criminal liability statutes in oil spill incidents. As you know, \nstrict liability imposes criminal sanctions without requiring a showing \nof criminal knowledge, intent or even negligence. These federal actions \nimposing strict liability have created an atmosphere of extreme \nuncertainty for the maritime transportation industry about how to \nrespond to and cooperate with the Coast Guard and other federal\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\nagencies in cleaning up an oil spill. Criminal culpability in this \ncountry, both historically and as reflected in the comprehensive OPA90 \nlegislation itself, typically requires wrongful actions or omissions by \nindividuals through some degree of criminal intent or through the \nfailure to use the required standard of care. However, Federal \nprosecutors have been employing other antiquated, seemingly unrelated \n``strict liability'' statutes that do not require a showing of \n``knowledge'' or ``intent'' as a basis for criminal prosecution for oil \nspill incidents. Such strict criminal liability statutes as the \nMigratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, statutes that were \nenacted at the turn of the century to serve other purposes, have been \nused to harass and intimidate the maritime industry, and, in effect, \nhave turned every oil spill into a potential crime scene without regard \nto the fault or intent of companies, corporate officers and employees, \nand mariners.\n  The Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA) (16 U.S.C. 703 et seq.) provides \nthat ``it shall be unlawful at any time, by any means or in any manner, \nto pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture, or \nkill, . . . any migratory bird . . .'', a violation of which is \npunishable by imprisonment and/or fines. Prior to the Exxon Valdez oil \nspill in 1989, the MBTA was primarily used to prosecute the illegal \nactivities of hunters and capturers of migratory birds, as the Congress \noriginally intended when it enacted the MBTA in 1918. In the Exxon \nValdez case itself, and prior to the enactment of OPA90, the MBTA was \nfirst used to support a criminal prosecution against a vessel owner in \nrelation to a maritime oil spill, and this ``hunting statute'' has been \nused ever since against the maritime industry. The ``Refuse Act'' (33 \nU.S.C. 407, 411) was enacted over 100 years ago at a time well before \nsubsequent federal legislation essentially replaced it with \ncomprehensive requirements and regulations specifically directed to the \nmaritime transportation of oil and other petroleum products. Such \nstrict liability statutes are unrelated to the regulation and \nenforcement of oil transportation activities, and in fact were not \nincluded within the comprehensive OPA90 legislation as statutes in \nwhich criminal liability could be found. With the prosecutorial use of \nstrict liability statutes, owners and mariners engaged in the \ntransportation of oil cannot avoid exposure to criminal liability, \nregardless of how diligently they adhere to prudent practice and safe \nenvironmental standards. Although conscientious safety and training \nprograms, state-of-the-art equipment, proper operational procedures, \npreventative maintenance programs, and the employment of qualified and \nexperienced personnel will collectively prevent most oil spills from \noccurring, unfortunately spills will still occur on occasion.\n  To illustrate this point, please permit me to present a scenario that \nhighlights the dilemma faced by the maritime oil transportation \nindustry in Louisiana. Imagine, if you will, that a company is \noperating a towing vessel in compliance with Coast Guard regulations on \nthe Mississippi River on a calm, clear day with several fully laden \ntank barges in tow. Suddenly, in what was charted and previously \nidentified to be a clear portion of the waterway, one of the tank \nbarges strikes an unknown submerged object which shears through its \nhull and causes a significant oil spill in the river. Unfortunately, in \naddition to any other environmental damage that may occur, the oil \nspill kills one or more migratory birds. As you know, under OPA90 the \noperator must immediately undertake coordinated spill response actions \nwith the Coast Guard and other federal, state, and local agencies to \nsafeguard the vessel and its crew, clean up the oil spill, and \notherwise mitigate any damage to the surrounding environment. The \noverriding objectives at this critical moment are to assure personnel \nand public safety and to clean up the oil spill as quickly as possible \nwithout constraint. However, in the current atmosphere the operator \nmust take into consideration the threat of strict criminal liability \nunder the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Refuse Act, together with \ntheir attendant imprisonment and fines, despite the reasonable care and \nprecautions taken in the operation and navigation of the tow and in the \nspill response effort. Indeed, in the Coast Guard's own environmental \nenforcement directive, the statement is made that ``[t]he decision to \ncommit the necessary Coast Guard resources to obtain the evidence that \nwill support a criminal prosecution must often be made in the very \nearly stages of a pollution incident.'' Any prudent operator will \nquickly recognize the dilemma in complying with the mandate to act \ncooperatively with all appropriate public agencies in cleaning up the \noil spill, while at the same time those very agencies may be conducting \na criminal investigation of that operator. Vessel owners and their \nemployees who have complied with federal laws and regulations and have \nexercised all reasonable care should not continue to face a substantial \nrisk of imprisonment and criminal fines under such strict liability \nstatutes. Criminal liability, when appropriately imposed under OPA90, \nshould be employed only where a discharge is caused by conduct which is \ntruly ``criminal'' in nature, i.e., where a discharge is caused by \nreckless, intentional or other conduct deemed criminal by OPA90.\n  As this scenario demonstrates, the unjustified use of strict \nliability statutes is plainly undermining the very objectives which \nOPA90 sought to achieve, namely to enhance the prevention of and \nresponse to oil spills in Louisiana and elsewhere in the United States. \nAs we are well aware, tremendous time, effort, and resources have been \nexpended by both the federal government and the maritime industry to \neliminate oil spills to the maximum extent possible, and to plan for \nand undertake an immediate and effective response to mitigate any \nenvironmental damage from spills that do occur. Clearly unwarranted and \nimproper prosecutorial use of strict liability statutes is having a \n``chilling'' effect on these cooperative spill prevention and response \nefforts. Indeed, even if we were to believe that criminal prosecution \nonly follows intentional criminal conduct, the mere fact that strict \ncriminal liability statutes are available at the prosecutor's \ndiscretion will intimidate even the most innocent and careful operator. \nWith strict liability criminal enforcement, responsible members of the \nmaritime transportation industry are faced with an extreme dilemma in \nthe event of an oil spill--provide less than full cooperation and \nresponse as criminal defense attorneys will certainly direct, or \ncooperate fully despite the risk of criminal prosecution that could \nresult from any additional actions or statements made during the course \nof the spill response. Consequently, increased criminalization of oil \nspill incidents introduces uncertainty into the response effort by \ndiscouraging full and open communication and cooperation, and leaves \nvessel owners and operators criminally vulnerable for response actions \ntaken in an effort to ``do the right thing''.\n\n  In the maritime industry's continuing effort to improve its risk \nmanagement process, it seeks to identify and address all foreseeable \nrisks associated with the operation of its business. Through fleet \nmodernization, personnel training, and all other reasonable steps to \naddress identified risks in its business, the industry still cannot \nmanage or avoid the increased risks of strict criminal liability \n(again, a liability that has no regard to fault or intent). The only \nmethod available to companies and their officers to avoid the risk of \ncriminal liability completely is to divest themselves from the maritime \nbusiness of transporting oil and other petroleum products, in effect to \nget out of the business altogether. Furthermore, strict liability \ncriminal laws provide a strong disincentive for trained, highly \nexperienced mariners to continue the operation of tank vessels, and for \ntalented and capable individuals from even entering into that maritime \ntrade. An earlier editorial highlighted the fact that tugboat captains \n``are reporting feelings of intense relief and lightening of their \nspirits when they are ordered to push a cargo of grain or other dry \ncargo, as compared to the apprehension they feel when they are staring \nout of their wheelhouses at tank barges'', and ``that the reason for \nthis is very obvious in the way that they find themselves instantly \nfacing criminal charges . . . in the event of a collision or grounding \nand oil or chemicals end up in the water''. Certainly, the federal \ngovernment does not want to create a situation where the least \nexperienced\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\nmariners are the only available crew to handle the most hazardous \ncargoes, or the least responsible operators are the only available \ncarriers. Thus, the unavoidable risk of such criminal liability \ndirectly and adversely affects the safe transportation of oil products, \nan activity essential for the public, the economy, and the nation.\n  Therefore, despite the commitment and effort to provide trained and \nexperienced vessel operators and employees, to comply with all safety \nand operational mandates of Coast Guard laws and regulations, and to \nprovide for the safe transportation of oil as required by OPA90, \nmaritime transportation companies in Louisiana, and elsewhere still \ncannot avoid criminal liability in the event of an oil spill. \nResponsible, law-abiding companies have unfortunately been forced to \nundertake the only prudent action that they could under the \ncircumstances, namely the development of criminal liability action \nplans and retention of criminal counsel in an attempt to prepare for \nthe unavoidable risks of such liability.\n  These are only preliminary steps and do not begin to address the many \nimplications of the increasing criminalization of oil spills. The \nindustry is now asking what responsibility does it have to educate its \nmariners and shoreside staff about the potential personal exposure they \nmay face and wonder how to do this without creating many undesirable \nconsequences? How should the industry organize spill management teams \nand educate them on how to cooperate openly and avoid unwitting \nexposure to criminal liability? Mr. President, I have thought about \nthese issues a great deal and simply do not know how to resolve these \ndilemmas under current, strict liability law. In the event of an oil \nspill, a responsible party not only must manage the cleanup of the oil \nand the civil liability resulting from the spill itself, but also must \nprotect itself from the criminal liability that now exists due to the \navailable and willing use of strict liability criminal laws by the \nfederal government. Managing the pervasive threat of strict criminal \nliability, by its very nature, prevents a responsible party from \ncooperating fully and completely in response to an oil spill situation. \nThe OPA90 ``blueprint'' is no longer clear. Is this serving the \nobjectives of OPA90? Does this really serve the public welfare of our \nnation? Is this what Congress had in mind when it mandated its spill \nresponse regime? Is this in the interest of the most immediate, most \neffective oil spill cleanup in the unfortunate event of a spill? We \nthink not.\n  To restore the delicate balance of interests reached in the enactment \nof OPA90 a decade ago, we intend to work with the Congress to reaffirm \nthe OPA90 framework for criminal prosecutions in oil spill incidents. \nThe enactment of the legislation we are introducing today will ensure \nincreased cooperation and responsiveness desired by all those \ninterested in oil spill response issues without diluting the deterrent \neffect and stringent criminal penalties imposed by OPA90 itself.\n  I look forward to continuing the effort to upgrade the safety of \nmarine operations in the navigable waterways of the United States, and \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2944\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title I of the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act of 1974 to ensure that employees are not improperly \ndisqualified from benefits under pension plans and welfare plans based \non a miscategorization of their employee status; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n           employee benefits eligibility fairness act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, contingent workers in our society face \nsignificant problems, and they deserve our help in meeting them. These \nmen and women--temporary and part-time workers, contract workers, and \nindependent contractors--continue to suffer unfairly, even in our \nprosperous economy. A new report from the General Accounting Office \nemphasizes that contingent workers often lack income security and \nretirement security.\n  We know that for most workers today, a single lifetime job is a relic \nof the past. The world is long gone in which workers stay with their \nemployer for many years, and then retire on a company pension. Since \n1982 the number of temporary help jobs has grown 577 percent.\n  The GAO report shows that 30 percent of the workforce--39 million \nworking Americans--now get their paychecks from contingent jobs.\n  Contingent workers have lower incomes than traditional, full-time \nworkers and many are living in poverty. For example, 30 percent of \nagency temporary workers have family incomes below $15,000. By \ncomparison, only 8 percent of standard full-time workers have family \nincomes below $15,000.\n  Contingent workers are less likely to be covered by employer health \nand retirement benefits than are standard, full-time workers. Even when \nemployers do sponsor a plan, contingent workers are less likely to \nparticipate in the plan, either because they are excluded or because \nthe plan is too expensive. Only 21 percent of part-time workers are \nincluded in an employer-sponsored pension plan. By comparison, 64 \npercent of standard full-time workers are included in their employer's \npension plan.\n  Non-standard or alternative work arrangements can meet the needs of \nworking families and employers alike, but these arrangements should not \nbe used to divide the workforce into ``haves'' and ``have-nots.'' \nFlexible work arrangements, for example, can give working parents more \ntime to care for their children, but many workers are not in their \ncontingent jobs by choice. More than half of temporary workers would \nprefer a permanent job instead of their contingent job, but temporary \nwork is all they can find.\n  As the GAO report makes clear, employers have economic incentives to \ncut costs by miscategorizing their workers as temporary or contract \nworkers. Too often, contingent arrangements are set-up by employers for \nthe purpose of excluding workers from their employee benefit programs \nand evading their responsibilities to their workers. Millions of \nemployees have been miscategorized by their employers, and as a result \nthey have been denied the benefits and protections that they rightly \ndeserve and worked hard to earn.\n  All workers deserve a secure retirement at the end of their working \nyears. Social Security has been and will continue to be the best \nfoundation for that security. But the foundation is just that--the \nbeginning of our responsibility, not the end of it. We cannot expect \nAmericans to work hard all their lives, only to face poverty and hard \ntimes when they retire.\n  That is why I am introducing, with Senators Torricelli and Harkin, \nthe Employee Benefits Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000 to help \ncontingent workers obtain the retirement benefits they deserve. This \nlegislation clarifies employers' responsibilities under the law so that \nthey cannot exclude contingent workers from employee benefit plans \nbased on artificial labels or payroll practices.\n  This is an issue of basic fairness for working men and women. It is \nunfair for individuals who work full-time, on an indefinite long-term \nbasis for an employer to be excluded from the employer's pension plan, \nmerely because the employer classifies the workers as ``temporary'' \nwhen in fact they are not. The employer-employee relationship should be \ndetermined on the facts of\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nthe working arrangement, not on artificial labels, not on artificial \naccounting practices, not artificial payroll practices.\n  It is long past time for Congress to recognize the plight of \ncontingent workers and see that they get the employee benefits they \ndeserve. These important changes are critical to improving the security \nof working families, and I look forward to their enactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2946\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Employee Benefits \n     Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The intent of the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974 to protect the pension and welfare benefits of \n     workers is frustrated by the practice of mislabeling \n     employees to improperly exclude them from employee benefit \n     plans. Employees are wrongly denied benefits when they are \n     mislabeled as temporary employees, part-time employees, \n     leased employees, agency employees, staffing firm employees, \n     and contractors. If their true employment status were \n     recognized, mislabeled employees would be eligible to \n     participate in employee benefit plans because such plans are \n     offered to other employees performing the same or \n     substantially the same work and working for the same \n     employer.\n       (2) Mislabeled employees are often paid through staffing, \n     temporary, employee leasing, or other similar firms to give \n     the appearance that the employees do not work for their \n     worksite employer. Employment contracts and reports to \n     government agencies also are used to give the erroneous \n     impression that mislabeled employees work for staffing, \n     temporary, employee leasing, or other similar firms, when the \n     facts of the work arrangement do not meet the common law \n     standard for determining the employment relationship. \n     Employees are also mislabeled as contractors and paid from \n     non-payroll accounts to give the appearance that they are not \n     employees of their worksite employer. These practices violate \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n       (3) Employers are amending their benefit plans to add \n     provisions that exclude mislabeled employees from \n     participation in the plan even in the event that such \n     employees are determined to be common law employees and \n     otherwise eligible to participate in the plan. These plan \n     provisions violate the Employee Retirement Income Security \n     Act of 1974.\n       (4) As a condition of employment or continued employment, \n     mislabeled employees are often required to sign documents \n     that purport to waive their right to participate in employee \n     benefit plans. Such documents inaccurately claim to limit the \n     authority of the courts and applicable Federal agencies to \n     correct the mislabeling of employees and to enforce the terms \n     of plans providing for their participation. This practice \n     violates the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to clarify \n     applicable provisions of the Employee Retirement Income \n     Security Act of 1974 to ensure that employees are not \n     improperly excluded from participation in employee benefit \n     plans as a result of mislabeling of their employment status.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nestablish the Sand Creek Massacre Historic Site in the State of \nColorado; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nintroduction of legislation to create the sand creek national historic \n                                  site\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Sand Creek \nMassacre National Historic Site Establishment Act of 2000, legislation \nwhich will finally recognize and memorialize the hallowed ground on \nwhich hundreds of peaceful Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians were massacred \nby members of the Colorado Militia.\n  The legislation I introduce today follows The Sand Creek Massacre \nHistoric Site Study Act of 1998, legislation I introduced and Congress \napproved to study the suitability of creating an enduring memorial to \nthe slain innocents who were camped peacefully near Sand Creek, in \nKiowa County, in Colorado on November 28, 1868.\n  Much has been written about the horrors visited upon the plains \nIndians in the territories of the Western United States in the latter \nhalf of the 19th century. However, what has been lost for more than a \ncentury is a comprehensive understanding of the events of that day in a \ngrove of cottonwood trees along Sand Creek now SE Colorado. In some \ncases denial of the events of the day or a sense that ``the Indians had \nit coming'' has prevailed.\n  This legislation finally recognizes a shameful event in our country's \nhistory based on scientific studies, and\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nmakes it clear America has the strength and resolve to face its past \nand learn the painful lessons that come with intolerance.\n  The indisputable facts are these: 700 members of the Colorado \nMilitia, commanded by Colonel John Chivington struck at dawn that \nNovember day, attacking a camp of Cheyenne and Arapaho Indians settled \nunder the U.S. Flag and a white flag which the Indian Chiefs Black \nKettle and White Antelope were told by the U.S. would protect them from \nmilitary attack.\n  By day's end, almost 150 Indians, many of them women, children and \nthe elderly, lay dead. Chivington's men reportedly desecrated the \nbodies of the dead after the massacre, and newspaper reports from \nDenver at the time told of the troops displaying Indian body parts in a \ngruesome display as they rode through the streets of Colorado's largest \ncity following the attack.\n\n  The perpetrators of this horrible attack which left Indian women and \neven babies dead, were never brought to justice even after a \ncongressional investigation concerning this brutality.\n  The legislation I introduce today authorizes the National Park \nService to enter into negotiations with willing sellers only, in an \nattempt to secure property inside a boundary which encompasses \napproximately 12,470 acres as identified by the National Park Service, \nfor a lasting memorial to events of that fateful day.\n  This legislation has been developed over the course of the last 18 \nmonths. It represents a remarkable effort which brought divergent \npoints of view together to define the events of that day and to plan \nfor the future protection of this site. The National Park Service, with \nthe cooperation of the Kiowa County Commissioners, the Cheyenne and \nArapaho Tribes of Oklahoma, the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and the \nNorthern Arapaho Tribe, the State of Colorado and many local landowners \nand volunteers have completed extensive cultural, geomorphological and \nphysical studies of the area where the massacre occurred.\n  All of those involved in this project agree, not acting now is not a \noption. This legislation does not compel any private property owner to \nsell his or her property to the federal government. It allows the \nNational Park Service to negotiate with willing sellers to secure \nproperty at fair market value, for a national memorial. This process \ncould take years. However, several willing sellers have come forward \nand are willing to negotiate with the NPS. The property they own has \nbeen identified by the NPS as suitable for a memorial. Additional \nacquisitions of property from willing sellers could come in the future. \nHowever, the Sand Creek National Historic Site could never extend \nbeyond the 12,470 acres identified by the site resource study already \ncompleted.\n  This legislation has come to being because all of those involved have \nexhibited an extraordinary ability to put aside their differences, look \nwith equal measure at the scientific evidence and the oral traditions \nof the Tribes, and come up with a plan that equally honors the memory \nof those killed and the rights of the private property owners who have \nbeen faithful and responsible stewards of this site. We have a window \nof opportunity here that will not always be available. I encourage my \ncolleagues to respect the memory of those so brutally killed and \nsupport the creation of a National Historic Site on this hallowed \nground in Kiowa County, in Colorado.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and other research material \nassociated with the studies of the Sand Creek site be printed in the \nRecord for my colleagues or the public to review.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 2953. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \noutreach programs carried out by the Department of Veterans Affairs to \nprovide for more fully informing veterans of benefits available to them \nunder laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n\n                    The Veterans' Right to Know Act\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI: Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nVeterans' Right to Know Act which will assist millions of brave \nAmericans who have served this nation in times of war. This legislation \nwould ensure that all veterans are fully informed of the various \nbenefits that they have earned through their brave and dedicated \nservice to their country.\n  Throughout the history of the United States, the interests of our \nnation have been championed by ordinary citizens who willingly defend \nour nation when called upon. During the times of crisis which \nthreatened the very existence of our Republic, we persevered because \nyoung men and women from all walks of life took up arms to defend the \nideals by which this nation was founded. Whether it was winning our \nfreedom from an oppressive empire, preserving our Union, defeating \nfascism or battling the spread of communism, the American people have \ntime and time again answered the call to defend liberty, justice and \ndemocracy at home and throughout the world.\n  Our government owes a debt of gratitude to each and every one of our \nveterans, and we must make a concerted effort to show our appreciation \nfor their valiant service. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \nprovides the necessary health care services and benefits to our war \nheroes; however, over half of the veterans in the United States are not \nfully aware of the benefits or pensions to which they are entitled.\n  The bill I introduced today is straightforward and it does not call \nfor the creation of new benefits. Rather, it seeks to ensure that our \nveterans are well informed of the benefits they are entitled to as a \nresult of their service or injuries sustained during their service to \ntheir country.\n  This legislation would require the VA to inform veterans about their \neligibility for benefits and health care services whenever they first \napply for any benefit with the VA. Furthermore, many times, widows and \nsurviving family members of veterans are not aware of the special \nbenefits available to them when their family member passes. My bill \nwould help these individuals in their time of loss by instructing the \nVA to inform them of the benefits for which they are eligible on the \npassing of their loved one.\n  My legislation also seeks to reach out to those veterans who are not \ncurrently enrolled in the VA system by calling upon the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to prepare an annual outreach plan that will encourage \neligible veterans to register with the VA as well as keeping current \nenrollees aware of any changes to benefits or eligibility requirements.\n  This bill will help ensure that our government and its services for \nveterans are there for the men and women who have served this nation in \nthe armed forces. I am hopeful that my colleagues in the Senate will \nrecognize the tremendous service that our veterans have given and \nsupport this reasonable measure to ensure that our veterans receive the \nbenefits they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Stevens, \n        Mr. Breaux, and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2954. A bill to establish the Dr. Nancy Foster Marine Biology \nScholarship Program; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                    The Nancy Foster Scholarship Act\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nancy \nFoster Scholarship Act, legislation to create a scholarship program in \nmarine biology or oceanography in honor of Dr. Nancy Foster, head of \nthe National Ocean Service at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration (NOAA) until her passing on Tuesday, June 27, 2000. I am \nproud to introduce legislation to commemorate the life and work of such \na wonderful leader, mentor, and coastal advocate. I thank my colleagues \nSenators Snowe, Kerry, Stevens, Breaux, and Cleland for joining me in \nrecognizing Dr. Foster's strong commitment to improving the \nconservation and scientific understanding of our precious coastal \nresources.\n  My legislation would create a Nancy Foster Marine Biology Scholarship \nProgram within the Department of Commerce. This Program would provide \nscholarship funds to outstanding women and minority graduate students \nto support and encourage independent graduate level research in marine \nbiology. It is my hope that this scholarship program will promote the \ndevelopment of future leaders of Dr. Foster's caliber.\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\n  Dr. Foster was the first woman to direct a NOAA line office, and \nduring her 23 years at NOAA rose to one of the most senior levels a \ncareer professional can achieve. She directed the complete \nmodernization of NOAA's essential nautical mapping and charting \nprograms, and created a ground-breaking partnership with the National \nGeographic Society to launch a 5-year undersea exploration program \ncalled the Sustainable Seas Expedition. Dr. Foster was a strong and \nenthusiastic mentor to young people and a staunch ally to her \ncolleagues, and for this reason, I believe the legislation I am \nintroducing today to be the most appropriate way for us all to ensure \nthat her deep commitment to marine science continues on in others.\n  Mr. President, we will all feel Dr. Foster's loss deeply for years to \ncome. The creation of a scholarship program in her honor is one small \nway we can thank a person who did so much for us all.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n By Mr. DeWINE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Voinovich, and Mr. Leahy);\n\n  S. 2955. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nrelief for the payment of asbestos-related claims; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n               asbestos-related claims relief legislation\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe bill introduced today by my friend and colleague from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, that would provide relief for payment of asbestos-related \nclaims.\n  I urge my colleagues on the Finance Committee to take a close look at \nthe serious problem this bill addresses. Certain manufacturers who were \nrequired by government specification to use asbestos in their products \nare facing a severe financial crisis arising from claims made by \nindividuals who are suffering health problems from asbestos-related \ndiseases. These claims have put several of these companies into \nbankruptcy, and several more appear to be on the brink of insolvency. \nThousands of jobs may be at stake, as may be the proper compensation of \nthe victims of the illnesses.\n  A major part of the underlying justification for this measure is that \nthe federal government shares some culpability in the harm caused by \nthe asbestos-related products manufactured by these companies. For \nexample, from World War II through the Vietnam War, the government \nrequired that private contractors and shipyard workers use asbestos to \ninsulate navy ships from so-called ``secondary fires.'' Because of \nsovereign immunity, however, the government has not had to share in \npaying the damages, leaving American companies to bear the full and \nongoing financial load of compensation.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is a step toward recognizing \nthat the federal government is partially responsible for payment of \nthese claims. It does so through two income tax provisions, both of \nwhich directly benefit the victims of the illnesses.\n  The first provision exempts from income tax the income earned by a \ndesignated or qualified settlement fund established for the principal \npurpose of resolving and satisfying present and future claims relating \nto asbestos illnesses. The effect of this provision, Mr. President, is \nto increase the amount of money available for the payment of these \nclaims.\n  The second provision allows taxpayers with specified liability losses \nattributable to asbestos to carry back those losses to the tax year in \nwhich the taxpayer, or its predecessor company, was first involved in \nproducing or distributing products containing asbestos.\n  This provision is a matter of fairness, Mr. President. Because of the \nlong latency period related to asbestos-related diseases, which can be \nas long as 40 years, many of these claims are just now arising. Current \nlaw provides for the carryback of this kind of liability losses, but \nonly for a ten-year period.\n  Many of the companies involved earned profits and paid taxes on those \nprofits in the years the asbestos-related products were made or \ndistributed. However, it is now clear, many years after the taxes were \npaid, that there were no profits earned at all, since millions of \ndollars of health claims relating to those products must now be paid.\n  It is only fair, and it is sound tax policy, to allow relief for \nsituations like these. Again, it should be emphasized that the primary \nbeneficiaries of this tax change will not be the corporations, but the \nvictims of the illnesses, because the taxpayer would be required to \ndevote the entire amount of the tax reduction to paying the claims.\n  This is not the only time the federal government has been at least \npartially responsible for health problems of citizens that arose many \nyears after the event that initially triggered the problem. During the \nCold War, America conducted above ground atomic tests during which the \nwind blew the fallout into communities and ranches of Utah, New Mexico \nand Arizona. The government also demanded quantities of uranium, which \nis harmful to those who mined and milled it. The incidence of cancers \nand other debilitating diseases caused by this activity among the \n``downwinders,'' miners and millers has been acknowledged by the \nfederal government.\n  The least we can do for those manufacturers forced to use asbestos \ninstead of other materials is provide some tax relief for their \ncompensation funds.\n  This legislation has substantial bipartisan backing. It is sponsored \nin the House by both the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the \nJudiciary Committee. It is backed by the by the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce and by at least one related labor union. This bill addresses a \nvery serious problem and is the right thing to do. I hope we can pass \nit expeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2955\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which \nwould preserve over 130,000 acres of land in Western Colorado. This \nlegislation is supported locally by property owners, county \ncommissioners, environmentalists, and recreational groups. My bill is a \nSenate companion to H.R. 4275 which was introduced by my colleague and \nfellow Coloradan Representative Scott McInnis.\n  The areas proposed for Wildernesss Protection are the Black Ridge and \nRuby Canyons of the Grand Valley and Rabbit Valley near Grand Junction, \nColorado. They contain unique and valuable scenic, recreational, \nmultiple use, paleontological, natural, and wildlife components. This \nhistoric rural western setting provides extensive opportunities for \nrecreational activities, and are publicly used for hiking, camping, and \ngrazing. This area is truly worthy of additional protection as a \nnational conservation area.\n  This legislation has the support of the administration and should \neasily be signed into law. The only issue confronting us is the limited \namount of time left in the 106th Congress. I hope we will be able to \nmove this legislation quickly through the process and that it will not \nget bogged down in partisan politics.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npreserve coverage of drugs and biologicals under part B of the medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               medicare self-administered medications act\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to address a \nserious problem regarding Medicare's treatment of self-injectable \ndrugs. Section 1862(s) of the Social Security Act defines covered \n``medical and other health services'' for purposes of coverage under \nMedicare Part B. Included in the definition are:\n\n       (2)(A) services and supplies (including drugs and \n     biologicals which cannot, as determined in accordance with \n     regulations, be self-administered) furnished as incident to a \n     physician's professional service, of kinds which are commonly \n     furnished in physicians' offices and are commonly either \n     rendered without charge or included in the physicians' bills \n     . . .\n\n  Regulations at 42 C.F.R. 410.29 provide further limitations on drugs \nand biologicals, but they do not define the phrase ``cannot be self-\nadministered.'' Individual Medicare carriers have reportedly applied \ndifferent policies when considering whether a drug or biological can or \ncannot be self-administered. Some carriers have based the determination \non the typical means of administration while others have assessed the \nindividual patient's ability to administer the drug.\n  On August 13, 1997, HCFA issued a memorandum to Medicare carriers \nwhich was intended to clarify program policy. The memorandum stated \nthat the inability to self-administer is to be based on the typical \nmeans of administration of the drug, not on the individual patient's \nability to administer the drug. The memorandum stated that: ``The \nindividual patient's mental or physical ability to administer any drug \nis not a consideration for this purpose.''\n  As a result of this memorandum, certain patients, for example \npatients with multiple sclerosis or some forms of cancer, no longer had \nMedicare coverage for certain drugs. However, implementation of this \npolicy directive has been halted for FY2000. On November 29, 1999, the \nPresident signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2000. \nSection 219 of General Provisions in Title II, Department of Health and \nHuman Services contains a provision relating to the memorandum. The \nprovision prohibits the use of any funds to carry out the August 13, \n1997, transmittal or to promulgate any regulation or other transmittal \nor policy directive that has the effect of imposing (or clarifying the \nimposition of ) a restriction on the coverage of injectable drugs \nbeyond those applied on the day before issuance of the transmittal.\n  The definition of covered services continues to be of concern to \npolicymakers. On March 23, 2000, the House Commerce Committee, \nSubcommittee on Health & Environment held a hearing on this issue. I \nunderstand that there was a very productive discussion of other policy \noptions during the question and answer period. One witness, Dr. Earl \nSteinberg of Johns Hopkins University, suggested having the \nbeneficiary's physician determine whether a medication can or cannot be \nself-injected. The bill I am introducing today follows that expert \nadvice and introduces the judgment of the physician into the decision \nprocess.\n  On May 17, 2000 I sent a letter to HCFA Administrator DeParle, \nrequesting her serious attention to this problem. I went further to ask \nher to propose an administrative remedy for the inequity that existed. \nIn her reply, she stated that she was ``very troubled by the \npredicament of beneficiaries whose drugs are not covered under the \nlaw.'' But it is clear from Administrator DeParle's letter, that \nwithout legislative authority there is only a limited amount HCFA will \ndo to address this problem.\n  The bill I am introducing today allows a Medicare beneficiary's own \nphysician to make the determination of whether the beneficiary can or \ncannot administer their medication. I would ask for my colleagues' \nsupport in this legislation. This issue is of vital importance to some \nof our most gravely ill Medicare beneficiaries. These beneficiaries, \nmany with advanced cases of multiple sclerosis or cancer, deserve our \nhelp and they deserve it today. I ask consent that the full text be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Self-Administered \n     Medications Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PRESERVATION OF COVERAGE OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICALS \n                   UNDER PART B OF THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(s)(2) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(2)) is amended, in each of \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B), by striking ``(including drugs and \n     biologicals which cannot, as determined in accordance with \n     regulations, be self-administered)'' and inserting \n     ``(including drugs and biologicals for which the usual method \n     of administration of the form of drug or biological is not \n     patient self-administration or, in the case of injectable \n     drugs and biologicals, for which the physician determines \n     that self-administration is not medically appropriate)''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to drugs and biologicals administered on or after \n     October 1, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANTORUM:\n  S. 2958. A bill to establish a national clearinghouse for youth \nentrepreneurship education, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    youth entrepreneurship clearinghouse and curriculum-based youth \n                            entrepreneurship\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nempower at-risk youths and their communities. My legislation would \nestablish a national youth entrepreneurship clearinghouse and permit \ncurriculum-based youth entrepreneurship education as an allowable use \nof funds. Only curriculum-based youth entrepreneurship programs that \ndemonstrate success in equipping disadvantaged youth with applied math \nand other analytical skills would be eligible for assistance under this \nmeasure. Students who participate in these programs learn basic \nentrepreneurial skills and gain a better understanding of the \nrelationship between the subjects they learn in their classrooms and \nthe business world. By teaching students practical skills needed to \nestablish and maintain thriving entrepreneurial projects, the programs \nempower students and prepare them for future endeavors as contributing \nmembers of their communities. My legislation will instill pride in at-\nrisk youths by providing them with the opportunity to improve their \nsurroundings, while they explore and learn about the many career \nchoices available to them in the business world.\n  I am pleased that this measure was included in the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Reauthorization bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives, and it is my hope that we can facilitate its passage \nin the Senate and move closer to providing significant and meaningful \ninitiatives for our children in need.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN:\n  S. 2960. A bill to provide for qualified withdrawals from the Capital \nConstruction Fund (CCF) for fishermen leaving the industry and for the \nrollover of Capital Construction Funds to\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\nindividual retirement plans; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                the capital construction fund reform act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the Capital \nConstruction Fund Reform Act of 2000.\n  The Capital Construction Fund (CCF) was originally created by the \nMerchant Marine Act as a way to encourage the construction and use of \nAmerican-owned vessels in U.S. waters. For fishermen, the Capital \nConstruction Fund authorizes the accumulation of funds, free from \ntaxes, for the purpose of buying or refitting commercial fishing \nvessels. The program has been a success in promoting the domestic \nfishing industry. However, the usefulness of the CCF has not kept up \nwith the times. Today it is actually exacerbating the problems facing \nU.S. fisheries by forcing fishermen to keep their money in fishing \nvessels, rather than allowing them to retire from fishing and pursue \nother interests.\n  Our nation's fisheries are collapsing. Over the past year, fisheries \nin New England, Alaska and the West Coast have been officially declared \ndisasters by the Secretary of Commerce. Plainly speaking, there are too \nmany boats and not enough fish. Along the West Coast, a mere 200 of the \n1400 boats currently fishing could catch the entire allowable harvest \nof groundfish. That means we could buyout 85 percent of the boats and \nstill not reduce capacity in our fisheries. Since 1995, Congress has \nappropriated $140 million to buy fishing vessels and permits back from \nfishermen. Clearly, more needs to be done. This legislation empowers \nthe fisherman to make his own choices to stay or leave the fishery with \nhis own money.\n  In these times when we ought to be reducing the number of boats in \nour fisheries, it does not make sense for federal policy to encourage \nfishermen to build more of them. Yet current law prohibits fishermen \nfrom getting their own money out of CCF accounts for any purpose other \nthan building boats. If they do, they lose up to 70 percent of their \nmoney in taxes and penalties. When fishermen have already been hit with \nincreasingly severe harvest restrictions over the past few years, it is \njust not fair to hold their own money hostage.\n  That is why I'm introducing a bill that makes it easier for fishermen \nto withdraw their funds from the Capital Construction Fund if they \nretire from the fishery. My bill would allow fund holders to roll their \nfunds over into an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or other \nretirement fund. It would also allow them to use their own money to \nparticipate in buyback programs. This bill also eliminates the tax-\npenalty for withdrawals for those folks wishing to leave the industry.\n  Mr. President, this bill enjoys wide support from a variety of \norganizations with an interest in our nation's fisheries. Environmental \ngroups, trawlers, small boat operators and processors alike have \nexpressed their enthusiasm for this legislation. I urge my colleagues \nto support the swift adoption of this bill so that our fisherman can \nstart making their own choices about their businesses and lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2960\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       The Act may be cited as ``The Capital Construction Fund \n     (CCF) Qualified Withdrawal Act of 2000''.\n\n     SECTION 2. EXPANSION OF PURPOSES OF THE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION \n                   FUND BY AMENDING THE MERCHANT MARINE ACT OF \n                   1936\n\n       Section 607(a) of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936 (46 U.S.C. \n     App. 1177(a)) is amended by striking ``of this section.'' and \n     inserting ``of this section. Any agreement entered into under \n     this section may be modified for the purpose of encouraging \n     the sustainability of the fisheries of the United States by \n     making the termination and withdrawal of a capital \n     construction fund account a qualified withdrawal if done in \n     exchange for the retirement of the related commercial fishing \n     vessels and related commercial fishing permits.''\n\n     SECTION 3.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to address problems \nconcerning methyl tertiary butyl ether, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n               THE FEDERAL REFORMULATED FUELS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today I have introduced \nlegislation, S. 2962, which I believe will deal once and for all with \nthe MTBE problem that is facing us all across America, specifically New \nEngland. In the Northeast, as well as California and other areas of the \ncountry, we are beginning to see evidence of MTBE in ground water. This \nis a serious environmental problem that must be addressed. It is \ncertainly a problem in New Hampshire.\n  I rise today to speak for my constituents in New Hampshire who are \nnow having their wells, several a week by the way, being contaminated \nby MTBE. This is my home State. This is a serious problem there. I am \nhere to offer this legislation to help my constituents in New Hampshire \nget relief from MTBE, which is a pollutant in their wells. But I am \nalso here to speak for all Americans across the country who have MTBE \nin their wells, whether they be in California or New Hampshire.\n  MTBE has done more damage to our drinking water than we would care to \nknow. MTBE has been a component of our fuel supply for over two \ndecades. In 1990, we amended the Clean Air Act to include a clean \ngasoline program. Unfortunately, we did not look at the science that \nwas probably more evident than not. Because we did not look at that \nscience, we have now created another environmental problem of a huge \nmagnitude, which is probably going to cost billions of dollars to clean \nup. If there is a moral here, or lesson, it should be: Use good \nscience. Look carefully before you leap into some of these \nenvironmental dilemmas.\n  That program in the 1990 Clean Air Act amendment mandated use of 2 \npercent oxygen in the gas, by weight. In other words, 2 percent of the \nweight of a gallon of gasoline should be oxygen. That was put in the \nfuel.\n  MTBE was one of two options that could be used. The problem with MTBE \nis that it has this ability to migrate through the ground very quickly \nand then into the water table. What is MTBE? It is an ether, and in the \nevent of a leak or gas spill, the MTBE will separate from the gas and \nmigrate through the ground very quickly. The real problem starts when \nMTBE finds its way into the ground water, which it frequently does.\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\n  Several States have had gasoline leaks, or spills, that led to the \nclosure of wells because of MTBE. It smells. It tastes horrible. It is \nnot the kind of thing you want to see come out of your shower or your \nfaucet when you are ready to use your water. This is a serious problem. \nSome have made light of it, frankly, in this body, in the sense that \nmaybe it is not such a serious problem and maybe we should look at some \nother alternatives other than banning it. But we need to ban MTBE. The \nlegislation I am introducing today will do that. It does it in a \nresponsible manner, which I will explain.\n  Several States have had these leaks or spills, as I said. So this \nbill will address the problems associated with MTBE, but--and this is a \nvery important point--will not reduce any of the environmental benefits \nof the clean air program. That cannot be said with every option that \nhas been presented on this issue. Again, we can ban MTBE, but we will \nnot reduce any environmental benefit that the MTBE has brought to clean \nthe air and that is important.\n  Briefly, this bill will allow the Governor of any State to waive the \ngasoline oxygen requirement of the Clean Air Act--waive it. But it will \npreserve the environmental benefits. It will also grant the State and \nthe Federal Government authority to ban MTBE. It authorizes an \nadditional $200 million out of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank \nFund to clean up MTBE where these wells have been contaminated because \nof these leaking tanks. In other words, if we could repair those \nleaking tanks, we are going to cut back on the amount of problems we \nare going to have in the future. So it is important we have this as \npart of the legislation to get the money there to fix these tanks, to \ncut back on the amount of MTBE that gets into the ground water. If it \ndoes not leak out of the tank, the gasoline tank, it will not get into \nthe ground water. But it is leaking out of tanks and we have to fix it.\n\n  The bill also authorizes an extensive study of numerous environmental \nconsequences of our current fuel use. It was my hope to have marked up \nand sent to the floor from the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nwhich I chair, a bill this past week. In fact, it was our goal to do it \nyesterday, but we could not get the parties together who I needed to \nmake this bill a reality, in the sense that it would pass. We could \nhave introduced a bill, could have marked a bill, perhaps, but it would \nnot have passed because we would not have the support. This problem is \ntoo serious to play politics.\n  MTBE is a pollutant in our wells. We need to get it out. We have to \nhave legislation to do it and it has to pass. There is no point \nintroducing a bill that will not pass. There are people who are dug in \non all sides of this issue for various reasons. But the point is, we \nneed to compromise. We all cannot get what we want, but the end result \nmust be that we get MTBE out of our ground water. That is the bottom \nline.\n  So I agreed, reluctantly, but I agreed, in the interests of working \ntogether with my colleagues, to hold off until September in order to \nresolve the few remaining issues, but I intend to hold that markup in \nSeptember. In fact, the specific date is September 7. In that \nlegislation that we mark up, we will ban MTBE.\n  The issues that are in this legislation include the treatment of \nethanol. I am pleased with the recent progress we have made on this. \nBut there is a serious problem that we have to deal with, those who \nadvocate more ethanol in fuel. I expect these issues to be resolved. We \nare working behind the scenes very hard to resolve these issues before \nthe September 7 markup. It will give the staff something to do during \nthe August recess. I know they will work out the details. But I thank \nthe many Senators on both sides of the aisle I have been working with \nvery closely to resolve these issues. This is a tough, tough issue, and \nit is hard to get agreement. Everybody is not going to get what they \nwant, but the bottom line is, we have to get MTBE out of the water.\n  Let me address the ethanol issue for a moment. Some weeks ago I \ncirculated a draft that included a clean alternative fuels program. \nThis is a very complex issue. What are alternative fuels? It could be \npremium gasoline. It could be natural gas. It could be electricity. It \ncould be fuel cells. It could be ethanol. But if you say ``renewable \nfuels,'' then you are talking for the most part only ethanol. So when \nwe are talking alternative fuels, what alternatives do we have to MTBE \nthat would help us meet these requirements in the Clean Air Act? This \nhas proven to be a good step toward addressing the ethanol question.\n  The program will also enhance the development of cleaner and more \nefficient cars which will help with the Clean Air Act issues as well. \nThere has been growing support for this alternative fuels approach \nsince the time we first brought this up. We do not want to create more \nMTBE problems. We do not want to create dirtier air by eliminating MTBE \nbecause we created dirty water by putting MTBEs in gasoline.\n\n  So last week in an effort, again, to reach out, I received a letter \nsupporting that approach from 32 States represented by air quality \nplanners in the northeastern States and the Governors' Ethanol \nCoalition. So for the first time we now have ethanol, and the \nNortheast, you have specific problems here with the MTBE issue, \ntalking, working together, and, as we said, from this letter of support \nfrom 32 States, they support this approach.\n  We have not dotted every ``i'' and crossed every ``t'' yet, but in \nconcept they support the approach.\n  The bill I am offering today, while that bill does not include the \nexact language they are talking about in that letter--and I want to \nmake that clear--it is a bridge. It is a bridge from where my \nlegislation is to where they are. Actually, simultaneously to the bill \nI have introduced, I have also offered an amendment No. 4026, which \ncrosses that bridge. I have introduced what I would like to have, what \nI believe is the most cost-effective method to deal with this problem, \nbut I recognize that even though it is the least costly, it does not \nhave the amount of support I need to pass it. So I have offered another \namendment to my own bill, which is my way of saying: OK, you offered me \nthe bridge. I am willing to walk across it and meet you at least \nhalfway.\n  I will describe this bill in a little more detail first. This is a \ncomplex issue. The Environmental and Public Works Committee has been \nstruggling with this, certainly in the last 7 or 8 months I have been \nchairman of the committee, and I am sure they were struggling with it \nmany months before that. I have tried to craft a solution that is \ndirect and balanced. I believe I have accomplished that. That is my \ngoal. It is not to ramrod anything through to make anybody angry. It is \na legitimate attempt to get a consensus to deal with a serious \nenvironmental problem, not to deal with everybody's own opinions.\n  If anybody comes to the table and says: If I do not get this, I will \nleave the table--I tell the people who say that: Don't bother coming to \nthe table; you are wasting my time and yours. If you want to, talk, \ncompromise, and reach a rational conclusion. I am willing to talk, and \nSenators on all sides of this have done just that. We have talked to \nmany industry folks and environmental people as well on this very \nissue.\n  The bill waives the oxygen mandate. The Reformulated Gasoline \nProgram, or RFG, requires at least 2 percent of gasoline by weight to \nbe oxygen. MTBE and ethanol are the principal additives that help \nsatisfy this mandate. It is ethanol or MTBE. They will bring us to that \n2 percent oxygenate requirement. Because MTBE is rarely used outside \nthe Reformulated Gas Program, a sensible starting point was to allow \neach State, if they wish, to waive the oxygen requirement.\n\n  What about the so-called environmental backsliding; in other words, \nslipping back and allowing more dirty air? There is concern that if the \nGovernors waive this mandate that this will affect the environmental \nbenefit--clean air--of the Reformulated Gas Program.\n  Let me be very clear: My bill ensures there will be no environmental \nbacksliding. We are not walking away from the requirements of the Clean \nAir Act. If this bill is adopted, the environment--at least the air--\nwill not know the difference. There will be no negative impact on the \nair, and the water will be cleaner.\n  Phaseout of MTBE: Eliminating the 2 percent oxygen mandate alone does \nnot\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\nmean the elimination of MTBE. MTBE is an effective octane booster, and \nrefiners still may want to use it. Since only a very small amount of \nMTBE will cause a tremendous amount of damage, it is important to \nconsider the fate of MTBE.\n  This bill will give the EPA Administrator the authority to ban it \nimmediately. If EPA does not do so in 4 years, then this bill will, by \nlaw, ban MTBE. The EPA has 4 years to ban it. If they do not, the bill \nwill.\n  EPA could, however, overturn the ban if it deemed it was not \nnecessary to protect air quality, water quality, or human health. If it \ngets to the point that it is not a problem, then EPA does not have to \nban it. Notwithstanding EPA's decision, the bill gives the States the \nauthority to ban the additive.\n  Since there is already massive contamination caused by MTBE, this \nbill will authorize, as I said, $200 million to be given to the States \nfrom the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Program for the purpose of \ncleaning up MTBE-caused contamination.\n  Since a Federal mandate caused this pollution--remember that a \nFederal mandate caused this pollution. This is not the fault of the oil \ncompanies. It is not the fault of the MTBE producers. They did what \nthey were asked to do. They produced this additive to clean up the air. \nSince a Federal mandate caused the pollution, it would be irresponsible \nfor the Federal Government not to bear some of the financial burden \nassociated with the cleanup. Unfortunately, that is the case.\n  I do not like to spend taxpayers' dollars, but this was a mandate, \nand because of that mandate, we have a problem.\n  It is also important to point out that although it is not part of my \nlegislation, it is reasonable to think of some way of perhaps trying to \nwork with the MTBE producers to help them through this transition if, \nin fact, MTBE is banned. I certainly am willing to work with them to \ncome up with some solution, some help in terms of their movement from \none industry to another, or whatever the case may be.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a comprehensive study of the \nenvironmental consequences of our current fuel supply. In order to be \nbetter informed to make future environmental decisions regarding fuel \npolicy, the bill directs EPA to undertake a study of our motor fuel.\n  I will talk a little bit about the cost, a very important point.\n  Lately, we have heard a great deal about gasoline prices, certainly \nfuel oil prices, as well, in New England. These concerns underscore the \nquestion of the costs associated with limiting MTBE use.\n  MTBE, like it or not, is clean, it is cheap, and it helps to clean up \nour air. Placing it in our fuel supply and keeping the fuel supply \nclean will have a cost. We have to replace it. We cannot backslide. We \ndo not want to dirty the air while we take MTBE out.\n  It is my belief the Senate is not prepared to reduce our clean air \nstandards or allow for the continued contamination of our drinking \nwater.\n  We have two issues: Contaminated drinking water and do we backslide \noff the clean air provision. I believe my colleagues in the Senate are \nwilling to work with me to clean up the water to get the MTBE out of \nour wells and to preserve the integrity of the Clean Air Act and not \nbackslide or move back from the cleaner air we have accomplished by \nusing MTBE.\n  The question, though, becomes: What is the most effective and cost \nfriendly option for achieving this goal? I have a chart which will help \nillustrate the options. Each one of these options--the red line, yellow \nline, green line, and the blue line--bans MTBE, but it is a little more \ncomplicated than that.\n  One option is simply the elimination of MTBE with no other changes in \nthe law. That is the red line. These show costs. This is the highest \ncost option because it is about an 8-cent increase in gas prices per \ngallon. This is a ban of MTBE, and it replaces it with ethanol in the \nReformulated Gas Program. One might think: That is fine, it is ethanol, \nproduced by corn, a nice natural product; what is wrong with that? \nLet's do it.\n  The problem is, in areas in the Northeast, such as New Hampshire, and \nin other States such as Texas, these States would have to use ethanol \nto meet that oxygenate requirement because there is no other option. In \norder to meet the 2-percent oxygenate requirement if MTBE is removed, \nthey have to use ethanol.\n  One may say: What is wrong with that? Ethanol makes gas evaporate \nmore quickly and those fumes would add to smog and haze in New England \nand it would be serious. Obviously, California would have the same \nproblem.\n  Refiners would have to make gas less evaporative and thereby \nincreasing the cost. In other words, they would have to do something to \ndeal with that rapid evaporation and it would cost more to do that. \nThis is not an option for New England nor California nor any other \nState that has this particular problem.\n  If we are going to be responsible, then we should work with our \ncolleagues who have these problems. I happen to have that problem \nbecause I am from New Hampshire, and as the chairman of the committee, \nI need to work with all regions of the country to get a compromise that \nis acceptable to everybody so that we do not have more environmental \nproblems in New England or California or some other place by simply \nbanning MTBE and letting ethanol take over. Some want that.\n  Obviously, the ethanol producers would love it, but that does not \nhelp us. We do not want to create more problems. That is not a \nresponsible approach, I say with all due respect.\n  The next line is the orange line in terms of cost.\n  That is the Clinton administration's position. That represents the \ncost of eliminating the oxygen mandate, but replacing it with a \nnational ethanol mandate. You have no other alternative other than \nethanol.\n  The cost of mandating a threefold increase in ethanol sales is very \nexpensive. So the options represented by the orange line shown on the \nchart cost less than what is shown with the red line because it does \nnot mandate that the reformulated gas contain ethanol. It does not \nmandate it, but that is what is going to happen. But, shown with this \norange line on the chart, it simply mandates the total ethanol market. \nSo you are mandating the market here, and that is no good. That does \nnot work. Unlike what is shown with the red line, there would be no \nregional constraint. It would not be acceptable.\n  Now, what is shown on the chart with the blue line is legislation \nthat I am introducing today, without the amendment initially. In my \nview, that is the cheapest and most responsible way to deal with this \nproblem. However, for reasons which I respect--I might not agree with \nthem, but I respect them--it does not have enough support, either, to \npass the Senate. I recognize that, but I want everybody to know where I \nam coming from.\n  I believe we should use the cheapest alternative that gets the job \ndone. That is my view. But I understand, as I said before, I am willing \nto build that bridge to go from what is shown with the blue line to \nwhat is shown with the green line. I will not go to what is shown with \nthe orange or red lines, but I am willing to go from what is shown with \nthe blue line to what is shown with the green line.\n  As I have said, what is shown with the blue line is the bill I have \nintroduced. That bill will cost more to make clean gas without MTBE, \nbut because we place the fewest requirements on the refiners on how to \nachieve that clean gas, this bill would cost the economy less than all \nother options. It is very important for me to repeat that. We place the \nfewest requirements on the refiners on how to achieve the clean gas. We \nwant clean gas achieved. That is the goal. This bill would cost the \neconomy less than all of those other options.\n  While my bill addresses all of the concerns with MTBE, I am also \nsensitive to the concerns of the Senators who understand that this bill \nmight have an impact on ethanol. So in order to address these concerns, \nI have prepared an amendment to my own legislation, amendment No. 4026, \nwhich I have already sent to the desk.\n  This amendment seeks to address the concerns over ethanol that \nMembers have. I am hoping that over the course of the next 30 days we \nwill be able to build this bridge from what is shown by the blue line \nto what is shown by the\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\ngreen line, to get to what I think is an acceptable and responsible \napproach.\n  I indicated earlier there is a lot of interest. Thirty-two States \nhave expressed interest in this, in my letter. This amendment seeks to \naddress the concerns of the ethanol industry by establishing a segment \nof the fuel market that must be comprised of either ethanol or fuel \nused to power superclean vehicles.\n  About 10 days ago, I had the opportunity to ride in a fuel-celled \nbus. It had hydrogen cells. I had never experienced anything like it: \nNo fumes, no smell, very little sound, and no pollutants whatsoever. I \nroad several miles in it.\n\n  The current occupant of the Chair, the Senator from Utah, Senator \nBennett, drives a hybrid car which is part electric, part gas. You see, \nwe are moving in the right direction. Hybrid cars, fuel cells--they are \nthe future. The more we do that, the less we need of any type of \ngasoline, whether it is ethanol or just oil based. It does not matter.\n  The point is, we are moving in the right direction. That is what we \nwant to encourage. This bill will establish a segment of the fuel \nmarket that must be comprised of either ethanol or fuel used to power \nthose clean vehicles. We do not want to stop them from having that \noption.\n  If we just go with the renewables that the administration wants, all \nthey can use is ethanol. What we want them to do is use ethanol, if \nthey wish, but to use hybrid cars if they wish. Encourage that, \nencourage fuel cells, whatever, or premium gas, but let the market deal \nwith it.\n  So there are a lot of exciting things happening. This amendment is \ngoing to create competition. There is nothing wrong with competition, \ngood old competition. You pick winners and losers--no guarantees--with \ncompetition between the ethanol industry and the clean vehicle market. \nSo why mandate ethanol and exclude clean vehicles? It does not make any \nsense.\n  So the estimated cost of this approach is represented by the green \nline on the chart. This is a very good approach that I believe is a \ncompromise that gets us there. It costs us a little more, but it gets \nus there. Because we can't get there with what is represented by the \nblue line, I am willing to go here, with what is represented by the \ngreen line.\n  Mr. President, I know my time is pretty close to expiring, I am sure.\n  To those who will ask, why does this have to be so complicated, I did \nnot create the issue. I have spent the last 6 months trying to \nunderstand it and learn about it. I think I am getting there, with a \nlot of help. It is a complex issue, with many competing interests. That \nis the thing. But a simple ban of MTBE does not get everybody there--\nall the regions of the country. It does not get it done.\n  So a simple ban of MTBE makes gas more expensive and air more dirty. \nIt is not acceptable. We cannot do that. A stand-alone mandate of \nethanol does not get you there, either. Smog concerns, cost concerns--\nparticularly in New Hampshire, and other areas of the Northeast, as \nwell as California--that does not get you there.\n  Simply eliminating the reformulated gas mandate does not work, \neither. That is another option. MTBE would continue to be used and the \npotential adverse impact on ethanol would be there.\n  I am committed, I say to my colleagues, to a solution that, one, \ncleans up our Nation's drinking water, and, two, preserves the \nenvironmental benefits of the reformulated gasoline program, which is \nthe most cost-effective option for the whole Nation. And that is shown \nright there with the green line. That is the one we can get it done \nwith. I wish it were here with what is depicted with the blue line, but \nthis will get us there with what is depicted with the green line; and \nwe will do it.\n  So I am convinced this is the right approach. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues. This is an honest attempt to sit down with \neverybody and get to a resolution, because to continue to argue about \nthis and debate this, while more and more wells every day get polluted \nwith MTBE, is irresponsible. It is totally irresponsible.\n\n  We should not be talking about somebody's profit at the expense of \nsomebody's well being polluted. Let's compromise. We will work with \nyou. You can make some profit, but you are not going to make so much \nprofit that we have to stand around and have our wells polluted. That \nis simply wrong. It is unacceptable. It is irresponsible. I am not \ngoing to stand for it. I don't think anybody would who had these kinds \nof problems. It is irresponsible. So we are going to work together.\n  I am very encouraged by the folks, especially the ethanol Senators, \nwho I have talked with, and their staffs. We have talked to folks in \nthe oil industry. They are not real thrilled about some of this, but, \nagain, this is a solution that we must find. We cannot continue to say \nwe will talk about it next week or we will deal with it in conference \nor we will deal with it next year. We need to deal with it now. This is \na responsible effort to do that.\n  So, again, I look forward to working with my colleagues, and I look \nforward to that markup on September 7. I intend to be ready for it, and \nto send that bill out of the EPW Committee and on to the calendar in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2962\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in a very few hours we will, each of us, be \nreturning to our respective States for the summer recess. Most of us \nwill have town hall meetings or other fora in which we will have a \nchance to interact with our constituents.\n  Much that occurs on this floor, although very important, does not \nconnect with the American people. Some of it seems pretty esoteric, \npretty dry stuff. I am going to be discussing this afternoon an issue \nthat does connect with the American people. Whether you live in Maine \nor California or Washington State or Florida or, as I do, the great \nState of Nevada--and which I am privileged to represent--people are \ntalking about the price of prescription drugs.\n  The reason for that is that the marvels of modern medicine have made \nit possible, through prescription drugs, to address a number of the \nmaladies that affect all of us as part of humankind. The cost of those \nprescription drugs are literally going through the ceiling. I will \ncomment more specifically upon that in a moment.\n  For literally millions of people in this country, the cost of \nprescription drugs has been so prohibitive that medications that would \naddress a medical problem that those individuals face are simply beyond \nthe pale. So for many, it is fair to say, the choice is a Hobson's \nchoice.\n  Do they eat in the evening, or do they take the prescription \nmedication that has been prescribed by their physician? It would be my \nfondest hope and expectation, before this Congress adjourns sine die--\nthat is, at the end of this legislative year--that we could enact \nprescription drug legislation. That would be my No. 1 priority. But I \nthink all of us recognize there are some things we can do as part of \nwhatever plan we might subscribe to, and Senator Graham and I this \nafternoon are offering a piece of legislation entitled the Consumer \nAwareness of Market-Based Drug Prices Act of 2000.\n  This is a piece of legislation that deals with the price of drugs. We \nknow what the cost is, but we are talking about the price. We have a \nlot of information on the cost. We know, for example, that we are \nspending on drugs in this country, prescription medications--in the \nlast available year, 1999--almost $122 billion. We also know quite a \nbit about how much we in the Federal Government are spending for \nprescription drugs.\n  For example, the States and the Federal Government spent $17 billion \nin fiscal year 1999 for drugs, just under the Medicaid program alone. \nThose costs are going to escalate rather dramatically. What is missing, \nhowever, is some critically important information--information that \nwould be important to consumers and those who negotiate on behalf of \nconsumers, because what we don't know, what we don't have much \ninformation about is drug prices. The reason for that is some statutory \nprohibitions I am going to talk about and which this legislation \nspecifically addresses.\n  So the questions are: What do consumers know about drug prices today? \nWhat do employers who purchase prescription drugs on behalf of their \nemployees know about prices? What do health plans negotiating on behalf \nof their enrollees know about prices? What do physicians who prescribe \ndrugs for their patients know about prices?\n  The answer is simply, very, very little; almost nothing. What little \nis known is essentially worthless information. We have the average \nwholesale price, but this is a truly meaningless figure.\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\n  During the course of my discussion this afternoon on the floor of the \nSenate, we are going to be talking about three kinds of prices: The \naverage wholesale price, average manufacturer price, and the best \nprice.\n  Just talking about the average wholesale price, that is a public list \nprice set by manufacturers, the pharmaceutical industry; that is \nneither average nor wholesale and is a price set by the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. The best analogy I can give you is that it would be \nanalogous to the price that appears as the sticker price on the window \nof a new car. Nobody pays that price. It really is not very helpful in \nterms of what you need to know when negotiating to purchase a car. And \nnow there are a number of web sites and publications and manuals--a \nwhole host of things that tell consumers this is what the manufacturer \npaid, these are the hold-backs by the dealers, these are the discounts \nand the commissions; here is the price on which you want to focus your \nattention. You can get that information if you are purchasing an \nautomobile, and you can get that information when you purchase a whole \nhost of other things. But that information is not available if you are \ntalking about finding out the price of prescription drugs, and that is \nbecause of some statutory limitations.\n\n  It is somewhat analogous to the statement Sir Winston Churchill made \nin 1939 in describing the Soviet Union. He went on to say: ``A riddle, \nwrapped up in a mystery, inside an enigma.'' That is a pretty fair \ncharacterization of what we know about the prices of prescription \nmedications as sold by the manufacturer.\n  There are many different approaches as we deal with this prescription \ndrug issue and want to extend it as either part of Medicare or some \nalternative approach. I have been privileged to serve on the Finance \nCommittee, which has been the vortex for this debate and discussion. I \nlistened closely to my colleagues wax eloquently on the subject of \nprescription drugs, and, whether you are to the left or to the right of \nthe political spectrum, or whether you consider yourself in the \nmainstream, a moderate, all of us worship at the shrine of competition. \nEverybody says what we need to do is to inject more competition into \nthe system. I happen to subscribe to that because I do believe that by \nallowing the synergy of the free marketplace to work, it will be the \nmost efficient and the most cost-effective way to deliver services. But \nthere is an impediment to the operation of the free marketplace.\n  What does the free marketplace need to work? How do we ensure \ncompetition? Well, some of you may recall that course from school, \nEcon. 201; that is what it was called at the University of Nevada where \nI was enrolled. Basic economic theory dictates that the availability of \nreal market-based information is critical to a free market and that \nprice transparency is necessary. That is precisely what we do not have \nin this system we have created today.\n  The market today lacks market-based price information. A market \nsimply cannot work without the availability of that price information. \nI emphasize the availability of that information. The information that \nis available to the public verges on the absurd. There is a complete \nvoid of useful information about prices. So, in effect, the employers \nand health plans negotiating on behalf of consumers are negotiating in \nthe dark. They are at a serious disadvantage. It is as if they are \nblindfolded going into that negotiating arena. They don't know where \nthe end of the tunnel is. They do not know what the real prices are. So \none can fairly ask, how can even the most conscientious, effective \nemployer or health plan operator negotiate good prices on behalf of \nconsumers if they don't have the most basic information about market \nprices? They undoubtedly pay higher prices than they otherwise would, \nand ultimately these higher prices are translated into higher prices to \nthe consumers; they are passed on. That is the nature of the system.\n  So what type of price information would be available, or should be \navailable, that would be useful and helpful information? The average \nmanufacturer price for a drug would be a useful thing for purchasers to \nknow; that is, the average price at which a manufacturer sold a \nparticular drug. That is what is actually paid for retail drugs. By \nlaw, by act of Congress, that is kept confidential, and that is one of \nthe changes this legislation seeks to accomplish. That is confidential. \nYou can't get that information.\n  The average price actually paid to a manufacturer by a wholesaler is \nsupposed to be similar to the average manufacturer's price, but, in \npoint of fact, it diverges widely. The average wholesale price, to \nrefresh your memory, is a list price that is meaningless, a price \nassigned by the pharmaceutical industry. In theory, these prices should \nbe tracking; in point of fact, they widely diverge. So it is the \naverage manufactured price, the price that is actually paid, that is \nwhat we really want to know, and that is what we don't know.\n  The other price we don't know, and also by law is kept confidential, \nis the best price. That is the lowest price available to the private \nsector for a particular medication--whether it be Mevacor, Claritin, or \nany one of the other medications so many of us use today. That \ninformation is not available. So the average wholesale price--an \nutterly meaningless number, a fiction, if you will--is available. The \naverage manufacturer price is not; nor is the best price.\n  Knowledge about the average manufacturer price and the best price \nwould certainly enable us to have lower prices for health plans, lower \nprices for employers, and lower prices for the consumers. But the \npublic is denied this information.\n  Let me emphasize--because a number of you might be thinking: There we \ngo again with a vast new bureaucracy to collect this data with all of \nthe burdens that are imposed upon the free market and the limitations \nthat would be generated.\n  My friends, that is not the case because under the law, the Secretary \nof Health and Human Services currently collects the average \nmanufacturer price and the best price.\n  In other words, we have this information. It is not something we \ndon't know about, or we have to create some new mechanism to gather. We \nhave that information. It is there. But we are precluded by law from \nsharing that information with those who negotiate with the \npharmaceutical industry to negotiate the best possible price for \nemployees, members of health plans, or other organizations that provide \nprescription drugs to their clients, patient customer base--however you \ncharacterize it. There is good information. All purchasers could use it \nto benefit those for whom they negotiate.\n  It is clear that we need to increase the level of knowledge consumers \nhave about drug prices in today's marketplace. Transparency--that is \nthe ability to see what these prices are and promote the fair market--\nwill lower prices.\n  That is why my colleague, Senator Graham, and I are introducing this \nlegislation. We are not talking about mandating negotiated prices. We \nare simply talking about making the data that is collected available to \nthose who are negotiating for prescription drugs. It would simply \nrequire the Secretary, who already collects this information, to \nprovide the average manufacturer price of drugs and the best price \navailable in the market.\n  These prices are collected to implement the Medicare prescription \ndrug rebate system. The rebates are based on those prices. But because \nMedicaid is prohibited by law from disclosing the average manufacturer \nprice, or the best price, the market doesn't get the advantage of this \ninformation, and we are prohibited from knowing the price that Medicaid \npays for each drug.\n  Let me say say parenthetically that it is generally agreed that the \nprice Medicaid pays is in point of fact the best price. So this would \nbe a very relevant piece of information. We can't say for sure even \nwith respect to a federally funded program what we are spending on a \nparticular drug. We don't know what Medicaid pays for Claritin, \nMevacor, or Prilosec. We just do not know that. We know the total price \nwe are paying for drugs generally, and what we are spending for drugs. \nBut we do not know what we are paying for them separately. This \ninformation needs to be made available because making price information \navailable will help purchasers and consumers alike.\n  Today, anyone can get on the Internet to find the lowest price \navailable\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\nfor a given airline flight. I think the question needs to be asked: Why \nshouldn't the public have access to price information on something that \nis so critical and that may be necessary to save one's life, or to \nprevent the onset of some debilitating disease, or to ameliorate its \nimpact, the information with respect to the average manufacturer price \nand the best price?\n  The bottom line is today there are no sources of good price \ninformation for consumers and purchasers, thus keeping prices \nartificially higher than they would otherwise be.\n  The legislation which we introduce today would be extremely helpful \nin correcting this. The market-based price information this bill would \nprovide would help all purchasers, employers, and pharmacy benefit \nmanagers who are at a disadvantage without true price information.\n  Employers are struggling with increasing premiums. In large part, \npremiums are increasing because of rising drug expenditures. And, yet, \nemployers don't have the information they need to assess whether the \npremium increases are appropriate. The answer to that is because \nwithout knowing the prices and the rebates that the pharmacy benefit \nmanagers are negotiating, they are not able to determine if the \npharmacy benefit managers are passing along the rebates to them in the \nform of lower costs and lower premiums.\n  Further, neither the PBMs nor the employers know if the drug \ncompanies are being candid with them. When they try to negotiate lower \nprices with the manufacturer, they are told, no, we can't give you that \nprice because it is lower than the best price. The employers and the \nPBMs have no way of knowing in point of fact whether it is true. The \nbattleground is really a negotiation of what these prices are. That is \nthe information we don't know. In effect, those who negotiate with the \npharmaceutical industry go into that combat with one arm tied behind \ntheir backs and blindfolded as to what the average manufacturer price \nand the best price is.\n  Let me say that this piece of legislation is going to provoke an \noutcry. You don't have to have a degree from Oxford. You don't have to \nhave a Ph.D. from some of our most distinguished institutions in \nAmerica. Who would one think would dislike this information? My \nfriends, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to know.\n  Undoubtedly, the provision that is in the law today was crafted for \ntheir benefit. It certainly was not crafted for the benefit of employer \ngroups, or health care providers who negotiate pharmaceutical benefits. \nIt certainly was not put in to protect consumers. It is not in their \nbest interests.\n  I am sure we are going to have a predictable outcry that some \nhorrendous draconian thing will occur if we make these prices \navailable.\n  My view is that transparency is essential. Make the prices available, \nand let this free marketplace that we all talk about that has produced \nsuch an extraordinary standard of living for us be the envy of the \nworld. Nobody is suggesting that the free market could not, nor would, \nin my judgment, provide some of the dynamics that would help to keep \nthe costs down. Let an honest negotiating process occur.\n  The lack of market-based information has an effect on the Federal \nbudget--not only for consumers in terms of the medications they pay for \nbut all taxpayers.\n  Whether in Congress--and I profoundly hope we will in fact--makes \nthat prescription drug benefit a part of Medicare, or a subsequent \nCongress, this is an idea whose time has come. It will occur. It may \nnot occur in my time. I leave at the end of this year. But it is going \nto occur. There are dramatic cost implications. Without the benefit of \nthis information, it will be very difficult indeed.\n  Let's just talk for a moment in terms of prices, information that is \nmade available, and the generic formulas that we use for reimbursement.\n\n  Although the average wholesale price is not a true market measure \nprice--this is set by the industry--it is used to determine Medicare \nreimbursement for the few drugs that are currently covered by Medicare.\n  The prescription Medicare benefit is very limited. I would like to \nsee the Medicare prescription benefit extended through Medicare as an \noption, as we have a voluntary option under Part B. I don't want \nanybody to be confused, but there are some drugs that are covered in \nconcert with the physician's prescriptions.\n  The average wholesale price minus 5 percent--what is wrong with that? \nWhat is wrong with that is this average wholesale price is a fix. It \nmeans nothing. It is the price that the drug companies get together and \ntell us is the average wholesale price. Yet that is the reimbursement \nmechanism that is used for Medicare.\n  Medicaid, which is a program, as we all know, that involves \nparticipation by the Federal and the State governments and made \navailable to the poorest of our citizens, represents a rather \nsubstantial cost to the taxpayer. My recollection is that cost is in \nthe neighborhood of about $17 billion a year.\n\n  Here is how that formula worked. This is the Medicaid benefit: The \naverage wholesale price minus 10 percent. Remember, this is a price set \nby the pharmaceutical industry; it is not a market-driven price. \nMultiply that times the units--whatever the number of prescriptions, \nsay an allergy drug or a drug for elevated cholesterol level--times \n15.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. This is the one we are \nprecluded from knowing. Or take the average manufacturer price, minus \nthe best price. This information we don't know, and we should be able \nto get this information.\n  What can happen with respect to the Medicare reimbursements--because \nthe physicians who prescribe this medication get the average wholesale \nprice minus 5 percent, we do not know what the physicians are actually \npaying the pharmaceutical industry for the drugs. According to the \nJustice Department, the Health and Human Services Office of the \nInspector General, and our colleague in the other body who chairs the \nCommerce Committee, the average wholesale price has been manipulated in \norder to reap greater Medicare reimbursements.\n  The way that works, the doctor prescribes something covered by \nMedicare and reimburses the average wholesale price minus 5 percent. In \npoint of fact, your physician may be paying much, much less to the \npharmaceutical industry. So the spread is the physician's profit, and \nthere is potential for abuse.\n  I am not suggesting in any way that a physician should not be \ncompensated for his care. I am proud to say my son is a physician, a \ncardiologist. But you ought not to be able to manipulate the wholesale \nprice--which is this fiction we have talked about--and then allow the \nphysician to seek payment from the pharmaceutical industry at a price \nthat is substantially less than what Medicare is paying. That gouges \nthe American taxpayer. That is the issue that concerns us.\n  As I have indicated, drug companies have artificially inflated this \naverage wholesale price, which results in these inflated Medicare \nreimbursements to physicians, and the manufacturer then in turn \nprovides the discounts, and the physicians can keep the difference. If \nthe average wholesale price of the drug is $100, minus 5 percent would \nbe $95, and if the physician actually only pays $50, the physician is \ngetting $45 as part of that spread. That is much less than he is \nactually paying. Medicare, conversely, is reimbursing the physician at \na far greater price than the physician is actually paying for that \nmedication.\n  The need for better information has never been greater. Medicare drug \nbenefit is critical and should be enacted this year. I truly hope it \nwill be. Accurate market-based price information will ensure the best \nuse of the taxpayer dollars financing this benefit and the lowest \npossible beneficiary coinsurance; that is, the amount, the coinsurance, \nthe beneficiary has to pay.\n  This should be an easy call. Transparency promotes a fair market. We \nare all for that, I believe. Price information leads to price \ncompetition. I think we are all for that. That competition leads to \nlower prices for employers, for health plans, and for consumers. I \nthink we are all for that.\n\n  So at a time when drug prices are increasing at two to three times \nthe rate of the overall rate of inflation, referred to as the Consumer \nPrice Index, at a time when the same drugs prescribed by veterinarians, \nfor use by pets--the identical medication--are priced lower than the \nsame drug prescribed by prescriptions for doctors' use for people,\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\nat a time when the primary information consumers have about \nprescription drugs is through the $2 billion annually spent by the \nindustry on direct-to-consumer advertising, and those ads never mention \nprice --these are the things we are bombarded with on television; we \nsee full pages in the leading newspapers in the country--at a time when \nAmericans are traveling to foreign countries--to Canada and Mexico, in \nparticular--to obtain lower prices, why shouldn't we be doing whatever \nwe can to encourage competition in the United States and to lower the \nprice of drugs sold in this country?\n  I think it is a no-brainer. I think we should set the market forces \nin action. We simply need to allow the public to have access to readily \navailable market-based information. This is commonsense, easy-to-\nunderstand, easy-to-implement legislation. We should pass it this year. \nThere is no new bureaucracy created. We can have the information at \nHHS. All this legislation would do is require it be made available. The \npotential benefits are enormous.\n  It will be interesting to see how this debate unfolds on this \nlegislation because my colleagues have not heard the last of me on this \nissue. This makes a lot of sense, whether we do or do not succeed this \nyear in extending a prescription benefit as part of Medicare. We ought \nto do it. We can do it. We should do it. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in a bipartisan effort to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 2964. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nnew tax incentives to make health insurance more affordable for small \nbusinesses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  access to affordable health care act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nAccess to Affordable Health Care Act, that is designed to make health \ninsurance more affordable both for individuals and for small businesses \nthat provide health care coverage for their employees.\n  In the past few years, Congress has taken some major steps to expand \naccess to affordable health coverage for all Americans. In 1996, the \nHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act--also known as \nKassebaum-Kennedy--was signed into law which assures that American \nworkers and their families will not lose their health care coverage if \nthey change jobs, lose their jobs, or become ill.\n  One of the first bills I sponsored on coming to the Senate was \nlegislation to establish the State Children's Health Insurance Program, \nwhich was enacted as part of the Balanced Budget Act. States have \nenthusiastically responded to this program, which now provides \naffordable health insurance coverage to over two million children \nnationwide, including 9,365 in Maine's expanded Medicaid and CubCare \nprograms.\n  Despite these efforts, the number of uninsured Americans continues to \nrise. At a time when unemployment is low and our nation's economy is \nthriving, more than 44 million Americans--including 200,000 Mainers--do \nnot have health insurance. Clearly, we must make health insurance more \navailable and more affordable.\n  Most Americans under the age of 65 get their health coverage through \nthe workplace. It is therefore a common assumption that people without \nhealth insurance are unemployed. The fact is, however, that most \nuninsured Americans are members of families with at least one full-time \nworker. According to the Health Insurance Association of America, \nalmost seven out of ten uninsured Americans live in a family whose head \nof household works full-time.\n  In my state of Maine, small business is not just a segment of the \neconomy--it is the economy. I am, therefore, particularly concerned \nthat uninsured, working Americans are most often employees of small \nbusinesses. Nearly half of the uninsured workers nationwide are in \nbusinesses with fewer than 25 employees.\n  According to a recent National Federation of Independent Businesses \nsurvey of over 4,000 of its members, the cost of health insurance is \nthe number one problem facing small businesses. And it has been since \n1986. It is time for us to listen and to lend a hand to these small \nbusinesses.\n  Small employers generally face higher costs for health insurance than \nlarger firms, which makes them less likely to offer coverage. Premiums \nare generally higher for small businesses because they do not have as \nmuch purchasing power as large companies, which limits their ability to \nbargain for lower rates. They also have higher administrative costs \nbecause they have fewer employees among whom to spread the fixed costs \nof a health benefits plan. Moreover, they are not as able to spread \nrisks of medical claims over as many employees as can large firms.\n  As a consequence, according to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), \nonly 42 percent of small businesses with fewer than 50 employees offer \nhealth insurance to their employees. By way of contrast, more than 95 \npercent of businesses with 100 or more employees offer insurance.\n\n  Moreover, the smaller the business, the less likely it is to offer \nhealth insurance to its employees. According to the Employee Benefit \nResearch Institute (EBRI), only 27 percent of workers in firms with \nfewer than 10 employees received health insurance from their employers \nin their own name, compared with 66 percent of workers in firms with \n1,000 or more employees. Small businesses want to provide health \ninsurance for their employees, but the cost is often prohibitive.\n  Simply put, the biggest obstacle to health care coverage in the \nUnited States today is cost. While American employers everywhere--from \ngiant multinational corporations to the small corner store--are facing \nhuge hikes in their health insurance costs, these rising costs are \nparticularly problematic for small businesses and their employees. Many \nsmall employers are facing premium increases of 20 percent or more, \ncausing them either to drop their health benefits or pass the \nadditional costs on to their employees through increased deductibles, \nhigher copays or premium hikes. This, too, is troubling and will likely \nadd to the ranks of the uninsured since it will cause some employees--\nparticularly lower-wage workers who are disproportionately affected by \nincreased costs--to drop or turn down coverage when it is offered to \nthem.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Access to Affordable \nHealth Care Act, would help small employers cope with these rising \ncosts. My bill would provide new tax credits for small businesses to \nhelp make health insurance more affordable. It would encourage those \nsmall businesses that do not currently offer health insurance to do so \nand would help businesses that do offer insurance to continue coverage \neven in the face of rising costs.\n  Under my proposal, employers with fewer than ten employees would \nreceive a tax credit of 50 percent of the employer contribution to the \ncost of employee health insurance. Employers with ten to 25 employees \nwould receive a 30 percent credit. Under my bill, the credit would be \nbased on an employer's yearly qualified health insurance expenses of up \nto $2,000 for individual coverage and $4,000 for family coverage.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would also make health \ninsurance more affordable for individuals and families who must \npurchase health insurance on their own. The Access to Affordable Health \nCare Act would provide an above-the-line tax deduction for individuals \nwho pay at least 50 percent of the cost of their health and long-term \ncare insurance. Regardless of whether an individual takes the standard \ndeduction or itemizes, he or she would be provided relief by the new \nabove-the-line deduction.\n  My bill also would allow self-employed Americans to deduct the full \namount of their health care premiums. Some 25 million Americans are in \nfamilies headed by a self-employed individual--of these, five million \nare uninsured. Establishing parity in the tax treatment of health \ninsurance costs between the self-employed and those working for large \nbusinesses is not just a matter of equity. It will also help to reduce \nthe number of uninsured, but working Americans. My bill will make \nhealth insurance more affordable for the 82,000 people in Maine who are \nself-employed. They include our lobstermen, our hairdressers, our \nelectricians, our plumbers, and the many owners of mom-and-pop stores \nthat dot communities throughout the state.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n  Mr. President, the Access to Affordable Health Care Act would help \nsmall businesses afford health insurance for their employees, and it \nwould also make coverage more affordable for working Americans who must \npurchase it on their own. I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors \nof this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Cleland):\n  S. 2965. A bill to amend the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, to establish \na program to ensure greater security for United States seaports, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n               the port and maritime security act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today, to introduce the Port and \nMaritime Security Act of 2000. This legislation is long overdue. It is \nneeded to facilitate future technological and advances and increases in \ninternational trade, and ensure that we have the sort of security \ncontrol necessary to ensure that our borders are protected from drug \nsmuggling, illegal aliens, trade fraud, threats of terrorism as well as \npotential threats to our ability to mobilize U.S. military force.\n  The Department of Transportation recently commenced an evaluation of \nour marine transportation needs for the 21st Century. In September \n1999, Transportation Secretary Slater issued a preliminary report of \nthe Marine Transportation System (MTS) Task Force--An Assessment of the \nU.S. Marine Transportation System. The report reflected a highly \ncollaborative effort among public sector agencies, private sector \norganizations and other stakeholders in the MTS.\n  The report indicates that the United States has more than 1,000 \nharbor channels and 25,000 miles of inland, intracoastal, and coastal \nwaterways in the United States which serve over 300 ports, with more \nthan 3,700 terminals that handle passenger and cargo movements. These \nwaterways and ports link to 152,000 miles of railways, 460,000 miles of \nunderground pipelines and 45,000 miles of interstate highways. \nAnnually, the U.S. marine transportation system moves more than 2 \nbillion tons of domestic and international freight, imports 3.3 billion \ntons of domestic oil, transports 134 million passengers by ferry, \nserves 78 million Americans engaged in recreational boating, and hosts \nmore than 5 million cruise ship passengers.\n  The MTS provides economic value, as waterborne cargo contributes more \nthan $742 billion to U.S. gross domestic product and creates employment \nfor more than 13 million citizens. While these figures reveal the \nmagnitude of our waterborne commerce, they don't reveal the spectacular \ngrowth of waterborne commerce, or the potential problems in coping with \nthis growth. It is estimated that the total volume of domestic and \ninternational trade is expected to double over the next twenty years. \nThe doubling of trade also brings up the troubling issue of how the \nU.S. is going to protect our maritime borders from crime, threats of \nterrorism, or even our ability to mobilize U.S. armed forces.\n  Security at our maritime borders is given substantially less federal \nconsideration than airports or land borders. In the aviation industry, \nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is intimately involved in \nensuring that security measures are developed, implemented, and funded. \nThe FAA works with various Federal officials to assess threats directed \ntoward commercial aviation and to target various types of security \nmeasures as potential threats change. For example, during the Gulf War, \nairports were directed to ensure that no vehicles were parked within a \nset distance of the entrance to a terminal.\n  Currently, each air carrier, whether a U.S. carrier or foreign air \ncarrier, is required to submit a proposal on how it plans to meet its \nsecurity needs. Air carriers also are responsible for screening \npassengers and baggage in compliance with FAA regulations. The types of \nmachines used in airports are all approved, and in many instances paid \nfor by the FAA. The FAA uses its laboratories to check the machinery to \ndetermine if the equipment can detect explosives that are capable of \ndestroying commercial aircrafts. Clearly, we learned from the Pan Am \n103 disaster over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988. Congress passed \nlegislation in 1990 ``the Aviation Security Improvement Act,'' which \nwas carefully considered by the Commerce Committee, to develop the \ntypes of measures I noted above. We also made sure that airports, the \nFAA, air carriers and law enforcement worked together to protect the \nflying public.\n  Following the crash of TWA flight 800 in 1996, we also leaped to \nspend money, when it was first thought to have been caused by a \nterrorist act. The FAA spent about $150 million on additional screening \nequipment, and we continue today to fund research and development for \nbetter, and more effective equipment. Finally, the FAA is responsible \nfor ensuring that background checks (employment records/criminal \nrecords) of security screeners and those with access to secured \nairports are carried out in an effective and thorough manner. The FAA, \nat the direction of Congress, is responsible for certifying screening \ncompanies, and has developed ways to better test screeners. This is all \ndone in the name of protecting the public. Seaports deserve no less \nconsideration.\n  At land borders, there is a similar investment in security by the \nfederal government. In TEA-21, approved $140 million a year for five \nyears for the National Corridor Planning and Development and \nCoordinated Border Infrastructure Program. Eligible activities under \nthis program include improvements to existing transportation and \nsupporting infrastructure that facilitate cross-border vehicles and \ncargo movements; construction of highways and related safety \nenforcement facilities that facilitate movements related to \ninternational trade; operational improvements, including improvements \nrelating to electronic data interchange and use of telecommunications, \nto expedite cross border vehicle and cargo movements; and planning, \ncoordination, design and location studies. By way of contrast, at U.S. \nseaports, the federal government invests nothing in infrastructure, \nother than the human presence of the U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Customs \nService, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and whatever \nequipment those agencies have to accomplish their mandates. Physical \ninfrastructure is provided by state-controlled port authorities, or by \nprivate sector marine terminal operators. There are no controls, or \nrequirements in place, except for certain standards promulgated by the \nCoast Guard for the protection of cruise ship passenger terminals. \nEssentially, where sea ports are concerned we have abrogated the \nfederal responsibility of border control to the state and private \nsector.\n\n  I think that the U.S. Coast Guard and Customs Agency are doing an \noutstanding job, but they are outgunned. There is simply too much money \nin the illegal activities they are seeking to curtail or eradicate, and \nthere is too much traffic coming into, and out of the United States. \nFor instance, in the latest data available, 1999, we had more than 10 \nmillion TEU's imported into the United States. For the uninitiated, a \nTEU refers to a twenty-foot equivalent unit shipping container. By way \nof comparison, a regular truck measures 48-feet in length. So in \ntranslation, we imported close to 5 million truckloads of cargo. \nAccording to the Customs Service, seaports are able to inspect between \n1 percent and 2 percent of the containers, so in other words, a drug \nsmuggler has a 98 percent chance of gaining illegal entry.\n  It is amazing to think, that when you or I walk through an \ninternational airport we will walk through a metal detector, and our \nbags will be x-rayed, and Customs will interview us, and may check our \nbags. However, at a U.S. seaport you could import a 48 foot truck load \nof cargo, and have at least a 98 percent chance of not even being \ninspected. It just doesn't seem right.\n  For instance, in my own state, the Port of Charleston which is the \nfourth largest container port in the United States, Customs officials \nhave no equipment even capable of x-raying intermodal shipping \ncontainers. Customs, which is understaffed to start with, must \nphysically open containers, and request the use of a canine unit from \nlocal law enforcement to help with drug or illegal contraband \ndetection. This is simply not sufficient.\n  The need for the evaluation of higher scrutiny of our system of \nseaport security came at the request of Senator\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nGraham, and I would like to at this time commend him for his persistent \nefforts to address this issue. Senator Graham has had problems with \nsecurity at some of the Florida seaports, and although the state has \ntaken some steps to address the issue, there is a great need for \nconsiderable improvement. Senator Graham laudably convinced the \nPresident to appoint a Commission, designed similarly to the Aviation \nSecurity Commission, to review security at U.S. seaports.\n  The Commission visited twelve major U.S. seaports, as well as two \nforeign ports. It compiled a record of countless hours of testimony and \nheard from, and reviewed the security practices of the shipping \nindustry. It also met with local law enforcement officials to discuss \nthe issues and their experiences as a result of seaport related crime. \nUnfortunately, the report will not be publicly available until sometime \nin the fall; however, Senator Graham's staff and my staff have worked \nclosely with the Commission, to develop legislation--the bill that we \nare introducing--to address the Commission's concerns.\n  For instance, the Commission found that twelve U.S. seaports \naccounted for 56 percent of the number of cocaine seizures, 32 percent \nof the marijuana seizures, and 65 percent of heroin seizures in \ncommercial cargo shipments and vessels at all ports of entry \nnationwide. Yet, we have done relatively little, other than send in an \nundermanned contingency of Coast Guards and Customs officials to do \nwhatever they can.\n  Drugs are not the only criminal problem confronting U.S. seaports. \nFor example, alien smuggling has become increasingly lucrative \nenterprise. To illustrate, in August of 1999, I.N.S. officials found \n132 Chinese men hiding aboard a container ship docked in Savannah, \nGeorgia. The INS district director was quoted as saying; ``This was a \nvery sophisticated ring, and never in my 23 years with the INS have I \nseen anything as large or sophisticated''. According to a recent GAO \nreport on INS efforts on alien smuggling (RPT-Number: B-283952), \nsmugglers collectively may earn as much as several billion dollars per \nyear bringing in illegal aliens.\n  Another problem facing seaports is cargo theft. Cargo theft does not \nalways occur at seaports, but in many instances the theft has occurred \nbecause of knowledge of cargo contents. International shipping provides \naccess to a lot of information and a lot of cargo to many different \npeople along the course of its journey. We need to take steps to ensure \nthat we do not facilitate theft. Losses as a result of cargo theft have \nbeen estimated as high as $12 billion annually, and it has been \nreported to have increased by as much as 20 percent recently. The FBI \nhas become so concerned that it recently established a multi-district \ntask force, Operation Sudden Stop, to crack down on cargo crime.\n  The other issues facing seaport security may be less evident, but \npotentially of greater threat. As a nation in general, we have been \nrelatively lucky to have been free of some of the terrorist threats \nthat have plagued other nations. However, we must not become \ncomplacent. U.S. seaports are extremely exposed. On a daily basis many \nseaports have cargo that could cause serious illness and death to \npotentially large populations of civilians living near seaports if \ntargeted by terrorism.\n\n  The sheer magnitude of most seaports, their historical proximity to \nestablished population bases, the open nature of the facility, and the \nmassive quantities of hazardous cargoes being shipped through a port \ncould be extremely threatening to the large populations that live in \nareas surrounding our seaports. The same conditions in U.S. seaports, \nthat could expose us to threats from terrorism, could also be used to \ndisrupt our abilities to mobilize militarily. During the Persian Gulf \nWar, 95 percent of our military cargo was carried by sea. Disruption of \nsea service, could have resulted in a vastly different course of \nhistory. We need to ensure that it does not happen to any future \nmilitary contingencies.\n  As I mentioned before, our seaports are international borders, and \nconsequently we should treat them as such. However, I am realistic \nabout the possibilities for increasing seaport security, the realities \nof international trade, and the many functional differences inherent in \nthe different seaport localities. Seaports by their very nature, are \nopen and exposed to surrounding areas, and as such it will be \nimpossible to control all aspects of security, however, sensitive or \ncritical safety areas should be protected. I also understand that U.S. \nseaports have different security needs in form and scope. For instance, \na seaport in Alaska, that has very little international cargo does not \nneed the same degree of attention that a seaport in a major \nmetropolitan center, which imports and exports thousands of \ninternational shipments. However, the legislation we are introducing \ntoday will allow for public input and will consider local issues in the \nimplementation of new guidelines on port security, so as to address \nsuch details.\n  Substantively, the Port and Maritime Security Act establishes a \nmulti-pronged effort to address security needs at U.S. Seaports, and in \nsome cases formalizes existing practices that have proven effective. \nThe bill authorizes the Coast Guard to establish a task force on port \nsecurity in consultation with U.S. Customs and the Maritime \nAdministration.\n  The purpose of the task force is to implement the provisions of the \nact; to coordinate programs to enhance the security and safety of U.S. \nseaports; to provide long-term solutions for seaport safety issues; to \ncoordinate with local port security committees established by the Coast \nGuard to implement the provisions of the bill; and to ensure that the \npublic and local port security committees are kept informed about \nseaport security enhancement developments.\n  The bill requires the U.S. Coast Guard to establish local port \nsecurity committees at each U.S. seaport. The membership of these \ncommittees is to include representatives of the port authority, labor \norganizations, the private sector, and federal, state, and local \ngovernment officials. These committees will be chaired by the U.S. \nCoast Guard's Captain-of-the-Port, and will implement the provisions \nand requirements of the bill locally, to ensure that local \nconsiderations are considered in the establishment of security \nguidelines.\n  The bill requires the task force, in consultation with the U.S. \nCustoms Service and MarAd, to develop a system of providing port \nsecurity threat assessments for U.S. seaports, and to revise this \nassessment at least triennially. The threat assessment shall be \nperformed with the assistance of local officials, through local port \nsecurity committees, and ensure the port is made aware of and \nparticipates in the analysis of security concerns.\n  The bill also requires the task force to develop voluntary minimum \nsecurity guidelines that are linked to the U.S. Coast Guard Captain-of-\nthe-Port controls, to include a model port concept, and to include \nrecommended ``best practices'' guidelines for use of maritime terminal \noperators. Local port security committees are to participate in the \nformulation of security guidelines, and the Coast Guard is required to \npursue the international adoption of similar security guidelines. \nAdditionally, the Maritime Administration (MarAd) is required to pursue \nthe adoption of proper private sector accreditation of ports that \nadhere to guidelines (similar to a underwriters lab approval, or ISO \n9000 accreditations).\n  The bill authorizes MarAd to provide Title XI loan guarantees to \ncover the costs of port security infrastructure improvements, such as \ncameras and other monitoring equipment, fencing systems and other types \nof physical enhancements. The bill authorizes $10 million, annually for \nfour years, to cover costs, as defined by the Credit Reform Act, which \ncould guarantee up to $400 million in loans for security enhancements. \nThe bill also establishes a matching grant program to develop and \ntransfer technology to enhance security at U.S. seaports. The U.S. \nCustoms Service may award up to $12 million annually for four years for \nthis technology program, which is required to be awarded on a \ncompetitive basis. Long-term technology development is needed to ensure \nthat we can develop non-intrusive technology that will allow trade to \nexpand, but also allow us greater ability to detect criminal threat.\n\n  The bill also authorizes additional funding for the U.S. Customs \nService to carry out the requirements of the\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nbill, and more generally, to enhance seaport security. The bill \nrequires a report to be attached on security and a revision of 1997 \ndocument entitled ``Port Security: A National Planning Guide.'' The \nreport and revised guide are to be submitted to Congress and are to \ninclude a description of activities undertaken under the Port and \nMaritime Security Act of 2000, in addition to analysis of the effect of \nthose activities on port security and preventing acts of terrorism and \ncrime.\n  The bill requires the Attorney General, to the extent feasible, to \ncoordinate reporting of seaport related crimes and to work with state \nlaw enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data on cargo \ntheft. Better data will be crucial in identifying the extent and \nlocation of criminal threats and will facilitate law enforcement \nefforts combating crime. The bill also requires the Secretaries of \nAgriculture, Treasury, and Transportation, as well as the Attorney \nGeneral to work together to establish shared dockside inspection \nfacilities at seaports for federal and state agencies, and authorizes \n$3 million, annually for four years, to carry out this section. The \nbill also requires the Customs Service to improve reporting of imports \nat seaports, and to eliminate user fees for domestic U.S.- flag \ncarriers carrying in-bond domestic cargo.\n  Finally, the bill reauthorizes an extension of tonnage duties through \n2006, and makes available $40,000,000 from the collections of these \nduties to carry out the Port and Maritime Security Act. These fees \ncurrently are set at certain levels, and are scheduled to be reduced in \n2002. The legislation reauthorizes and extends the current fee level \nfor an additional four years, but dedicates its use to enhancing our \nefforts to fight crime at U.S. seaports and to facilitating improved \nprotection of our borders, as well as to enhance our efforts to ward \noff potential threats of terrorism.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today, joined by Senators Hollings, \nBreaux, and Cleland, to introduce the Port and Maritime Security Act of \n2000, a bill that would significantly improve the overall security and \ncargo processing operations at U.S. seaports.\n  For some time, I have very been concerned that seaports--unlike our \nairports, lack the advanced security procedures and equipment that are \nnecessary to prevent acts of terrorism, cargo theft and drug \ntrafficking. In addition, although seaports conduct the vast majority \nof our international trade, the activities of law enforcement and trade \nprocessing agencies--such as the Coast Guard, Customs, the Department \nof Agriculture, the FBI, and state and local agencies--are often \nuncoordinated and fragmented. Taken together, the lack of security and \ninteragency coordination at U.S. seaports present an extremely \nattractive target for criminals and a variety of criminal activities.\n  Before discussing the specifics of this legislation, it is important \nto describe the circumstances that have caused the security crisis at \nour seaports. Today, U.S. seaports conduct 95 percent of the Nation's \ninternational trade. Over the next twenty years, the total volume of \nimported and exported goods at seaports is expected to increase three-\nfold.\n  In addition, the variety of trade and commerce that are carried out \nat seaports has greatly expanded. Bulk cargo, containerized cargo, \npassenger cargo and tourism, intermodal transportation systems, and \ncomplex domestic and international trade relationships have \nsignificantly changed the nature and conduct of seaport commerce. This \ncontinuing expansion of activity at seaports has increased the \nopportunities for a variety of illegal activities, including drug \ntrafficking, cargo theft, auto theft, illegal immigration, and the \ndiversion of cargo, such as food, to avoid safety inspections.\n  In the face of these new challenges, it appears that the U.S. port \nmanagement system has fallen behind the rest of the world. We lack a \ncomprehensive, nationwide strategy to address the security issues that \nface our seaport system.\n  Therefore, in 1998, I asked the President to establish a Federal \ncommission to evaluate both the nature and extent of crime and the \noverall state of security in seaports and to develop recommendations \nfor improving the response of Federal, State and local agencies to all \ntypes of seaport crime. In response to my request, President Clinton \nestablished the Interagency Commission on Crime and Security in U.S. \nSeaports on April 27, 1999.\n  Over the past year, the Commission has conducted on-site surveys of \ntwelve (12) U.S. seaports, including the Florida ports of Miami and \nPort Everglades. At each location, interviews and focus group sessions \nwere held with representatives of Government agencies and the trade \ncommunity. The focus group meetings with Federal agencies, State and \nlocal government officials, and the trade community were designed to \nsolicit their input regarding issues involving crime, security, \ncooperation, and the appropriate government response to these issues. \nThe Commission also visited two large foreign ports--Rotterdam and \nFelixstowe--in order to assess their security procedures and use their \nstandards and procedures as a ``benchmark'' for operations at U.S. \nports.\n\n  In February of this year, the Commission issued preliminary findings \nwhich outlined many of the common security problems that were \ndiscovered in U.S. seaports. Among other conclusions, the Commission \nfound that: (1) intelligence and information sharing among law \nenforcement agencies needs to be improved at many ports; (2) many ports \ndo not have any idea about the threats they face, because vulnerability \nassessments are not performed locally; (3) a lack of minimum security \nstandards at ports and at terminals, warehouses, and trucking firms, \nleaves many ports and port users vulnerable to theft, pilferage, and \nunauthorized access by criminals; and (4) advanced equipment, such as \nsmall boats, cameras, vessel tracking devices, and large scale x-rays, \nare lacking at many high-risk ports. Although the Commission's final \nreport will not be released until later this summer, I have worked \nclosely with them to draft this legislation.\n  The legislation Senator Hollings and I are introducing today will \nbegin to address the problems of our seaports by directing the \nCommandant of the Coast Guard, in consultation with the Customs Service \nand the Maritime Administration, to establish a Task Force on Port \nSecurity. The new Task Force on Port Security will be responsible for \nimplementing all of the provisions of our legislation. It will have a \nbalanced representation, including Federal, State, local, and private \nsector representatives familiar with port operations, including port \nlabor.\n  To ensure full implementation of this legislation, the bill requires \nthe U.S. Coast Guard to establish local port security committees at \neach U.S. seaport. Membership of these committees will include \nrepresentatives of the local port authority, labor organizations, the \nprivate sector, and Federal, State, and local government officials. The \ncommittees will be chaired by the local U.S. Coast Guard Captain-of-\nthe-Port.\n  In addition, our bill requires the Task Force on Port Security to \ndevelop a system of providing port security threat assessments for U.S. \nseaports, and to revise these assessments at least every three years. \nThe local port security committees will participate in the analysis of \nthreat and security concerns.\n  Perhaps most important, the bill requires the Task Force to develop \nvoluntary minimum security guidelines for seaports, develop a ``model \nport'' concept for all seaports, and include recommended ``best \npractices'' guidelines for use by maritime terminal operators. Again, \nlocal port security committees are to participate in the formulation of \nthese security guidelines, and the Coast Guard is required to pursue \nthe international adoption--through the International Maritime \nOrganization and other organizations--of similar security guidelines.\n  Some States and localities have already conducted seaport security \nreviews, and have implemented strategies to correct the security \nshortfalls that they have discovered. In 1999, Florida initiated \ncomprehensive security review of seaports within the state. Led by \nJames McDonough, Director of the governor's Office of Drug Control, the \nreview found that 150 to 200 metric tons of cocaine--or fifty percent \nof the U.S. total-flow into Florida annually through ports throughout \nthe state.\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\n  Both the Florida Legislature and the Florida National Guard \nrecognized the need to address this growing problem and acted \ndecisively. Legislation was introduced in the Florida Senate that \ncalled for the development and implementation of statewide port \nsecurity plans, including requirements for minimum security standards \nand compliance inspections. In fiscal year 2001, the Florida National \nGuard will commit $1 million to provide counter-narcotics support at \nselected ports-of-entry to both strengthen U.S. Customs Service \ninterdiction efforts and enhance overall security at these ports.\n  In a July 21, 2000, editorial in the Tallahassee Democrat, Mr. \nMcDonough identifies the evaluation of Florida's seaports and the \nimplementation of security standards as a priority initiative in \nstemming the flow of drugs into Florida.\n  We realize that U.S. seaports are a joint federal, state, and local \nresponsibility, and we seek to support comprehensive port security \nefforts such as the one in Florida. Therefore, our bill provides \nsignificant incentives for both port infrastructure improvements and \nresearch and development on new port security equipment.\n  The bill authorizes the Maritime Administration to provide title XI \nloan guarantees to cover the costs of port security infrastructure \nimprovements, such as cameras and other monitoring equipment, fencing \nsystems, as well as other physical security enhancements. The \nauthorization level of $10 million annually, for four years, could \nguarantee up to $400 million in loans for seaport security \nenhancements.\n  In addition, the legislation will also establish a matching grant \nprogram to develop and transfer technology to enhance security at U.S. \nseaports. The U.S. Customs Service may award up to $12 million \nannually, for four years, for this competitive grant program.\n  We also must improve the reporting on, and response to, seaport \ncrimes as they take place. Therefore, the bill requires the Attorney \nGeneral to coordinate reports of seaport related crimes and to work \nwith State law enforcement officials to harmonize the reporting of data \nof cargo theft. To facilitate this coordination, the bill authorizes $2 \nmillion annually, for four years, to modify the Justice Department's \nNational Incident-Based Reporting System. It also authorizes grants to \nstates to help them modify their reporting systems to capture crime \ndata more accurately.\n  In order to pay for all of these important initiatives, the bill \nwould reauthorize an extension of tonnage duties through 2006. It would \nalso make available $40,000,000 from the collection of these duties to \ncarry out all of the provisions of the Port and Maritime Security Act. \nCurrently, the collection of tonnage duties is not directed towards a \nspecific program. Implementing the provisions of the Port and Maritime \nSecurity Act of 2000 will produce concrete improvements in the \nefficiency, safety, and security of our nation's seaports, and will \nresult in a demonstrable benefit for those who currently pay tonnage \nduties.\n  Seaports play one of the most critical roles in expanding our \ninternational trade and protecting our borders from international \nthreats. The ``Port and Maritime Security Act'' recognizes these \nimportant responsibilities of our seaports, and devotes the necessary \nresources to move ports into the 21st century. I urge my colleagues to \nlook towards the future by supporting this critical legislation--and by \ntaking action to protect one of our most valuable tools in promoting \neconomic growth.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the July 21, 2000 \neditorial from The Tallahasee Democrat in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Tallahassee Democrat, July 21, 2000]\n\n              Florida's Drug War: Looking Back--And Ahead\n\n                        (By James R. McDonough)\n\n       The recent signing of anti-drug legislation by Gov. Jeb \n     Bush should come as welcome news to Debbie Alumbaugh and \n     parents like her.\n       In 1998, Michael Tiedemann, the Fort Pierce woman's 15-\n     year-old son, choked to death on his vomit after getting sick \n     from ingesting GHB and another drug. GHB is one of several \n     ``club'' or ``designer'' drugs that are a growing problem in \n     Tallahassee, as pointed out recently in a letter to the \n     Democrat by Rosalind Tompkins, director of the newly created \n     Anti-Drug Anti-Violence Alliance. The new law won't bring \n     Michael back, but it lessens the chance that GHB and other \n     dangerous substances will fall into other young hands. Gov. \n     Bush, who has made reducing drug abuse one of his top \n     priorities, approved the following anti-drug measures passed \n     during the 2000 session:\n       A controlled substance act, which is aimed at GHB, ecstasy \n     and other club drugs, and more established drugs such as \n     methamphetamine. The new law addresses the trafficking, sale, \n     purchase, manufacture and possession of these drugs.\n       A nitrous oxide criminalization act that addresses the \n     illegal possession, sale, purchase or distribution of this \n     substance.\n       A money-laundering bill designed to tighten security at \n     Florida's seaports. The measure also creates a contraband \n     interdiction team that will search vehicles for illegal \n     drugs.\n       A bill that applies the penalties under Florida's ``10/20/\n     Life'' law to juveniles who carry a gun while trafficking in \n     illegal drugs.\n       Gov. Bush also approved a budget that includes an estimated \n     $270 million for drug abuse prevention and treatment. This is \n     a big step in the right direction, as these services, \n     especially drug prevention programs aimed at children, are \n     critical.\n       Considering the above legislation--along with the \n     publication of the Florida Drug Control Strategy, a statewide \n     crackdown on rave clubs, a survey that shows significant \n     reductions in youth use of marijuana, cocaine and inhalants, \n     and a decline in heroin and cocaine overdose deaths--the past \n     year has shown some progress toward reducing drug abuse.\n       Even with additional dollars for drug abuse treatment, the \n     number of treatment beds still falls far short of demand. The \n     wait time to enter a treatment program is measured in weeks. \n     This is unacceptable when you consider the damage done to the \n     individual and to society as an addict awaits treatment. We \n     must continue to narrow the treatment gap until those who \n     need this vital help can get it in a timely manner.\n       Our efforts cannot be solely focused on the demand for \n     drugs. A sound drug control strategy must also address \n     supply. The Office of Drug Control has several initiatives to \n     stem the flow of drugs into Florida.\n       An intelligence effort to determine the types of drugs \n     entering our state, the way in which they enter, who brings \n     them in and the amounts. This includes the expansion of a \n     drug supply database, all of which go to better inform \n     counter-drug operations.\n       An evaluation of Florida's seaports and the implementation \n     of standards for security against drug smuggling and money \n     laundering.\n       The addition of a third High Intensity Drug Trafficking \n     Area--a formal designation that creates a multi-agency anti-\n     drug task force--covering Northeast Florida.\n       A systematic counter-drug effort aimed at interdicting and \n     deterring drug trafficking on Florida's roads and highways.\n       Development of intelligence-driven multi-jurisdictional \n     counter-drug operations that combine the efforts of law \n     enforcement agencies at the federal, state and local levels.\n       Our efforts will continue. As history has taught us, the \n     struggle against drugs is one that never ends. The minute we \n     believe we have put the matter to rest and relax our guard, \n     drug use immediately begins to resurge. Conversely, if we \n     address the problem in a rational, balanced way, drug abuse \n     abates. The fact is that government can only do so much in \n     countering illegal drugs. Because substance abuse has such as \n     pervasive impact on the family and on society, addressing the \n     problem falls to the entire community: government, educators, \n     community and business leaders, clergy, coaches and, most \n     importantly, parents.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. \n        Roth):\n  S. 2966. A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprohibit retaliation and confidentiality policies relating to \ndisclosure of employee wages, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                   the wage awareness protection act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I introduce \nthe Wage Awareness Protection Act.\n  We have made great strides in the fight against workplace \ndiscrimination. The enactment of the Civil Rights Act more than 30 \nyears ago served to codify this Nation's commitment to the basic \nprinciples of equal opportunity and fairness in the workplace. At the \ntime, we enacted not one, but two laws, aimed at ensuring that women \nreceive equal pay for equal work: the Equal Pay Act (``EPA'') of 1963, \nand to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. More recently, Congress \nreaffirmed this commitment by passing the Civil Rights Act of 1991, \nwhich expanded the 1964 Civil Rights Act and gave victims of \nintentional discrimination the ability to recover compensatory and \npunitive damages.\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\n  Certainly a lot has changed since we first enacted these laws. It \nshould come as no surprise that more women are participating in the \nlabor force than ever before, with women now making up an estimated 46 \npercent of the workforce. Women are also spending more time in school \nand are now earning over half of all bachelor's and master's degrees. \nIn addition, women are breaking down longstanding barriers in certain \nindustries and occupations.\n  Despite these advances, the unfortunate reality is that pay \ndiscrimination has continued to persist in some workplaces. In a recent \nhearing before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \nwe heard testimony that a principal reason why gender-based wage \ndiscrimination has continued is that many female employees are simply \nunaware that they are being paid less than their male counterparts. \nThese unwitting victims of wage discrimination are often kept in the \ndark by employer policies that prohibit employees from sharing salary \ninformation. Employees are warned that they will be reprimanded or \nterminated if they discuss salary information with their co-workers.\n  I believe that a fundamental barrier to uncovering and resolving \ngender-based pay discrimination is fear of employer retaliation. \nEmployees who suspect wage discrimination should be able to share their \nsalary information with co-workers. I am not alone in my belief. \nAccording to a recent Business and Professional Women/USA survey, \nAmericans overwhelmingly support anti-retaliation legislation. And, 65 \npercent of those polled, said they believe legislation should protect \nthose who suspect wage discrimination from employer retaliation for \ndiscussing salary information with co-workers.\n  The Worker Awareness Protection Act will prohibit employers from \nhaving blanket wage confidentiality policies preventing employees from \nsharing their salary information. In addition, this new legislation \nwill bolster the Equal Pay Act's retaliation provisions including \nproviding workers with protection from employer retaliation for \nvoluntarily discussing their own salary information with coworkers. I \nam excited about this legislation. It is my hope that it will help \npoint the way to elimination of any pernicious discriminatory pay \npractices.\n  I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2966\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nfacilitate competition in the electric power industry; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n           the electric power industry tax modernization act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators, Gorton, \nKerrey and Jeffords in introducing the Electric Power Industry Tax \nModernization Act, legislation that will facilitate the opening up of \nthe nation's energy grid to electricity competition. This landmark \nlegislation demonstrates the good faith of the most important players \nin the industry--the investor owned utilities (IOUs) and the municipal \nutilities.\n  In the Energy Committee, which I currently Chair, we have held more \nthan 18 days of hearings and heard testimony from more than 160 \nwitnesses on electricity restructuring. Although those 160 witnesses \nhad many differing views, every witness agreed that the tax laws must \nbe rewritten to reflect the new reality of a competitive electricity \nmarket.\n  Already, 24 states have implemented laws deregulating their \nelectricity markets. And the other 36 states are all considering \nderegulation schemes. Faced with that reality, the federal tax laws \nmust be updated to ensure that tax laws which made sense when \nelectricity was a regulated monopoly are not allowed to interfere with \nopening up the nation's electrical infrastructure to competition.\n  Last October I held a hearing in the Finance Committee Subcommittee \non Long Term Growth to examine all of the tax issues that confront the \nindustry. At the end of the hearing I urged all parties to sit down at \nthe negotiating table and hammer out a consensus that will resolve the \ntax issues.\n  The bill we are introducing today reflects the compromise that has \nbeen reached between the IOUs and the municipal utilities.\n  One of the major problems that the current tax rules create is to \nundermine the efficiency of the entire electric system in a deregulated \nenvironment because these rules effectively preclude public power \nentities from participating in State open access restructuring plans, \nwithout jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds.\n  No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become \nretroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in \na state open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial \nmarkets and could undermine the financial stability of many \nmunicipalities.\n  The bill we are introducing overcomes this problem by allowing \nmunicipal systems to elect to terminate the issuance of new tax-exempt \nbonds for generation facilities in return for grandfathering existing \nbonds. In addition, the bill allows tax-exempt bonds to be issued to \nfinance some new transmission facilities.\n  I recognize that in making these two changes in the tax law, the \nmunicipal utilities have given up a substantial financing tool that has \nbeen at the heart of the controversy between the municipal utilities \nand the IOUs.\n  At the same time, the bill updates the tax code to reflect the fact \nthat the regulated monopoly model no longer exists. For example, the \nbill modifies the current rules regarding the treatment of nuclear \ndecommissioning costs to make certain that utilities will have the \nresources to meet those future costs and clarifies the tax treatment of \nthese funds if a nuclear facility is sold.\n  The bill also provides tax relief for utilities that spin off or sell \ntransmission facilities to independent participants in FERC approved \nregional transmission organizations.\n  Another section of the bill changes the tax rules regarding \ncontributions in aid of construction for electric transmission and \ndistribution facilities. This is an especially important provision; \nhowever when this bill is considered in the Finance Committee, I intend \nto modify this proposal so that it is expanded to all contributions in \naid of construction, not just for electric transmission and \ndistribution.\n  The IOUs and the Municipal utilities are to be commended for coming \nup\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\nwith this agreement. However, there is one other element of the tax \ncode that needs to be addressed if we are going to open the entire grid \nto competition. And that sector is the cooperative sector.\n  Currently, coops may not participate in wheeling power through their \nlines because of concern that they will violate the so-called 85-15 \ntest. I urge the coops to sit down with the other utilities and reach \nan accord so that when we consider this legislation, the coops' will be \nincluded in a tax bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today I am extremely pleased to co-sponsor \nthe Electric Power Industry Tax Modernization Act. This legislation, \nwhen enacted, will contribute to a more reliable and efficient electric \npower industry that will provide benefits for all Americans connected \nto the interstate power grid.\n  I have been working for three years to resolve the tax problems for \nconsumer-owned municipal utilities, those that are often referred to as \nPublic Power. Nearly half the citizens of my state are served by Public \nPower.\n  These problems are due to outdated tax statutes that were written in \na different era-an era where the emerging competition in the wholesale \nelectricity market was not envisioned. The negative effects of these \noutdated tax provisions have impacted not only consumers of Public \nPower, but also tens of millions of other customers. Public Power is \noften prevented from sharing the use of their transmission systems \nsolely due to these tax provisions. These outdated tax provisions are \nnegatively impacting the reliability of entire regions of our nation, \nadding stress to an already stressed system.\n  In addition to Public Power, other types of utilities are prevented \nfrom adapting to this new era of emerging competition by other \nconstraints in this outdated area of the tax law. All of these \nuncertainties have led to a condition where investment has slowed in \nthis critical area of the economy, just as we need more investment to \nassure sufficient power plants and transmission lines to feed a growing \neconomy that is increasingly dependent on reliable and affordable \nelectricity.\n  This compromise bill includes the essence of my legislation, S. 386, \nThe Bond Fairness and Protection Act that I introduced last year with \nSenator Kerrey from Nebraska, a bill that includes an additional 32 co-\nsponsors in the Senate. This legislative language will allow Public \nPower to move into the future with certainty, and protects the millions \nof American citizens who hold current investments in Public Power debt.\n  The bill also includes legislative language that resolves conflicts \nfor investor-owned utilities. These changes are also needed to solve \nproblems in other parts of the outdated tax code as it pertains to \nelectricity. The new provisions will also help contribute to a more \nreliable and orderly electricity system in our nation.\n  I look forward to gaining additional support for this bill among the \nother members of the Senate, and I look forward to the Finance \nCommittee's consideration of this legislation in September. As soon as \nthis legislation can be enacted, American electricity consumers will \nbegin to enjoy a more certain and reliable future regarding their \nelectricity needs.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I wish to join my colleagues, \nSenator Murkowski, Gorton, and Jeffords in introducing legislation that \nwill help ensure that customers receive reliable and affordable \nelectricity. The Electric Power Industry Tax Modernization Act is the \nculmination of months-long discussions between shareholder-owned \nutilities and publicly-owned utilities. Without the diligence and \npatience exhibited by these groups, it is doubtful that Congress could \nbe in the position to act on this issue. Additionally, I would like to \nrecognize the efforts of Senator Murkowski and Senator Gorton, whose \nefforts at getting these groups to sit down and discuss these issues \nwas invaluable to the final agreement.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will ensure that Nebraskans continue \nto benefit from the publicly-owned power they currently receive. \nNebraska has 154 not-for-profit community-based public power systems. \nIt is the only state which relies entirely on public power for \nelectricity. This system has served my state well as Nebraskans enjoy \nsome of the lowest electricity rates in the nation.\n  In closing, I would urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort \nto address the changes steaming from electrical restructuring.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2967\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to empower communities and individuals by \nconsolidating and reforming the programs of the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                    local housing opportunities act\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the ``Local Housing \nOpportunities Act'', legislation to empower communities and individuals \nby consolidating and reforming HUD programs. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the following section-by-section description of the bill be \nprinted in the Record and that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord following the description.\n  In 1994, there were 240 separate programs at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD). By 1997, the number of programs \nhad grown to 328. Many of these programs have never been authorized by \nCongress, and operate under questionable legal authority. While the \nnumber of HUD programs has grown, HUD's workforce has declined from \n12,000 employees in 1995 to 9,000 employees today. As a result, scarce \nresources are diverted away from core housing and enforcement programs, \ndramatically increasing the risks of mismanagement and fraud. HUD \nremains the only Cabinet level agency designated by the General \nAccounting Office (GAO) as ``High Risk''. In order to promote the \ninterests of taxpayers and improve the delivery of services to \nbeneficiaries, Congress should transfer more programs to\n\n[[Page S7868]]\n\nthe States and localities and enact legislation to consolidate, \nterminate, and streamline HUD programs.\n\n                     Section-by-Section Description\n\n       I. Prohibition of Unauthorized Programs at the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development--Prohibits HUD from carrying \n     out any program that is not explicitly authorized in statute \n     by the Congress. This provision takes effect one year after \n     the effective date to give the Congress sufficient time to \n     authorize those programs that it wishes to maintain. Within \n     60 days of the date of enactment the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development shall provide a report detailing every \n     HUD program along with the statutory authorization for that \n     program. This report shall be provided annually to the Senate \n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, the Senate \n     Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, the House \n     Committee on Banking and Financial Services, and the House \n     Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity.\n       II. Elimination of Certain HUD Programs--Terminates certain \n     programs as recommended by the HUD Secretary in the ``HUD \n     2020 Program Repeal and Streamlining Act''. The Department \n     has determined that these programs are unnecessary, outdated, \n     or inactive.\n       Community Investment Corporation Demonstration--never \n     funded, superseded by the Community Development Financial \n     Institutions program administered by the Department of the \n     Treasury.\n       New Towns Demonstration Program for Emergency Relief of Los \n     Angeles--not funded since FY 1993.\n       Solar Assistance Financing Entity--not funded in recent \n     years.\n       Urban Development Action Grants--discontinued program, not \n     funded in recent years.\n       Certain Special Purpose Grants--not funded since FY 1993 \n     and FY 1995.\n       Moderate Rehabilitation Assistance in Disasters--no \n     additional assistance for the Moderate Rehabilitation program \n     has been provided (other than for the homeless under the \n     McKinney Act) since FY 1989.\n       Rent Supplement Program--not funded for many years.\n       National Home Ownership Trust Demonstration--authority \n     expired at the end of FY 1994.\n       Repeal of HOPE I, II, and III--all HOPE funds have been \n     awarded, no additional funding has been requested since FY \n     1995, and no future funding is anticipated.\n       Energy Efficiency Demonstration Program, section 961 of \n     NAHA--never funded.\n       Technical Assistance and Training for IHAs--no funds have \n     been provided for this program since FY 1994.\n       Termination of the investor mortgages portion of the \n     Section 203(k) rehabilitation mortgage insurance program as \n     recommended by the HUD IG. Investor rehabilitation mortgages \n     constitute approximately 20% of the loans insured under this \n     program, and recent IG audits have found this portion of the \n     program to be particularly vulnerable to fraud and abuse by \n     investor-owners. The larger portion of the program for owner/\n     occupants is retained.\n       Certificate and Voucher Assistance for Rental \n     Rehabilitation Projects--rental rehabilitation program has \n     been repealed, section 289 of NAHA.\n       Single Family Loan Insurance for Home Improvement Loans in \n     Urban Renewal Areas--unnecessary.\n       Single Family and Multifamily Mortgage Insurance for \n     Miscellaneous Special Situations, section 223 (a)(1)-(6) and \n     (8)--obsolete.\n       Single Family Mortgage Insurance for so-called ``Modified'' \n     Graduated Payment Mortgages, section 245 (b)--insurance \n     authority terminated in 1987 but provision never repealed.\n       War Housing Insurance--authority for new insurance \n     terminated in 1954, but provision never repealed.\n       Insurance for Investments (Yield Insurance)--program never \n     implemented, but authority and provision never repealed.\n       National Defense Housing--authority for new insurance \n     terminated in 1954, but provision never repealed.\n       Rural Homeless Housing Assistance--not funded since FY \n     1994, all HUD homeless assistance will be part of the \n     McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund created under \n     this legislation.\n       Innovative Homeless Initiatives Demonstration--not funded \n     since FY 1995, all HUD homeless assistance will be part of \n     the McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund created \n     under this legislation.\n       During the remainder of 2000, the Senate Housing and \n     Transportation Subcommittee will hold hearings on this \n     discussion draft. At that time the Subcommittee will solicit \n     the recommendations of the Department, the IG, the GAO, and \n     other organizations for other HUD programs that can be \n     streamlined or eliminated. This legislation also provides for \n     the creation of a ``HUD Consolidation Task Force'' which will \n     report to the Congress with recommendations on how to reduce \n     the number of programs at HUD through consolidation, \n     termination, or transfer to other levels of government.\n       III. HUD Consolidation Task Force--Mandates the creation of \n     a task force that will focus exclusively on legislative and \n     regulatory options to reduce the number of HUD programs. The \n     task force will consist of three individuals: the Comptroller \n     General of the United States, the HUD Secretary, and the HUD \n     Inspector General. Within six months of the enactment of this \n     legislation, the task force will produce a report outlining \n     options to reduce the number of HUD programs through \n     consolidation, elimination, and transfer to other levels of \n     government. The report will be provided to the Senate and \n     House Housing Subcommittees as well as the Senate and House \n     Banking Committees.\n       I. Community Development Block Grant Authorization (CDBG) \n     and Prohibition of Set-Asides and Earmarks--Restores local \n     control over the CDBG program by prohibiting Congressional \n     set-asides and earmarks not specifically authorized in \n     statute. The original intent of CDBG was that program dollars \n     would be allocated directly to cities and states according to \n     formula. In FY 1999 over 10 percent of the funds were \n     earmarked for specific projects (the earmarks have increased \n     steadily in recent years). CDBG was last authorized in 1994, \n     this legislation would authorize the program through FY 2005, \n     with an initial authorization of $4,850,000,000 in FY 2001.\n       II. Community Notification of Opt-Outs--Requires that when \n     HUD receives notice of a Section 8 opt-out that it forward \n     that notice within 10 days to the top elected official for \n     the unit of local government where the property is located. \n     This supplements the requirement in Section 8 (c)(8)(A) of \n     the Housing Act of 1937 that HUD and tenants be notified one \n     year in advance if a Section 8 opt-out is anticipated.\n       III. Urban Homestead Requirement--Directs that HUD-held \n     properties that have not been disposed of within six months \n     following acquisition by HUD or a determination that they are \n     substandard or unoccupied, shall be made available upon \n     written request for sale or donation to local governments or \n     Community Development Corporations (CDCs).\n       IV. Permanent ``Moving To Work'' Authorization--Continues \n     the deregulation of Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) by \n     opening the ``Moving To Work'' program to all PHAs. This \n     program was authorized as a demonstration in the 1996 VA/HUD \n     Appropriation bill and granted up to 30 PHAs the option to \n     receive HUD funds as a block grant. The program provides \n     autonomy from HUD micro-management and the freedom to \n     innovate with reforms such as work requirements, time limits, \n     job training, and Home ownership assistance. The Secretary \n     shall approve an application under this program for all but \n     the lowest performing PHAs unless the Secretary makes a \n     written determination, within 60 days after receiving the \n     application, that the application fails to comply with the \n     statutory provisions authorizing the ``Moving to Work'' \n     program.\n       Consolidate HUD Homeless Assistance Funds into the \n     ``McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund''--Combines \n     HUD's McKinney programs (Supportive Housing Program, Shelter \n     Plus Care, Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation for Single Room \n     Occupancy Dwellings, Safe Havens, Rural Homeless Housing \n     Assistance, and the Emergency Shelter Grants), into a single \n     McKinney Homeless Assistance Performance Fund ( and \n     authorizes funding through FY 2003, at an initial level of \n     $1,050,000,000 in FY 2001). Distributes funds according to \n     the CDBG block grant formula with 70 percent to units of \n     local government and 30 percent to states.\n       Eligible units of local government include metropolitan \n     cities, urban counties, and consortia. The formula is to be \n     reviewed after one year with a statutory requirement that HUD \n     provide alternative formulas for the Congress to consider. \n     State funds are available for use in areas throughout the \n     entire state. Codifies and requires a Continuum of Care \n     system by grant recipients. The Continuum of Care submission \n     is linked with the Consolidated Plan. Every three dollars of \n     federal block grant money is to be matched with one dollar of \n     state or local money. Funds qualifying for the match are the \n     same as those currently permitted under the Emergency Shelter \n     Grants program, and would include salaries paid to staff, \n     volunteer labor, and the value of a lease on a building. \n     There is a five year transition period--state and local \n     governments would receive no less than 90 percent of prior \n     award amounts (average for FY 96-99) in the first year after \n     enactment, 85 percent in the second year after enactment, 80 \n     percent in the third and fourth year after enactment, and 75 \n     percent in the fifth year after enactment. Eligible projects \n     and activities include emergency assistance, safe haven \n     housing, transitional housing, permanent housing, supportive \n     services for persons with disabilities, single room occupancy \n     housing, prevention, outreach and assessment, acquisition and \n     rehabilitation of property, new construction, operating \n     costs, leasing, tenant assistance, supportive services, \n     administrative (generally limited to 10 percent of funds), \n     capacity building, targeting to subpopulations of persons \n     with disabilities. Performance measures and benchmarks are \n     included, along with periodic performance reports, reviews, \n     and audits.\n       I. Mutual and Self-Help Housing Technical Assistance and \n     Training Grants Program--Reauthorizes technical assistance \n     grants to facilitate the construction of self-help housing in \n     rural areas. Program beneficiaries are required to contribute \n     a significant amount of sweat equity to the construction of \n     the homes that they will own. Authorizes funding of $40 \n     million for FY 2001 and 2002, and $45 million for FY 2003-\n     2005.\n       II. Improve the Rural Housing Repair Loan Program for the \n     Elderly--Increases the amount for which a promissory note is \n     considered a sufficient security for housing repairs from \n     $2,500 to $7,500.\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n       III. Enhance Efficiency of Rural Housing Preservation \n     Grants--Eliminates the existing statutory requirement that \n     prohibits a State from obligating more than 50 percent of its \n     Housing Preservation Grants allocation to any one grantee. \n     Many states receive only a small amount from this formula \n     program. In many cases the money can only be most effectively \n     invested in one project.\n       IV. Project Accounting Records and Practices--Requires \n     section 515 rural housing borrowers to maintain records in \n     accordance with GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting \n     Principles).\n       V. Operating Assistance for Migrant Farmworker Projects \n     Authority--Permits rural housing operating assistance \n     payments in migrant and seasonal farm labor housing \n     complexes.\n       I. Authorization of Appropriations for Rental Vouchers for \n     Relocation of Witnesses and Victims of Crime--Authorizes \n     specific funding for vouchers for victims and witnesses of \n     crime. These vouchers were authorized in the Quality Housing \n     and Work Responsibility Act of 1998 (QHWRA). No funds have \n     yet been appropriated and HUD has yet to write regulations. \n     The current authorization directs the Secretary to make \n     available such sums as may be necessary for the relocation of \n     families residing in public housing who are victims of a \n     crime of violence reported to an appropriate law enforcement \n     authority, and requires that PHAs notify tenants of the \n     availability of such funds. This legislation would authorize \n     a funding level in each of FY 2001-2005 of $25,000,000.\n       II. Revise the HUD Lease Addendum--Prohibits the HUD lease \n     addendum from overriding local law. Participating housing \n     providers and residents sign a three-party lease along with \n     the public housing authority. The law requires the attachment \n     of a HUD Lease Addendum (HUD Form 52647.3) which overrides \n     some local market provisions and practices, holding the \n     voucher resident to a non-standard lease contract. The use of \n     federally promulgated forms that counter local practice \n     incurs additional training, legal and management costs. The \n     voucher lease addendum shall be nullified to the extent that \n     it conflicts with State or local law.\n       III. Reduce the Burden of Housing Quality Standard \n     Inspections--Provides the option that Housing Quality \n     Standard inspections be conducted on a property basis rather \n     than a unit basis. Currently each individual unit that is \n     rented under the program must be inspected for compliance \n     with HUD's Housing Quality Standards. Individual inspections \n     are a time-consuming administrative headache for PHAs and \n     Section 8 landlords, result in slow unit turnover, and \n     significant lost revenue. This legislation provides the \n     Section 8 landlord with the option to have annual inspections \n     conducted on a property or building basis, rather than a unit \n     basis.\n       IV. HUD Report to the Congress on Ways to Improve the \n     Voucher Program--Requires that the HUD Secretary solicit \n     comments and recommendations for improvement in the voucher \n     program through notice in the Federal Register. Six months \n     after enactment, the Secretary shall submit to the House and \n     Senate Housing Subcommittees and the House and Senate Banking \n     Committees a summary of the recommendations received by the \n     Secretary regarding suggestions for improvement in the \n     voucher program.\n       I. Reauthorize the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity \n     Program (SHOP)--Reauthorizes the SHOP program which provides \n     funding for land and infrastructure purchases to facilitate \n     self-help housing. Utilized by Habitat for Humanity and the \n     Housing Assistance Council. Reauthorize through FY 2005, \n     beginning with $25 million in FY 2001. Adds new language \n     allowing an additional year to use funds for local groups \n     building five or more homes (increase from two years to three \n     years), and also making it possible for local and national \n     non-profit organizations using SHOP funds to advance their \n     own money to purchase property, pending the environmental \n     review approvals, to be repaid from federal funds after the \n     environmental reviews have been approved.\n       II. Capacity Building for Community Development and \n     Affordable Housing Program--Reauthorizes and increases grants \n     to non-profits to expand affordable housing capacity. \n     Presently authorized for The Enterprise Foundation, Local \n     Initiatives Support Corporation, Habitat for Humanity, \n     Youthbuild USA, and the National Community Development \n     Initiative. Expands access to this program to include the \n     ``National Association of Housing Partnerships'' and \n     authorizes a funding level of $40 million for each of FY \n     2001-2003. Amounts must be matched three to one from other \n     sources.\n       III. Work Requirement for Public Housing Residents: \n     Coordinate Federal Housing Assistance with State Welfare \n     Reform Work Programs--Requires that able-bodied and non-\n     elderly public housing residents be in compliance with the \n     work requirements of welfare reform in their state. Those \n     unable to comply would be provided the opportunity to engage \n     in community service or participate in an economic self-\n     sufficiency program. There is substantial overlap in families \n     receiving welfare and those benefitting from assisted \n     housing. Among families with children, it is estimated that \n     72 percent of those who live in public housing receive some \n     type of welfare. These families are currently subject to \n     Welfare Reform work requirements and this provision simply \n     applies the requirement to the remaining able-bodied \n     recipients of federal housing assistance. Public housing was \n     originally conceived as temporary assistance for working low-\n     income families to help them during times of financial \n     distress. Recent housing legislation has recognized this fact \n     by placing increasing emphasis on self-sufficiency. These \n     efforts should be coordinated with the self sufficiency \n     efforts of Welfare Reform. PHAs shall monitor compliance with \n     the state work requirement. There shall be an exception for \n     the elderly and disabled, and as with Welfare Reform, there \n     will be a broad definition of work including; employment, \n     community service, vocational and job training, work \n     associated with self help housing construction, refurbishing \n     publicly assisted housing, the provision of certain child \n     care services, and participation in education programs or \n     economic self-sufficiency programs. This work requirement \n     will replace the 8 hour per month ``Community Service'' \n     Requirement that exists in current law for residents of \n     public housing. Public Housing Authorities shall not be \n     prohibited by this legislation from implementing more \n     stringent work requirements and States electing the housing \n     assistance block grant would be excluded from this \n     requirement and be free to design their own self-sufficiency \n     requirements.\n       IV. Flexible Use of CDBG Funds to Maintain Properties--\n     Amends Section 105(a)(23) of the Housing and Community \n     Development Act, which currently authorizes use of CDBG \n     funding for activities necessary to make essential repairs \n     and payment of operating expenses needed to maintain the \n     habitability of housing units acquired through tax \n     foreclosure proceedings in order to prevent abandonment and \n     deterioration of such housing in primarily low- and moderate-\n     income neighborhoods. This language is amended to permit the \n     use of CDBG funds for property upkeep in instances in which a \n     court has wrested effective control of a distressed \n     residential property from the owner and appointed a \n     responsible third party (often a non-profit organization or \n     other owner/manager of properties in the area) to operate the \n     property on an interim basis as administrator, although legal \n     title remains with the original owner.\n       IV. Allows Vouchers in Grandfamily Housing Assisted with \n     HOME Dollars--Permits flexible use of Section 8 vouchers in \n     Grandfamily Housing assisted with HOME dollars. Current law \n     restricts the level of Section 8 assistance that may be used \n     in projects assisted with HOME funds. This legislation \n     creates an exception to the general rule for projects \n     designed to benefit Grandfamilies, by permitting the use of \n     Section 8 vouchers at the Fair Market Rent (FMR) level by \n     Grandparents choosing to live in low income housing projects \n     assisted with HOME dollars. This change is designed to assist \n     low-income, elderly residents and their grandchildren for \n     whom they provide full-time care and custody.\n       V. Simplified FHA Downpayment Calculation.--Makes permanent \n     the temporary simplified FHA downpayment calculation provided \n     in section 203(b) of the National Housing Act. The current \n     downpayment calculation on FHA loans is needlessly complex. \n     Recent appropriations bills have included a simplified pilot \n     program that replaces the current multi-part formula with a \n     single calculation based solely on the appraised value of the \n     property. The simplified formula yields substantially the \n     same downpayment result as the multi-part formula.\n       VI. Authorize the Use of Section 8 Funds for Downpayment \n     Assistance--Permits tenants to receive up to one year's worth \n     of Section 8 assistance in a lump sum to be used toward the \n     down payment on a home. This compliments innovative programs \n     that allow the use of Section 8 assistance for mortgage \n     payments.\n       VII. Reauthorize the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation \n     through 2003--Reauthorizes the Neighborhood Reinvestment \n     Corporation, a congressionally chartered, public non-profit \n     corporation established in 1978 to revitalize declining \n     lower-income communities and provide affordable housing. \n     Funding is authorized at $90 million in FY 2001, and $95 \n     million in each of FY 2002 and 2003.\n       Provides States the option to receive certain federal \n     assisted housing funds (tenant assistance programs) in the \n     form of a block grant. Modeled on Welfare Reform, this would \n     give States the freedom to innovate absent HUD micro-\n     management. States accepted into the program would sign a \n     five year performance agreement with the federal \n     government that details how the State intends to combine \n     and use housing assistance funds from programs included in \n     the performance agreement to advance low income housing \n     priorities, improve the quality of low income housing, \n     reduce homelessness, and encourage economic opportunity \n     and self-sufficiency. States electing the block grant \n     would determine how funds are distributed to state \n     agencies, Public Housing Authorities, project owners, and \n     tenants. During the first year of the performance \n     agreement States would receive the highest of the prior \n     three years funding for each program included in the \n     performance agreement. There would then be an annual \n     inflation adjustment in each future year until Congress \n     (following consultation with HUD) enacts a formula that \n     reflects the relative low-income/affordable housing needs \n     of each State. A performance agreement submitted to the \n     Secretary would have to be approved by the Secretary \n     unless the Secretary makes a written determination, within \n     60 days after\n\n[[Page S7870]]\n\n     receiving the performance agreement, that the performance \n     agreement fails to comply with provisions of the Act. \n     Eligible programs for inclusion in the block grant shall \n     include: the voucher program for rental assistance under \n     section 8(o) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; the \n     programs for project-based assistance under section 8 of \n     the United States Housing Act of 1937; the program for \n     housing for the elderly under section 202 of the Housing \n     Act of 1959; the program for housing for persons with \n     disabilities under section 811 of the Cranston-Gonzales \n     National Affordable Housing Act. The distribution of block \n     granted funds within the State from programs included in \n     the performance agreement shall be determined by the \n     Legislature and the Governor of the State. In a State in \n     which the constitution or state law designates another \n     individual, entity, or agency to be responsible for \n     housing, such other individual, entity, or agency shall \n     work in consultation with the Governor and Legislature to \n     determine the local distribution of funds. Existing \n     contracts involving federal housing dollars shall be \n     honored by the States until their expiration. States shall \n     at such point handle the renewal of all contracts. A State \n     may not use more than 3 percent of the total amount of \n     funds allocated to such State under the programs included \n     in the performance agreement for administrative purposes. \n     Performance criteria shall include at a minimum a measure \n     of; the improvement in housing conditions, the number of \n     units that pass housing quality inspections, the number of \n     residents that find employment and move to self-\n     sufficiency, the level of crime against residents, the \n     level of homelessness, the level of poverty, the cost of \n     assisted housing units provided, the level of assistance \n     provided to people with disabilities and to the elderly, \n     success in maintaining the stock of affordable housing, \n     and increasing homeownership. If at the end of the 5-year \n     term of the performance agreement a State has failed to \n     meet at least 80 percent of the performance goals \n     submitted in the performance agreement, the Secretary \n     shall terminate the performance agreement and the State or \n     community shall be required to comply with the program \n     requirement, in effect at the time of termination, of each \n     program included in the performance agreement. To reward \n     States that make significant progress in meeting \n     performance goals, the HUD Secretary shall annually set \n     aside sufficient funds to grant a reward of up to 5 \n     percent of the funds allocated to participating States.\n\n            Sense of the Congress Supporting Tax Incentives\n\n\n  Sense of the Congress That the Low Income Housing Tax Credit State \n    Ceilings and the Private Activity Bond Caps Should Be Increased\n\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Low Income Housing \n     Tax Credit and Private Activity Bonds have been valuable \n     resources in the effort to increase affordable housing.\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the Low Income Housing \n     Tax Credit and Private Activity Bonds effectively utilize the \n     ability of the states to deliver resources to the areas of \n     greatest need within their jurisdictions.\n       It is the sense of the Congress that the value of the Low \n     Income Housing Tax Credit and the Private Activity Bonds have \n     been eroded by inflation.\n       Therefore, be it resolved, That the Low Income Housing Tax \n     Credit State Ceilings should be increased by forty percent in \n     the year 2000, and that the level of the state ceilings \n     should be adjusted annually to account for increases in the \n     cost-of-living, and\n       That the Private Activity Bond Caps should be increased by \n     fifty percent in the year 2000, and that the value of the \n     caps should be adjusted annually to account for increases in \n     the cost-of-living.\n       I. Tighten Language on Lobbying Restrictions on HUD \n     employees--Prohibits employees at HUD from lobbying, or \n     attempting to influence legislation before the Congress. This \n     language is based on current restrictions on Department of \n     Interior employees. No federally appropriated funds may be \n     used for any activity that in any way tends to promote public \n     support or opposition to legislation, a nomination, or a \n     treaty. The President, the Vice President and Senate \n     confirmed agency officials are exempt from these provisions. \n     However, these individuals may not delegate their authority \n     to any other employees of the Department. Provides civil \n     money penalties against non-exempt employees who \n     independently violate the statute, and against exempt \n     employees who have delegated their lobbying authority.\n       II. The Department of Housing and Urban Development shall \n     promulgate regulations under the provisions of this Act \n     within 6 months of the enactment of this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 2968\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Local \n     Housing Opportunities Act''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1.

A bill to provide for summer academic enrichment programs, \nand for the purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n\n\n            the student education enrichment development act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, approximately 3.4 million students entered \nkindergarten in U.S. public schools last\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\nfall, and experts predict wildly different futures for them. Many \nchildren do well throughout elementary school, only to slip and fall \nbetween the cracks in middle school. This so-called ``achievement gap'' \nopens wide in middle school and grows throughout high school if nothing \nis done to stop it.\n  Raising test scores in K-12 education has brought the achievement-gap \nissue to the forefront of the national education debate and created a \nnew opportunity to support those states that are making a real effort \nto improve student achievement. But trying to close the gap by simply \nbumping up test standards only pushes kids out of school rather than \nacross the gap.\n  Few have really looked at the most logical place to begin to close \nthe gap: summer school. Students take their achievement tests in April \nbut have to return to school in the Fall. Summer school is one place to \nbegin helping students close the gap, yet the Federal government does \nnothing to create and support successful summer academic programs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Student Education \nEnrichment Development Act, or SEED Act, will leverage summer academic \nprograms to boost student performance. SEED will support all struggling \nstudents by providing the first federal funds to backstop state and \nlocal efforts to develop, plan, implement, and operate high quality \nsummer academic enrichment programs.\n  The disparity in school performance tied to race and ethnicity, known \nas the achievement gap, shows up in grades, test scores, course \nselection, and college completion. To a large extent, these factors \npredict a student's success in school, whether a student will go to \ncollege, and how much money the student will earn when he or she enters \nthe working world. It happens in cities and in suburbs and in rural \nschool districts. The gaps are so pronounced that in 1996, several \nnational tests found African-American and Hispanic 12th graders scoring \nat roughly the same levels in reading and math as white 8th graders. By \n2019, when they are 24 years old, current trends indicate that the \nwhite children who are now nearing the end of their first year in \nschool will be twice as likely as their African-American classmates, \nand three times as likely as Hispanics, to have a college degree.\n  In Oregon last year, only 52 percent of the tenth graders met the \nstate's standard for reading, while only 36 percent met the standard \nfor math. But students in Oregon are actually doing better than the \nnational average. More than two-thirds of American high-school seniors \ngraduated last year without being able to read at a proficient level. \nResults like these are the reason we need SEED.\n  This week's Time Magazine reports that at least 25 percent of our \nU.S. school districts are mandating summer school for struggling \nstudents--twice that number in poor urban areas. While these programs \nare helping some students, the results should be better. Only 40 \npercent of New York students who failed state exams and completed \nsummer school passed on the state exam on their second attempt. In the \nPacific Northwest, Seattle canceled its summer program after students \nmade only meager academic gains. I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle from Time magazine be included in the record at the conclusion \nof my statement.\n  Schools should strive to meet higher standards, and we should have \nhigh expectations for every child. But our kids should not be punished \nbecause our education system has failed them. It's time to make sure \nevery child learns and succeeds. According to a recent study, more than \nhalf of our teachers promoted unprepared students because the current \nsystem does not provide adequate options.\n  High-quality summer academic programs would give struggling students \na chance to succeed in a system that has failed them and help reverse \nthe trend of poor student performance by preparing students to succeed \nwhere they have previously failed. Over the past years, we've heard a \nlot of rhetoric about education, but empty promises won't help our kids \nlearn. Our children deserve more.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Landrieu, Breaux and Bayh in \nintroducing the bill today, and ask unanimous consent that my statement \nand a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Student Education Enrichment \n     Demonstration Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) States are establishing new and higher academic \n     standards for students in kindergarten through grade 12;\n       (2) no Federal funding streams are specifically designed to \n     help States and school districts with the costs of providing \n     students who are struggling academically, with the extended \n     learning time and accelerated curricula that the students \n     need to meet high academic standards;\n       (3) forty-eight States now require State accountability \n     tests to determine student grade-level performance and \n     progress;\n       (4) nineteen States currently rate the performance of all \n     schools or identify low-performing schools through State \n     accountability tests;\n       (5) sixteen States now have the power to close, take over, \n     or overhaul chronically failing schools on the basis of those \n     tests;\n       (6) fourteen States provide high-performing schools with \n     monetary rewards on the basis of those tests;\n       (7) nineteen States currently require students to pass \n     State accountability tests to graduate from high school;\n       (8) six States currently link student promotion to results \n     on State accountability tests;\n       (9) excessive percentages of students are not meeting their \n     State standards and are failing to perform at high levels on \n     State accountability tests; and\n       (10) while the Chicago Public School District implemented \n     the Summer Bridge Program to help remediate their students in \n     1997, no State has yet created and implemented a similar \n     program to complement the education accountability programs \n     of the State.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to provide Federal support \n     through a new demonstration program to States and local \n     educational agencies, to enable the States and agencies to \n     develop models for high quality summer academic enrichment \n     programs that are specifically designed to help public school \n     students who are not meeting State-determined performance \n     standards.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to phase out the use of \nmethyl tertiary butyl ether in fuels or fuel additives, to promote the \nuse of renewable fuels, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                 clean and renewable fuels act of 2000\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. I am introducing today legislation \ndesigned to address the extensive problems that have been caused by the \ngasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) and to make \nappropriate revisions to the reformulated gasoline (RFG) program in the \nClean Air Act.\n  It has become absolutely clear that MTBE has to go. Even in Iowa, \nwhere we are not required to have oxygenated fuels or RFG, a recent \nsurvey found a surprising level of water contamination with MTBE. So my \nlegislation requires a phased reduction in the use of MTBE in motor \nfuel and then a prohibition on MTBE in fuel of fuel additives beginning \nthree years after enactment. Retail pumps dispensing gasoline with MTBE \nwould be labeled so that consumers know what they are buying. And in \norder to facilitate an orderly phase-out of MTBE, EPA may establish a \ncredit trading system for the dispensing and sale of MTBE.\n  My legislation recognizes the benefits that have been provided by the \noxygen content requirement in the reformulated gasoline program. Oxygen \nadded to gasoline reduces emissions of carbon monoxide, toxic compounds \nand fine particulate matter. So my legislation continues the oxygen \ncontent requirement, but it does allow for certain actions that would \nalleviate concerns about whether alternative oxygen additives will be \navailable after MTBE is removed from gasoline. The bill allows for \naveraging of the oxygen content upon a proper showing and it also would \nallow for a temporary reduction or waiver of the minimum oxygen content \nrequirement in very limited circumstances.\n  The legislation also ensures that all health benefits of the \nreformulated gasoline program are maintained and improved. The bill \nincludes very strong provisions to ensure that there is no backsliding \nin air quality and health benefits from cleaner burning reformulated \ngasoline. The petroleum companies would also be prohibited from taking \nthe pollutants from gasoline in some areas and putting them back into \ngasoline in other areas of the country that are not subject to the more \nstringent air quality standards. Those are referred to as the anti-\ndumping protections. My bill places tighter restrictions on highly \npolluting aromatic and olefin content of reformulated gasoline.\n  My legislation also recognizes the important role of renewable fuels \nin improving our environment, building energy security for our nation, \nand increasing farm income, economic growth and job creation, \nespecially in rural areas. The legislation creates a renewable content \nrequirement for gasoline and for diesel fuel.\n  Overall, this legislation will get MTBE out of gasoline, maintain and \nimprove the air quality and health benefits of the reformulated \ngasoline program and the Clean Air Act, and put our nation on a solid \npath toward greater use of renewable fuels.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary of my \nlegislation be printed in the Record. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Section-by-Section Summary--Clean and Renewable Fuels Act of 2000\n\n     Section 1. Short title\n       The bill may be cited as the ``Clean and Renewable Fuels \n     Act of 2000''\n     Section 2. Use and cleanup of methyl tertiary butyl ether\n       Prohibition Except in Specified Nonattainment Areas: \n     Section 211(c) of the Clean Air Act is amended to provide \n     that beginning January 1, 2001, a person shall not sell or \n     dispense to ultimate consumers any fuel or fuel additive \n     containing MTBE in any area that is not a specified \n     nonattainment area in which reformulated gasoline is required \n     to be used and in which MTBE was used to meet the oxygen \n     content requirement prior to January 1, 2000.\n       Interim Period for Use of MTBE: The Administrator shall \n     issue regulations requiring, during the one-year period \n     beginning one year after enactment, a one-third reduction in \n     the quantity of MTBE that may be sold or dispensed for use in \n     a fuel or fuel additive, and during the one-year period \n     beginning two years after enactment, a two-thirds reduction \n     in the quantity of MTBE that may be sold or dispensed for use \n     in a fuel or fuel additive. In no area may the quantity of \n     MTBE sold or dispensed for use as a fuel or fuel additive \n     increase.\n       Basis for Reductions; Equitable Treatment: The basis for \n     reductions shall be the quantity of MTBE sold or dispensed \n     for use as a fuel or fuel additive in the United States \n     during the one-year period ending on the date of enactment. \n     The regulations requiring such reductions shall to the \n     maximum extent practicable provide for equitable treatment on \n     a geographical basis and among manufacturers, refiners, \n     distributors and retailers.\n       Trading of Authorizations to Sell or Dispense MTBE: To \n     facilitate the most orderly and efficient reduction in the \n     use of MTBE, the regulations may allow the sale and purchase \n     of authorizations to sell or dispense MTBE for use in a fuel \n     or fuel additive.\n       Labeling: The Administrator shall issue regulations \n     requiring any person selling or dispensing gasoline that \n     contains MTBE at retail prominently to label the gasoline \n     dispensing system with a notice stating that the gasoline \n     contains MTBE and providing such information concerning the \n     human health and environmental risks of MTBE as the \n     Administrator determines appropriate.\n       Prohibition on Use of MTBE or Other Ethers: Effective three \n     years after enactment, a person shall not manufacture, \n     introduce into commerce, offer for sale, sell, or dispense a \n     fuel or fuel additive containing MTBE or any other ether \n     compound. The Administrator may waive the prohibition on an \n     ether compound other than MTBE upon a determination that it \n     does not pose a significant risk to human health or the \n     environment. The Administrator may require a more rapid \n     reduction (including immediate termination) of the quantity \n     of MTBE sold or dispensed in an area upon a determination of \n     MTBE contamination or a substantial risk or contamination.\n       State Authority to Regulate MTBE: A State may impose such \n     restrictions, including a prohibition, on the manufacture, \n     sale or use of MTBE in a fuel or fuel additive as the State \n     determines appropriate to protect human health and the \n     environment.\n       Remedial Action Regarding MTBE Contamination: MTBE \n     contamination would be prioritized in state source water \n     assessment programs. EPA shall issue guidelines for MTBE \n     cleanup and may enter into cooperative agreements for, and \n     provide technical assistance to support, voluntary pilot \n     programs for the cleanup of MTBE and the protection of \n     private wells from MTBE contamination.\n     Section 3. Reformulated gasoline--in general; oxygen content\n       Opt-in Areas; General Provisions: Regulations issued for \n     the reformulated gasoline program shall apply to specified \n     nonattainment areas and opt-in areas. The regulations shall \n     require the greatest possible reduction in emissions of ozone \n     forming volatile organic and other compounds and emissions of \n     toxic air pollutants and precursors of toxic air pollutants.\n       Waiver of Per-Gallon Oxygen Content Requirement: The \n     Administrator shall issue regulations establishing a \n     procedure providing for the submission of applications for a \n     waiver of any per-gallon oxygen content requirement otherwise \n     established and the averaging of oxygen content over an \n     appropriate period of time, not exceeding a year. After \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary \n     of Agriculture, the Administrator shall grant a petition for \n     oxygen averaging where necessary to avoid a shortage or \n     disruption in supply of reformulated gasoline, to avoid \n     excessive prices for reformulated gasoline, or to facilitate \n     attainment by the area of a national ambient air quality \n     standard. The Administrator shall ensure that the human \n     health and environmental benefits of the reformulated \n     gasoline program are fully maintained during the period of \n     any waiver.\n       Temporary Reduction of Oxygen Content Requirement: Upon \n     application of a state, if the Secretary of Energy with the \n     concurrence of the Secretary of Agriculture finds that there \n     is an insufficient supply of oxygenates in an area the \n     Administrator\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\n     may temporarily reduce or waive the oxygen content \n     requirement for the area to the extent necessary to ensure an \n     adequate supply of reformulated gasoline. A temporary waiver \n     would be effective for 90 days, or a shorter period if a \n     sufficient supply of oxygenates exists, and may be extended \n     for an additional 90-day period. The regulations shall ensure \n     that the human health and environmental benefits of the \n     reformulated gasoline program are fully maintained during the \n     period of any temporary waiver of the oxygen content \n     requirement.\n     Section 4. Limitations on aromatics and olefins in \n         reformulated gasoline\n       Aromatic Content: The aromatic hydrocarbon content of \n     reformulated gasoline shall not exceed 22 percent by volume; \n     the average aromatic hydrocarbon content shall not exceed the \n     average aromatic hydrocarbon content of reformulated gasoline \n     sold in either calendar year 1999 or calendar year 2000; and \n     no gallon of reformulated gasoline shall have an aromatic \n     hydrocarbon content in excess of 30 percent.\n       Olefin Content: The olefin content of reformulated gasoline \n     shall not exceed 8 percent by volume; the average olefin \n     content shall not exceed the average olefin content of \n     reformulated gasoline sold in either calendar year 1999 or \n     calendar year 2000; and no gallon of reformulated gasoline \n     shall have an olefin content in excess of 10 percent.\n     Section 5. Reformulated gasoline performance standards\n       Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds: Required \n     reductions in VOC emissions shall be on a mass basis and, to \n     the maximum extent practicable using available science, on \n     the basis of ozone forming potential of VOCs and taking into \n     account the effect on ozone formation of reducing carbon \n     monoxide emissions.\n       Emissions of Toxic Air Pollutants and Precursors: The \n     required reductions shall apply to toxic air pollutants or \n     precursors of toxic air pollutants. The required emissions \n     reductions shall be on a mass basis and, to the maximum \n     extent practicable using available science, on the basis of \n     relative toxicity or carcinogenic potency, whichever is more \n     protective of human health and the environment.\n     Section 6. Anti-backsliding\n       Ozone Forming Potential: The Administrator shall revise \n     performance standards to ensure that the ozone forming \n     potential, taking into account all ozone precursors, of the \n     aggregate emissions during the high ozone season from \n     baseline vehicles using reformulated gasoline does not exceed \n     the ozone forming potential of emissions when using \n     reformulated gasoline that complies with the regulations in \n     effect on January 1, 2000.\n       Specified Pollutants: The Administrator shall revise \n     performance standards to ensure that the aggregate emissions \n     of specified pollutants or their precursors when using \n     reformulated gasoline do not exceed the aggregate emissions \n     of such pollutants or precursors from baseline vehicles when \n     using reformulated gasoline that complies with the \n     regulations in effect on January 1, 2000. The specified air \n     pollutants are toxic air pollutants, categorized by degree of \n     toxicity and carcinogenic potency; particulate matter and \n     fine particulate matter; pollutants regulated under section \n     108; and such other pollutants as the Administrator \n     determines should be controlled to prevent deterioration of \n     air quality and to achieve attainment of a national ambient \n     air quality standard in one or more areas.\n       Adjustments for Carbon Monoxide Emissions: In carrying out \n     the ozone anti-backsliding requirement, the Administrator \n     shall adjust the performance standard to take into account \n     carbon monoxide emissions that are greater or less than the \n     carbon monoxide emissions achieved by reformulated gasoline \n     containing 2 percent oxygen by weight and meeting other \n     performance standards. An adjustment to the VOC emission \n     reduction requirements under the provisions of this section \n     shall be credited toward the requirement for VOC emissions \n     reductions under section 182 of the Clean Air Act.\n       Updating of Baseline Vehicles: Not later than 3 years after \n     enactment, the Administrator shall revise the performance \n     standards to redefine the term ``baseline vehicles'' as \n     used in the anti-backsliding provisions to mean vehicles \n     representative of vehicles (including off-road vehicles) \n     in use as of January 1, 2000.\n     Section 7. Certification of fuels\n       Combined Reductions of Ozone Forming VOCs and Carbon \n     Monoxide: In certifying a fuel formulation or slate of fuel \n     formulations as equivalent to reformulated gasoline, the \n     Administrator shall determine whether the combined reductions \n     in emissions of VOCs and carbon monoxide result in a \n     reduction in ozone concentration equivalent to or greater \n     than the reduction achieved by a reformulated gasoline \n     meeting the statutory formula and performance requirements. A \n     certified fuel formulation or slate of fuel formulations \n     shall receive the same VOC reduction credit under section 182 \n     as a reformulated gasoline meeting the statutory formula and \n     performance requirements.\n       Carbon Monoxide Credit: In determining combined reductions \n     in emissions of VOCs and carbon monoxide by a fuel \n     formulation or slate of fuel formulations the Administrator \n     shall consider the change in carbon monoxide emissions from \n     baseline vehicles attributable to an oxygen content that \n     exceeds any minimum oxygen content for reformulated gasoline \n     applicable to the area and may consider the change in carbon \n     monoxide emissions attributable to such oxygen content from \n     vehicles other than baseline vehicles.\n       Toxic Air Pollutants and Precursors: To be certified as \n     equivalent to reformulated gasoline, the fuel or slate of \n     fuels must achieve equivalent or greater reduction in \n     emissions of toxic air pollutants or precursors of toxic air \n     pollutants than are achieved by a reformulated gasoline \n     meeting the statutory formula and performance requirements.\n       Certification Subject to Anti-Backsliding Rules: The \n     provisions on certification would clearly specify that a \n     requirement for certification of a fuel formulation or slate \n     of fuel formulations is compliance with the anti-backsliding \n     provisions.\n     Section 8. Additional opt-in areas\n       Upon application of the Governor of a State, the \n     Administrator shall apply the requirements relating to \n     reformulated gasoline in any area of the State that is not a \n     covered area or a classified area. The application shall be \n     published in the Federal Register as soon as practicable \n     after it is received.\n     Section 9. Anti-dumping protections\n       Updating Baseline Year; Additional Pollutants Covered: The \n     Administrator shall issue regulations to ensure that gasoline \n     sold or introduced into commerce by a refiner, blender or \n     importer (other than gasoline covered by the reformulated \n     gasoline rules) does not result in average per-gallon \n     emissions of VOCs, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide, toxic \n     air pollutants, particulate matter, fine particulate matter, \n     or any precursor of such pollutants, in excess of \n     the emissions of each pollutants attributable to gasoline \n     sold or introduced into commerce by the refiner, blender \n     or importer in calendar year 1999 or calendar year 2000, \n     in whichever year the lower emissions occurred. In the \n     absence of adequate and reliable data for a refiner, \n     blender or importer for calendar year 1999 or calendar \n     year 2000, the Administrator shall substitute baseline \n     gasoline for 1999 or 2000 gasoline.\n       Average Per-Gallon Emissions: In applying the anti-dumping \n     provisions, average per-gallon emissions shall be measured on \n     the basis of mass, and to the maximum extent practicable \n     using available science, on the basis of ozone-forming \n     potential, degree of toxicity and carcinogenic potency.\n       Aromatic Hydrocarbon and Olefin Content: Anti-dumping \n     requirements also apply to ensure against increases in \n     aromatic hydrocarbon or olefin content of gasoline relative \n     to the levels in calendar year 1999 or calendar year 2000, in \n     whichever year the content was lower.\n       Anti-Dumping Compliance: The Administrator shall issue \n     regulations providing that an increase in oxides of nitrogen \n     or volatile organic compounds caused by adding oxygenates may \n     be offset by an equal or greater reduction in emissions of \n     VOCs, carbon monoxide or toxic air pollutants. In making this \n     determination, the Administrator shall measure emissions on \n     the basis of mass, and to the maximum extent practicable \n     using available science, on the basis of ozone-forming \n     potential, degree of toxicity and carcinogenic potency.\n     Section 10. Renewable content of gasoline and diesel fuel\n       Renewable Content of Gasoline: Not later than September 1, \n     2000, the Administrator shall issue regulations requiring \n     each refiner, blender or importer of gasoline to comply with \n     renewable content requirements. On a quarterly basis, all \n     gasoline sold or introduced into commerce shall contain the \n     applicable percentage of fuel derived from a renewable \n     source. The applicable percentages increase from 1.3 percent \n     in 2000, to 2.4 percent in 2004 (coinciding with the expected \n     prohibition of MTBE by late 2003) and to 4.2 percent in 2010 \n     and thereafter.\n       Fuel Derived From A Renewable Source: The definition of \n     fuel derived from a renewable source includes fuel produced \n     from agricultural commodities, products and their residues; \n     plant materials, including grasses, fibers, wood and wood \n     residues; dedicated energy crops and trees; animal wastes, \n     byproducts and other materials of animal origin; municipal \n     wastes and refuse derived from plant or animal sources; and \n     other biomass that is used to replace or reduce the quantity \n     of fossil fuel in a fuel mixture used to operate a motor \n     vehicle, motor vehicle engine, nonroad vehicle, or nonroad \n     engine.\n       Credit Program: The Administrator shall establish a program \n     for renewable fuel credit trading on a quarterly average \n     basis. The Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary \n     of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, may issue \n     regulations governing the generation and trading of such \n     credits in order to prevent excessive geographical \n     concentration in the use of fuel derived from renewable \n     sources that would tend unduly to affect the price, supply or \n     distribution of such fuels; impede the development of the \n     renewable fuels industry; or otherwise interfere with the \n     purposes of the renewable fuel content requirement.\n       Waiver: A waiver from the renewable content requirement may \n     be granted for an area in whole or in part after consultation \n     with the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of \n     Energy. The waiver may only be granted for an area upon a \n     determination that the renewable content requirement would \n     severely harm the economy or environment of the area, or \n     there is inadequate\n\n[[Page S7886]]\n\n     domestic supply or distribution capacity with respect to \n     fuels from renewable sources and only after a determination \n     that use of the credit trading program would not alleviate \n     the circumstances on which the petition is based. A waiver \n     shall terminate after one year, or at such earlier time as is \n     determined appropriate by the Administrator, but may be \n     renewed after consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture \n     and the Secretary of Energy.\n       Labeling: The Administrator shall issue guidance to the \n     States for labeling at the point of retail sale of fuel \n     derived from a renewable source and the major fuel additive \n     components of the fuel.\n       Reports to Congress: Concerning the renewable content \n     requirement, the Administrator shall report to Congress at \n     least every 3 years (1) regarding reductions in emissions of \n     air pollutants; (2) in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture, regarding the impact on demand for farm \n     commodities, biomass and other material used for producing \n     fuel derived from renewable sources; the adequacy of food and \n     feed supplies; and the effect upon farm income, employment \n     and economic growth, particularly in rural areas; and (3) in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Energy, describing \n     greenhouse gas emission reductions and assessing the effect \n     on U.S. energy security and reliance on imported petroleum.\n       Renewable Content of Diesel Fuel: Not later than September \n     1, 2000, the Administrator shall issue regulations applicable \n     to each refiner, blender, or importer of diesel fuel to \n     ensure that diesel fuel sold or introduced into commerce in \n     the United States complies with renewable content \n     requirements. The Administrator shall establish requirements \n     for the content of diesel fuel that is derived from renewable \n     sources similar to the requirements of the program for \n     gasoline, using the same definition of fuel derived from a \n     renewable source. The regulations shall establish applicable \n     percentages by volume for renewable content for diesel fuel \n     on a quarterly basis, require a gradual increase in the \n     renewable content of diesel fuel, and require that for \n     calendar year 2010 and thereafter the applicable percentage \n     shall be 1.0 percent. The regulations shall provide for \n     credit trading and waiver applications on similar terms to \n     those of the program for gasoline.\n       Prevention of effects on Highway Apportionments: States \n     would be protected from any adverse impacts as a consequence \n     of the sale and use within a State of ethanol in determining \n     the payments attributable to a State paid into the Highway \n     Trust Fund and the minimum guarantee based on payments into \n     the Highway Trust Fund.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Levin, \n        and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 2972. A bill to combat international money laundering and protect \nthe United States financial system, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n the international counter-money laundering and foreign anticorruption \n                              act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the United States must do more to \nstop international criminals from washing the blood off their profits \nfrom the sale of drugs, from terror or from organized crime by \nlaundering money into the United States financial system.\n  That is why today, along with Senators Grassley, Sarbanes, Levin, and \nRockefeller, I am introducing the International Counter-Money \nLaundering and Foreign Anticorruption Act of 2000 which will give the \nSecretary of the Treasury the tools to crack down on international \nmoney laundering havens and protect the integrity of the U.S. financial \nsystem from the influx of tainted money from abroad.\n  I very much appreciate work of the Secretary of Treasury Lawrence \nSummers in the development of this legislation. Secretary Summers has \nbeen a leader in bringing the issue of money laundering to the \nattention of the American public and the Congress. Earlier this year, \nSecretary Summers said, ``The attack on money laundering is an \nessential front in the war on narcotics and the broader fight against \norganized crime worldwide. Money laundering may look like a polite form \nof white collar crime, but it is the companion of brutality, deceit and \ncorruption.''\n  I am deeply saddened that I will not have the pleasure of working \nwith Senator Paul Coverdell, who was to be the primary cosponsor of \nthis legislation. His passing is a tremendous loss to the both to the \nAmerican people and the U.S. Senate.\n  Money laundering is the financial side of international crime. It \noccurs when criminals seek to disguise money that was illegally \nobtained. It allows terrorists, drug cartels, organized crime groups, \ncorrupt foreign government officials and others to preserve the profit \nfrom their illegal activities and to finance new crimes. It provides \nthe fuel that allows criminal organizations to conduct their ongoing \naffairs. It has a corrosive effect on international markets and \nfinancial institutions. Money launderers rely upon the existence of \njurisdictions outside the United States that offer bank secrecy and \nspecial tax or regulatory advantages to non-residents, and often \ncomplement those advantages with weak financial supervision and \nregulatory regimes.\n  Today, the global volume of laundered money is estimated to be 2-5 \npercent of global Gross Domestic Product, between $600 billion and $1.5 \ntrillion. The effects of money laundering extend far beyond the \nparameters of law enforcement, creating international political issues \nwhile generating domestic political crises.\n  International criminals have taken advantage of the advances in \ntechnology and the weak financial supervision in some jurisdictions to \nplace their illicit funds into the United States financial system. \nGlobalization and advances in communications and technologies allow \ncriminals to move their illicit gains faster and farther than ever \nbefore. The result has been a proliferation of international money \nlaundering havens. The ability to launder money into the United States \nthrough these jurisdictions has allowed corrupt foreign officials to \nsystemically divert public assets to their personal use, which in turn \nundermines U.S. efforts to promote democratic institutions and stable, \nvibrant economies abroad.\n  In February, State and Federal regulators formally sanctioned the \nBank of New York for ``deficiencies'' in its anti-money laundering \npractices including lax auditing and risk management procedures \ninvolving their international banking business. The sanctions were \nbased on the Bank of New York's involvement in an alleged money \nlaundering scheme where more than $7 billion in funds were transmitted \nfrom Russia into the bank. Federal investigators are \ncurrently attempting to tie the $7 billion to criminal activities in \nRussia such as corporate theft, political graft or racketeering.\n\n  In November 1999, the minority staff of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Subcommittee on Investigations released a report on private \nbanking and money laundering. The report describes a number of \nincidences where high level government officials have used private \nbanking accounts with U.S. financial institutions to launder millions \nof dollars from foreign governments. The report details how Raul \nSalinas, brother of former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas, used \nprivate bank accounts to launder money out of Mexico. Representatives \nfrom Citigroup testified at a Subcommittee hearing that the bank had \nbeen slow to correct controls over their private banking accounts.\n  During the 1980's, as chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, I began an investigation of the Bank of Credit and \nCommerce International (BCCI), and uncovered a complex money laundering \nscheme. Unlike any ordinary bank, BCCI was from its earliest days made \nup of multiplying layers of entities, related to one another through an \nimpenetrable series of holding companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, \nbanks-within-banks, insider dealings, and nominee relationships.\n  By fracturing corporate structure, record keeping, regulatory review, \nand audits, the complex BCCI family of entities was able to evade \nordinary legal restrictions on the movement of capital and goods as a \nmatter of daily practice and routine. In creating BCCI as a vehicle \nfundamentally free of government control, its creators developed an \nideal mechanism for facilitating illicit activity by others.\n  BCCI's used this complex corporate structure to commit fraud \ninvolving billions of dollars; and launder money for their clients in \nEurope, Africa, Asia and the Americas. Fortunately, we were able to \nbring many of those involved in BCCI to justice. However, my \ninvestigation clearly showed that rogue financial institutions have the \nability to circumvent the laws designed to stop financial crimes.\n  In recent years, the United States and other well-developed financial \ncenters have been working together to improve their antimoney \nlaundering regimes and to set international anti-\n\n[[Page S7887]]\n\nmoney laundering standards. Back in 1988, I included a provision in the \nState Department Reauthorization bill that requires major money \nlaundering countries to adopt laws similar to our own on reporting \ncurrency, or face sanctions if they did not. Panama and Venezuela wound \nup negotiating what were called Kerry agreements with the United States \nand became less vulnerable to the placement of U.S. currency by drug \ntraffickers in the process.\n  Unfortunately, other nations--some small, remote islands--have moved \nin the other direction. Many have passed laws that provide for \nexcessive bank secrecy, anonymous company incorporation, economic \ncitizenship, and other provisions that directly conflict with well-\nestablished international anti-money laundering standards. In doing so, \nthey have become money laundering havens for international criminal \nnetworks. Some even blatantly advertise the fact that their laws \nprotect anyone doing business from U.S. law enforcement.\n  Just last month, the Financial Action Task Force, an \nintergovernmental body developed to develop and promote policies to \ncombat financial crime, released a report naming fifteen \njurisdictions--including the Bahamas, The Cayman Islands, Russia, \nIsrael, Panama, and the Philippines--that have failed to take adequate \nmeasures to combat international money laundering. This is a clear \nwarning to financial institutions in the United States that they must \nbegin to scrutinize many of their financial transactions with customers \nin these countries as possibly being linked to crime and money \nlaundering. Soon, the Financial Action Task Force will develop bank \nadvisories and criminal sanctions that will have the effect of driving \nlegitimate financial business from these nations, depriving them of a \nlucrative source of tax revenue. This report has provided important \ninformation that governments and financial institutions around the \nworld should learn from in developing their own anti-money laundering \nlaws and policies.\n\n  The Financial Stability Forum has recently released a report that \ncategorizes offshore financial centers according to their perceived \nquality of supervision and degree of regulatory cooperation. The \nOrganization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has begun a \nnew crackdown on harmful tax competition. Members of the European Union \nhas reached an agreement in principle on sweeping changes to bank \nsecrecy laws, intended to bring cross-border investment income within \nthe net of tax authorities.\n  The actions by the Financial Action Task Force, the European Union \nand others show a renewed international focus and commitment to curbing \nfinancial abuse around the world. I believe the United States has a \nsimilar obligation to use this new information to update our anti-money \nlaundering status.\n  The International Counter-Money Laundering and Anticorruption Act of \n2000 which I am introducing today would provide the tools the U.S. \nneeds to crack down on international money laundering havens and \nprotect the integrity of the U.S. financial system from the influx of \ntainted money from abroad. The bill provides for actions that will be \ngraduated, discretionary, and targeted, in order to focus actions on \ninternational transactions involving criminal proceeds, while allowing \nlegitimate international commerce to continue to flow unimpeded. It \nwill give the Secretary of the Treasury--acting in consultation with \nother senior government officials and the Congress--the authority to \ndesignate a specific foreign jurisdiction, foreign financial \ninstitution, or class of international transactions as being of \n``primary money laundering concern.'' Then, on a case-by-case basis, \nthe Secretary will have the option to use a series of new tools to \ncombat the specific type of foreign money laundering threat we face. In \nsome cases, the Secretary will have the option to require banks to \npierce the veil of secrecy that foreign criminals hide behind. In other \ncases, the Secretary will have the option to require the identification \nof those using a foreign bank's correspondent or payable-through \naccounts. And if these transparency provisions were deemed to be \ninadequate to address the specific problem identified, the Secretary \nwill have the option to restrict or prohibit U.S. banks from continuing \ncorrespondent or payable-through banking relationships with money \nlaundering havens and rogue foreign banks. Through these steps, the \nSecretary will help prevent laundered money from slipping undetected \ninto the U.S. financial system and, as a result, increase the pressure \non foreign money laundering havens to bring their laws and practices \ninto line with international anti-money laundering standards. The \npassage of this legislation will make it much more difficult for \ninternational criminal organizations to launder the proceeds of their \ncrimes into the United States.\n  This bill fills in the current gap between bank advisories and \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) sanctions by \nproviding five new intermediate measures. Under current law, the only \ncounter-money laundering tools available to the federal governments are \nadvisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing \nbanks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given \ncountry, and full-blown economic sanctions under the IEEPA. This \nlegislation gives five additional measures to increase the government's \nability to apply pressure against targeted jurisdictions or \ninstitutions.\n  This legislation will in no way jeopardize the privacy of the \nAmerican public. The focus is on foreign jurisdictions, financial \ninstitutions and classes of transactions that present a threat to \nthe United States, not on American citizens. The actions that the \nSecretary of the Treasury is authorized to take are designated solely \nto combat the abuse of our banks by specifically identified foreign \nmoney laundering threats. This legislation is in no way similar to the \nKnow-Your-Customer regulations that were proposed by the regulators \nlast year. Further, the intent of this legislation is not to add \nadditional regulatory burdens on financial institutions, but, to give \nthe Secretary of the Treasury the ability to take action against \nexisting money laundering threats.\n\n  Let me repeat, this legislation only gives the discretion to use \nthese tools to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is no automatic \ntrigger which forces action whenever evidence of money laundering is \nuncovered. Before any action is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nin consultation with other key government officials, must first \ndetermine whether a specific country, financial institution or type of \ntransaction is of primary money laundering concern. Then, a calibrated \nresponse will be developed that will consider the effectiveness of the \nmeasure to address the threat, whether other countries are taking \nsimilar steps, and whether the response will cause harm to U.S. \nfinancial institutions and other firms.\n  This legislation will strengthen the ability of the Secretary to \ncombat the international money laundering and help protect the \nintegrity of the U.S. financial system. This bill is supported by the \nheads of all the major federal law enforcement agencies. The House \nBanking Committee recently reported out this legislation with a \nbipartisan 33-1 vote. I believe this legislation deserves consideration \nby the Senate during the 106th Congress.\n  Today, advances in technology are bringing the world closer together \nthan ever before and opening up new opportunities for economic growth. \nHowever, with these new advantages come equally important obligations. \nWe must do everything possible to insure that the changes in technology \ndo not give comfort to international criminals by giving them new ways \nto hide the financial proceeds of their crimes. I believe that this \nlegislation is a first step toward limiting the scourge of money \nlaundering will help stop the development of international criminal \norganizations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kerry, \nGrassley, Levin, and Rockefeller in introducing the Clinton/Gore \nadministration's International Counter-Money Laundering and Foreign \nAnti-Corruption Act of 2000 (``ICMLA''). Money laundering poses an \nongoing threat to the financial stability of the United States. It is \nestimated by the Department of the Treasury that the global volume of \nlaundered money accounts for between 2-5 percent of the global GDP.\n  The ICMLA is designed to bolster the United States ability to counter \nthe\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nlaundering of the proceeds of drug trafficking, organized crime, \nterrorism, and official corruption from abroad. The bill broadens the \nauthority of the Secretary of the Treasury, ensures that banking \ntransactions and financial relationships do not contravene the purposes \nof current antimoney laundering statutes, provides a clear mandate for \nsubjecting foreign jurisdictions that facilitate money laundering to \nspecial scrutiny, and enhances reporting of suspicious activities. The \nbill similarly strengthens current measures to prevent the use of the \nU.S. financial system for personal gain by corrupt foreign officials \nand to facilitate the repatriation of any stolen assets to the citizens \nof countries to whom such assets belong.\n  First, section 101 of the ICMLA gives the Secretary of the Treasury, \nin consultation with other key government officials, discretionary \nauthority to impose five new ``special measures'' against foreign \njurisdictions and entities that are of ``primary money laundering \nconcern'' to the United States. Under current law, the only counter-\nmoney laundering tools available to the federal government are \nadvisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing \nbanks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given \ncountry, and full-blown economic sanctions under the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (``IEEPA''). The five new intermediate \nmeasures will increase the government's ability to apply well-\ncalibrated pressure against targeted jurisdictions or institutions. \nThese new measures include: (1) requiring additional record keeping/\nreporting on particular transactions, (2) requiring the identification \nof the beneficial foreign owner of a U.S. bank account, (3) requiring \nthe identification of those individuals using a U.S. bank account \nopened by a foreign bank to engage in banking transactions (a \n``payable-through account''), (4) requiring the identification of those \nusing a U.S. bank account established to receive deposits and make \npayments on behalf of a foreign financial institution (a \n``correspondent account''), and (5) restricting or prohibiting the \nopening or maintaining of certain correspondent accounts.\n  Second, the bill seeks to enhance oversight into illegal activities \nby clarifying that the ``safe harbor'' from civil liability for filing \na Suspicious Activity Report (``SAR'') applies in any litigation, \nincluding suit for breach of contract or in an arbitration proceeding. \nUnder the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA''), any financial institution or \nofficer, director, employee, or agent of a financial institution is \nprotected against private civil liability for filing a SAR. Section 201 \nof the bill amends the BSA to clarify the prohibition on disclosing \nthat a SAR has been filed. These reports are the cornerstone of our \nnation's money-laundering efforts because they provide the information \nnecessary to alter law enforcement to illegal activity.\n  Third, the bill enhances enforcement of Geographic Targeting Orders \n(``GTOs''). These orders lower the dollar thresholds for reporting \ntransactions within a defined geographic area. Section 202 of the bill \nclarifies that civil and criminal penalties for violations of the Bank \nSecrecy Act and its regulations also apply to reports required by \nGTO's. In addition, the section clarifies that structuring a \ntransaction to avoid a reporting requirement by a GTO is a criminal \noffense and extends the presumptive GTO period from 60 to 180 days.\n  Fourth, section 203 of the bill permits a bank, upon request of \nanother bank, to include suspicious illegal activity in written \nemployment references. Under this provision, banks would be permitted \nto share information concerning the possible involvement of a current \nor former officer or employee in potentially unlawful activity without \nfear of civil liability for sharing the information.\n  Finally, title III of the bill addresses corruption by foreign \nofficials and ruling elites. Pursuant to a sense of Congress, the \nSecretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General \nand the financial services regulators, is mandated to issue guidelines \nto financial institutions operating in the United States on appropriate \npractices and procedures to reduce the likelihood that such \ninstitutions could facilitate proceeds expropriated by or on behalf of \nforeign senior government officials.\n  The ICMLA addresses many of the shortcomings of current law. The \nSecretary of Treasury is granted additional authority to require \ngreater transparency of transactions and accounts as well as to \nnarrowly target penalties and sanctions. The reporting and collection \nof additional information on suspected illegal activity will greatly \nenhance the ability of bank regulators and law enforcement to combat \nthe laundering of drug money, proceeds from corrupt regimes, and other \nillegal activities.\n  Mr. President, the House Banking Committee passed the identical \nantimoney laundering bill by a vote of 31 to 1 on June 8, 2000. I hope \nthat we can move this legislation expeditiously in the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2973. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to improve fishery management and enforcement, and \nfisheries data collection, research, and assessment, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              the magnuson-stevens act amendments of 2000\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Magnuson-\nStevens Act Amendments of 2000. I would like to thank Mr. Hollings for \njoining me as an original cosponsor of this legislation to reauthorize \nand update the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management \nAct. As my colleagues and I well remember, we last substantially \nreauthorized the Act only four years ago with the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct--a three-year effort in itself. As in 1996, I look forward to \nworking with members of the Commerce Committee as we update and improve \nthis most important legislation.\n  Mr. President, the fishery resources found off U.S. shores are a \nvaluable national heritage. In 1998, the last year for which we have \nfigures, U.S. commercial fisheries produced $3.1 billion in dockside \nrevenues, contributing a total of more than $25 billion to the Gross \nNational Product. By weight of catch, the United States is the world's \nfifth largest fishing nation, harvesting over 4 million tons of fish \nannually. The United States is also a significant seafood exporter, \nwith exports valued at over $8 billion in 1998. In addition to \nsupporting the commercial seafood industry, U.S. fishery resources \nprovide enjoyment for about 9 million saltwater anglers who take home \nroughly 200 million pounds of fish each year.\n  Over the past year, the Commerce Committee under Senator Snowe's \nleadership has been holding a series of hearings around the country in \npreparation for this year's reauthorization. These hearings have \npointed to one central theme--while there is certainly room for \nimproving fisheries management under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the \nsweeping changes we made in 1996 are still being implemented in each \nregion. In fact, a number of regions are showing good progress, \nincluding New England where the yellowtail flounder and haddock stocks \nare rebounding. For this reason, I believe this year's reauthorization \nshould leave in place the core conservation provisions of the Act, and \nfocus on providing adequate resources, and any organizational or other \nchanges necessary for NOAA Fisheries and Regional Fishery Management \nCouncils to achieve the goals we set forth in the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct.\n  Mr. President, the bill I introduce today outlines a proposal for \nmaking this a reality. While we have added increasingly complex \ntechnical and scientific requirements to the fisheries management \nprocess, we have failed in many cases to provide the resources \nnecessary to meet these requirements. Effective fisheries management \nfor the future will rely on committing adequate resources and direction \nto the fisheries managers as well as the fishing participants. These \ninclude providing necessary funding increases to both the agency and \nthe Councils, creation of a national observer program, establishing a \nnationwide cooperative research program with the fishing industry, and \nensuring that we are collecting the socioeconomic data we need to \ndesign management measures that\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nmake sense for fishermen. This legislation aims to remedy this by \nproviding a significant increase in funding, and specifying amounts \nrequired to support both the new initiatives and existing programs.\n  Over the years, we have reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act many \ntimes, and each time we have wrestled with the question of how to \nimprove the ability of the Regional Fisheries Management Councils to \neffectively and fairly implement the requirements of the Act. This bill \nsuggests ways in which to begin remedying these concerns. First, the \nbill would clarify that the Secretary of Commerce must ensure \nrepresentation on the Council of all qualified persons who are \nconcerned with fisheries conservation and management. While fishermen \nare the source of tremendous wisdom and expertise needed in managing \nthese fisheries, there are others such as scientists and those with \nother relevant experience who may also provide valuable service to the \nCouncils. To help the Secretary meet this requirement, the bill \nrequires Governors to consult with members of recreational, commercial, \nand other fishing or conservation interests within a State before \nselecting a list of nominees to send to the Secretary. We would like to \nsee all those who can provide constructive attention to our fishery \nmanagement problems to work together to forge innovative and \nprogressive solutions. In addition, we must increase independent \nscientific involvement in the Councils, and my legislation would \nprovide that Councils must involve Science and Statistics Committee \nmembers in the development and amendment of fisheries management plans.\n  I do know of the grave concerns expressed by conservation groups, \nfishermen, scientists and managers about problems with the existing \nfishery management process. I believe we need to address these \nquestions, both with respect to the Councils and the Agency. I would \nlike to work on this further with my colleagues as we go forward, but \nin the meantime this bill asks the National Academy of Sciences to \nbring together international and regional experts to evaluate what \nworks and what may be broken in the current system, and what additional \nchanges may be necessary to modernize and make more effective our \nentire fishery management process.\n  In our series of hearings around the country, we have consistently \nheard a call from both industry and conservation groups for observer \ncoverage in our fisheries. We have failed to adequately provide funding \nmechanisms for observer coverage; each year, federally funded observers \nare deployed in as few as five to seven fisheries, and observer \ncoverage is rarely over 20 percent. Without observer coverage, there is \nlittle hope that we will have statistically significant data, \nparticularly data on actual levels of bycatch. I have included \nprovisions to ensure that each fishery management plan details observer \ncoverage and monitoring needs for a fishery, and created a new National \nObserver Program. This national program would address technical and \nadministrative responsibilities over regional observer programs. I have \nalso included provisions to allow Councils or the Secretary to develop \nobserver monitoring plans, and have established a fishery observer fund \nwhich would include funds appropriated for this purpose, collected as \nfines under a new bycatch incentive program, or deposited through fees \nestablished under this section.\n  In the 1996 reauthorization, we took a first step in dealing with the \nissue of bycatch by instructing NMFS to implement a standardized \nbycatch reporting methodology. Nonetheless, I believe we have a long \nway to go in dealing with the bycatch problem in many of our fisheries. \nIn addition to establishing a national observer program, my bill would \nestablish a task force to recommend measures to monitor, manage, and \nreduce bycatch and unobserved fishing mortality. The Secretary would \nthen be charged with implementing these recommendations. In addition, I \nhave provided for the development of bycatch reduction incentive \nprograms that could include a system of fines, non-transferable bycatch \nquotas, or preferences for gear types with low-bycatch rates.\n  It is also time for us to move forward on ecosystem-based fishery \nmanagement. We do not yet have the data to actually manage most of our \nfisheries on an ecosystem basis, but I still believe we must begin the \npreparation and consideration of fishery ecosystem plans. We must \nstrive to understand the complex ecological and socioeconomic \nenvironments in which fish and fisheries exist, if we hope to \nanticipate the effects that fishery management will have on the \necosystem, and the effects that ecosystem change will have on \nfisheries. My legislation would require each Council to develop one \nfishery ecosystem plan for a marine ecosystem under its jurisdiction. \nEach ecosystem plan would have to include a listing of data and \ninformation needs identified during development of the plan, and the \nmeans of addressing any scientific uncertainties associated with the \nplan.\n  One of the most resounding comments we heard at all of our regional \nhearings was the need to continually improve scientific information, \nand to involve the fishing industry in the collection of this \ninformation. My bill would establish a national cooperative research \nprogram, patterned after the successful cooperative research program in \nthe New England scallop fishery, for projects that are developed \nthrough partnerships among federal and state managers, fishing industry \nparticipants, and academic institutions. Priority would be given to \nprojects to reduce bycatch, conservation engineering projects, projects \nto identify and protect essential fish habitat or habitat area of \nparticular concern, projects to collect fishery ecosystem information \nand improve predictive capabilities, and projects to compile social and \neconomic data on fisheries.\n  Over the years, I have heard much complaint that NMFS does not \ncommunicate effectively with the fishing industry or the general \npublic. To remedy this, my bill calls for the establishment of a \nfisheries outreach program within NMFS to heighten public understanding \nof NMFS research and technology, train Council members on \nimplementation of National Standards 1 and 8 requirements of NEPA and \nthe Regulatory Flexibility Act, and identify means of improving quality \nand reporting of fishery-dependent data. New provisions would also \nrequire improvement of the transparency of the stock assessment process \nand methods, and increase access and compatibility of data relied upon \nin fishery management decisions. I have required the Secretary to \nperiodically review fishery data collection and assessment methods, and \nto establish a Center for Independent Peer Review under which \nindependent experts would be provided for special peer review \nfunctions.\n  Mr. President, I have also included provisions to address one of our \nbiggest problems in fisheries today--too many fishermen chasing too few \nfish. It is true that many of our fisheries are overcapitalized. A \nbuyout in New England several years ago attempted to deal with this \nproblem, and according to Penny Dalton, Assistant Administrator for \nFisheries, in a recent USA Today article, the buyout ``jump started \nrecovery in the New England groundfish fishery.'' A section of my bill \nwould require the Secretary to evaluate overcapacity in each fishery, \nand identify measures planned or taken to reduce any such overcapacity. \nMy legislation would amend the existing Act to ensure that capacity \nreduction programs also consider and address latent fishing capacity, \nand would allow the use of Capital Construction Funds and funds from \nthe Fisheries Finance Program for measures to benefit the conservation \nand management of fisheries such as capacity reduction, as well as for \ngear and safety improvements.\n  In 1996, we enacted a new concept in defining, and requiring \nprotection and identification of, essential fish habitat (EFH). While \nthere has been much outcry that essential fish habitat has been \nidentified too broadly and that EFH consultation processes have \nresulted in regulatory delay, GAO reports very few real problems \nresulting from such designations. As a result, I do not feel it is \nnecessary to significantly modify EFH provisions. Instead, I believe we \ncan improve the current work of NMFS and the Councils to identify EFH, \nand areas within them called ``habitat areas of particular concern'' \n(HAPCs). I have added new provisions that would require Councils to \nprotect and identify\n\n[[Page S7890]]\n\nHAPCs as part of existing requirements to identify and protect EFH. My \nbill would clarify that HAPCs are to be identified pursuant to the NMFS \nEFH guidelines, and that these areas should receive priority \nidentification and protection, as they are oftentimes the areas most \ncritical to fish spawning and recruitment. It is crucial that we \nimprove our understanding of fisheries habitat, and my bill would \nestablish pilot cooperative research projects on fishery and non-\nfishery impacts to HAPCs.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of \nindividual fishing quotas, which have been the subject of much debate \nover the past few years. There is a moratorium on these programs in \nplace until September 30, 2000, and we have been skirting consideration \nof this new management tool for too long. We must begin debate and \nconsideration of the panoply of exclusive quota-based programs that \nhave developed over the past several years, which must include adoption \nof legislative guidance for these programs. For this reason, the bill \nsuggests a set of national criteria that would permit establishment of \nexclusive quota based programs--including community-based quotas, \nfishing cooperatives, and individual fishing quotas--but still protect \nthe concerns of those who do not wish to employ these tools. I invite \nall those who are concerned about these issues to engage in a \ndiscussion with my colleagues and me on the appropriate way to address \nthis national issue as we move forward this session.\n  I understand the many concerns of small fishermen in New England \nregarding the use of these tools. First, no region would have to \nimplement an exclusive quota-based program without approval of a 3/5 \nmajority of eligible permit holders through a referendum process. In \naddition, any exclusive quota-based program developed under my \nlegislation would have to meet a set of national criteria. These \nnational criteria would include provisions specifically aimed at \nprotecting small fishermen such as the following: (1) ensuring that \nquota-based programs provide a fair and equitable initial allocation of \nquota (including the establishment of an appeals process for \nqualification and allocation decisions), (2) preserving the historical \ndistribution of catch among vessel categories and gear sectors, (3) \nconsidering allocation of a portion of the annual harvest specifically \nto small fishermen and crew members; and (4) requiring programs to \nconsider the effects of consolidation of quota shares and establish \nlimits necessary to prevent inequitable concentration of quota share or \nsignificant impacts on other fisheries or fishing communities. To \nrespond to the concern that we must ensure quota-based programs meet \nconservation objectives, my legislation would provide a 7-year review \nof the performance of quota holders, including fulfillment of \nconservation requirements of the Act. Finally any quota-based program \nwould have to have a plan to rationalize the fishery--which in some \ncases would require a buyout of excess capacity under section 312(b) of \nthe Act.\n  Mr. President, I believe this legislation provides the funding, \ntools, and programs to ensure the important changes made in the 1996 \namendments are implemented effectively and improved where necessary. \nDuring the last reauthorization, our nation's fisheries were at a \ncrossroads, and action was required to remedy our marine resource \nmanagement problems, to preserve the way of life of our coastal \ncommunities, and to promote the sustainable use and conservation of our \nmarine resources for future generations and for the economic good of \nthe nation. We made changes in 1996 that were good for the environment, \ngood for the fish, and good for the fishermen. We must stay the course, \nand this bill will help us do just that. In addition, the bill will \nprovide us with innovative tools, such as exclusive quota-based \nprograms and the new national observer program, to further advance \nfisheries management. Mr. President, I remain committed to the goal of \nestablishing biologically and economically sustainable fisheries so \nthat fishing will continue to be an important part of the culture of \ncoastal communities as well as the economy of the Nation and \nMassachusetts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2975. A bill to limit the administrative expenses and profits of \nmanaged care entities to not more than 15 percent of premium revenues; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           managed care health benefits integrity act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Health \nBenefits Integrity Act to make sure that most health care dollars that \npeople and employers pay into a managed care health insurance plan get \nspent on health care and not on overhead.\n  Under my bill, managed care plans would be limited to spending 15 \npercent of their premium revenues on administration. This means that if \nthey spend 15 percent on administration, they would spend 85 percent of \npremium revenues on health care benefits or services.\n  This bill was prompted by study by the Inspector General (IG) for the \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported under a USA Today \nheadline in February, ``Medicare HMOs Hit for Lavish Spending.'' The IG \nreviewed 232 managed care plans that contract with Medicare and found \nthat in 1999 the average amount allocated for administration ranged \nfrom a high of 32 percent to a low of three percent. The IG recommended \nthat the Department establish a ceiling on the amount of administrative \nexpenditures of plans, noting that if a 15 percent ceiling had been \nplaced in 1998, an additional $1 billion could have been passed on to \nMedicare beneficiaries in the form of additional benefits or reduce \ndeductibles and copayments.\n  The report said, ``This review, similar OIG reviews, and other \nstudies have shown that MCOs' [managed care organizations'] exorbitant \nadministrative costs have been problematic and can be the source for \nabusive behavior.'' Here are some examples cited by the Inspector \nGeneral on page 7 of the January 18 report: $249,283 for food, gifts \nand alcoholic beverages for meetings by one plan; $190,417 for a sales \naward meeting in Puerto Rico for one plan; $157,688 for a party by one \nplan; $25,057 for a luxury box at a sports arena by one plan; $106,490 \nfor sporting events and/or theater tickets at four plans; $69,700 for \nholiday parties at three plans; and $37,303 for wine gift baskets, \nflowers, gifts and gift certificates at one plan.\n  It is no wonder that people today are angry at HMOs. When our hard-\nearned premium dollars are frittered away on purchases like these, we \nhave to ask whether HMOs are really providing the best care possible. \nFurthermore, in the case of Medicare, we are also talking about wasted \ntaxpayer dollars since Part B of Medicare is funded in part by the \ngeneral treasury. One dollar wasted in Medicare is one dollar too much. \nMedicare needs all the funds it can muster to stay solvent and to be \nthere for beneficiaries when they need it.\n  I feel strongly that if HMOs are to be credible, they must be more \nprudent in how they spend enrollees' dollars. Administrative expenses \nmust be limited to reasonable expenses.\n  An October 1999 report by Interstudy found that for private HMO \nplans, administrative expenses range from 11 percent to 21 percent and \nthat for-profit HMOs spend proportionately more on administrative cost \nthan not-for-profit HMOs. This study found the lowest rate to be 3.6 \npercent and the highest 38 percent in California! In some states the \nmaximums were even higher.\n  The shift from fee-for-service to managed care as a form of health \ninsurance has been rapid in recent years. Nationally, 86 percent of \npeople who have employment-based health insurance (81.3 million \nAmericans) are in some form of managed care. Around 16 percent of \nMedicare beneficiaries are in managed care nationally (40 percent in \nCalifornia), a figure that doubled between 1994 and 1997. By 2010, the \nCongressional Budget Office predicts that 31 percent of Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be in managed care. Between 1987 and 1999, the \nnumber of health plans contracting with Medicare went from 161 to 299. \nAs for Medicaid, in 1993, 4.8 million people (14 percent of Medicaid \nbeneficiaries) were in managed care. Today, 16.6 million (54 percent) \nare in managed care.\n  In California, the State which pioneered managed care for the nation, \nan estimated 88 percent of the insured are in some form of managed \ncare. Of the 3.7 million Californians who are in Medicare, 40 percent \n(1.4 million) are in\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\nmanaged care, the highest rate in the U.S. As for Medicaid in \nCalifornia, 2.5 million people (50 percent) of beneficiaries are in \nmanaged care. And so managed care is growing and most people think it \nis here to stay.\n  I am pleased to say that in California we already have a regulation \nalong the lines of the bill I am proposing. We have in place a \nregulatory limit of 15 percent on commercial HMO plans' administrative \nexpenses. This was established in my State for commercial plans because \nof questionable expenses like those the HHS IG found in Medicare HMO \nplans and because prior to the regulation, some plans had \nadministrative expense as high as 30 percent of premium revenues.\n  This bill would never begin to address all the problems patients \nexperience with managed care in this country. That is why we also need \na strong Patients Bill of Rights bill. I hope, however, this bill will \ndiscourage abuses like those the HHS Inspector General found and will \nhelp assure people that their health care dollars are spent on health \ncare and are not wasted on outings, parties, and other activities \ntotally unrelated to providing health care services.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Byrd, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2976. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nallow States to provide health benefits coverage for parents of \nchildren eligible for child health assistance under the State \nchildren's health insurance program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              family health insurance program act of 2000\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, Senators Byrd, Boxer and I are \nintroducing legislation to allow States, at their option, to enroll \nparents in the State-Children's Health Insurance Program, known as S-\nCHIP. This bill could provide insurance to 2.7 million parents \nnationwide and 356,000 parents in California by using unspent \nallocations States will otherwise lose on September 30, 2000. Congress \nhas appropriated a total of $12.9 billion for S-CHIP for fiscal years \n1998, 1999, and 2000, or about $4.3 billion for each fiscal year. \nCalifornia received $854.6 million in 1998, $850.6 million in 1999, and \n$765.5 million in 2000. Right now California stands to lose $588 \nmillion just in fiscal year 1998 funds because California has faced \nmany hurdles in enrolling children. That is in part why we are \nintroducing this bill, to enhance enrollment of more children and to \nhelp states use available S-CHIP funds.\n  S-CHIP is a low-cost health insurance program for low-income children \nup to age 19 that Congress created in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nAfter three years, S-CHIP covers approximately two million children \nacross the country, out of the three to four million children estimated \nto be eligible. Congress created it as a way to provide affordable \nhealth insurance for uninsured children in families that cannot afford \nto buy private insurance.\n  States can choose from three options when designing their S-CHIP \nprogram: (1) expansion of their current Medicaid program; (2) creation \nof a separate State insurance program; or (3) a combination of both \napproaches. In California, S-CHIP, known as Health Families, is set up \nas a public-private program rather than a Medicaid expansion. Healthy \nFamilies allows California families to use federal and State S-CHIP \nfunds to purchase private managed care insurance for their children. \nUnder the federal law, States generally cover children in families with \nincomes up to 200 percent of poverty, although States can go higher if \ntheir Medicaid eligibility was higher than that when S-CHIP was enacted \nin 1997. In California, eligibility was raised to 250 percent in \nNovember 1999, increasing the number of eligible children by 129,000.\n  Basic benefits in the California S-CHIP program include inpatient and \noutpatient hospital services, surgical and medical services, lab and x-\nray services, and well-baby and well-child care, including \nimmunizations. Additional services which States are encouraged to \nprovide, and which California has elected to include, are prescription \ndrugs and mental health, visions, hearing, dental, and preventive care \nservices such as prenatal care and routine physical examinations. In \nCalifornia, enrollees pay a $5.00 co-payment per visit which generally \napplies to inpatient services, selected outpatient services, and \nvarious other health care services.\n  The United States faces a serious health care crisis that continues \nto grow as more and more people are becoming uninsured. Despite the \nrobust health of the economy, the U.S. has seen an increase in the \nuninsured by nearly five million since 1994. Currently, 44 million \npeople (or 18 percent) of the non-elderly population are uninsured. In \nCalifornia, 23.5 percent, or 7.3 million, are uninsured. One study \ncited in the May 2000 California Journal found that as many as 2,333 \nCalifornians lose health insurance every day. A May 29, 2000 San Jose \nMercury article cited California's emergency room doctors who \n``estimate that anywhere from 20 percent to 40 percent of their walk-in \npatients have no health coverage.'' This a problem that needs to be \naddressed now.\n\n  The bill we are introducing would allow States to expand S-CHIP \ncoverage to parents whose children are eligible for the program. In my \nState, that would be families up to 250 percent of the federal poverty \nlevel. For the year 2000, the federal poverty level for a family of \nfour is $17,050. In California, with the upper eligibility limit of 250 \npercent of poverty, families of four making up to $42,625 are eligible. \nThis bill could reach approximately 2.7 million parents nationwide and \nmore than 356,000 parents in California. The bill we are introducing \nretains the current funding formula, State allotments, benefits, \neligibility rules, and cost-sharing requirements.\n  An S-CHIP expansion should be accomplished without substituting S-\nCHIP coverage for private insurance or other public health insurance \nthat parents might already have. The current S-CHIP law requires that \nState plans include adequate provisions preventing substitution and my \nbill retains that. For example, many States require that an enrollee be \nuninsured before he or she is eligible for the program.\n  This bill is important for several reasons. Many State officials say \nthat by covering parents of uninsured children we can actually cover \nmore children. More than 75 percent of uninsured children live with \nparents who are uninsured. If an entire family is enrolled in a plan \nand seeing the same group of doctors--in other words, if the care is \nconvenient for the whole family--all the members of the family are more \nlikely to be insured and to stay healthy. This is a key reason for this \nlegislation, bringing in more children by targeting the whole family.\n  Private health insurance in the commercial market can be very \nexpensive. The average annual cost of family coverage in private health \nplans for 1999 was $5,742, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \nCalifornia has some of the lowest-priced health insurance, yet the \nState ranks fifth in uninsured for 1998-1996. In California, high \nhousing costs, high gas prices, expensive commutes, and a high cost-of-\nliving make it difficult for many California families to buy health \ninsurance. According to the California Institute, the median price of \nsingle family home rose 17 percent, to $231,710, from February 1999 to \nFebruary 2000. The California Housing Affordability Index, which \nmeasures the percentage of Californians that are able to purchase mid-\npriced homes, declined 11 percent from 1999 to 2000. With prices like \nthese, many families are unable to afford health insurance even though \nthey work full-time.\n  Many low-income people work for employers who do not offer health \ninsurance. In fact, forty percent of California small businesses (those \nemploying between three and 50 employers) do not offer health \ninsurance, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study in June.\n  We need to give hard-working, lower income American families \naffordable, comprehensive health insurance, and this bill does that.\n  The President has proposed to cover parents under the S-CHIP program. \nThe California Medical Association and Alliance of Catholic Health Care \nsupport our bill.\n  Current law requires States to spend federal S-CHIP dollars within \nthree years of the appropriation. Many States, including California, \ncould lose millions of dollars of unspent federal\n\n[[Page S7892]]\n\nFiscal Year 1998 funds on September 30, 2000. I am working to get an \nextension of that deadline. In the meantime, we could begin to cover \nparents while getting that extension and working to increase funds for \nthe program. According to estimates from the Health Care Financing \nAdministration, the following 39 States could lose the following \namounts, totaling $1.9 billion. Arizona, California, Georgia, Illinois, \nLouisiana, Michigan, New Mexico, and Texas stand to lose the most \nmoney. These eight States alone would lose $1.4 billion.\n\n        States                                                 Millions\nArizona...........................................................$77.2\nArkansas...........................................................45.4\nCalifornia........................................................588.8\nColorado...........................................................12.9\nConnecticut.........................................................9.4\nDelaware..............................................................6\nDistrict of Columbia................................................2.4\nFlorida............................................................41.5\nGeorgia............................................................78.1\nHawaii..............................................................8.9\nIdaho...............................................................4.1\nIllinois...........................................................84.2\nIowa................................................................1.4\nKansas..............................................................1.5\nLouisiana..........................................................73.3\nMaryland...........................................................26.7\nMichigan...........................................................51.4\nMinnesota..........................................................28.3\nMontana.............................................................1.8\nNevada.............................................................18.6\nNew Hampshire.......................................................7.5\nNew Jersey............................................................2\nNew Mexico.........................................................57.9\nNorth Dakota........................................................2.9\nOhio...............................................................19.8\nOklahoma...........................................................37.6\nOregon.............................................................18.3\nPennsylvania.......................................................0.64\nRhode Island........................................................4.6\nSouth Dakota........................................................4.4\nTennessee..........................................................26.4\nTexas.............................................................443.6\nUtah................................................................1.7\nVermont.............................................................1.6\nVirginia...........................................................38.4\nWashington.........................................................45.1\nWest Virginia......................................................11.3\nWisconsin............................................................23\nWyoming.............................................................6.9\n\n  Our bill would offer another option for States like mine to use these \nunspent funds.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting and passing this bill. \nBy giving States the option to cover parents--whole families--we can \nreduce the number of uninsured with existing funds and encourage the \nenrollment of more children and we can help keep people healthy by \nbetter using this valuable, but currently under-utilized program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 2977.

Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today \nto benefit 17 million citizens of Southern California and visitors from \naround the country and world through the development of the Western \nCenter for Archaeology and Paleontology. At this center, visitors will \nbe able to marvel at the archaeological and paleontological past of \ninland southern California.\n  This bill would help create an interpretive center and museum around \nDiamond Valley Lake to highlight the animals and habitat of the Ice Age \nup to the European settlement period.\n  I understand that the paleontological resources are world class and \ninclude hundreds of thousands of historic and pre-historic artifacts. \nThese include a mastodon skeleton, a mammoth skeleton, a seven-foot \nlong tusk, and bones from extinct species previously not believed to \nhave lived in the area, including the giant long-horned bison and North \nAmerican lion.\n  Additionally, visitors will enjoy unprecedented recreational \nopportunities through a system of hiking, biking, and equestrian trails \nwandering through the grasslands, chaparral, and oak groves that \nsurround the reservoir.\n  The total cost of the project is $58 million. The State has agreed to \ncommit one quarter of the tab, the Metropolitan Water District has \nagreed to contribute one-quarter, and other local governments will also \ncontribute one-quarter. This bill would authorize the federal \ngovernment's share of one-quarter or $14 million.\n  I urge the Senate to adopt this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2978. A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n\n\n         The Tribal College or University Loan Forgiveness Act.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, our tribal colleges and universities have \ncome to play a critically important role in educating Native Americans \nacross the country. For more than 30 years, these institutions have \nproven instrumental in providing a quality education for those who had \npreviously been failed by our mainstream educational system. Before the \ntribal college movement began, only six or seven out of 100 Native \nAmerican students attended college. Of those few, only one or two would \ngraduate with a degree. Since these institutions have curricula that is \nculturally relevant and is often focused on a tribe's particular \nphilosophy, culture, language and economic needs, they have a high \nsuccess rate in educating Native American people. As a result, I am \nhappy to say that tribal college enrollment has increased 62 percent \nover the last six years.\n  The results of a tribal college education are impressive. Recent \nstudies show that 91 percent of 1998 tribal college and university \ngraduates are working or pursuing additional education one year after \ngraduating. Over the last ten years, the unemployment rate of recently \npolled tribal college graduates was 15 percent, compared to 55 percent \non many reservations overall.\n  While tribal colleges and universities have been highly successful in \nhelping Native Americans obtain a higher education, many challenges \nremain to ensure the future success of these institutions. These \nschools rely heavily on federal resources to provide educational \nopportunities for all students. As a result, I strongly support efforts \nto provide additional funding to these colleges through the Interior, \nAgriculture and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations bills.\n  In addition to resource constraints, administrators have expressed a \nparticular frustration over the difficulty they experience in \nattracting qualified individuals to teach at tribal colleges. \nGeographic isolation and low faculty salaries have made recruitment and \nretention particularly difficult for many of these schools. This \nproblem is increasing as enrollment rises.\n  That is why I am introducing the Tribal College or University Loan \nForgiveness Act. This legislation will provide loan forgiveness to \nindividuals who commit to teach for up to five years in one of the 32 \ntribal colleges nationwide. Individuals who have Perkins, Direct, or \nGuaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to $15,000 in loan \nforgiveness. This program will provide these schools extra help in \nattracting qualified teachers, and thus help ensure that deserving \nstudents receive a high quality education.\n  This measure will benefit individual students and their communities. \nBy providing greater opportunities for Native American students to \ndevelop skills and expertise, this bill will spur economic growth and \nhelp bring prosperity and self-sufficiency to communities that \ndesperately need it. Native Americans and the tribal college system \ndeserve nothing less. I believe our responsibility was probably best \nsummed up by one of my state's greatest leaders, Sitting Bull.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to clarify \nthe status of professional employer organizations and to promote and \nprotect the interests of professional employer organizations, their \ncustomers, and workers; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    professional employer organization workers benefits act of 2000\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today along with my Finance Committee \ncolleague, Senator Mack, I am introducing the Professional Employer \nOrganization Workers Benefits Act of 2000. This legislation will expand \nretirement and health benefits for workers at small and medium-sized \nbusinesses in this country.\n  The bill makes it easier for certified professional employer \norganizations (PEO's) to assist small and medium-sized businesses in \ncomplying with the many responsibilities of being an employer. It \npermits PEO's to collect Federal employment taxes on behalf of the \nemployer and provide benefits to the small business' workers. For many \nof these workers, the pension, health and other benefits that a PEO \nprovides would not be available from the small business itself because \nthey are too costly for the small business to provide on its own. The \naverage client of a PEO is a small business with 18 workers and an \naverage wage of $20,000. PEO's have the expertise and can take \nadvantage of economies of scale to provide health and retirement \nbenefits in an affordable and efficient manner.\n  A recent Dunn & Bradstreet survey of small businesses reveled that \nonly 39 percent offered health care and just 19 percent offer \nretirement plans. We must take every opportunity to assist these small \nbusinesses in providing retirement and health benefits to their \nemployees. PEO's offer one creative way to bridge the gap between what \nworkers need and what small businesses can afford to provide. In fact, \none analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons estimates that 40 percent of \ncompanies in a PEO coemployment relationship upgrade their total \nemployee benefits package as a result of the partnership with the PEO. \nTwenty-five percent of those companies offer health and other benefits \nfor the first time.\n  Over the past few years, small and medium-sized businesses have \nsought out the services offered by PEO's. In response, many states have \ncreated programs to recognize, license and regulate PEO's to ensure \nthat a viable industry could grow. Unfortunately, federal law has not \nkept pace. Current rules for who can collect employment taxes and \nprovide benefits do not fit with the PEO model. Under some \ninterpretations, PEO's would be prohibited from performing the very \nservices that small businesses are asking them to undertake.\n  This legislation clarifies the tax laws to make it clear that PEO's \nmeeting certain standards will be able to assist small businesses in \nproviding employee benefits and collecting Federal employment taxes. \nThis bill is a narrower version of a provision that was included in the \npension legislation I sponsored in the last Congress. This new bill \nincorporates comments we received from interested parties over the \ncourse of the past year, including those received from the Treasury and \nLabor Departments. As a result the bill we are introducing today is \nmuch improved from previous versions.\n  In addition, I would like to make clear what this bill does not do. \nUnlike earlier versions, this legislation applies only to PEO's, and \nnot to temporary staffing agencies. Further, this bill applies only to \nthe two specific areas of tax law--employment taxes and employee \nbenefits. It does not affect any other law nor does it affect the \ndetermination of who is the employer for any other purpose. The bill \nspecifically provides that it creates no inferences with respect to \nthose issues.\n  I am hopeful that, with this narrower focus, this legislation can be \nconsidered on its own merits, without getting bogged down in larger \ndisputes involving contingent workforces and independent contractors. \nThose issues are important ones that Congress may want to examine, but \nwe should not allow them to delay resolution of the unrelated PEO \nissued addressed by this bill.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Mack, my other colleagues on \nthe Finance Committee, and the administration to move this bill during \nthe 106th Congress so that we can help small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses operate more efficiently while at the same time expanding \nthe benefits available to their workers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following explanation \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Technical Explanation of Professional Employer Organization Workers \n                          Benefits Act of 2000\n\n       The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \n     clarify the treatment of certain qualifying organizations--\n     called Certified Professional Employer Organizations \n     (CPEOs)--for employee benefit and employment tax purposes. \n     Generally, the bill provides that an entity which meets \n     certain requirements may be certified as a CPEO by the \n     Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and will be allowed (1) to \n     take responsibility for employment taxes with respect to \n     worksite employees of an unrelated client and (2) to provide \n     such workers with employee benefits\n\n[[Page S7894]]\n\n     under a single employer plan maintained by the CPEO.\n       While the legislation will allow the CPEO to take \n     responsibility for certain functions, the bill expressly \n     states (1) that it does not override the common law \n     determination of an individual's employer and (2) that it \n     will not affect the determination of who is a common law \n     employer under federal tax laws or who is an employer under \n     other provisions of law (including the characterization of an \n     arrangement as a MEWA under ERISA). Status as a CPEO (or \n     failure to be a CPEO) will also not be a factor in \n     determining employment status under current rules.\n\n\n          CERTIFICATION OF PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYER ORGANIZATIONS\n\n       In order to be certified as a CPEO, an entity must \n     demonstrate to the IRS by written application that it meets \n     (or, if applicable, will meet) certain requirements. \n     Generally, the requirements for certification will be \n     developed by the IRS using the ERO (electronic return \n     originator) program and the requirements to practice before \n     the IRS (as described in Circular 230) as a model. Standards \n     will include review of the experience of the PEO and issuance \n     of an opinion by a certified public accountant on the CPEOs \n     financial statements. As part of the certification process, \n     the applicant must disclose any criminal complaints against \n     it, its principal owners and officers, or related entities, \n     and any incidence of failure to timely file tax returns or \n     pay taxes (either income or employment taxes) by it, its \n     principal owners and officer, or related entities. The IRS \n     would have the ability to do a background and tax check of \n     the applicant, its principal owners and officers, or related \n     entities, and may reject an application on the basis of \n     information determined in that process. In addition, in order \n     to be certified, a CPEO must represent that it (or the \n     client) will maintain a qualified retirement plan for the \n     benefit of 95% of worksite employees.\n       The CPEO must notify the IRS in writing of any change that \n     affects the continuing accuracy of any representation made in \n     the initial certification request. In addition, after initial \n     certification, the CPEO must continue to file copies of its \n     audited financial statements with the IRS by the last day of \n     the sixth month following the end of the fiscal year. \n     Procedures would be established for suspending or revoking \n     CPEO status (similar to those under the ERO program). There \n     would be a right to administrative appeal from an IRS denial, \n     suspension, or revocation or certification.\n\n\n               cpeo relationship with particular workers\n\n       After certification, a CPEO will be allowed to take \n     responsibility for employment taxes and to provide employee \n     benefits to ``worksite employees.'' A worker who performs \n     services at a client's worksite is a ``worksite employee'' if \n     the worker (and at least 85% of the individuals working at \n     the worksite) are subject to a written service contract that \n     expressly provide that the CPEO will:\n       (1) Assume responsibility for payment of wages to the \n     worker, without regard to the receipt or adequacy of payment \n     from the client for such services;\n       (2) Assume responsibility for employment taxes with respect \n     to the worker, without regard to the receipt or adequacy of \n     payment from the client for such services;\n       (3) Assume responsibility for any worker benefits that may \n     be required by the service contract, without regard to the \n     receipt or adequacy of payment from the client for such \n     services;\n       (4) Assume shared responsibility with the client for firing \n     the worker and recruiting and hiring any new worker; and\n       (5) Maintain employee records.\n       (6) Agrees to be treated as a CPEO with respect to the \n     worksite employees covered under the agreement.\n       For this purpose, a worksite is defined as a physical \n     location at which a worker generally performs service or, if \n     there is no such location, the location from which the worker \n     receives job assignments. Contiguous locations would be \n     treated as a single physical location. Noncontiguous \n     locations would generally be treated as separate worksites, \n     except that each worksite within a reasonably proximate area \n     would be required to satisfy the 85% test for the workers at \n     that worksite.\n       While the determination of whether noncontiguous locations \n     are reasonably proximate is a facts and circumstances \n     determination, certain situations will be deemed not to be \n     reasonably proximate. If the worksite is separated from all \n     other client worksites by at least 35 miles, it will not be \n     considered reasonably proximate. Thus, a client (or any \n     member of its controlled group) that maintains two worksites \n     that are more than 35 miles apart could treat the worksites \n     as separate for purposes of applying the 85% standard. Within \n     a 35-mile radius, a worksite will not be considered \n     reasonably proximate to another if the worksite operates in a \n     different industry or industries from other worksites within \n     the 35-mile radius pursuant to standards similar to those \n     established in Revenue Procedure 91-64 (relating to industry \n     classification codes). For example, a client that maintained \n     a restaurant and a hardware store in the same town could \n     treat them as separate worksites because they are in \n     different industries. In addition, based on all the facts \n     and circumstances, under rules prescribed by the IRS, a \n     worksite would not be reasonably proximate if it operates \n     independently for a bona fide business reason (that is \n     unrelated to employment taxes and employee benefits). For \n     example, a convenience store and a restaurant which have \n     no supervisory personnel in common but which are under \n     common ownership control could, under rules prescribed by \n     the IRS, be treated as different worksites. Similarly, two \n     noncontiguous wholesale and retail operations owned by the \n     same individual but which are operated independently \n     (including independent supervisory personnel) may, under \n     rules prescribed by the IRS, be determined to be not \n     reasonably proximate.\n       The 85% rule generally is intended to describe the typical, \n     non-abusive PEO arrangement whereby a business contracts with \n     a PEO to take over substantially all its workers at a \n     particular worksite. The 85% rule is intended to ensure that \n     the benefits of the bill are not available in any situation \n     in which a business uses a PEO arrangement to artificially \n     divide its workforce.\n\n\n                      cpeo employee benefit plans\n\n       To the extent consistent with the Internal Revenue Code and \n     corresponding provisions of other federal laws, the CPEO may \n     generally provide worksite employees with most types of \n     retirement plans or other employee benefit plans that the \n     client could provide. Worksite employees may not, however, be \n     offered a plan that the client would be prohibited from \n     offering on its own. For example, if the client is a state or \n     local government, worksite employees performing services for \n     that client may not be offered participation in a section \n     401(k) plan. Similarly, a CPEO may not maintain a plan that \n     it would be prohibited from offering on its own (e.g., a \n     section 403(b) plan). However, an eligible client could \n     maintain such a plan.\n       Size Limitations.--In general, employee benefit provisions \n     (in the Internal Revenue Code and in directly correlative \n     provisions in other Federal laws) that reference the size of \n     the employer or number of employees will generally be applied \n     based on the size or number of employees and worksite \n     employees of the CPEO. For example, worksite employees will \n     be entitled to COBRA health care continuation coverage even \n     if the client would have qualified for the small employer \n     exception to those rules. Similarly, a CPEO welfare benefit \n     plan will be treated as a single employer plan for purposes \n     of Internal Revenue Code section 419A(f)(6). Plan reporting \n     requirements are met at the CPEO level. However, a client \n     which could meet the size requirements for eligibility for an \n     MSA or a SIMPLE plan could contribute to such an arrangement \n     maintained by the CPEO.\n       Nondiscriminaiton Testing.--The legislation intends that \n     clients of a CPEO will not generally receive significantly \n     better or worse treatment with respect to coverage, \n     nondiscrimination or other Internal Revenue Code rules than \n     they would get outside of the CPEO arrangement. Consequently, \n     nondiscrimination and other rules of the Code relating to \n     retirement plans (including sections 401(a)(4), 401(a)(17), \n     401(a)(26), 401(k), 401(m), 410(b) and 416 and similar rules \n     applicable to welfare and fringe benefit plans such as \n     section 125) will generally be applied on a client-by-client \n     basis.\n       The portion of the CPEO plan covering worksite employees \n     with respect to a client will be tested taking into account \n     the worksite employees at a client location and all other \n     nonexcludable employees of the client taking into account \n     414(b), (c), (m), (n) (with respect to workers not otherwise \n     included as worksite employees) and (o), but one client's \n     worksite employees would not be included in applying the \n     coverage or other nondiscrimination rules (1) to portions of \n     the CPEO plan covering worksite employees of other clients, \n     (2) to the portion of the CPEO plan covering nonworksite \n     employees, (3) to other plans maintained by the CPEO (except \n     to the extent such plan covers worksite employees of the same \n     client), or (4) to other plans maintained by members of the \n     CPEO's controlled group.\n       The legislation also treats any worksite employees as ``per \n     se'' leased employees of the client, thus requiring clients \n     to include all worksite employees in plan testing. In \n     accordance with current leased employee rules, the client \n     would take into account CPEO plan contributions or benefits \n     made on behalf of worksite employees of that client. \n     Consistent with this treatment of worksite employees, the \n     client would be permitted to cover worksite employees under \n     any employee benefit plan maintained by the client and \n     compensation paid by the CPEO to worksite employees would be \n     treated as paid by the client for purposes of applying \n     applicable qualification tests.\n       For example, assume a CPEO maintained a plan covering \n     worksite employees performing services for Corporation X, \n     worksite employees performing services for Corporation Y, and \n     employees of the CPEO who are not worksite employees. In that \n     case the nondiscrimination tests would be applied separately \n     to the portions of the plan covering (1) worksite employees \n     performing services for Corporation X; (2) worksite employees \n     performing services for corporation Y, and (3) CPEO employees \n     who are not worksite employees, as if each of (1), (2), and \n     (3) were a separate plan. In addition, worksite employees \n     performing services for Corporation X, for example, would be \n     per se leased employees of Corporation X and thus would be \n     included in testing any other plans maintained by Corporation \n     X or any members of Corporation X's controlled group. \n     Similarly, the CPEO workforce (other than worksite employees) \n     will be treated as a separate employer for testing purposes \n     (and will\n\n[[Page S7895]]\n\n     be included in applying the nondiscrimination rules to any \n     plans maintained by the CPEO or members of its controlled \n     group).\n       In applying nondiscrimination rules to plans maintained by \n     other entities within the CPEO's controlled group for workers \n     who are not worksite employees, worksite employees will not \n     be taken into account. Thus, in the example above, worksite \n     employees performing services for Corporation X or \n     Corporation Y would not be taken into account in testing \n     plans maintained by other members of the CPEO's controlled \n     group.\n       For purposes of testing a particular client's portion of \n     the plan under the rules above, general rules applicable to \n     that client would apply as if the client maintained that \n     portion of the plan. Thus, if the terms of the benefits \n     available to the client's worksite employees satisfied the \n     requirements of the section 401(k) testing safe harbor, then \n     that client could take advantage of the safe harbor. \n     Similarly, a client that meets the eligibility criteria for a \n     SIMPLE 401(k) plan would be allowed to utilize the SIMPLE \n     rules to demonstrate compliance with the applicable \n     nondiscrimination rules for that client.\n       Application of certain other qualified plan and welfare \n     benefit plan rules will generally be determined as if the \n     client and the CPOE are a single employer (consistent with \n     the principle that the CPEO arrangement will not result in \n     better or worse treatment). Thus, there would be a single \n     annual limit under section 415. Section 415 will provide that \n     any cutbacks required as a result of the single annual limit \n     will be made in the client plan. Deduction limits and funding \n     requirements would apply at the CPEO level. In addition, if \n     the client portion of a plan is part of a top heavy group, \n     any required top heavy minimum contribution or benefit will \n     generally need to be made by the CPEO plan. There will be \n     complete ``crediting'' of service for all benefit purposes. \n     The ``break in service'' rules for plan vesting will be \n     applied with respect to worksite employees using rules \n     generally based on Code section 413.\n       The bill also provides the Secretary with the authority to \n     promulgate rules and regulations that streamline, to the \n     extent possible, the application of certain requirements, the \n     exchange of information between the client and the CPEO, and \n     the reporting and record keeping obligations of the CPEO with \n     respect to its employee benefit plans.\n       Worksite employees will not generally be entitled to \n     receive plan distributions of elective deferrals until the \n     worker leaves the CPEO group. In cases where a client \n     relationship terminates with a CPEO that maintains a plan, \n     the CPEO will be able to ``spin off'' the former client's \n     portion of the plan to a new or existing plan maintained by \n     the client. Where the terminated client does not establish a \n     plan or wish to maintain the client's portion of the CPEO \n     plan, the CPEO plan may distribute elective deferrals of \n     worksite employees associated with a terminated client only \n     in a direct rollover to an IRA designated by the worker. In \n     the event that no such IRA is designated before the second \n     anniversary of the termination of the CPEO/client \n     relationship the assets attributable to a client's worksite \n     employees may be distributed under the general plan terms \n     (and law) that applies to a distribution upon a separation \n     from service or severance from employment after that time.\n       Similar to IRS practice in multiple employer plans, \n     disqualification of the entire plan will occur if a \n     nondiscrimination failure occurs with respect to worksite \n     employees of a client and either that failure is not \n     corrected under one of the IRS correction programs or that \n     portion of the plan is not spun off and/or terminated. If \n     that portion of the plan is corrected or spun off and/or \n     terminated, then the failure of a CPEO retirement plan to \n     satisfy applicable nondiscrimination requirements with \n     respect to that client will not result in the \n     disqualification of the plan as applied to other clients. \n     Existing government programs for correcting violations would \n     be available to the CPEO for the plan and, in the case of \n     nondiscrimination failures tested at the client level, to the \n     client portion of the plan with the fee to be based on the \n     size of the affected client's portion of the plan. Moreover, \n     the CPEO plan will be treated as one plan for purposes of \n     obtaining a determination letter.\n\n\n                        employment tax liability\n\n       An entity that has been certified as a CPEO must accept \n     responsibility for employment taxes with respect to wages it \n     pays to worksite employees performing services for clients. \n     Such liability will be exclusive or primary, as provided \n     below. It is expected that the CPEO would (as provided by the \n     Secretary) be required, on an ongoing basis, to provide the \n     IRS with a list of clients for which employment tax liability \n     has been assumed and a list of clients for whom it no longer \n     has employment tax liability. Reporting and other \n     requirements that apply to an employer with respect to \n     employment taxes would generally apply to the CPEO for \n     remuneration remitted by the CPEO (as provided by the \n     Secretary). In addition, the remittance frequency of \n     employment taxes will be determined with reference to \n     collections and the liability of the CPEO.\n       Wages paid by the client during the calendar year prior to \n     the assumption of employment tax liability would be counted \n     towards the applicable FICA or FUTA tax wage base for the \n     year in determining the employment tax liability of the CPEO \n     (and vice versa). Exceptions to payments as wages or \n     activities as employment, and thus to the required payment of \n     employment taxes, are determined by reference to the client. \n     Also, for purposes of crediting state unemployment insurance \n     (SUI) taxes against FUTA tax liability, payments by the CPEO \n     (or transmitted by the CPEO for the client) with respect to \n     worksite employees would be taken into account. Thus, in \n     determining FUTA liability, CPEO's would be treated as the \n     employer for crediting SUI collection purposes on essentially \n     the same terms as they would be authorized to process wage \n     withholding, FICA and FUTA. The bill is, however, limited to \n     Federal law and does not address the issue of whether a CPEO \n     (i) would be eligible for successor status for SUI tax \n     collection or (ii) how the state experience rating formula \n     would be applied to the CPEO. Determinations with respect to \n     these issues will be made pursuant to state law.\n       A CPEO will have exclusive liability for employment taxes \n     with respect to wage payments made by the CPEO to worksite \n     employees (including owners of the client who are worksite \n     employees) if the CPEO meets the net worth requirement and, \n     at least quarterly, an examination level attestation by an \n     independent Certified Public Accountant attesting to the \n     adequate and timely payment of federal employment taxes has \n     been filed with the IRS.\n       The net worth requirement is satisfied if the CPEO's net \n     worth (less goodwill and other intangibles) is, on the last \n     day of the fiscal quarter preceding the date on which payment \n     is due and on the last day of the fiscal quarter in which the \n     payment is due, at least:\n       $50,000 if the number of worksite employees is fewer than \n     500;\n       $100,000 if the number of worksite employees is 500 to \n     1,499;\n       $150,000 if the number of worksite employees is 1,500 to \n     2,499;\n       $200,000 if the number of worksite employees is 2,500 to \n     3,999; and\n       $250,000 if the number of worksite employees is more than \n     3,999;\n       In the alternative, the net worth requirement could be \n     satisfied through a bond (for employment taxes up to the \n     applicable net worth amount) similar to an appeal bond filed \n     with the Tax Court by a taxpayer or by an insurance bond \n     satisfying similar rules.\n       Within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter, the \n     CPEO will provide the IRS with an examination level \n     attestation from an independent certified public accountant \n     that states that the accountant has found no material reason \n     to question the CPEO's assertions with respect to the \n     adequacy of federal employment tax payments for the fiscal \n     quarter. In the event that such attestation is not provided \n     on a timely basis, the CPEO will cease to have exclusive \n     liability with respect to employment taxes (regardless of the \n     net worth or bonding requirement) effective the due date for \n     the attestation. Exclusive liability will not be restored \n     until the first day of the quarter following two successive \n     quarters for which an examination level attestations were \n     timely filed. In addition, the Secretary will have the \n     authority, under final regulations, to provide limits on a \n     CPEO's exclusive liability for employment taxes with respect \n     to a particular customer in cases where there is an undue and \n     large risk with respect to the ultimate collection of those \n     taxes.\n       For any tax period for which any of these criteria for \n     exclusive liability for employment taxes are not satisfied, \n     or to the extent the client has not made adequate payments to \n     the CPEO for the payment of wages, taxes, and benefits, the \n     CPEO will have primary liability and the client will have \n     secondary liability for employment taxes. In that instance, \n     the IRS will assess and attempt to collect unpaid employment \n     taxes against the CPEO first and may not generally take any \n     action against a client with respect to liability for \n     employment taxes until at least 45 days following the date \n     the IRS mails a notice and demand to the CPEO. For this \n     purpose, the statute of limitations for assessment or \n     collection against the client will not expire until one year \n     after the date that is 45 days after mailing of notice and \n     demand to the CPEO (in the same manner as transferee \n     liability under section 6901(c)). With respect to employment \n     taxes attributable to periods during which a CPEO has \n     liability, the client will be liable to the IRS for taxes, \n     penalties (applicable to client actions or to the time \n     periods after assessment of the client for the taxes), and \n     interest (with such liability to be reduced by amounts paid \n     to the IRS by the CPEO that are allocable, under rules to be \n     determined by the IRS, to the client).\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       These provisions will be effective on January 1, 2002. The \n     IRS will be directed to establish the PEO certification \n     program at least three months prior to the effective date. \n     The bill directs the IRS to accommodate transfers of assets \n     in existing plans maintained by a CPEO or CPEO clients into a \n     new plan (or amended plan) meeting the requirements of the \n     legislation (e.g., client-by-client nondiscrimination \n     testing) without regard to whether or not such plans might \n     fail the exclusive benefit rule because worksite employees \n     might be considered common law employees of the client.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nintroducing the ``Rural Health Care in the 21st Century Act.'' I am \npleased to have worked with my colleagues in crafting this bill that \nwill address the\n\n[[Page S7896]]\n\nneeds of rural providers and beneficiaries as we begin the new century.\n  This legislation establishes a grant and loan program to assist rural \nproviders in acquiring the necessary technologies to improve patient \nsafety and meet the continually changing records management \nrequirements. Rural hospitals and other providers do not have the \ncapital needed to purchase these expensive technologies nor the \nresources to train their staff. This new program will enable these \nproviders to purchase such crucial equipment as patient tracking \nsystems, bar code systems to avoid drug errors and software equipped \nwith artificial intelligence.\n  Another reason this legislation is so important is because it will \nbring equity to the Medicare Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) \nprogram, which has been inherently biased against rural providers since \nit was implemented in 1986. The premise of this program is to give \nhospitals that provide a substantial amount of care to low-income \npatients additional funding to assist with the higher costs associated \nwith caring for this population.\n  Mr. President, the current DSH program does almost nothing for rural \nhospitals because different eligibility requirements have been \nestablished for rural and urban providers. To qualify for the increased \npayments the DSH program provides, urban hospitals are required to \ndemonstrate that 15 percent of their patient load consists of Medicaid \npatients and Medicare patients eligible for Supplemental Security \nIncome. However, rural hospitals must meet a higher threshold of 45 \npercent. Mr. President, there is no justification for this inequity. \nOur bill will level the playing field by applying the same eligibility \nthreshold currently enjoyed by urban hospitals to all rural hospitals \nas well. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission this \nreform will open the door for 55 percent of all rural hospitals to \nbenefit from the DSH program--a significant increase over the 15.6 \npercent of rural hospitals currently participating.\n  The ``Rural Health Care in the 21st Century Act'' also addresses \nother inequities faced by rural providers because federal regulators do \nnot adequately reflect the unique circumstances of delivering health \ncare in rural America. This bill provides rural home health agencies \nwith a 10 percent bonus payment as they have average per episode costs \nthat are 20 percent higher than urban agencies.\n  Rural Health Clinics and Critical Access Hospitals are a key \ncomponent of maintaining access to primary and emergency services in \nrural communities. This legislation makes modifications to the Balanced \nBudget Act to ensure these providers will continue to be an integral \npart of the rural health care delivery system.\n  Mr. President, I believe this bill is an important step in ensuring \nrural providers are treated equally under federal programs. This \nequalization must be accomplished so we can guarantee that rural \nMedicare beneficiaries have the same choices and access to services as \ntheir urban counterparts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. DeWine, Mr. \n        Kerrey, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Byrd, and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2982. A bill to enhance international conservation, to promote the \nrole of carbon sequestration as a means of slowing the building of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and to reward and encourage \nvoluntary, pro-active environmental efforts on the issue of global \nclimate change; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            International Carbon Sequestration Incentive Act\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nInternational Carbon Sequestration Incentive Act. I am joined by \nSenators Daschle, DeWine, Bob Kerrey, Grassley and Byrd.\n  Environmental issues have traditionally been filled with \ncontroversy--pitting beneficial environmental measures against hard-\nworking small business and state interests. It is unfortunate that the \natmosphere surrounding environmental debate is filled with accusations \nof blame rather than basic problem-solving.\n  From listening to the public discourse concerning environmental \nissues, one would thing there is no other choice but to handicap our \nbooming economy in order to have a clean environment, despite the fact \nthat pollution is often, unfortunately, an unavoidable consequence of \nmeeting public needs.\n  Mr. President, I stand here today to illustrate that there is a \nbetter way to deal with important environmental concerns. There is a \nway to encourage the best rather than expecting the worst. There is a \nway to create environmental incentives and environmental markets, \nrather than only environmental regulations. There is a way to chip away \nat environmental challenges, rather than demagoging an ``all or \nnothing'' stance.\n  This bill--the International Carbon Sequestration Incentive Act, \ntakes a pro-active, incentive-driven approach to one of the most \ndifficult environmental issues of our time--global climate change.\n  Specifically, this bill provides investment tax credits for groups \nwho invest in international carbon sequestration projects--including \ninvestments which prevent rainforest destruction and projects which \nreforest abandoned native forest areas. These projects will reduce the \namount of carbon dioxide emitted into the air--helping to offset \nclimate change since carbon dioxide is one of the main greenhouse \ngases.\n  This bill achieves these environmental benefits by promoting carbon \nsequestration--the process of converting carbon dioxide in the \natmosphere into carbon which is stored in plants, trees and soils.\n  Under this bill, eligible projects can receive funding at a rate of \n$2.50 per verified ton of carbon stored or sequestered--up to 50% of \nthe total project cost. The minimum length of these projects is 30 \nyears and the Implementing Panel can only approve $200 million in tax \ncredits each year.\n  Why do this? Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas believed to \ncontribute to global warming. While there is debate over the role in \nwhich human activity plays in speeding up the warming process, there is \nbroad consensus that there are increased carbon levels in the \natmosphere today.\n  Until now, the only real approach seriously considered to address \nclimate change was an international treaty which calls for emission \nlimits on carbon dioxide--which would mean limiting the amount that \ncomes from your car, your business and your farm. This treaty--the \nKyoto treaty, also favored exempting developing nations from emission \nlimits--putting the U.S. economy at a distinct disadvantage. \nApproaching the issue of climate change in this fashion would be very \ncostly and would not respond to the global nature of this problem.\n  Instead, my approach encourages offsetting greenhouse gases through \nimproved land management and conservation--and by engaging developing \nnations rather than cutting them out of the process.\n  In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, sponsored projects \nunder this bill will also help to preserve the irreplaceable \nbiodiversity that flourishes in the Earth's tropical rain forests and \nother sensitive eco-systems. In addition to diverse plant life, these \nprojects will be protecting countless endangered and rare species.\n  This bill requires investors to work closely with foreign \ngovernments, non-governmental organizations and indigenous peoples to \nfind the capital necessary to set aside some of the last great \nresources of the planet. Rain forests have been called the lungs of the \nEarth--helping to filter out pollution and provide sanctuary for \nnumerous pharmaceutical finds which may one day cure many of our human \ndiseases.\n  This bill rewards the partnership and pro-active vision of companies \nthat want to be part of the solution to climate change. We are lucky in \nthe fact that private industry is already looking at this issue and \nworking to find a way to contribute. An example of what this bill would \npromote can be seen by looking at the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park \nin Bolivia.\n  As you can see by looking at these photos [DISPLAY FOREST SCENES], \nNoel Kempff is a beautiful, biodiverse part of the world. This park \nspans nearly 4 million acres in Bolivia, hosts several hundred species \nof rare and endangered wildlife--including 130 species of mammals, 620 \nspecies of birds and 70 species of reptiles--not to mention 110 \ndifferent species of orchids and grasses.\n\n[[Page S7897]]\n\n  This park was in direct danger of deforestation. The land would have \nbeen cleared and eventually turned into large commercial farming \noperations. The loss of this park would have led to carbon dioxide \nemissions of between 25-36 million tons as well as increased commercial \nagricultural competition.\n  Instead, the Bolivian government came together with The Nature \nConservancy, American Electric Power and other investors to preserve \nthe park and conduct extensive verification of the carbon being stored \nin trees and soils of the now protected area.\n  Companies like American Electric Power, BP Amoco and PacifiCorp want \nto invest in projects like Noel Kempff because they want to promote the \nrole of carbon sequestration as a means to combat climate change. These \ncompanies have taken a big step in contributing to the solution--think \nhow much more good they, and other companies, could do if there were \nincentives to encourage this activity.\n  In the U.S., we are lucky enough to have programs like the \nConservation Reserve Program and federal parks--which help preserve \nsome of the natural resources of this great nation. Unfortunately, \ndeveloping countries do not have access to the kind of capital it takes \nto make similar investments in their own countries. It is therefore, a \nworthy investment in the world environment--since climate change is a \nglobal problem, to chip away at this problem by doing what we know \nhelps reduce pollution and greenhouse gases: planting and preserving \ntrees.\n  This bill is designed to encourage more participation in projects \nlike the Noel Kempff Park. By using limited and very targeted tax \ncredits, we have an opportunity as a nation--to take a leadership role \non climate change without crushing our own economy. This bill also \nfurthers the goal of including developing countries in the climate \nchange issue--since any agreement to reduce greenhouse gases must \nultimately include these areas which will become the largest emitters.\n  Mr. President, I do not pretend that this bill will resolve the \nclimate change issue. That is not my intent. Rather, this bill takes \nthe view that where we do agree that good can be achieved--we should \nmove forward. It is my hope that this bill will contribute to the \nsolution on climate change and help to re-shape the way we view \nenvironmental problems.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2983. A bill to provide for the return of land to the Government \nof Guam, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                   the guam omnibus opportunities act\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Guam Omnibus \nOpportunities Act, which seeks to address important issues to the \npeople of Guam dealing with land, economic development and social \nissues. On July 25, the House passed similar legislation, H.R. 2462, \nwhich was introduced by Congressman Robert Underwood, the Delegate from \nGuam. During the 105th Congress, the Senate passed similar provisions \nof H.R. 2462 as part of S. 210, an omnibus territories bill.\n  There are several provisions of the Guam Omnibus Opportunities Act. \nFirst, Section 2 of the bill provides a process for the Government of \nGuam to receive lands from the U.S. government for specified public \npurposes by giving Guam the right of first refusal for declared federal \nexcess lands by the General Services Administration prior to it being \nmade available to any other federal agency. It also provides for a \nprocess for the Government of Guam and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService to engage in negotiations on the future ownership and \nmanagement of declared federal excess lands within the Guam National \nWildlife Refuge.\n  Section 3 provides the Government of Guam with the authority to tax \nforeign investors at the same rates as states under U.S. tax treaties \nwith foreign countries since Guam cannot change the withholding tax \nrate on its own under current law. Under the U.S. Internal Revenue \nCode, there is a 30 percent withholding tax rate for foreign investors \nin the United States. Since Guam's tax law ``mirrors'' the rate \nestablished under the U.S. Code, the standard rate of foreign investors \nin Guam is 30 percent. It is a common feature in U.S. tax treaties for \ncountries to negotiate lower withholding rates on investment returns. \nUnfortunately, while there are different definitions for the term \n``United States'' under these treaties, Guam is not included. This \nomission has adversely impacted Guam since 75 percent of Guam's \ncommercial development is funded by foreign investors. As an example, \nwith Japan, the U.S. rate for foreign investors is 10 percent. This \nmeans that while Japanese investors are taxed at a 10 percent \nwithholding tax rate on their investments in the fifty states, those \nsame investors are taxed at a 30 percent withholding rate on Guam.\n  While the long-term solution is for U.S. negotiators to include Guam \nin the definition of the term ``United States'' for all future tax \ntreaties, the immediate solution is to amend the Organic Act of Guam \nand authorize the Government of Guam to tax foreign investors at the \nsame rates as the fifty states. It is my understanding that all other \nU.S. territories have remedied this problem in one way or another. \nTherefore, Guam is the only U.S. jurisdiction in the country that is \nnot extended tax equity for foreign investors.\n  With an unemployment rate of 15 percent, Guam continues to struggle \neconomically due to the Asian financial crisis. That is why I believe \nit is vitally important for the federal government to assist Guam in \nstimulating its economy through sound federal policies and technical \nassistance. This section would greatly assist the Government of Guam in \npromoting economic development on the island and would provide long \nneeded tax equity.\n  Section 4 considers Guam within the U.S. Customs zone in the \ntreatment of betel nuts, which are part of Chamorro tradition and \nculture. While betel nuts are grown in the United States, the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) has an important alert for betel nuts from \nforeign countries in place due to the influx of betel nuts from Asian \ncountries for commercial consumption and the FDA's contention that the \nbetel nut is ``adulterated.'' This means an automatic detention of \nbetel nuts by U.S. Customs agents when entering the United States. \nAlthough Guam is a U.S. territory, Guam is considered to be outside the \nU.S. Customs zone. Betel nuts grown in Guam, therefore, are subject to \nthe FDA ban in the same manner as foreign countries. This section \nnarrowly applies to Guam, limits use to personal consumption, and \nensure that the FDA ban against foreign countries remains in place.\n  Section 5 empowers the governors of the territories and the State of \nHawaii to report to the Secretary of the Interior on the financial and \nsocial impacts of the Compacts of Free Association on their respective \njurisdictions and requires that the Secretary forward Administration \ncomments and recommendations on the report to Congress. This is an \nimportant issue to the State of Hawaii as the numbers of migrants to \nHawaii from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States \nof Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau continue to grow. The State of \nHawaii has spent well over $14 million in public funds in the past year \nalone, with most of the funds being spent on our educational and health \ncare systems.\n  Under the compact agreements, the Federal government made clear that \nit would compensate jurisdictions affected, yet the State of Hawaii has \nnot received federal funding since the implementation of these \nagreements. This section seeks to improve the reporting requirements \nfor Compact Impact Aid to address this situation.\n  Section 6 establishes a five-member Guam War Claims Review Commission \nto be appointed by the Secretary of the Interior. The goal of the \nCommission is to review the facts and circumstances surrounding U.S. \nrestitution to Guamanians who suffered compensable injury during the \noccupation of Guam by Japan during World War II. Compensable injury \nincludes death, personal injury, or forced labor, forced march, or \ninternment. The Commission would review the relevant historical facts \nand determine the eligible claimants, the eligibility requirements, and \nthe total amount necessary for compensation, and report its findings \nand recommendations for action to Congress nine months after the \nCommission is established.\n  The 1951 Treaty of Peace between the U.S. and Japan effectively \nbarred\n\n[[Page S7898]]\n\nclaims by U.S. citizens against Japan. As a consequence, the U.S. \ninherited these claims, which was acknowledged by Secretary of State \nJohn Foster Dulles when the issue was raised during consideration of \nthe treaty before the Committee on Foreign Relations in 1952.\n  Considerable historical information indicates that the United States \nintended to remedy the issue of war restitution for the people of Guam. \nIn 1945, the Guam Meritorious Claims Act was enacted which authorized \nthe Navy to adjudicate and settle war claims in Guam for property \ndamage for a period of one year. Claims in access of $5,000 for \npersonal injury or death were to be forwarded to Congress. \nUnfortunately, the Act never fulfilled its intended purposes due to the \nlimited time frame for claims and the preoccupation of the local \npopulation with recovery from the war, resettlement of their homes, and \nrebuilding their lives.\n  On March 25, 1947, the Hopkins Commission, a civilian commission \nappointed by the Navy Secretary, issued a report which revealed the \nflaws of the 1945 Guam Meritorious Claims Act and recommended that the \nAct be amended to provide on the spot settlement and payment of all \nclaims, both property and for the death and personal injury.\n  Despite the recommendations of the Hopkins Commission, the U.S. \ngovernment failed to remedy the flaws of the Guam Meritorious Act when \nit enacted the War Claims Act of 1948, legislation which provided \ncompensations for U.S. citizens who were victims of the Japanese war \neffort during World War II. Guamanians were U.S. nationals at the time \nof the enactment of the War Claims Act, thereby making them ineligible \nfor compensation. In 1950, with the enactment of the Organic Act of \nGuam, Guamanians became U.S. citizens.\n  In 1962, Congress again attempted to address the remaining \ncircumstances of U.S. citizens and nationals that had not received \nreparations from previous enacted laws. Once again, however, the \nGuamanians were inadvertently made ineligible because policymakers \nassumed that the War Claims Act of 1948 included them. Section 6 brings \nclosure to this longstanding issue.\n  In summary, Mr. President, the Guam Omnibus Opportunities Act will go \na long way toward resolving issues that the Federal Government has been \nworking on with the Government of Guam on land, economic development \nand social issues. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to resolve these issues to assist Guam in achieving greater \neconomic self-sufficiency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CONRAD:\n  S. 2984. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and to \nprovide a refundable caregivers tax credit; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              long-term caregivers assistance act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Long-Term \nCaregivers Assistance Act of 2000, a proposal that would provide much \nneeded assistance to individuals with long-term care needs and their \ncaregivers.\n  Nationwide, more than 8 million individuals require some level of \nassistance with activities of daily living. Over the next 30 years, \nthis number is expected to increase significantly as our nation \nexperiences an unprecedented growth in its elderly population.\n  We know that for many people leaving their homes to obtain care is \nnot their first choice--the cost of nursing home care can be \nprohibitive, and such care often takes individuals away from their \ncommunities. While federal support for long-term care is primarily \nspent on nursing home services, many people receive assistance with \ntheir long-term care needs in the home from their families, often \nwithout the help of public assistance or private insurance.\n  Nationwide, nearly 37 million individuals provide unpaid care to \nfamily members of all ages with functional or cognitive impairments. In \nmy state, there are about 61,000 individuals providing informal \ncaregiving services.\n  Unfortunately, the need for long-term care can cause substantial \nfinancial burdens on many individuals and their families. According to \na recent study, almost two-thirds of those serving as caregivers suffer \nfinancial setbacks--setbacks that can total thousands of dollars in \nlost wages and other benefits over a caregiver's lifetime. This is a \nburden that caregivers and their families should not have to bear \nalone.\n  For this reason, I am introducing this proposal to provide a $2,000 \ntax credit that could be used by individuals with substantial care \nneeds or by their caregivers.\n  Taxpayers who have long-term care needs, or who care for others with \nsuch needs, may not have the same ability to pay taxes as other \ntaxpayers--a reasonable and legitimate concern in a tax system based on \nthe principle of ability-to-pay. Providing a tax credit is an equitable \nand efficient way of helping caregivers and individuals with long-term \ncare needs meet their formal and informal costs.\n  I recognize that this tax credit is only a piece of the long-term \ncare puzzle--but I believe it is an important piece. This credit could \nbe used to help pay for prescription drugs or other out-of-pocket \nexpenses. It could be used to pay for some formal home care services. \nIt could also be used to help family members offset some of the \nexpenses they incur in caregiving.\n  We must act now to address the long-term care needs of our nation. I \nurge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 2985. A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to \nauthorize the Commodity Credit Corporation to reallocate certain \nunobligated funds from the export enhancement program to other \nagricultural trade development and assistance programs; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n     providing school lunches to hungry children--the agricultural \n      flexibility in export development and assistance act of 2000\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if you had happened to be in the Senate \nDining Room a few months ago, you might have seen a group of people \nhaving lunch and wondered what in the world would gather Ambassador \nGeorge McGovern, Senators Bob Dole and Ted Kennedy, Agriculture \nSecretary Dan Glickman, Congressmen Jim McGovern and Tony Hall and \nmyself all at one table.\n  The answer to your question is that we were working together on a \nbipartisan initiative that could have a positive impact on children \naround the world and be of great benefit to America's farmers.\n  Former Senator and now Ambassador McGovern has advocated an idea to \nemulate one of the most beneficial programs ever launched on behalf of \nchildren in this country--the school lunch program.\n  He has worked with Senator Dole and others to establish an \ninternational school lunch program and President Clinton has jump-\nstarted this proposal with his announcement that the United States will \nprovide $300 million in surplus commodities for the initiative.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation to provide a long-term funding \nsource for international school feeding programs that will allow such \nprograms to expand and reach more kids.\n  Today there are more than 300 million children throughout the world--\nmore kids than the entire population of the United States--who go \nthrough the day and then to bed at night hungry. Some 130 million of \nthese kids don't go to school right now, mainly because their parents \nneed them to stay at home or work to pitch in any way that they can.\n  In January of this year, I traveled to sub-Saharan Africa, the \nepicenter of the AIDS crisis, with more than two-thirds of AIDS cases \nworldwide. There I saw first-hand the horrible impact AIDS is having on \nthat continent. I met a woman in Uganda named Mary Nalongo Nassozzi, \nwho is a 63-year-old widow.\n  All of her children died from AIDS and she has created an \n``orphanage'' with 16 of her grandchildren now living in her home. \nPeople like Mary need our help to keep these kids in school.\n  Linking education and nutrition is not a new idea. Private voluntary \norganizations like CARE, Catholic Relief Services, ADRA, World Vision, \nSave the Children and Food for the Hungry are already helping kids with \neducation, mother/child nutrition programs and school feeding programs.\n\n[[Page S7899]]\n\nThese organizations and the World Food Program operate programs in more \nthan 90 countries at this time, but typically can only target the \npoorest children in the poorest districts of the country.\n  Ambassador McGovern, Senator Dole, myself and others have called for \nan expanded effort, and as I noted earlier, President Clinton has \nresponded. I applaud the President for the program he announced last \nSunday in Okinawa. This $300 million initiative is expected to help \nserve a solid, nutritious meal to nine million children every day they \ngo to school.\n  Think about it: for only 10 cents a day for each meal, we can feed a \nhungry child and help that child learn. With what you or I pay for a \nBig Mac, fries and a soft drink, we could afford to feed two classrooms \nof kids in Ghana or Nepal.\n\n\n                The Benefits of School Feeding Programs\n\n  While we need to consider the costs of an international school \nfeeding program, I think we should also look at the benefits.\n  Malnourished children find it difficult to concentrate and make poor \nstudents. But these school feeding programs not only help \nconcentration, they have many benefits, including increased attendance \nrates and more years of school attendance, improved girls' enrollment \nrates, improved academic performance, lower malnutrition rates, greater \nattention spans and later ages for marriage and childbirth.\n  These benefits ripple in many directions: higher education levels for \ngirls and later marriage for women help slow population growth; greater \neducation levels overall help spur economic development; and giving \nneedy children a meal at school could also help blunt the terrible \nimpact AIDS is having throughout Africa, where there are more than 10 \nmillion AIDS orphans who no longer have parents to feed and care for \nthem.\n\n\n                           domestic benefits\n\n  Some will question our involvement in overseas feeding programs, so \nlet me describe what we're doing at home and how we benefit from these \nefforts.\n  This year, we're spending more than $20 billion in our food stamp \nprogram. More than half of this amount goes to kids. We're also \nspending over $9 billion for school child nutrition programs, and more \nthan $4 billion for the WIC program. While this sounds like a lot, we \nneed to do more. Many people who are eligible for these programs are \nnot aware of it and the Department of Agriculture must do a better job \ngetting the word out. Still, these figures put the costs of an \ninternational school feeding effort in perspective: they will be a \nsmall fraction of what we're spending here at home.\n\n  Through our international efforts, we share some of what we have \nlearned with less fortunate countries. But we also benefit.\n  An international school lunch program will provide a much-needed \nboost to our beleaguered farm economy, where surpluses and low prices \nhave been hurting farmers for the third year in a row. Congress has \nprovided more than $20 billion in emergency aid to farmers over the \nlast three years. Buying farm products for this proposal would boost \nprices in the marketplace, helping U.S. farmers and needy kids in the \nprocess. It is a common-sense proposal for helping our farmers, and the \nright thing to do.\n  Second, the education of children leads to economic development, \nwhich in turn increases demand for U.S. products in the future. Some of \nthe largest food aid recipients in the 1950s are now our largest \ncommercial customers.\n  Finally, let's consider the positive foreign policy implications of \nthis measure. It helps fulfill the commitments we made in Rome in 1996 \nto work to improve world food security and helps satisfy the commitment \nto net food importing developing countries we made in Marrakesh in 1995 \nat the conclusion of the Uruguay Round. It also supports the goals of \n``Education for All'' made in April in Dakar to achieve universal \naccess to primary education.\n  It goes beyond demonstrating our commitment to summit texts and \ndocuments and has a real impact on our national security. When people \nare getting enough to eat, internal instability is less likely. Most of \nthe conflicts taking place right now around the world are related at \nleast in part to food insecurity.\n\n\n                  we can't and shouldn't do this alone\n\n  The United States shouldn't go it alone. This needs to be an \ninternational effort. If the full costs for this program are shared \nfairly among developed countries, as we do now for United Nations \npeacekeeping efforts or humanitarian food aid relief efforts, then our \nresource commitments will be multiplied many times over. I encourage \nthe Administration to continue its efforts to gain multilateral support \nfor this initiative.\n  We should also seek the involvement and commitment of America's \ncorporations and philanthropic organizations. Companies can contribute \nbooks and school supplies, computer equipment, kitchen equipment, \nconstruction supplies and management expertise.\n\n\n                          proposed legislation\n\n  The food aid laws we already have in place allow USDA and USAID to \nstart up these kinds of programs, but resources are limited.\n  The President's initiative is a concrete first step in the effort to \nassure that every kid is going to school, and that every kid going to \nschool has a meal.\n\n  However--and this is not to detract in any way from the important \naction he has taken--the President's initiative relies on surplus \ncommodities. That is a sensible approach at this time. But we may not \nalways have an overabundance. We all hope for and are working for an \nend to the farm crisis, which means the quantity of surplus commodities \nwill decline. We need to look at how we will continue to pay for this \nprogram in the future as it helps more children and as surplus \ncommodities dwindle.\n  The legislation I am introducing today, the Agricultural Flexibility \nin Export Development and Assistance Act of 2000, addresses the longer-\nterm funding issue.\n  My legislation authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to reallocate \nunspent Export Enhancement Program (EEP) money to school feeding and \nother food aid programs. When EEP was first authorized, one of its main \npurposes was to increase demand for U.S. agricultural commodities--to \nput money in the wallets of farmers by promoting overseas demand for \nour products. Because U.S. commodity prices have come down, it hasn't \nbeen used to any major extent since 1995. We are sitting on a pot of \nmoney, authorized but not being spent, while the EU spends over $5 \nbillion annually on similar programs. My legislation would free up the \nSecretary of Agriculture to devote those funds to school feeding and \nother food aid programs.\n  Because I recognize some would like to see a portion of the surplus \nEEP funds to be spent on export development programs, my bill also \npermits a portion of the funds to be spent on export promotion.\n  To maintain flexibility while ensuring our food aid goals are \naddressed, the measure would require that a minimum of 75 percent of \nreallocated EEP funding be spent for either PL480 (Title I or Title II) \nor Food for Progress food aid, with at least half of this amount \ndevoted to school feeding or child nutrition programs. It would allow \nup to 20 percent of the reallocated funds to be spent on the Market \nAccess Program to promote agricultural exports, and a maximum of five \npercent to be spent on the Foreign Market Development (Cooperator) \nprogram.\n  To ensure new artificial restraints don't block our intention in this \nlegislation, the measure also raises the caps currently in place \nregarding the quantity of food aid permitted under Food for Progress \nand the amount that may be used to pay for the administrative expenses \nassociated with the program.\n  Both the Coalition for Food Aid and Friends of the World Food Program \nsupport this measure. Major commodity groups such as the American \nSoybean Association and the National Corn Growers Association also \nsupport it.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this \nlegislation and in support of the broader effort to respond to the \nnutrition needs of 300 million children, 130 million of whom are not \nbut could and should be in school. With our help, these statistics can \nchange.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Just \nOpportunities in Bidding (JOB) Act which is\n\n[[Page S7900]]\n\nnecessary to ensure that companies who seek to do business with our \ngovernment are treated fairly. The JOB Act would prohibit the \nimplementation of proposed regulations which would dramatically amend \nthe Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n  I have many concerns about these proposed regulations, but I am \ndeeply troubled by the discrimination which it will inevitably foster \nwhen implemented. The regulations will de facto amend many of our \nnation's laws and give government contracting officers, who are not \ntrained in the interpretation of these laws, unfettered discretion to \ndeny contracts to companies based on any alleged violation of any labor \nand employment, environmental, antitrust, tax, or consumer protection \nlaws over the three years immediately preceding the contract. This is a \ndramatic change from the current requirements of the Federal \nAcquisition Regulation which requires that violations must be \nsubstantial to trigger denial of contract eligibility and does not \nextend to unrelated, past violations.\n  The proposed regulations would also allow for the denial of contracts \non the basis of a mere complaint issued by a federal agency, which \noften are based solely upon information provided by outside, interested \nparties. Moreover, the proposal's terminology is vague and extremely \nsubjective--placing tremendous and unprecedented discretion in the \nhands of federal contracting officers. That is discretion that they do \nnot need nor qualified to exercise. Terms such as ``legal compliance'' \nby bidding parties are well-intentioned, I am sure, however, I view \nthis as a trial lawyer's greatest wish come true. What does ``legal \ncompliance'' mean? Does it mean that employers must ensure that they \nare 100 percent in compliance with all of the pertinent laws? Can even \nthe most prudent employers guarantee that they and their worksites are \n100 percent in compliance with all federal tax, labor, environmental, \nand anti-trust statutes and regulations? That's certainly a question \nwhich many creative lawyers will undoubtedly rush to answer in \ncourthouses across our nation.\n  This proposal is in direct contradiction to existing policy which is \nto fulfill governmental needs for goods and services at a fair and \nreasonable price from contractors who are technically qualified and \nable to perform the contract. Our current policy is based upon a good \nbalance between our desire to get the best value for our constituents' \ntaxdollars while being fair to all qualified companies who want to have \nthe opportunity to provide their goods and services to the government. \nThe proposed regulations will result in the unjustified exclusion of \nmany of these companies from the bidding process and will result in \nless competition, reduced job opportunities for many employees--\nespecially small businesses--and less value for our constituents' \ntaxdollars.\n  As elected representatives of our constituents, we cannot condone \nthis and as a legislative body we must refuse to allow a continuation \nof this Administration's legislation by regulation. The JOB Act would \nrequire the GAO to thoroughly examine this issue and report back to \nCongress with its findings. To me, this is a sound and reasonable \napproach rather than a political one. If you agree that the proposed \nregulations--and the millions of American workers, employers, and \ntaxpayers that they will profoundly affect--deserve more thorough \nconsideration, join me in my effort to enact the JOB Act.\n  I ask consent that the text of the bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \npromote access to health care services in rural areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           rural health care in the 21st century act of 2000\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural \nHealth Care in the 21st Century Act of 2000. This legislation will \nimprove access to technology necessary to improve rural health care and \nexpand access to quality health care in rural areas.\n  The future of health care in this country is being challenged by a \nvariety of factors. The growing pains associated with managed care, an \nincreasing elderly population and the drive to ensure the solvency of \nthe federal Medicare Trust Fund are just a few of the factors placing \npressure on health care facilities and health care providers across the \ncountry. Small, rural hospitals that provide services to a relatively \nlow volume of patients are faced with even greater challenges in this \nenvironment.\n  The bill I am introducing today takes critical steps to improve \naccess to high technology in rural areas and establishes a new high \ntechnology acquisition grant and loan program to improve patient safety \nand outcomes. At the same time hospitals need to update equipment, \ncomply with new regulatory requirements and join the effort to reduce \nmedical errors, many hospitals are finding it difficult to access the \nfinancial backing necessary to acquire the telecommunications equipment \nnecessary to develop innovative solutions. This bill establishes a 5-\nyear grant program through the Office of Rural Health Policy that \nallows hospitals, health care centers and related organizations to \napply for matching grants or loans up to $100,000 to purchase the \nadvanced technologies necessary to improve patient safety and keep pace \nwith the changing records management requirements of the 21st Century.\n  This bill also increases Disproportionate Share Hospitals payments to \nrural hospitals. The Medicare DSH adjustment is based on a complex \nformula and the hospital's percentage of low-income patients. This \npercentage of low-income patients is different for each hospital, \ndepending on where the hospital is located and the number of beds in \nthe hospital. This bill establishes one formula to distribute payments \nto all hospitals covered by the inpatient PPS. This will give rural \nhospitals an equal opportunity to qualify for the DSH adjustment.\n  Twenty-five percent of our nation's senior citizens live in rural \nareas where access to modern health care services is often lacking. \nTelehealth technologies have evolved significantly and can serve to \nconnect rural patients to the health care providers that they need. \nThis bill includes provisions of S. 2505, a telehealth bill introduced \nby my colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords. These provisions \naddress eight areas of Medicare reimbursement policy that need \nimprovement. It eliminates requirements for fee-sharing between \nproviders and provides a standard professional fee to the health care \nprovider who delivers the care. The site where the patient is presented \nis made eligible for a standard facility fee. The requirement for a \ntelepresenter is\n\n[[Page S7901]]\n\neliminated and the codes that can be billed for are expanded to reflect \ncurrent practice. All rural counties and urban HPSAs are covered by \nthis legislation and demonstration projects are established to access \nreimbursement for store and forward activities. Also, the law \nis clarified to allow for home health agencies to incorporate \ntelehomecare into their care plans where appropriate.\n\n  The Health Care Financing Administration is currently administering \nfive telemedicine demonstration projects. This provision extends these \nprojects an additional two years to give the projects adequate time to \nproduce useful data.\n  The Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility Program established by the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 allows rural hospitals to be reclassified \nas limited service facilities, known as Critical Access Hospitals. \nCritical Access Hospitals are important components of the rural health \ncare infrastructure. They are working to provide quality health care \nservices in sparsely populated areas of the country. However, they are \nrestricted by burdensome regulations and inadequate Medicare payments. \nIn addition to reduced staffing requirements, Congress intended to \nreimburse CAH inpatient and outpatient hospital services on the basis \nof reasonable costs. This legislation exempts Medicare swing beds in \nCAHs for the Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Prospective Payment System \n(PPS) and reimburses based on reasonable costs, and provides reasonable \ncost payment for ambulance services and home health services in CAHs.\n  In addition, this legislation directs the Secretary of HHS to \nestablish a procedure to ensure that a single FI will provide services \nto all CAHs and allows CAHs to choose between two options for payment \nfor outpatient services: (1) reasonable costs for facility services, or \n(2) an all-inclusive rate which combines facility and professional \nservices.\n  This bill permanently guarantees pre-Balanced Budget Act payment \nlevels for outpatient services provided by rural hospitals with under \n100 beds, modifies the 50 bed exemption language and for Rural Health \nClinics allows RHCs to qualify as long as their average daily patient \ncensus does not exceed 50, allows Physician Assistant-owned RHCs that \nlose their clinic status to maintain Medicare Part B payments, and \nclarifies that when services already excluded from the PPS system are \ndelivered to Skilled Nursing Facility patients by practitioners \nemployed by the RHCs, those visits are also excluded from the PPS \npayment system. In addition, this bill increases payments under the \nMedicare home health PPS for beneficiaries who reside in rural areas by \nincreasing the standardized payment per 60-day episode by 10 percent.\n  Current law allows states the option to reimburse hospitals for \nQualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) services attributable to \ndeductibles and coinsurance amounts. However, many state Medicaid \nprograms have chosen not to pay these costs, leaving rural hospitals \nwith a significant portion of unpaid bad debt expenses. This is \nespecially burdensome since federal law prohibits hospitals from \nseeking payment for the cost-sharing amounts from QMB patients. This \nlegislation provides additional relief to rural hospitals by restoring \n100% Medicare bad debt reimbursement for QMBs.\n  Although, as a general rule, scholarships are excluded from income, \nthe Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that National \nHealth Service Corp scholarships are included in income. Imposing taxes \non the scholarships could have disastrous effects on a program that for \nover 20 years has helped funnel doctors, nurse-practitioners, physician \nassistants, and other health professionals into medically underserved \ncommunities. This provision excludes from gross income of certain \nscholarships any amounts received under the National Health Service \nCorps Scholarship Program.\n  Finally, this bill includes important technical corrections to the \nBalanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999. This bill extends the option to \nrebase target amounts to all Sole Community Hospitals and allows \nCritical Access Hospitals to receive reimbursement for lab services on \na reasonable cost basis.\n  Exciting changes are taking place in rural America. This legislation \nwill enable small rural hospitals to take advantage of the latest \ntechnology and improve health care for rural residents across the \ncountry. Mr. President, I invite my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis endeavor. I am unanimous consent that a copy of the bill appear in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2987\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a National Commission on Space; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              millennium national commission on space act\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Millennium National \nCommission on Space Act.\n  The year 1999 proved to be very difficult for NASA. The Commerce \nCommittee reviewed reports on such incidents as:\n  Workers searching for misplaced Space Station tanks in a landfill;\n  Loose pins in the Shuttle's main engine;\n  Failure to make English-metric conversions causing the failure of a \n$125 million mission to Mars;\n  Two-time use of ``rejected'' seals on Shuttle's turbopumps;\n  $1 billion of cost overruns on the prime contract for the Space \nStation with calls from the Inspector General at NASA for improvement \nin the agency's oversight;\n  Workers damaging the main antennae on the Shuttle for communication \nbetween mission control and the orbiting Shuttle;\n  Urgent repair mission to the Hubble telescope;\n  Approximately $1 billion invested in an experimental vehicle and \ncurrently no firm plans for its first flight, if it flies at all; and\n  The lack of long-term planning for the Space Station, an issue on \nwhich the Science, Technology, and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce \nCommittee has repeatedly questioned NASA.\n  It is the last of these items, the lack of long-term planning for the \nSpace Station and the lack of long-term planning of NASA and the \ncivilian space program, that is of a concern to me. I feel that the \ncivilian space program is in need of some guidance. Just as the space \npolicy of the 1980's had changed since the creation of NASA in 1958, \nthe space policy of the New Millennium needs to change from the 1980's.\n  Space has become more commercialized. Today, the private sector \nconducts more space launches than the government. There are many more \ncompanies developing plans to implement other new and innovative \ncommercial ventures.\n  I feel that the long term civilian space goals and objectives of the \nnation are in need of some major revisions. As I mentioned earlier, \ntoday's environment has changed drastically since the last commission \nof this type was assembled.\n  This bill proposes a Presidential Commission to address these points. \nThe commission will do the ``homework'' that will form the basis for a \nrevised civilian space program. The civilian space industry has proven \nto be a valuable national asset over the years. The goal of this bill \nwill be to ensure that the U.S. maintains its preeminence in space.\n  This commission will consist of 15 Members appointed by the President \nbased upon the recommendations of Congressional leadership. My hope is \nthat today's new environment will be reflected in the make-up of the \ncommission's members. For that reason, the bill sets limits on how many \nmembers shall be from the government and how many should serve on their \nfirst federal commission. Ex-officio members of the commission are also \nspecified in the bill. Advisory members from the Senate and the House \nof Representatives are to be appointed to the commission by the \nPresident of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The final report of the commission is to identify the long range \ngoals, opportunities, and policy options for the U.S. civilian space \nactivity for the next 20 years.\n  As Chairman of the Science, Technology and Space Subcommittee of the \nCommerce Committee, I will continue our oversight responsibilities at \nNASA. I look forward to working with other Members of this body to \nfurther perfect this bill.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this opportunity to introduce this \nlegislation which addresses these very important issues for the space \ncommunity.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as the Ranking Democratic Member of the \nCommerce Committee's Science, Technology, and Space Supcommittee, I am \njoining my Chairman, Senator Frist, in introducing legislation to \nestablish a National Space Commission.\n  If past experience holds true, NASA will be a catalyst for scientific \ndiscovery in this new century. In the past year, NASA has worked on a \nvariety of valuable projects from finding a value for the Hubble \nConstant which measures how fast the universe is expanding to docking \nwith the International Space Station for the very first time. Earlier \nthis week, NASA and the Russian Space Agency completed the docking of \nthe Service Module to the International Space Station, setting the \nstage for the first permanent crew to occupy the station.\n  Now, our space exploration agency is poised at a crossroads. After \nseveral failures, management has made some changes and reinvested in \nthe work force and in project oversight. During the next year, NASA \nwill try to meet a very aggressive schedule for the assembly of the \nSpace Station, and we will finally have our orbiting laboratory in \nspace. At the same time, a new Administration will be entering the \nWhite House. It seems to be an appropriate moment to stand back and ask \nwhere our space program is going in the next twenty years.\n  Now is the time to look to the future. The Millennium National Space \nCommission will build on the work of the 1985 National Space Commission \nand help us formulate an agenda for the civilian space program. In \ndoing so, it will help keep this nation in the forefront of scientific \nexploration of ``the final frontier.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 2989. A bill to provide for the technical integrity of the FM \nradio band, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      low power radio act of 2000\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \nfriend and colleague Senator Kerrey to resolve the controversy that has \nerupted over the Federal Communications Commission's creation of a new, \nnoncommercial low-power FM radio service.\n  As you undoubtedly know, the FCC's low-power FM rules will allow the \ncreation of thousands of new noncommercial FM radio stations with \ncoverage of about a mile or so. Although these new stations will give \nchurches and community groups new outlets for expression of their \nviews, commercial FM broadcasters as well as National Public Radio \noppose the new service. They argue that the FCC ignored studies showing \nthat the new low-power stations would cause harmful interference to the \nreception of existing full-power FM stations.\n  Mr. President, legislation before the House of Representatives would \ncall a halt to the institution of low-power FM service by requiring \nfurther independent study of its potential for causing harmful \ninterference to full-power stations, and Senator Gregg has introduced \nthe same legislation in the Senate. While this would undoubtedly please \nexisting FM radio broadcasters, it understandably angers the many \nparties who are anxious to apply for the new low-power licenses. Most \nimportantly, it would delay the availability of whatever new \nprogramming these new low-power licensees might provide, even where the \nstation would have caused no actual interference at all had it been \nallowed to operate.\n  With all due respect to Senator Gregg and to the supporters of the \nHouse bill, Senator Kerrey and I think we can reach a fairer result, \nand the bill we are introducing, the Low Power Radio Act of 2000, is \nintended to do just that.\n  Unlike Senator Gregg's bill, the Low Power Radio Act would allow the \nFCC to license low-power FM radio stations. The only low-power FM \nstations that would be affected would be those whose transmissions are \nactually causing harmful interference to a full-power radio station. \nThe Commission would determine which stations are causing such \ninterference and what the low-power station must do to alleviate it,\n\n[[Page S7906]]\n\nas the expert agency with the experience and engineering resources \nrequired to make such determinations.\n  The Act gives full-power broadcasters the right to file a complaint \nwith the Commission against any low-power FM licensee for causing \nharmful interference, and stipulates that the costs of the proceeding \nshall be borne by the losing party. Finally, to make sure that the FCC \ndoes not relegate the interests of full-power radio broadcasters to \nsecondary importance in its eagerness to launch the new low-power FM \nservice, the bill requires the FCC to complete all rulemakings \nnecessary to implement full-power stations' transition to digital \nbroadcasting no later than June 1, 2001.\n  Mr. President, this legislation strikes a fair balance by allowing \nnon-interfering low-power FM stations to operate without further delay, \nwhile affecting only those low-power stations that the FCC finds to be \ncausing harmful interference in their actual, everyday operations. This \nis totally consistent with the fact that low-power FM is a secondary \nservice which, by law, must cure any interference caused to any \nprimary, full-power service. This legislation will provide an efficient \nand effective means to detect and resolve harmful interference. By \nproviding a procedural remedy with costs assigned to the losing party, \nthe bill will discourage the creation of low-power stations most likely \nto cause harmful interference even as it discourages full-power \nbroadcasters from making unwarranted interference claims. And for these \nreasons it will provide a more definitive resolution of opposing \ninterference claims than any number of further studies ever could.\n  Mr. President, in the interests of would-be new broadcasters, \nexisting broadcasters, but, most of all, the listening public, I urge \nthe enactment of the Low Power Radio Act of 2000.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Low \nPower Radio Act of 2000 with Senator McCain. Low power FM radio is an \neffort to bring more diversity to the airwaves. Though radio airwaves \nbelong to the public, only a handful of people currently control what \nwe hear on-air. Low power FM will expand that number by thousands, \ngiving a voice to local governments, community groups, churches, and \nschools.\n  I understand that there is some concern that these new low-power \nsignals will interfere with existing full-power stations. I believe \nthese fears are greatly exaggerated. The Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC) has decades-long experience dealing with FM-spectrum \nissues, and they have conducted extensive testing to ensure that these \nnew stations will not cause interference.\n  Should interference occur, however, I believe that full-power \nstations must have a process for alleviating the problem. The Low Power \nRadio Act allows any broadcaster or listener to file a formal complaint \nwith the FCC. If the FCC determines that a low-power station is causing \nharmful interference, the low power station will be removed from the \nairwaves while a technical remedy is found. To discourage frivolous \ncomplaints, however, the FCC is authorized to assess reimbursement of \ncosts associated with the proceeding as well as punitive damages onto \nany full-power station who files a complaint without any purpose other \nthan to impede a low-power radio transmission.\n  This initiative has undergone a considerable period of testing and \npublic comment. Delaying implementation will only result in more \nconflicting engineering studies without guaranteeing that interference \nwill not occur. I believe that it is time to let low power FM go \nforward. The Low Power Radio Act gives the FCC the authority to resolve \nharmful interference complaints on a case-by-case, common sense basis. \nIt is a compromise that can work to the benefit of existing \nbroadcasters, potential low power licensees, and all radio listeners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2990. A bill to amend chapter 42 of title 28, United States Code, \nto establish the Judicial Education Fund for the payment of reasonable \nexpenses of judges participating in seminars, to prohibit the \nacceptance of seminar gifts, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n               the judicial education reform act of 2000\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill for introduction. \nThe bill is entitled the Judicial Education Reform Act of 2000. Mr. \nFeingold is cosponsoring the legislation.\n  Mr. President, as the arbiters of justice in our democracy, judges \nmust be honest and fair in their duties. As importantly, if the rule of \nlaw is to have force in our society, citizens must have faith that \njudges approach their duties honestly and fairly, and that their \ndecisions are based solely on the law and the facts of each case. Even \nif every judge were uncorrupt and incorruptible, their honesty would \nmean nothing if the public loses confidence in them. Court rulings are \neffectively only if the public believes that they have been arrived at \nthrough impartial decision-making. The judiciary must avoid the \nappearance of conflict as fastidiously as it avoids conflict.\n  Recent press coverage and an investigation by the public interest law \nfirm Community Rights Counsel have revealed that more than 230 federal \njudges have taken more than 500 trips to resort locations for legal \nseminars paid for by corporations, foundations, and individuals between \n1192 and 1998. Many of these sponsors have one-sided legal agendas in \nthe courts designed to advance their own interests at the expense of \nthe public interest. In many cases, judges accepted seminar trips while \nrelevant cases were pending before their court. In some cases, judges \nruled in favor of a litigant bankrolled by a seminar sponsor. And in \none case a judge ruled one way, attended a seminar and returned to \nswitch his vote to agree with the legal views expressed by the sponsor \nof the trip.\n  The notion that federal judges are accepting all-expense-paid trips \nthat combine highly political legal theory with stays at resort \nlocations from persons with interests before their courts creates an \nappearance of conflict that is unacceptable and unnecessary. At a \nminimum, it creates a perception of improper influence that erodes the \ntrust the American people must have in our judicial system.\n  Fortunately, the problems posed by improper judicial junkets can be \nremedied and the appearance of judicial impartiality restored. The \nJudicial Education Reform Act will seek to amend the Ethics Reform Act \nof 1989 to close the loophole that allows for privately-funded seminars \nby requiring federal judges to live by the same rules that now govern \nfederal prosecutors. The proposal is modeled after the successful \nFederal Judicial Center. It will ensure that legal educational seminars \nfor judges serve to educate, not improperly influence. It will ensure \nthat these seminars improve our judiciary through better-trained and \nbetter-informed judges, not undermine it by eroding public confidence \nin judicial neutrality.\n  Specifically, the legislation bans privately-funded seminars by \nprohibiting judges from accepting private seminars as gifts, providing \nappropriate exceptions, such as where a judge is a speaker, presenter \nor panel participant in such a seminar. The proposal establishes a \nJudicial Education Fund of $2 million within the U.S. Treasury for the \npayment of expenses incurred by judges attending seminars approved by \nthe Board of the Federal Judicial Center. It requires the Judicial \nConference to promulgate guidelines to ensure that the Board approves \nonly those  seminars that are conducted in a manner that will maintain \nthe public's confidence the judiciary. Finally, the proposal requires \nthat the Board approve a seminar only after information on its content, \npresenters, funding and litigation activities of sponsors and \npresenters are provided. If approved, information on the seminar must \nbe posted on the Internet.\n\n  Mr. President, in introducing this legislation, I am not charging the \nfederal judiciary or any single judge with improper behavior. I do not \nquestion the integrity of judges, rather I question a system that \ncreates the clear appearance of conflict. I understand the need for \neducation. Our economy has mainstreamed once exotic technologies in \ncommunication, medicine and other fields, and it is important that \njudges have access to experts to keep current on technological \nadvances. And I recognize the need for judges to be exposed to diverse \nlegal views and to test current legal views. The Judicial Education \nReform Act legislation provides\n\n[[Page S7907]]\n\n$2 million for precisely that purpose. No judge will be without access \nto continuing education. But, that education will not be funded by \nprivate entities with broad legal agendas before the federal courts, \nor, as has happened in some of the most unfortunate cases, private \nentities with cases pending before participating judges.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the \nrecord a statement from the Honorable Abner J. Mikva on this subject. \nMr. Mikva is a former Chief Judge on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the D.C. Circuit and a current Visiting Professor of Law at the \nUniversity of Chicago. His statement captures this the essence this \nissue and need for reform.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      Statement of Abner J. Mikva\n\n       The notion that judges must be honest for the system to \n     work is hardly a profound statement. As early as the \n     Declaration of Independence, our founders complained about \n     judges who were obsequious to King George, rather than the \n     cause of justice. But a pure heart is not all that judges \n     must bring to the judicial equation. For the system to work \n     as it should, the judges must be perceived to be honest, to \n     be without bias, to have no tilt in the cause that is being \n     heard.\n       That perception of integrity is much more difficult to \n     obtain. After spending 15 years as a judge and a lifetime as \n     a lawyer and lawmaker, I can safely say that the number of \n     judges who were guilty of outright dishonesty--malum in se--\n     were happily very few. Even taking into account that I \n     started practicing law in Chicago in the bad old days, the \n     number of crooked judges was small. But that is not what \n     people believe--then or now.\n       The framers and attenders to our judicial system have taken \n     many steps to help foster the notion of the integrity of its \n     judges. Some relate to smoke and mirrors--the high bench, the \n     black robe, the ``all rise'' custom when the judge enters the \n     room. Some, like life tenure for federal judges, the codes of \n     conduct promulgated for all judges, are intended to create \n     the climate for integrity and good behavior. (The \n     Constitution limits the life tenure of federal judges to \n     their ``good behavior''.)\n       All of those steps become meaningless when private \n     interests are allowed to wine and dine judges at fancy \n     resorts under the pretext of ``educating'' them about \n     complicated issues. If an actual party to a case took the \n     judge to a resort, all expenses paid, shortly before the case \n     was heard, it would not matter what they talked about. Even \n     if all they discussed were their prostate problems, the judge \n     and the party would be perceived to be acting improperly. \n     The conduct is no less reprehensible when an interest \n     group substitutes for the party to the case, and the \n     format for discussion is seminars on environmental policy, \n     or law and economics, or the ``takings clause'' of the \n     Constitution.\n       That's what this report is about. It is about the \n     perception of dishonesty that arises when judges attend \n     seminars and study sessions sponsored by corporations and \n     foundations that have a special interest in the \n     interpretation given to environmental laws. It may be a \n     coincidence that the judges who attend these meetings usually \n     come down on the same side of important policy questions as \n     the funders who finance these meetings. It may even be a \n     coincidence that very few environmentalists are invited to \n     address the judges in the bucolic surroundings where the \n     seminars are held. But I doubt it. More importantly, any \n     citizen who reads about judges attending such fancy meetings \n     under such questionable sponsorship, will doubt it even more.\n       The federal judiciary has a very effective Federal Judicial \n     Center. It already provides many of the educational services \n     that these special interest groups seek to provide to judges. \n     Admittedly, since the Center is using taxpayer funds and must \n     answer to Congress, the locals of their programs are not as \n     exotic. (The last ones I attended were in South Bend, Indiana \n     in October, and Washington, D.C. in December.) The purpose of \n     Center sponsored programs is as vanilla as it claims: there \n     is no agenda to get the judges to perform in any particular \n     way in handling environmental cases. As a result, the \n     programs are not only balanced as to presentation, but they \n     provide no tilt to the judges' subsequent performance.\n       Unfortunately, the U.S. Judicial Conference, the governing \n     body for all federal judges, has punted on the propriety of \n     judges attending seminars funded by special interest groups. \n     It advised judges to consider the propriety of such seminars \n     on a ``case by case'' process. That delicacy has not begun to \n     stem the erosion of public confidence in the fairness of the \n     judicial process when it comes to environmental causes. One \n     of the special interest sponsoring groups publishes a ``Desk \n     Reference for Federal Judges'' which it distributes to all \n     its judge attendees. That must be a real confidence builder \n     for an environmental group that sees it on the desk of a \n     judge sitting on its case. One of the judges on the court on \n     which I sat has attended some 12 trips sponsored by the three \n     most prominent special interest seminar groups. I remember at \n     least two occasions where co-panelist judges took positions \n     that they had heard advocated at seminars sponsored by groups \n     with more than a passing interest in the litigation under \n     consideration.\n       When I was in the executive branch, all senior officials \n     operated under a very prophylactic rule. Whenever we were \n     invited to attend or speak at a private gathering, the \n     government paid our way. Whether it was the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce or the A.F.L.-C.I.O., nobody could even imply that \n     the official was being wined and dined and brainwashed to \n     further some special interest. Experience showed that such a \n     policy was not sufficient in itself to restore people's \n     confidence in the Executive Branch; at least we didn't make \n     the problem worse.\n       If the Federal Judicial Center can't provide sufficient \n     judicial education to the task, maybe the federal judges \n     could use such a prophylaxis. If the judges want to go \n     traveling, let the government pay for the trip. It may or may \n     not change the places they go or the things they learn, but \n     it will at least change the transactional analysis.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at the very foundation of our system of \njustice is the notion that judges will be fair and impartial. Strict \nethical guidelines have been in effect for years to remove even the \nhint of impropriety from the conduct of those we entrust with the \nresponsibility of adjudicating disputes and applying the law.\n  In recent years, there have been disturbing reports of judges \nparticipating in legal education seminars sponsored and paid for by \norganizations that simultaneously fund federal court litigation on the \nsame topics that are covered by the seminars. Some of these seminars \nhave a clearly biased agenda in favor a certain legal philosophy. A \nrecent report released by Community Rights Counsel found that at least \n1,030 federal judges took over 5,800 privately funded trips between \n1992 and 1998. The appearance created by these seminars is not \nconsistent with the image of an impartial judiciary.\n  Some of these seminars are conducted at posh vacation resorts in \nlocations such as Amelia Island, Florida and Hilton Head, South \nCarolina, and include ample time for expense-paid recreation. These \nkinds of education/vacation trips, which have been valued at over \n$7,000 in some cases, create an appearance that the judges who attend \nare profiting from their positions. Again, this is an appearance that \nis at odds with the traditions of our judiciary.\n  One-sided seminars given in wealthy resorts funded by wealthy \ncorporate interests to ``educate'' our judges in a particular view of \nthe law cannot help but undermine public confidence in the decisions \nthat judges who attend the seminars ultimately make. I am pleased, \ntherefore, to join with my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry, \nto introduce the Judicial Education Reform Act of 2000. Our bill \ninstructs the judicial conference to issue guidelines prohibiting \njudges from attending privately funded education seminars. The bill \nalso authorizes $2 million per year over five years so that the Federal \nJudicial Center, FJC, can reimburse judges for seminars they wish to \nattend, as long as those seminars are approved by the FJC under \nguidelines that will ensure that the seminars are balanced and will \nmaintain public confidence in the judiciary. And the bill makes clear \nthat the FJC cannot reimburse judges for the expense of recreational \nactivities at the seminars.\n  Mr. President, I have expressed concern throughout my time in the \nCongress about the improper influence of campaign contributions and \ngifts on members of Congress and the executive branch. Community Rights \nCounsel's report has turned the spotlight on the judicial branch and \nwhat it reveals is not at all comforting. The influence of powerful \ninterests on judicial decision-making through these education seminars \nshould concern everyone who believes in the rule of law in this \ncountry. If judges are seen to be under the influence of the wealthy \nand powerful in our society, ``equal justice under law'' will become an \nempty platitude rather than a powerful aspiration for the greatest \njudicial system on earth. I believe this bill will help us fulfill the \npromise of that great aspiration, and I hope my colleagues will join \nSenator Kerry and me in supporting it.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 2993. A bill to enhance competition for prescription drugs by \nincreasing the\n\n[[Page S7908]]\n\nability of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission to \nenforce existing antitrust laws regarding brand name drugs and generic \ndrugs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7908-S7921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DRUG COMPETITION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of outrageous examples \nof greed in my life but one of the worst is where pharmaceutical giants \npay generic drug companies to keep low-cost drugs from senior citizens \nand from families.\n  If Dante were still alive today I am certain he would find a special \nresting place for those who engage in these conspiracies.\n  The Federal Trade Commission and the New York Times deserve credit \nfor exposing this problem. Simply stated: some manufacturers of \npatented drugs--often brand-name drugs--are paying millions each month \nto generic drug companies to keep lower-cost products off the market.\n  This hurts senior citizens, it hurts families, it cheats healthcare \nproviders and it is a disgrace.\n  These pharmaceutical giants and their generic partners then share the \nprofits gained from cheating American families.\n  The companies have been able to get away with this by signing secret \ndeals with each other not to compete. My bill, which I am introducing \ntoday, will expose these deals and subject them to immediate \ninvestigation and action by the Federal Trade Commission, or the \nJustice Department. This solves the most difficult problem faced by \nfederal investigators--finding out about the improper deals. This bill \ndoes not change the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act, it does not amend FDA \nlaw, and it does not slow down the drug approval process. It allows \nexisting antitrust laws to be enforced because the enforcement agencies \nhave information about deals not to compete.\n  Fortunately, the FTC was able to get copies of a couple of these \nsecret contracts and instantly lowered the boom on the companies\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial in the July \n26, New York Times, called ``Driving Up Drug Prices'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Driving Up Drug Prices\n\n       Two recent antitrust actions by the Federal Trade \n     Commission and a related federal court decision have exposed \n     the way some pharmaceutical companies conspire to keep low-\n     priced drugs out of reach of consumers. Manufacturers of \n     patented drugs are paying tens of millions of dollars to \n     manufacturers of generic drugs if they agree to keep products \n     off the market. The drug companies split the profits from \n     maintaining a monopoly at the consumer's expense. The \n     commission is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. \n     It needs help from Congress to close loopholes in federal \n     law.\n       Dissatisfied with the supply of generic drugs, Congress \n     passed the Hatch-Waxman act in 1984 to encourage \n     manufacturers to challenge weak or invalid patents on brand-\n     name drugs. The act grants temporary protection from \n     competition to the first manufacturer that receives \n     permission from federal authorities to sell a generic drug \n     before the patent on a brand-name drug expires. For 180 days, \n     the federal government promises to approve no other generic \n     drug.\n       But as reported Sunday by Sheryl Gay Stolberg and Jeff \n     Gerth of The Times, drug companies are undermining Congress's \n     intent. Hoechst Marion Roussel, the maker of drugs to treat \n     hypertension and angina, agreed in 1997 to pay Andrx \n     Pharmaceuticals to delay bringing its generic alternative to \n     market. The commission brought charges against the companies \n     last March and a federal judge declared last month in a \n     private lawsuit that the agreement violated antitrust laws.\n       In a second case, Abbott Laboratories paid Geneva \n     pharmaceuticals to delay selling a generic alternative to an \n     Abbott drug that treats hypertension and enlarged prostates. \n     Geneva's drug could have cost Abbott over 30 million a month \n     in sales. In both cases, the manufacturer of the generic drug \n     used its claim to the 180-day grace period to block other \n     generic drugs from entering the market.\n       The drug companies deny that their agreements violate the \n     antitrust laws, presenting them as private preliminary \n     settlements between companies engaged in patent disputes. \n     That is untenable. The agreements are overly broad, \n     temporarily stopping all sales of generic drugs. Typically in \n     settlement of a patent dispute, the company infringing on the \n     patent would pay the patent holder. In these cases it is \n     reversed, stunting competition. The agreements are also \n     private, going into effect before a court reviews the public \n     interest.\n       Not all private settlements are anti-consumer. That is why \n     the commission has taken a careful case-by-case approach. It \n     could use a little help from congress. The 180-day grace \n     period was designed to encourage generics to enter the \n     market. Since it is being manipulated to impede competition, \n     the grace period needs to be fixed so that the production of \n     generic drugs cannot be blocked by a single company that \n     decides not to compete.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This editorial neatly summarizes the problem and concludes \nthat the FTC ``is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. It \nneeds help from Congress to close loopholes in federal law.''\n  My bill slams the door shut on would-be violators by exposing the \ndeals to our competition enforcement agencies.\n  Under current law, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to \nchallenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers \ncan enjoy lower generic drug prices.\n  Current law grants these generic companies a temporary protection \nfrom competition to the first manufacturer that gets permission to sell \na generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires.\n  This approach then gives the generic company a 180-day headstart on \nother generic companies.\n  That was a good idea--the unfortunate loophole exploited by a few is \nthat secret deals can be made that allow the manufacturer of the \ngeneric drug to claim the 180-day grace period--to block other generic \ndrugs from entering the market--while, at the same time, getting paid \nby the brand-name manufacturer to not sell the generic drug.\n  The bill I am introducing today will shut this loophole down for \ncompanies who want to cheat the public, but keeps the system the same \nfor companies engaged in true competition with each other. This bill \nwould give the FTC or the Justice Department the information it needs \nto take quick and decisive action against companies driven more by \ngreed than by good sense.\n  I think it is important for Congress not to overreact in this case \nand throw out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to \ntake advantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic \ndrugs at much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the \nincentive for them.\n  Instead, we should let the FTC and Justice look at every single deal \nthat could lead to abuse so that only the deals that are consistent \nwith the intent of that law will be allowed to stand.\n  This bill was quickly drafted because I wanted my colleagues to be \nable to look at it over the recess so that we can be ready to act when \nwe get back in session.\n  I look forward to suggestions from other Members on this matter and \nfrom brand-name and generic companies who will work with me to make \nsure this loophole is closed. I am not interested in comments from \ncompanies who want to continue to cheat consumers.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the bill in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Drug Competition Act of \n     2000.''\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) prescription drug costs are increasing at an alarming \n     rate and are a major worry of senior citizens and American \n     families;\n       (2) there is a potential for drug companies owning patents \n     on brand-name drugs to enter to private financial deals with \n     generic drug companies in a manner that could tend to \n     restrain trade and greatly reduce competition and increase \n     prescription drug costs for American citizens; and\n       (3) enhancing competition between generic drug \n     manufacturers and brand name manufacturers can significantly \n     reduce prescription drug costs to American families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives to encourage small business health plans, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                    the health insurance equity act\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new legislative \nproposal to help level the playing field for small businesses that try \nto provide health insurance for their employees and make health \ninsurance more affordable for all Americans.\n  While our economy is the strongest it's ever been, the number of \nuninsured Americans has gone from 32 million in 1987 to more than 44 \nmillion today. And that number is rising. While our nation continues to \nforge ahead in improving the world's greatest health care system, we \nface the increasing problem of having a significant percentage of our \npopulation that has no way to access it.\n  One of the largest sectors of the uninsured is employees who work for \nsmall businesses. While small businesses are the lifeblood of our \neconomy, they also face some of the greatest challenges--particularly \nwhen it comes to providing health benefits for their employees. While \nthe number of uninsured among employees who work for companies with \nmore than 500 people is 1 in 8, that number soars among companies with \nfewer than 25 employees--to 1 in 3. This is because large employers can \nspread the costs of providing health insurance among their multitude of \nemployees, while smaller companies have a much more difficult task. We \nneed to help small business owners--and the employees who work for \nthem--better afford quality health insurance.\n  Today, I propose that we lend a hand to the hardworking small \nbusinessmen and women of America, and their employees, to help them \nerase the gap in coverage between large and small businesses. The \nlegislation I am introducing--the Health Insurance Equity Act--will \ngive small businesses with less than 50 employees a 20% tax credit \ntoward the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. To \nencourage small businesses to pool together and take advantage of the \nsame benefits that their larger counterparts have, the credit will \nincrease to 25% if the businesses join new ``qualified health benefit \npurchasing coalitions'' that can help them easily administer their new \nhealth plans and negotiate better rates with insurers.\n  In addition, this legislation makes a change in the tax code to \nensure that these new coalitions can enjoy the full benefit of \ncharitable contributions from private foundations. While some private \nfoundations have indicated that they are willing to help fund some of \nthe start-up costs of health purchasing coalitions, current law does \nnot specify that these sorts of contributions would qualify as a \ncharitable donation. For this reason, private foundations have been \nreluctant to make grants or loans to these coalitions. The bill I am \nintroducing today will clarify that aid to qualified health benefit \npurchasing coalitions are entirely tax-deductible, which can help \nencourage private foundations and other interested parties to help the \ncoalitions with their important duties.\n  By helping people get better access to basic health insurance--before \nthey get very sick--we can save money for both hospital and patient, \nwhile helping millions of Americans live more healthy lifestyles.\n  With that Mr. President, I send my legislation to the desk, and ask \nthat it be appropriately referred. I also ask unanimous consent that it \nbe printed in the Record. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2994\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Health Insurance Equity Act \n     of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

The potato fields of \nLong Island were turned into massive tracts of uniform new houses known \nas Levittown. This same post-World War II growth at one point so \noverwhelmed my own home town of Warwick, Rhode Island that the state \nnewspaper described the city as ``a suburban nightmare''. Before long, \nstrip retail development catering to the automobile became the \ntrademark of the American landscape.\n  Our landscape has since been pockmarked by incremental, haphazard \ndevelopment, which too often offends the eye, and saps our economic \nstrength by requiring very expensive investment for extending \ninfrastructure farther and father into the country side. Driving down \nthe street in Anytown USA you see an apartment house next to a fast \nfood franchise, next to a fire station, next to an office building, \nnext to a strip mall. That isn't planned development.\n  Over forty years after Levittown, we find ourselves in a strong \neconomy sustained as never before. At the same time, every state in the \ncountry face significant problems relating to unplanned growth, from \nprotecting open space in the east to protecting precious drinking water \nsupplies in the west. We ought to seize the moment and learn from our \nprevious mistakes--we should not be burned twice.\n  The last thing anyone needs, citizens and developers alike, is to \nhave angry and divisive planning board, zoning board or city or town \ncouncil meetings. The best thing we can do to ensure wise growth is to \nencourage decision makers to work together with the citizens, \ndevelopers, interest groups and others to develop a consensus for \nplanning for growth in an orderly manner.\n  That is what the Community Character Act does.\n  Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, Senators Bennett, \nCleland, Jeffords, Levin, Lieberman and Leahy to introduce a bill that \nI believe will help states plan wise growth. This bill, Community \nCharacter Act of 2000, seeks to authorize $25 million over four years \nfor a grant program to help states develop or update their land use \nstatutes and Comprehensive Plans.\n  No state in the nation is immune from the effects of rapid unplanned \ndevelopment. Suburbanization is expensive, costing state and local \ntaxpayers dearly for extending roads and infrastructure, and building \nnew schools. Even states considered more rural are now facing rapid \nalterations in land use and quality of life.\n  Federal grants under this act would help states promote citizen \nparticipation in the developing of state plans, encourage sustainable \neconomic development, coordinate transportation and other \ninfrastructure development, conserve historic scenic resources and the \nenvironment, and sustainably manage natural resources.\n  I am pleased that this bill has such bipartisan support and hope that \nthe full Senate will give it favorable action.\n  I thank the chair and ask unanimous consent that my full statement \nand the text of the bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators DeWine, \nHatch and Voinovich in introducing bipartisan legislation to provide \ncommon-sense tax incentives to help address asbestos liability issues.\n  I agree with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in the Amchem \nProducts decision that Congress can provide a secure, fair and \nefficient means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure. The \nappropriate role for Congress is to provide incentives for private \nparties to reach settlements, not to take away the legal rights of \nasbestos victims and their families. Our bipartisan bill provides these \ntax incentives for private parties involved in asbestos-related \nlitigation to reach global settlements and for asbestos victims and \ntheir families receive the full benefit of the incentives.\n  Mr. President, encouraging fair settlements while still preserving \nthe legal rights of all parties involved is a win-win situation for \nbusiness and asbestos victims. For example, Rutland Fire Clay Company, \na family-run, 117-year-old small business in my home state of Vermont, \nrecently reached a settlement with its insurers and the trial bar \nconcerning the firm's asbestos problems. Unlike some big businesses \nthat are trying to avoid any accountability for their asbestos \nresponsibilities through national ``tort reform'' legislation, the \nRutland Fire Clay Company and its President, Tom Martin, are doing the \nright thing within the legal system. Mr. Martin plans to lead the \nfamily-run business from bankruptcy this year as a stronger firm with a \nsolid financial foundation for its employees in the 21st Century. The \ntax incentives in our bipartisan bill will support the Rutland Fire \nClay Company and its employees while providing financial security for \nits settlement with asbestos victims.\n  I believe it is in the national interest to encourage fair and \nexpeditious settlements between companies and asbestos victims. The \nlegislation we are introducing today will protect payments to victims \nwhile ensuring defendant firms remain solvent. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport our bipartisan legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE:\n  S. 2996. A bill to extend the milk price support program through 2002 \nat an increased price support rate; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                    dairy price support legislation\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is intended to begin a long overdue discussion regarding the \nfuture of an industry, and a way of life that is basic not only to our \nagricultural economy but to the soul of America. I am talking about \nfamily dairy farming. To maintain this country's family dairy industry, \nwe in the Senate need to act quickly before the end of this session, to \neffect a change in Federal dairy policy that will make a difference, a \ndifference to dairy farmers who are struggling because they receive a \nprice that is less than what it cost them to produce the product.\n  It is clear dairy farmers in this country are facing devastating \ntimes. The current dairy policies have brought chaos to family dairy \nfarmers. Last year, the Class III milk price decreased from $16.26 cwt. \nin September to $9.63 cwt in December, and prices have still not \nrecovered. Over the last ten months we have seen a drop of over forty \npercent in milk prices. How can our dairy farmers survive with such \nvolatility in the market place? Dairy farmers need to have a stable and \nequitable market price, and that simply does not exist under our \ncurrent dairy policy.\n  That is why I am pleased to introduce this legislation to set the \nmilk support price at $12.50 per hundredweight. As my colleagues know, \nthe dairy support price sets a floor on the price received by all \nproducers, regardless of region, that should be set at a level \nsufficient to curb market volatility. However, the current support \nlevel of $9.90 cwt. is too low to act as a stabilizer for the market. \nThe five year average for milk is $12.78 cwt, therefore this \nlegislation to set the support price at $12.50 would protect against \nthe huge drops producers have experienced in the past few years.\n  I want to make clear that this legislation is not intended to be the \ncomplete solution to the problems with our national dairy policy, or \nlack thereof. I firmly believe that we need to develop a supply \nmanagement mechanism to complement an increase in the price support, \nhowever, for too long this Congress has ignored the economic crisis our \nnation's dairy farmers are facing.\n  Mr. President, what we do here in Washington has to be rooted in the \nlives of the people we represent. It has to be based upon the reality \nof lives of people in our communities, including people in rural \ncommunities. I think it is vitally important to understand that there \nis a crisis in capital letters with dairy farmers that is evident when \nyou go out and talk with people, talk to farmers, hardworking dairy \nfarmers, good managers, sitting down in their kitchens adding up the \nfigures trying to cash flow. There is simply no way\n\n[[Page S7913]]\n\nthey can do it. Talk to dairy farmers who try to convince their sons \nand daughters that there is no more honorable profession to go into \nthan to be a farmer, to be a dairy farmer, to produce nutritious milk \nfor people at affordable prices, and yet people do not get a decent \nprice for their work.\n  In my State, fifty in the country in milk production, we have 8,000 \ndairy farmers with an average herd size of 59 cows. It is a family \ndairy industry. It is not a factory farm industry, and we want to keep \nit a family industry. The milk production from Minnesota farms \ngenerates more than $1.2 billion for our states' farmers each year, and \na recent University of Minnesota study determined that dairy production \nin Minnesota creates an additional $1.2 billion in economic activity \nfor related industry. Our dairy industry is efficient and it is \ninnovative, and it produces a plentiful supply of pure wholesome milk \nat extremely reasonable prices, but it is also an industry in crisis. \nIt is a crisis not only for dairy farmers themselves, but for rural \ncommunities throughout the country because the health and vitality of \nour rural communities is not going to be based upon the size of the \nherds but the number of dairy farmers who live in those communities, \nwho buy in those communities, who go to churches in those communities, \nwho support the school systems and businesses in those communities.\n\n  I am afraid, as I speak here on the floor of the Senate, that \nagriculture in our country is about to go through a transition where \nall of agriculture will be dominated by giant conglomerates. The result \nwill be the total lack of a competitive sector, family farm sector, of \nagriculture. That will be a transition that we'll deeply regret and \nthat is why we have to act now.\n  Mr. President, I hope we can respond appropriately to the pleas that \nare coming from any State and other agricultural States all around the \ncountry. Due to a drastic reduction in the prices paid to farmers for \ntheir milk during the past year, thousands of farmers are going out of \nbusiness. Since 1990 the number of dairy farmers in Minnesota has been \nnearly cut in half. This year alone we have already lost almost 300 \ndairy farms. We will lose more if we do not change the course of \npolicy. Federal dairy policy has allowed milk production and prices to \nfluctuate widely. This fluctuation has caused a tremendous amount of \ninstability for producers and consumers but it has been especially bad \nfor farmers. While retail prices for dairy farmers have gone down and \nwhile the price for farmers has been dramatically cut by 40 percent, we \nhave seen no such decrease at the grocery store.\n  The solution is a Federal policy that provides a decent living to \nhardworking family farmers producing needed milk. The average cost of \nproduction for milk in the United States is around $13 per \nhundredweight and yet farmers in my State are receiving less than $10 \nfor the same hundredweight. We need a system that will match output to \nneed, and pay farmers a fair price.\n  There is widespread support around the country for an increase in the \nprice support. In fact the National Farmers Union and the National \nFarmers Organization, earlier this year, testified in support of an \nincrease of the current price support of $9.90. Such a system will \nallow farmers to earn a price that covers the cost of production, and \nreduce the wild price fluctuations we have witnessed over the past few \nyears.\n  I want to make it very clear that I believe the vitality of the dairy \nindustry is important not only to my State's economic health, and to \nthe economic health of agricultural States all across the country, but \nto the maintenance of viable rural communities throughout our nation. I \nthink it is important if we are to protect the environment. I think it \nis important if we are to have diversity. I think it is important if we \nare to avoid more concentration in the agricultural sector of our \ncountry. I think it is important if we are to continue to have family \nfarmers who can produce wholesome milk at a decent price for consumers. \nI think it is important because it represents the very best of what we \nhave been about as a nation. I hope we can make substantive dairy \npolicy reforms this year, and I believe an increase in the price \nsupport is an important component, as is a targeted supply management \nmechanism. It is clear we must act soon. And I hope we can do it before \nthe close of Congress.\n  Mr. PRESIDENT, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Chafee, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2997. A bill to establish a National Housing Trust Fund in the \nTreasury of the United States to provide for the development of decent, \nsafe, and affordable housing for low-income families; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n             the national affordable housing trust fund act\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer the \nNational Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act which would establish a \nTrust Fund to fill the growing gap in our ability to provide affordable \nhousing in this country.\n  We are living through a time of great economic expansion. Many \nAmericans are benefitting from the growing economy. On the flip side \nhowever, is that the economy is fueling rising housing costs. While \nthese costs skyrocket at record pace, there are many families in this \ncountry who are unable to keep up.\n  HUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have ``worst \ncase'' housing needs. These families are paying over half their income \ntowards housing costs or living in severely substandard housing. Since \n1990, the number of families who have ``worst case'' housing needs has \nincreased by 12 percent--that's 600,000 more American families who \ncannot afford a decent and safe place to live.\n  For these families living paycheck to paycheck, one unforseen \ncircumstance, a sick child, a needed car repair, or a large utility \nbill can send them into homelessness. Just this week, on the front page \nof the Washington Post, an article detailed these problems right here \nin our own backyard. The article details the plight of low-income \nfamilies living in apartments which are no longer affordable because \nthe owners have decided to no longer accept federal assistance. For \nthese families, the loss of their affordable housing unit means they \nmay go without a home.\n  We mistakenly view the housing crisis in this country as confined to \nspecific demographics. This is untrue. There is not one metropolitan \narea in the country where a minimum wage earner can afford to pay the \nrent for a two-bedroom apartment. A person needs to earn over $11 an \nhour to afford the median rent for a two bedroom apartment in this \ncountry. This figure rises dramatically in many metropolitan areas--an \nhourly wage of $22 is needed in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 \nin Boston; $16 in the D.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and, $13 \nin Atlanta.\n  Working families in this country are increasingly finding themselves \nunable to afford housing. Using the numbers I just cited, a person in \nBoston would have to make over $35,000 just to afford a 2 bedroom \napartment. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, police \nofficers--these full time workers can have trouble affording even a \nmodest 2-bedroom apartment.\n  A story from my home state of Massachusetts highlights the problems \nfaced by working families. On Cape\n\n[[Page S7914]]\n\nCod, Susan O'Donnell a mother of three, earns $21,000 a year working \nfull-time. Nonetheless, she is forced to live in a campground because \nshe cannot find affordable housing. The campground she is living at has \ntime limits, so the only way she is able to stay for a prolonged period \nof time is through cleaning the campground's toilets. When her time \nruns out at the campground, she will again be forced to move with her \nthree children, though it is not clear where she will be able to afford \nto move. Skyrocketing housing costs have pushed her, and other full \ntime workers on the Cape out of their housing and into homelessness.\n  And, as I mentioned earlier, the problem is not only that we have \nfailed to create additional affordable units. We have actually \nwitnessed a tremendous loss in affordable housing. Between 1993 and \n1995, a loss of 900,000 rental units affordable to very low-income \nfamilies occurred. From 1996 to 1998, there was a 19% reduction in the \nnumber of affordable housing units. This amounted to a dramatic \nreduction of 1.3 million affordable housing units available to low-\nincome Americans.\n  The Washington Post article I mentioned previously, helps to show the \nreal impact of these losses. Because of the ability of higher wage \nearners to pay higher housing costs, building owners are now choosing \nnot to rent to households assisted with Section 8 vouchers.\n\n  Right over the D.C. line, in Prince Georges County, Maryland, 300 \ntenants in a apartment complex were recently told that they would have \nto move because the owner will no longer accept Section 8. This means \n300 families will lose their housing. And, it is not clear that there \nwill be anywhere for them to go. The same article introduces us to a \nwoman who experienced the same traumatizing eviction in Alexandria, \nVirginia. Ms. Evans is now living in a cockroach infested building with \nher children, because there are no decent units affordable to her. \nThis, in part, stems from the fact that of 31 properties in Alexandria \nwhich accepted voucher holders in the past, 12 will not longer accept \ntenants with federal assistance.\n  The loss of this affordable housing has exacerbated the housing \ncrisis in this country, and the federal government must take action.\n  However, the government has clearly not been doing enough. In fact, \ndespite the fact that more families are unable to afford housing, we \nhave decreased federal spending on critical housing programs over time. \nFrom fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1999, we engaged in what I call \nthe ``Great HUDway Robbery,'' diverting or rescinding over 20 billion \ndollars from federal housing programs for other uses. With a few \nexceptions, the funding increases of this past year have gone primarily \nto cover the rising costs of serving existing assisted families.\n  We need to bring our levels of housing spending back up to where they \nbelong. Between 1978 and 1995, the number of households receiving \nhousing assistance was increased by almost 3 million. From 1978 through \n1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing \nassistance each year. This number dropped significantly to 126,000 \nadditional households each year from 1985 through 1995.\n  And, in 1996, this nation's housing policy went all the way back to \nsquare one--not only was there no increase in families receiving \nhousing assistance, but the number of assisted units actually \ndecreased. From 1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households \ndropped by 51,000. In this time of rising rents and housing costs, and \nthe loss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we \nare not doing more to bring the levels of housing assistance back from \nthe dead.\n  It is high time that we focused on housing policies in Congress and \naround the country because housing is an anchor for families.\n  It is no secret that housing, neighborhood and living environment \nplay enormous roles in shaping young lives. Maintaining a stable home, \nmade possible through housing assistance, has positive outcomes for \nlow-income children. A child will be unable to learn if she is forced \nto change schools every few months because her family is forced to move \nfrom relative to relative to friend to friend because her parents can't \nafford the rent.\n  What I am doing today, is standing up before the Nation and saying, \n``no more.'' We have the resources we need to ensure that all Americans \nhave the opportunity to live in decent and safe housing, yet we are not \ndevoting these resources to fix the problem.\n  Today, I am proposing to address the severe shortage of affordable \nhousing by establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund which \nuses excess income generated by 2 federal housing programs--the Federal \nHousing Administration (FHA) and the Government National Mortgage \nAssociation (GNMA). These federal housing programs generate billions of \ndollars in excess income which currently go to the general Treasury for \nuse on other federal priorities. It is time to stop taking housing \nmoney out of housing programs. These excess funds should be used to \nhelp alleviate the current housing crisis.\n  My proposal would create an affordable housing production, ensuring \nthat new rental units are built for those who most need assistance--\nextremely low-income families, including working families. In addition, \nTrust Fund assistance will be used to promote homeownership for low-\nincome families, those families whose incomes are below 80% of the area \nmedian income.\n  The Trust Fund aims to create long-term affordable, mixed-income \ndevelopments in areas with the greatest opportunities for low-income \nfamilies.\n  A majority of assistance from the Trust Fund will be given out as \nmatching grants to the States which will distribute funds on a \ncompetitive basis like the low-income housing tax credit. Localities, \nnon-profits, developers and other entities will be eligible to apply \nfor funds. The remaining assistance will be distributed through a \nnational competition to intermediaries, such as non-profits which will \nbe required to leverage private funds for investment in affordable \nhousing.\n  This proposal will bring federal, State and private resources \ntogether to create needed affordable housing opportunities for American \nfamilies.\n  We can no longer ignore the lack of affordable housing, and the \nimpact it is having on families and children around the country. It is \nnot clear to me why this lack of housing has not caused more uproar. \nHow many families need to be pushed out of their homes and into the \nstreets, before action is taken. Earlier in this Congress, I proposed a \nprogram which would assist in maintaining the affordable housing stock \nthat already exists. I hope that this preservation program is taken up \nthis Congress and passed so that we can avoid losing anymore affordable \nunits. However, we must also focus on producing additional housing, \nwhich is exactly what this Housing Trust Fund will do.\n  Mr. President, I asked of the housing policy experts and \npractitioners in Massachusetts to work with me to come up with a viable \nprogram which would put the government back in the business of \nproducing affordable housing. This legislation is a result of \ncollaboration among numerous organizations and experts. I want to thank \nin particular, Aaron Gornstein of the citizens Housing and Planning \nAssociation in Massachusetts for helping to bring all of the relevant \nactors to the table to formulate this proposal. I appreciate the help \nof many people and organizations, but want to mention some people in \nMassachusetts who were critical in shaping the ideas behind this \nlegislation: Vince O'Donnell of the Community Economic Development \nAssistance Corp; Peter Gagliardi with the Hampden Hampshire Housing \nPartnership; Conrad Egan of the National Housing Conference; Joe \nFlately with the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation; Howard \nCohen with Beacon Residential; and, Patrick Dober of Lendlease.\n  I urge you to support this legislation which restores our commitment \nto providing affordable housing for all families. We can no longer turn \nour backs on those families who struggle each month just to put a roof \nover their heads.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the legislation, along \nwith a section-by-section summary, and letters of support from a number \nof organizations including the National Association of Homebuilders, \nthe National Council of State Housing Agencies, the National Low-Income \nHousing Coalition, the National Coalition for the\n\n[[Page S7915]]\n\nHomeless, the National Housing Conference, and others put in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2997\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) fill the growing gap in the national ability to build \n     affordable housing by using profits generated by Federal \n     housing programs to fund additional housing activities, and \n     not supplant existing housing appropriations; and\n       (2) enable rental housing to be built for those families \n     with the greatest need in areas with the greatest \n     opportunities in mixed-income settings and to promote \n     homeownership for low-income families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than 6 months after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall \n     promulgate regulations to carry out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Section by Section of National Affordable Housing Trust Fund \n                              Legislation\n\n\n                         section 1: short title\n\n       National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2000.\n\n\n                          section 2: purposes\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to use profits generated by \n     federal housing programs to help alleviate the current \n     housing crisis by funding new construction of affordable \n     rental housing in mixed-income developments and homeownership \n     activities.\n\n\n                 section 3: national housing trust fund\n\n       This Section establishes a National Affordable Housing \n     Trust Fund (``Trust Fund'') in the Treasury of the U.S. \n     Excess revenue generated by the Federal Housing \n     Administration (``FHA'') and the Government National Mortgage \n     Association (``GNMA'') will be transferred to the Trust Fund \n     in fiscal year 2001 and each year thereafter for eligible \n     uses.\n       FHA revenue, in excess of an amount necessary for the FHA \n     to retain 3% capital, will be transferred to the Trust Fund. \n     FHA is currently required to maintain 2% capital. GNMA \n     revenues will also be captured, above what the Secretary \n     determines is necessary for safe and sound operations.\n\n\n  section 4: administration of national affordable housing trust fund\n\n       This Section describes how Trust Fund assistance will be \n     allocated and for what uses. 75% of Trust Fund assistance \n     will be given as matching grants to States and 25% will be \n     awarded by HUD through a national competition, as follows:\n       Matching Grants to States. 75% of the Trust Fund will be \n     given as matching grants to States on a formula based on \n     factors related to need for housing in the State. States will \n     be required to match 25% of the federal grant with non-\n     federal funds. If a State does not come up with the requisite \n     match, public and non-profit entities can apply for the \n     State's portion of funds.\n       States will distribute assistance according to need and \n     criteria, including: whether the development will be mixed \n     income; whether the development is located in a low-poverty \n     census tract or a community experiencing revitalization; and \n     the amount of additional funding devoted to the project.\n       75% of Trust Fund assistance distributed by each State must \n     be used for the construction of rental housing for extremely \n     low-income households (income under 30% of area median \n     income) in mixed income developments which must remain \n     affordable for 40 years. The bill establishes a ``Continued \n     Assistance Rental Subsidy Program'' under which a developer \n     may use funds for up to three years of operating subsidy, so \n     long as it partners with a local housing agency to ensure a \n     stream of eligible tenants to the units, and the housing \n     agency agrees to provide any tenant in those units with a \n     voucher to move if the tenant so chooses.\n       The other 25% of assistance may be used for low-income \n     families (incomes under 80% of area median income) for \n     construction of rental housing or for homeownership \n     activities.\n\n                          National Competition\n\n       25% of the Trust Fund will be awarded by HUD through \n     competitive grants to non-profit intermediaries, who will use \n     and distribute the funds based on the same criteria as \n     required by the States. While there is no specific matching \n     requirement, HUD must give priority to those intermediaries \n     which leverage the greatest amount of private and non-federal \n     funds.\n       Like the State grants, 75% of assistance must be used for \n     rental housing for extremely low-income households in mixed \n     income developments, and the units must remain affordable for \n     40 years, and the other 25% of assistance must be used for \n     low-income families for rental housing or homeownership \n     activities. However, if a project contributes to a community \n     revitalization plan, these targeting requirements are waived, \n     so long as the households assisted in the project have \n     incomes under 60% of the area median income.\n\n\n                         section 5: regulations\n\n       HUD is required to promulgate regulations within 6 months \n     of the date of enactment of this bill.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Citizens' Housing and\n\n\n                                   Planning Association, Inc.,\n\n                                        Boston, MA, July 26, 2000.\n     Senator John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of Citizens' Housing and \n     Planning Association (CHAPA), I wanted to express our strong \n     support for the national housing trust fund legislation that \n     you will be filing this week. CHAPA is the largest and most \n     diverse housing advocacy organization in New England, \n     representing more than 1,500 housing providers, advocates, \n     government officials, lenders, and others.\n       In Massachusetts, we are in the midst of the most acute \n     housing crisis on record. The number of Massachusetts \n     households with severe housing needs has reached an all-time \n     high. Nearly 245,000 households pay more than half of their \n     incomes for rent, a 21 percent jump since 1990. Since 1997, \n     10,000 Massachusetts families have been homeless each year, \n     double the number since 1990.\n       The clear solution to this problem is to build and preserve \n     more affordable housing for low income families. The trust \n     fund legislation, which you are sponsoring, will lead to the \n     creation of thousands of affordable rental units across the \n     country. We are pleased that the focus of this program will \n     be to create new housing for low income families who are \n     facing the biggest housing squeeze.\n       We also are extremely pleased that the trust fund provides \n     flexible funds to the states and non-profit developers so \n     that these entities can tailor solutions to meet local needs. \n     The proposed program encourages the leveraging of private \n     funds and the creation of mixed income housing.\n       Thank you once again for playing an outstanding leadership \n     role on affordable housing. We hope that Congress will act \n     expeditiously on this critical legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Aaron Gornstein,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Housing Conference,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2000.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Senate Russell Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We, the National Housing Conference, \n     would like to extend our thanks to you for introducing the \n     National Housing Trust Fund Act of 2000. The NHC is a broad-\n     based nonpartisan advocate for national policies that promote \n     suitable housing in a safe, decent environment across the \n     nation. The NHC consists of members from across the entire \n     spectrum of the housing industry. Since 1931, the NHC has \n     demonstrated itself to be known as the united voice for \n     housing.\n       We are writing to pledge our support for your act because \n     we know you understand that:\n       (1) There is a compelling need for federal legislation to \n     construct affordable housing. Last month, our research \n     affiliate, the Center for Housing Policy, released a report \n     titled ``Housing America's Working Families.'' The report \n     demonstrated that despite the unprecedented economic \n     prosperity that this nation has been experiencing, one out of \n     every seven families has a critical housing need--They are \n     either spending over half their total income on rent or they \n     are living in severely inadequate units. These families--many \n     of them moderate-income working families--are teetering on an \n     all-too precarious ledge. Housing is a fundamental human need \n     and we believe that it is a shame that so many of America's \n     families are faced with such pressing housing problems, \n     particularly in an era of such economic abundance.\n       (2) The National Housing Trust Fund Act of 2000 would help \n     alleviate that need. The Act would allocate much needed funds \n     toward the construction and preservation of a range of \n     quality housing choices for low and moderate income people. \n     An increase in affordable housing options would provide many \n     needy families with better equalities of life. The National \n     Housing Trust Fund would supplement and complement existing \n     supply-oriented programs such as public housing, HOME, and \n     the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. Furthermore, Ann Schnare, \n     President of the Center for Housing Policy said in a \n     testimony on June 20th before Senator Allard, ``Many states \n     and local jurisdictions have established Housing Trust Funds \n     to capture revenue from many sources for affordable housing. \n     An analogous trust fund should be established at the federal \n     level. . . It could further encourage and strengthen \n     affordable housing efforts at the state and local levels by \n     providing incentives and developing partnerships with various \n     entities.''\n       It is important to note that the National Housing Trust \n     Fund would be in addition to existing appropriated funds and \n     would not supplant those appropriations. It would be financed \n     solely by excess income generated by the FHA and by Ginnie \n     Mae. If we establish this National Housing Trust Fund we will\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\n     ensure for countless future generations of Americans that \n     there will always be dependable affordable housing options.\n       Clearly, the National Housing Trust Fund Act is a good step \n     in the right direction. Too many people in our country are \n     lacking a fundamental human necessity--adequate housing. This \n     act would create provisions to mitigate some of this critical \n     housing need. Trust funds have been developed in the past for \n     other national priorities such as Social Security, highways, \n     and airports. We're glad that you agree that it is about time \n     for us to make housing a national priority as well.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Robert J. Reid,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Realtors,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, Committee on \n         Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the more than 760,000 \n     members of the National Association of Realtors, I am pleased \n     to indicate our support for your legislation. The National \n     Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2000. We believe this \n     important legislation reduces the barriers to affordable \n     housing production and closes the gap in needed housing \n     opportunities for American families, and we welcome the \n     opportunity to work with you to gain its passage.\n       As you know, millions of working American families are \n     facing a housing affordability crisis despite an \n     unprecedented run of economic growth and prosperity. This \n     phenomenon is exacerbated by the continuing decline of our \n     nation's affordable housing stock. The increase in demand \n     coupled with the diminishing supply of affordable units are \n     straining housing capacity in many communities nationwide, \n     leading to a rise in homelessness for many worthy American \n     working families.\n       The National Association of Realtors believes the time is \n     appropriate to address our nation's affordable housing crisis \n     as a national priority and forge a coherent and focused set \n     of policies for immediate adoption. Your legislation \n     establishing a trust fund utilizing revenues created through \n     the popular and successful FHA homeownership program for \n     usage in other critical housing areas is an insightful and \n     innovative response to the shortage of affordable housing \n     units. We strongly support this objective and we stand ready \n     to work with you and the Subcommittee during deliberation of \n     your bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis R. Cronk,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Association of Home Builders, Federal Government \n           Affairs Division,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2000.\n     Hon. John Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Subcommittee on Housing and \n         Transportation, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the 200,000 members of the \n     National Association of Home Builders (NAHB), I want to \n     extend to you our appreciation and support for your efforts \n     to introduce legislation to establish a ``National Affordable \n     Housing Trust Fund''.\n       NAHB supports your proposal to establish a National \n     Affordable Housing Trust Fund for the production of \n     affordable housing. Indeed, your goal to divert funds from \n     both the ``surplus'' existing within the Mutual Mortgage \n     Insurance Fund (MMI Fund) and excess revenue generated by the \n     Government National Mortgage Association into affordable \n     housing development, is laudable. The growing need for decent \n     affordable housing is well documented. We appreciate your \n     work and interest in this issue and want to assist you in any \n     way to facilitate movement of this legislation.\n       Again, thank you for your efforts to address the shortage \n     of affordable housing in America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gerald M. Howard,\n     Senior Staff Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Council of\n\n\n                                       State Housing Agencies,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the housing finance \n     agencies (HFAs) of the 50 states, the National Council of \n     State Housing Agencies (NCSHA) commends you for introducing \n     the ``National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act'' (Trust). \n     Given the tremendous and ever-growing need for decent and \n     affordable housing, it is imperative that any surplus the FHA \n     fund generates be rededicated to housing America's low income \n     families.\n       In this era of unprecedented economic prosperity, the \n     number of families experiencing worst case housing needs has \n     increased dramatically. According to a recent study published \n     by The Center for Housing Policy, 13.7 million families had \n     critical housing needs in 1997, including six million working \n     and nearly four million elderly households. In the face of \n     these alarming statistics, the affordable housing stock has \n     lost over one million units between 1993 and 1998.\n       Housing need, though great everywhere, varies dramatically \n     among and within the states. In some states, newly produced \n     rental housing for very low income families is the greatest \n     need. In others, preserving the irreplaceable low-cost rental \n     inventory is the highest priority.\n       Your bill responds effectively to these diverse housing \n     needs by allocating Trust funds directly to the states. \n     States understand their housing needs and are in the best \n     position to leverage these funds with other housing \n     resources. The sound and efficient administration of the \n     Housing Credit and the HOME programs are clear evidence of \n     states' capacity to administer the Trust fund.\n       We look forward to working with you as you move this bill \n     forward to design a delivery system that relies on the states \n     and their private and public sector partners to direct these \n     precious resources to their most pressing housing needs. \n     Thank you for all you are doing to expand affordable housing \n     opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Barbara J. Thompson,\n     Director of Policy and Government Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Low Income\n\n\n                                      Housing Coalition/LIHIS,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of the National Low Income \n     Housing Coalition. I am pleased to offer our support for the \n     National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act of 2000, which you \n     will introduce shortly. HLIHC is a membership organization \n     dedicated solely to ending the affordable housing crisis in \n     America. The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund that you \n     propose offers concrete and sustainable resources towards \n     achieving that goal.\n       The dimensions of the affordable housing crisis are well \n     documented. As you know, nowhere in the United States can a \n     full time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom unit at \n     the fair market rent. The housing wage, that is, the hourly \n     wage one must earn to afford the fair market rent, ranges \n     from $8.02 in West Virginia to $17.01 in Hawaii. The supply \n     of housing that is affordable to low wage workers and elderly \n     and disabled people on fixed incomes is dwindling while the \n     rents of the remaining units are escalating. Even those \n     families that are fortunate enough to receive a federal \n     housing voucher often are not able to find housing they can \n     afford with the voucher. The need for new affordable housing \n     production resources is serious and urgent.\n       The Housing Trust Fund provides a dedicated source of \n     funding for the production or rehabilitation of rental \n     housing. The use of excess revenue from FHA and Ginnie Mae \n     for this purpose is sensible housing policy. We are very \n     pleased that a majority of the funds will be targeted to \n     housing that is to be affordable to extremely low income \n     households for at least 40 years. This is the population with \n     the most severe housing problems and for whom the fewest \n     resources are available to increase the supply of affordable \n     housing. We also commend the decision to make operating \n     support an eligible activity for three years and the \n     preference for projects that can demonstrate an ongoing \n     source of operating subsidy.\n       We look forward to working with you towards passage of this \n     important new federal housing legislation. Thank you for your \n     continued leadership on housing issues in the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila Crowley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        National Coalition for the\n\n\n                                                     Homeless,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Senator John Kerry,\n     Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: ``They've got jobs, they just can't \n     find housing they can afford,'' is the comment we hear from \n     local providers across the country as they talk about the \n     unmet housing needs of an increasing number of families and \n     individuals who have consequently become homeless in their \n     communities. It is, therefore, with great enthusiasm that the \n     National Coalition for the Homeless supports the National \n     Affordable Housing Trust Fund, and strongly encourages its \n     expedited enactment and implementation.\n       As you know, for the past two decades, we have been \n     consistently rescinding our commitment to ``decent housing \n     for all Americans''. As a result, the need for affordable \n     housing is profound throughout the nation, in communities of \n     diverse sizes and socio-economic circumstances, and most \n     especially among extremely low-income households. For this \n     reason, we are seeing an unprecedented number of employed men \n     and women who have been forced into homelessness. I was \n     recently visiting a 250-bed single men's shelter in a urban \n     setting, where 70% of the residents were employed, most full \n     time, and what they got for their efforts, was a thin mat on \n     a concrete floor to call their `home'. We are also finding \n     very significant rates of homelessness among families who are \n     doing what they have been asked to do--moving from welfare to \n     work--but because of their low-wages are not able to afford \n     stable housing in healthy neighborhoods, which compromises \n     both their long-term employability and the health and well-\n     being of their children. We all want welfare reform to work; \n     the missing link has always been affordable housing.\n       Knowing that the availability of affordable housing is \n     fundamental to insuring that\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\n     working families can expect to meet their basic needs, we are \n     very grateful for your leadership in taking us as a nation \n     down the path of truly valuing individual and family \n     stability enough to ensure housing opportunities for those \n     without the resources to do it alone. The National Affordable \n     Housing Trust Fund represents America at her best--\n     opportunities and basic resources being made available to all \n     among us. Thank you for helping to bring America home again.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Mary Ann Gleason,\n     Housing Policy Analyst.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Enterprise Foundation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2000.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Housing and Transportation, \n         Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, Senate \n         Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: On behalf of The Enterprise Foundation, \n     the more than 1,500 community development organizations that \n     we represent and the millions of low-income Americans living \n     in poverty, we applaud your efforts to increase the number of \n     permanently affordable homes available for those families \n     most in need by establishing The National Affordable Housing \n     Trust Fund. The proposed legislation, ``The National \n     Affordable Housing Trust Fund of 2000,'' provides additional \n     funding to the states and nonprofit organizations for the \n     development of decent, safe and affordable housing for low-\n     income families.\n       The Enterprise Foundation is a national nonprofit housing \n     and community development organization dedicated to \n     rebuilding distressed neighborhoods. Central to our mission \n     is to see that all low-income people in the United States \n     have the opportunity for fit and affordable housing and to \n     move up and out of poverty into the mainstream of American \n     life. Therefore, we see firsthand the critical need for this \n     legislation as a way to combat the growing affordable housing \n     crisis faced by our nation.\n       At a time of unprecedented national prosperity, it is \n     unconscionable that an ever larger number of Americans have \n     trouble securing decent, affordable housing. In fact, it is a \n     side effect of our booming economy that rents are rising \n     faster than wages for poor working Americans. This historic \n     legislation recognizes that now is the time to deal with our \n     national need to produce more safe and sanitary housing for \n     low-income Americans.\n       Your bill strikes a thoughtful balance between devolution \n     to the states and federal innovation. It allows states to \n     decide how to spend the majority of the grant funds according \n     to their housing needs but also allows for federal funding of \n     innovative private/public partnership models as a way to \n     leverage limited public resources.\n       We look forward to working with you on this bill throughout \n     the legislative process and admire your leadership and \n     continued efforts to address the critical housing needs of \n     our nation's lower-income families. With your support we look \n     forward to continuing our mission to rebuild distressed \n     communities by providing people the tools they need to move \n     out of poverty.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Kristin Siglin,\n                                                   Vice President.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act introduced \nby Senator Kerry. Establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund \nis a necessary and timely legislative initiative.\n  The number of families in our country who live in substandard \nhousing, or pay more than 50 percent of their income for housing \ncosts--the factors considered in determining worst case housing need--\nis staggering. Recent studies show that 5.4 million American families \nhave worst case housing needs. This is 100,000 more families than were \nclassified as worst case housing needs just last year.\n  In addition, no family making minimum wage can afford the fair market \nrent for a two bedroom apartment in any metro area in the country. On \naverage, a person needs to earn over $11 to afford an apartment in any \nAmerican metro area, but this number is even higher in many parts of \nthe country. For instance, in Baltimore a person must earn over $12 an \nhour, or $24,000 a year to afford the rent on a two bedroom apartment.\n  Traditionally, the government has helped families who do not earn \nenough to afford a place to live with section 8 vouchers. However, in \ntoday's booming real estate market, a section 8 voucher is no guarantee \nof finding a place to live.\n  Currently, families in Maryland wait upwards of 31 months to get a \nsection 8 housing voucher. Once they receive the voucher, they face a \nnew challenge: finding an apartment that is affordable for them.\n  Recent articles in the Washington Post have highlighted the trials of \npoor working families attempting to find affordable housing both with \nand without federal assistance. One Fairfax, Virginia woman working \nfull time and living in a shelter called over 30 landlords, none of \nwhich had vacancies that she could afford. Another social worker \ncommented that the voucher holders she counseled had to call close to \n100 different developments to find a unit. The reality is that there \nare simply not enough affordable housing units in our country to meet \nthe needs of low income Americans.\n  This situation is simply unacceptable. The working poor of our \ncountry deserve decent places to live. Adequate housing is an essential \nneed for all Americans. It is the anchor that allows families to \nthrive.\n  Children can't learn if they are forced to attend 3 or 4 schools in a \nsingle year as their parents move from friend to friend because they \ncannot afford the rent. Workers can't find jobs or get training if they \nspend their days fighting to put a roof over their kids' heads. A sick \nperson will not get well if she spends her days huddled on a grate, \nwaiting for a bed in an emergency shelter.\n  Senator Kerry's bill would address our country's severe affordable \nhousing crisis by establishing an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that \nwill support the construction of additional affordable housing.\n  The Trust Fund is designed to create long-term affordable, mixed \nincome housing developments in areas where low-income families will \nhave access to transportation, social services, and job opportunities. \nIt is also designed to help in areas where local governments are \ncommitted to revitalization. These priorities are explicitly laid out \nin the legislation.\n  The bottom line is that we need to provide more resources to states, \nlocal governments and non-profits who are working to build more \naffordable housing. Unless we build more affordable units we will not \nbe able to solve the housing crisis we have today.\n  This bill is an opportunity for us to take advantage of our booming \neconomy to do this. I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting \nNational Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues here \ntoday as co-sponsor of this bill which represents an important step \nforward in solving the shortage of affordable housing. The need for \naffordable housing has reached epic proportions and touches all of our \ncommunities. The time for action is now.\n  The National Affordable Housing Trust Fund will be used to produce \nhousing that is affordable to very low income families. It will provide \nstates matching grant funds to produce affordable housing and engage in \nhomeownership activities. It will allow non-profit intermediaries to \ncompete for funds to produce housing. Most importantly, however, is it \nwill use the proceeds from our investment in promoting homeownership to \nbuild homes for low income families.\n  Mr. President, in 1997, 5.4 million households with 12.3 million \npeople paid more than one half of their income in rent or lived in \nseriously substandard housing. Who are these 12.3 million people? 1.5 \nmillion are elderly persons, 4.3 million are children and between 1.1 \nand 1.4 million are adults with disabilities. We can afford to do \nbetter. This is a prosperous nation that can afford to solve this \nproblem.\n  In may own states of Minnesota, a worker must earn $11.54 an hour, 40 \nhours a week, 522 weeks out of the year to afford a fair market rent \nfor a two bedroom apartment. $11.54. That's more than double the \nminimum wage. In fact, to afford a two bedroom apartment at minimum \nwage, families must work 88 hours a week. 88 hours. That's barely \npossible for a two parent family, and it is completely impossible for \nsingle parent families.\n  The poorest families are particularly hard hit. In Minneapolis-St. \nPaul, a study conducted by the Family Housing Fund found 68,900 renters \nwith incomes below $10,000 in Minneapolis-St. Paul and only 31,200 \nhousing units with rents affordable to those families. That is more \nthan two families for each unit affordable to a family at that income \nlevel and there is every indication it is getting worse.\n  Given this information, it isn't hard to understand why the number of \nfamilies entering emergency shelters and\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\nusing emergency food pantries is on the rise. In fact, more and more of \nthe homeless are working full time and are still unable to find \nhousing.\n  Mr. President, we must do more. The shortage of affordable housing is \nso drastic that in Minneapolis-St. Paul, like many other cities, even \nthose families fortunate enough to receive housing vouchers cannot find \na rental unit. Landlords are becoming increasingly selective given the \ndemand for housing and are requiring three months security deposit, \nhefty application fees and credit checks that price the poor and young \nnew renters out of the market.\n  Let me share a story that truly struck me. In February, the \nMinneapolis Public Housing Authority distributed applications for \nfamilies in the region interested in public housing. This was the first \ntime since 1996 applications were accepted for public housing and it \nwill likely to be last time for several years. Six thousand families \nsought applications for public housing in six days. An average of 1,000 \nfamilies each day requested applications to reside in public housing in \none metropolitan area.\n  Those families were not applying for free housing. Residents would be \nrequired to pay one third of their income in rent. This is not luxury \nhousing. Many families seem to look upon public housing with disdain, \nthough I know those communities are rich with the talents and \ncontributions of their tenants. This is not even immediate housing. \nMany of those families will wait years to get into public housing.\n  Clearly this is a sign that the demand for housing far exceeds the \nsupply. There is an immediate need to produce more affordable housing. \nFortunately, we can afford to do this. Fortunately, we have a plan to \ndo this.\n  Mr. President, I know it is hard to think about poverty when we are \nsurrounded by so much prosperity. But economic prosperity has not \ntouched every family. Instead the gap between income groups continues \nto widen and the gap between what low income families earn and what \nthey must pay for housing also appears to be widening.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics report that between 1995 and 1997 \nrents increased faster than income for the 20 percent of American \nhouseholds with the lowest incomes. The Consumer Price Index for \nResident Rent rose 6.2 percent, higher than the 3.9 percent rate of \ninflation for the same period.\n  The skyrocketing rents are fueled by the shortage of housing. The \ndemand for housing exceeds the supply, so in the private market the \nrents spiral upwards and far beyond the reach of the poor and often \nwell-beyond the reach of the middle class who find themselves priced \nout of the very communities they grew up in.\n  This affects families with children, elderly persons and persons with \ndisabilities. It affects the well-being of businesses. The cost of \nhousing has skyrocketed in some communities to a level that businesses \ncannot retain workers because their workers cannot afford to live in \nthose communities. The shortage of housing is making it difficult for \ncommunities to retain some of our most essential workers. Police, \nfiremen, teachers are all being priced out of the very communities they \nseek to serve!\n\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be part of this effort that will \ngenerate more affordable housing for low income families. It is time to \nheed the call we are all hearing from our constituents. There is not \none town, county or metropolitan area in this nation where a family can \nafford a two bedroom fair market rental working full time, year round \nat minimum wage. Not one state where a family who receives TANF can \nafford a two bedroom fair market rental unit.\n  Families respond to the shortage of housing by crowding into smaller \nunits. A one bedroom. An efficiency. Perhaps they rent seriously \nsubstandard housing, exposing their children to lead poisoning, living \nin neighborhoods where they don't feel safe allowing their children to \nplay outdoors. Housing with leaky roofs, bad plumbing, rodents, \nroaches. Perhaps they pay more than the recommended 30 percent of their \nincome in rent, maybe 40 percent, 50 percent or more.\n  Families may do without what we might consider necessities. Not \nluxuries, but necessities such as gas, heat, and electricity. Families \nso financially stressed that one small crisis can send them tumbling. \nPerhaps families double up, two families in a home. Multiple \ngenerations crowded under one roof. When the stress of multiple \nfamilies becomes unbearable, they are left with homeless shelters.\n  Mr. President, in a recent study of homelessness in Minneapolis-St. \nPaul, The Family Housing Fund reported that more and more children \nexperience homelessness. In one night in 1987, 244 children in the Twin \nCities were in a shelter or other temporary housing. In 1999, 1,770 \nchildren were housed in shelter or temporary housing. Let me repeat \nthat, 1,770 children in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area on one night \nalone sent the night in a homeless shelter or temporary housing. Seven \ntimes the number in 1987. And families are spending longer periods of \ntime homeless. If they have a family crisis, if they lost their housing \ndue to an eviction, if they have poor credit histories, if they can't \nsave up enough for a two or three month security deposit, they will \nhave longer stretches, longer periods of time in emergency shelters \nbefore they transition into homes.\n  Mr. President, we are experiencing unprecedented prosperity. It is \ntime to make a commitment to ensuring families have access to decent \naffordable housing. We can afford to do this. In fact, we cannot afford \nnot to do this.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB:\n  S. 3000.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas every day in the United States, 12 children under \n     the age of 19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas 31 percent of children aged 12 to 17 know someone \n     in that age bracket who carries a gun;\n       Whereas during the 1996-1997 school year, 5,724 students \n     were expelled for bringing guns or explosives to school;\n       Whereas the homicide rate for children under 15 years of \n     age is 16 times higher in the United States than in 25 other \n     industrialized nations;\n       Whereas over the past year, at least 50 people have been \n     killed or injured in school shootings in the United States;\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear \n     and violence;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of \n     National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence'' will \n     allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about \n     their future in that such students will have the opportunity \n     to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun \n     Violence'', and promise that they will never take a gun to \n     school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will \n     actively use their influence in a positive manner to prevent \n     friends from using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National \n     Concern About Young People and Gun Violence''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the school children of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution that has\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\npassed the Senate for the past four years unanimously. My resolution, \nwhich I am introducing today with Senator Warner and 31 original \ncosponsors establishes October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National Concern \nabout Young People and Gun Violence.'' For the last several years, I \nhave sponsored this legislation. I am pleased that Senator Warner has \njoined me again in leading the cosponsorship drive as we pledge to our \nyoung people across the nation that we support their strong efforts to \nhelp stop the violence in their own schools and communities. I thank \nSenator Warner for his help and partnership.\n  Sadly, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the \ntragic events that occurred in the last couple of years. School \nshootings across the nation have paralyzed communities and shocked the \ncountry. In recent years, we've seen school shootings from Mississippi \nto Oregon. In fact, just two weeks ago, a thirteen year old boy in \nSeattle, Washington, opened fire in a crowded cafeteria at his junior \nhigh school. Luckily no one was hurt. These events have touched us all. \nAdults and young people alike have been horrified by the violence that \nhas occurred in our schools, which should be a safe haven for our \nchildren. We are left wondering what we can do to prevent these \ntragedies.\n  I am again introducing this resolution because I am convinced the \nbest way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual \nchildren and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution \nestablishes a special day that gives parents, teachers, government \nleaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a way to focus \non the problems caused by gun violence. It also empowers young people \nto take affirmative steps to end this violence by encouraging them to \ntake a pledge not to use guns to resolve disputes.\n  A Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of student \npledges and for a ``Day of National Concern for Young People and Gun \nViolence.'' In addition, Mothers Against Violence in America, the \nNational Parent Teacher Association, the American Federation of \nTeachers, the National Association of Student Councils, and the \nAmerican Medical Association have joined the effort to establish a \nspecial day to express concern about our children and gun violence and \nto support a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge \nagainst gun violence. In 1999, more than two million students across \nthe nation signed the pledge card.\n  The Student Pledge Against Gun Violence gives students the chance to \nmake a promise, in writing, that they will do their part to prevent gun \nviolence. The students' pledge promises three things: (1) they will \nnever carry a gun to school; (2) they will never resolve a dispute with \na gun; and (3) they will use their influence with friends to discourage \nthem from resolving disputes with guns.\n  Just think of the lives we could have saved if all students had \nsigned--and lived up to--such a pledge last year. Twelve children would \nhave been alive today and 50 people would have escaped injury from a \nschool shooting. The reality is we've lost many children in what has \nbecome the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars, \nand other crime and in self-inflicted and unintentional shootings.\n  We all have been heartened by statistics showing crime in America on \nthe decline. Many factors are involved, including community-based \npolicing, stiffer sentences for those convicted, youth crime prevention \nprograms, and changes in population demographics. None of us intend to \nrest on our success because we still have far too much crime and \nviolence in our society.\n  So, we must find the solutions that work and focus our limited \nresources on resources on those. We must get tough on violent \ncriminals--even of they are young--to protect the rest of society from \ntheir terrible actions. And we, each and every one of us, must make \ntime to spend with our children, our neighbor's children, and the \nchildren who have no one else to care about them. Only when we reach \nout to our most vulnerable citizens--our kids--will we stop youth \nviolence.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join in this simple effort to focus \nattention on gun violence among youth by proclaiming October 17 a ``Day \nof Concern about Young People and Gun Violence.'' October is National \nCrime Prevention Month--the perfect time to center our attention of the \nspecial needs of our kids and gun violence. We introduce this \nresolution today in the hopes of getting every Senator to cosponsor it \nprior to this passage, which we hope will occur in early September. \nThis is an easy step for us to help facilitate the work that must go on \nin each community across America, as parents, teachers, friends and \nstudents try to prevent gun violence before it ruins any more lives.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce a \nresolution with my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, to \nestablish October 17, 2000, as the Day of National Concern About Young \nPeople and Gun Violence.\n  According to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, 10 \nchildren and teens across the country are killed by firearms each day. \nThis statistic is an alarming one, but, nevertheless, statistics can be \nso impersonal. We must remember that these 10 children lost everyday \nare real people. They are children, they are brothers, they are \nsisters, and they are grandchildren to real people. They are also a \nlost part of our future as a country. When put in real terms such as \nthis, it is difficult to imagine a more important task facing our great \nnation than eliminating gun violence among America's youth.\n  We all remember the events in Conyers, Georgia; Littleton, Colorado; \nPeal, Mississippi; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and \nSpringfield, Oregon, Neighborhoods in these areas have all been home to \nhorrific school shootings. Youth gun violence, however, is not limited \nto these all too often incidences of school shootings. America has lost \nthousands of children in what has become the all-too-common violence of \ndrive-by shootings, drug wars and other crimes, as well as in self-\ninflicted and unintentional shootings.\n  The good news in our fight against youth gun violence is that child \ngun deaths in America have fallen every year since 1994. Nevertheless, \nMr. President, 10 deaths a day is 10 too many.\n  While there is no simple solution as to how to stop youth violence, a \nMinnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of a Day of \nNational Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. I believe this \nidea is a step in the right direction, as do such groups as Mothers \nAgainst Violence in America, the National Association of Student \nCouncils, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Parent \nTeacher Associations, and the American Medical Association.\n  Simply put, this resolution will establish October 17, 2000, as the \nDay of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this \nday, students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to \nvoluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence.'' By \nsigning the pledge, students promise that they will never take a gun to \nschool, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will use their \ninfluence in a positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to \nsettle disputes.\n  Just last year over 2 million young Americans signed the Student \nPledge Against Gun Violence. I am confident the number of student's \nsigning this year's pledge will be even greater. Though this resolution \nis not the ultimate solution to preventing future tragedies, if it \nstops even one incident of youth gun violence, this resolution will be \ninvaluable. I urge all of my colleagues to join in this resolution to \nfocus attention on gun violence among youth.\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/27/senate-section/article/S7923-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7923-S7925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 345--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 17, 2000, AS A ``DAY OF \n         NATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT YOUNG PEOPLE AND GUN VIOLENCE''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Warner, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nCampbell, Mr. L.

Res. 345\n\n       Whereas every day in the United States, 12 children under \n     the age of 19 are killed with guns;\n       Whereas 31 percent of children aged 12 to 17 know someone \n     in that age bracket who carries a gun;\n       Whereas during the 1996-1997 school year, 5,724 students \n     were expelled for bringing guns or explosives to school;\n       Whereas the homicide rate for children under 15 years of \n     age is 16 times higher in the United States than in 25 other \n     industrialized nations;\n       Whereas over the past year, at least 50 people have been \n     killed or injured in school shootings in the United States;\n       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important \n     resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in \n     enabling children to grow in an environment free from fear \n     and violence;\n       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for \n     their own decisions and actions, and by positively \n     influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a \n     new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;\n       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation \n     will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide \n     observance involving millions of their fellow students, and \n     will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant \n     agents in a wave of positive social change; and\n       Whereas the observance of October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of \n     National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence'' will \n     allow students to make a positive and earnest decision about \n     their future in that such students will have the opportunity \n     to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun \n     Violence'', and promise that they will never take a gun to \n     school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will \n     actively use their influence in a positive manner to prevent \n     friends from using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National \n     Concern About Young People and Gun Violence''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling on the school children of the United States to \n     observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution that has\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\npassed the Senate for the past four years unanimously. My resolution, \nwhich I am introducing today with Senator Warner and 31 original \ncosponsors establishes October 17, 2000, as a ``Day of National Concern \nabout Young People and Gun Violence.'' For the last several years, I \nhave sponsored this legislation. I am pleased that Senator Warner has \njoined me again in leading the cosponsorship drive as we pledge to our \nyoung people across the nation that we support their strong efforts to \nhelp stop the violence in their own schools and communities. I thank \nSenator Warner for his help and partnership.\n  Sadly, this resolution has special meaning for all of us after the \ntragic events that occurred in the last couple of years. School \nshootings across the nation have paralyzed communities and shocked the \ncountry. In recent years, we've seen school shootings from Mississippi \nto Oregon. In fact, just two weeks ago, a thirteen year old boy in \nSeattle, Washington, opened fire in a crowded cafeteria at his junior \nhigh school. Luckily no one was hurt. These events have touched us all. \nAdults and young people alike have been horrified by the violence that \nhas occurred in our schools, which should be a safe haven for our \nchildren. We are left wondering what we can do to prevent these \ntragedies.\n  I am again introducing this resolution because I am convinced the \nbest way to prevent gun violence is by reaching out to individual \nchildren and helping them make the right decisions. This resolution \nestablishes a special day that gives parents, teachers, government \nleaders, service clubs, police departments, and others a way to focus \non the problems caused by gun violence. It also empowers young people \nto take affirmative steps to end this violence by encouraging them to \ntake a pledge not to use guns to resolve disputes.\n  A Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of student \npledges and for a ``Day of National Concern for Young People and Gun \nViolence.'' In addition, Mothers Against Violence in America, the \nNational Parent Teacher Association, the American Federation of \nTeachers, the National Association of Student Councils, and the \nAmerican Medical Association have joined the effort to establish a \nspecial day to express concern about our children and gun violence and \nto support a national effort to encourage students to sign a pledge \nagainst gun violence.

In selecting a location \n     or locations for the establishment of a prototype harbor \n     safety committee, the Coast Guard shall--\n       (1) consider the results of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a);\n       (2) consider identified safety issues for a particular \n     port;\n       (3) compare the potential benefits of establishing such a \n     committee with the burdens the establishment of such a \n     committee would impose on participating agencies and \n     organizations;\n       (4) consider the anticipated level of support from \n     interested parties; and\n       (5) take into account such other factors as may be \n     appropriate.\n       (c) Effect on Existing Programs and State Law.--Nothing in \n     this section--\n       (1) limits the scope or activities of harbor safety \n     committees in existence on the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) precludes the establishment of new harbor safety \n     committees in locations not selected for the establishment of \n     a prototype committee under subsection (b); or\n       (3) preempts State law.\n       (d) Nonapplication of FACA.--The Federal Advisory Committee \n     Act (5 U.S.C. App.) does not apply to harbor safety \n     committees established under this section or any other \n     provision of law.\n       (e) Harbor Safety Committee Defined.--In this section, the \n     term ``harbor safety committee'' means a local coordinating \n     body--\n       (1) whose responsibilities include recommending actions to \n     improve the safety of a port or waterway; and\n       (2) the membership of which includes representatives of \n     government agencies, maritime labor and industry \n     organizations, environmental groups, and public interest \n     groups.\n\n     SEC. 505.

PURPOSES AND FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to combat \n     trafficking in persons, a contemporary manifestation of \n     slavery whose victims are predominantly women and children, \n     to ensure just and effective punishment of traffickers, and \n     to protect their victims.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) As we begin the 21st century, the degrading institution \n     of slavery continues throughout the world. Sex trafficking is \n     a modern day form of slavery and it is the largest \n     manifestation of slavery today. Millions of people every \n     year, primarily women and children, are trafficked within or \n     across international borders. Approximately 50,000 women and \n     children are trafficked into the United States each year.\n       (2) Many of these persons are trafficked into the \n     international sex trade, often by force, fraud, or coercion. \n     The sex industry has rapidly expanded over the past several \n     decades. It involves sexual exploitation of persons, \n     predominantly women and girls, involving activities related \n     to prostitution, pornography, sex tourism, and other \n     commercial sexual services. The low status of women in many \n     parts of the world has contributed to a burgeoning of the \n     trafficking industry.\n\n[[Page S7939]]\n\n       (3) Trafficking in persons is not limited to the sex \n     industry. This growing transnational crime also includes \n     forced labor, and involves significant violations of minimal \n     labor, public health, and human rights standards worldwide.\n       (4) Traffickers primarily target women and girls, who are \n     disproportionately affected by poverty, lack of access to \n     education, chronic unemployment, discrimination, and lack of \n     viable economic opportunities in countries of origin. \n     Traffickers lure women and girls into their networks through \n     false promises of decent working conditions at relatively \n     good pay as nannies, maids, dancers, factory workers, \n     restaurant workers, sales clerks, or models. Traffickers also \n     buy children from poor families and sell them into \n     prostitution or into various types of forced or bonded labor.\n       (5) Traffickers often transport victims from their home \n     communities to unfamiliar destinations, including different \n     countries away from family and friends, religious \n     institutions, and other sources of protection and support, \n     leaving the victims defenseless and vulnerable.\n       (6) Victims are often forced through physical violence to \n     engage in sex acts or perform slavery-like labor. Such force \n     includes rape and other forms of sexual abuse, torture, \n     starvation, imprisonment, threats, psychological abuse, and \n     coercion.\n       (7) Traffickers often make representations to their victims \n     that physical harm may occur to them or others should they \n     escape or attempt to escape. Such threats can have the same \n     coercive effects on victims as actual infliction of harm.\n       (8) Trafficking in persons is increasingly perpetrated by \n     organized, sophisticated criminal enterprises. Such \n     trafficking is the fastest growing source of profits for \n     organized criminal enterprises worldwide. Profits from the \n     trafficking industry contribute to the expansion of organized \n     crime in the United States and worldwide. Trafficking often \n     is aided by official corruption in countries of origin, \n     transit, and destination, thereby threatening the rule of \n     law.\n       (9) Trafficking includes all the elements of the crime of \n     forcible rape, when it involves the involuntary participation \n     of another person in sex acts by means of fraud, force, or \n     coercion.\n       (10) Trafficking also involves violations of other laws, \n     including labor and immigration codes and laws against \n     kidnapping, slavery, false imprisonment, assault, battery, \n     pandering, fraud, and extortion.\n       (11) Trafficking exposes victims to serious health risk. \n     Women and children trafficked into the sex industry are \n     exposed to deadly diseases, including HIV and AIDS. \n     Trafficking victims are sometimes worked or physically \n     brutalized to death.\n       (12) Trafficking in persons involving slavery-like labor \n     practices substantially affects interstate and foreign \n     commerce. The United States must take action to eradicate the \n     substantial burdens on commerce that result from trafficking \n     in persons and to prevent the channels of commerce from being \n     used for immoral and injurious purposes.\n       (13) Trafficking of persons is an evil requiring concerted \n     and vigorous action by countries of origin, transit or \n     destination, and by international organizations.\n       (14) Existing legislation and law enforcement in the United \n     States and other countries are inadequate to deter \n     trafficking and bring traffickers to justice, failing to \n     reflect the gravity of the offenses involved. No \n     comprehensive law exists in the United States that penalizes \n     the range of offenses involved in the trafficking scheme. \n     Instead, even the most brutal instances of trafficking into \n     the sex industry are often punished under laws that also \n     apply to lesser offenses such as consensual sexual activity \n     and illegal immigration, so that traffickers typically escape \n     deserved punishment.\n       (15) In the United States, the seriousness of this crime \n     and its components are not reflected in current sentencing \n     guidelines, resulting in weak penalties for convicted \n     traffickers. Additionally, adequate services and facilities \n     do not exist to meet the needs of health care, housing, \n     education, and legal assistance, which safely reintegrate \n     trafficking victims into their home countries.\n       (16) In some countries, enforcement against traffickers is \n     also hindered by official indifference, by corruption, and \n     sometimes even by official participation in trafficking.\n       (17) Existing laws often fail to protect victims of \n     trafficking, and because victims are often illegal immigrants \n     in the destination country, they are repeatedly punished more \n     harshly than the traffickers themselves.\n       (18) Victims of severe forms of trafficking should not be \n     inappropriately incarcerated, fined, or otherwise penalized \n     solely for unlawful acts as a direct result of being \n     trafficked, such as for having used false documents, entering \n     the country without documentation, or working without \n     documentation.\n       (19) Victims of trafficking often find it difficult or \n     impossible to report the crimes committed against them or to \n     assist in the investigation and prosecution of such crimes. \n     This is because they are frequently unfamiliar with the laws, \n     culture, and language of the countries into which they are \n     trafficked. Also, they are often subjected to coercion, \n     intimidation, physical detention, debt bondage, and fear of \n     forcible removal to countries where they face hardship.\n       (20) The United States and the international community \n     agree that trafficking in persons involves grave violations \n     of human rights and is a matter of pressing international \n     concern. The international community has repeatedly condemned \n     slavery and involuntary servitude, violence against women, \n     and other elements of trafficking, through declarations, \n     treaties, United Nations resolutions and reports, including \n     the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the 1956 \n     Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the \n     Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to \n     Slavery; the 1957 Abolition of Forced Labor Convention; the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; the \n     Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination \n     Against Women; the Convention Against Torture and Other \n     Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment; United \n     Nations General Assembly Resolutions 50/167, 51/66, and 52/\n     98; the Final Report of the World Congress against Sexual \n     Exploitation of Children (Stockholm, 1996); the Fourth World \n     Conference on Women (Beijing, 1995); and the 1991 Moscow \n     Document of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \n     Europe.\n       (21) Trafficking in persons is a transnational crime with \n     national implications. To deter international trafficking and \n     bring its perpetrators to justice, nations including the \n     United States must recognize that trafficking is a serious \n     offense. This is done by prescribing appropriate punishment, \n     giving priority to the prosecution of trafficking offenses, \n     and protecting rather than punishing the victims of such \n     offenses. The United States must work bilaterally and \n     multilaterally to abolish the trafficking industry by taking \n     steps to promote cooperation among countries linked together \n     by international trafficking routes. The United States must \n     also urge the international community to take strong action \n     in multilateral fora to engage recalcitrant countries in \n     serious and sustained efforts to eliminate trafficking and \n     protect trafficking victims.\n       (22) Trafficking in persons substantially affects \n     interstate and foreign commerce. Trafficking for such \n     purposes as involuntary servitude, peonage, and other forms \n     of forced labor has an impact on the nationwide employment \n     network and labor market. Within the context of slavery, \n     servitude, and labor or services which are obtained or \n     maintained through coercive conduct that amounts to a \n     condition of servitude, victims are subjected to a range of \n     violations.\n       (23) Involuntary servitude statutes are intended to reach \n     cases in which persons are held in a condition of servitude \n     through nonviolent coercion. In United States v. Kozminski, \n     487 U.S. 950 (1988), the Supreme Court found that section \n     1584 of title 18, United States Code, should be narrowly \n     interpreted, absent a definition of involuntary servitude by \n     Congress. As a result, that section was interpreted to only \n     criminalize servitude coerced through force, threats of \n     force, or threats of legal coercion.\n\n     SEC. 3.
