Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I have \nbeen asked to make a unanimous-consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that immediately following the passage of \nH.R. 4444, the Commerce Committee be discharged from further \nconsideration of S. 2497 and the Senate proceed to its immediate \nconsideration under the following terms: Two hours on the bill to be \nequally divided in the usual form; that there be up to one relevant \namendment in order for each leader, that they be offered in the first \ndegree, limited to 30 minutes equally divided and not subject to any \nsecond-degree amendments; and that no motions to commit or recommit be \nin order.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following conclusion or use of \ndebate time in the disposition of the above described amendments, the \nbill be advanced to third reading and a vote occur on final passage of \nthe bill, as amended, if amended, all without any intervening action or \ndebate.\n  The bill has to do with the entertainment industry and the \nentertainment industry marketing their videos and CDs to those people--\nchildren--who are proscribed, really, from buying them or attending \nthose kinds of movies. These are R-rated movies. Children under 17 are \nnot permitted in these without an adult. Yet we have a report just \nissued, I think earlier this week, that says the movie industry targets \nthe very people who are not supposed to be viewing these kinds of \nmaterials or listening to these kinds of materials.\n  So this is a unanimous-consent request to move this out of the \nCommerce Committee and to deal with this issue on the floor promptly. \nThis is an important issue that has been a bipartisan issue in the \npast. I hope my unanimous-consent request will be approved by the \nDemocrats.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we, also, in the minority, are very \ninterested in this subject. We think the Vice President and nominee \nhas, along with others, set a good tone as to how we should look at \nwhat is going on with media. However, as we speak, at this very minute \nthere are hearings on this subject going on in the Commerce Committee. \nThe ranking member, Senator Hollings, has not had an opportunity to \nreview this unanimous-consent request. We believe if there is going to \nbe legislation brought before the Senate, it should be in the regular \norder; that is, there should be an opportunity to amend the legislation \nif in fact that is necessary. We know there are a number of Senators \nwho wish to offer amendments.\n  This unanimous-consent request that we have allows one amendment, and \non that one amendment Senators can speak for 30 minutes. So when we \nhave so much to do in this body--we have 11 appropriations bills we \nhave not completed. I am going to discuss, in a little bit, some more \nthings on education. We have a Patient's Bill of Rights we need to do, \na prescription bill we need to do, minimum wage--I think it is awfully \nlate in the game, when we have 15 days in the session left, to start \ntalking about media violence. This is an issue that has been \noutstanding for many months. We have members of the minority who have \nspoken out on this time after time.\n  Based on that, and for other reasons, we object.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The reason we are trying to move expeditiously here is \nthe FTC has come out with a record that shows the egregious nature of \nthe conduct of Hollywood with respect to the marketing to young people \nof material that is inappropriate for them, that they have said they \nwould not so market. It is very similar to the charges we have heard \nabout tobacco companies, that are not supposed to sell to minors, \nmarketing to minors. Here we have the identical situation.\n\n  The other side has not been reticent about bringing tobacco \nlegislation to the floor to stop the marketing to minors at the drop of \na hat. Yet when it comes to protecting Hollywood, we have a roadblock. \nWe have an opportunity here to reform the system, to do something \nsubstantive about an issue that is undercutting the moral fabric of our \ncountry, that is poisoning the minds of our children, and we have a \nroadblock because we have more important issues to discuss. According \nto the other side, there are other issues more important than these \nissues. I don't think there are very many issues that are more \nimportant than a deliberate attempt to market inappropriate material to \nyoung minds. That, to me, is about as high a priority as we can get.\n  There may be some other things the other side believes are more \nimportant than that, but bringing this bill to the floor and having \nthis debated is a very important issue. As the Senator from Nevada \nmentioned, their own Vice Presidential candidate believes this is a \nvery high profile issue.\n  Let's deal with it. Let's not talk about it; let's not politic about \nit; let's not pander about it; let's do something about it. Here we \nhave, again, an opportunity for us to do something substantive, to \ncreate reform, to move the agenda forward, and we have a roadblock; we \nhave an objection: It is just not the right time; it is just not the \nright way; it is just not the exact thing we would like to do.\n  Let's move forward. Let's start moving on reform. We hear complaints \nthat nothing gets done around here. Every time we start to put \nsomething forward to try to move a reform, the answer is no. We are \ngoing to continue to try. This is not the last time we are going to try \nto get unanimous consent on this matter. This is an important matter \nthat we need to bring up and we need to deal with before this session \nends.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we do not apologize for the work we have \ndone on tobacco. We, of course, have led the Nation into focusing on \nthe evils of tobacco and what it has done to hurt not only the youth \nbut the adult communities throughout America. We do not apologize for \nthat. This has been led by the minority, and we are proud of that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8440-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8440-S8441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE SENATE AGENDA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we also recognize that there are issues that \nneed to be discussed as to what is going on with the media. That is why \nthis legislation is important. The problem is there are other matters \ndealing with children we have totally ignored this year. For example, \nwe have spent, this year, 6 days of debate on the ESEA.\n  As I have said, we do not apologize for the work we have done on \ntobacco. What has happened has been revolutionary as a result of the \nminority speaking out against the problems of tobacco. We do not \napologize for that. Of course, we have called attention to it.\n  We have also called attention to the fact that we believe our \nchildren need more attention. On February 3 of this year, the majority \nsaid education will be a ``high priority'' in this Congress.\n  I regret to say instead of making education a central issue, and even \na high priority, we have had only 6 days of debate on education this \nentire year on the Senate floor. There is not a more important issue \nthat we can talk about on the Senate floor, bar none, than educating \nour children. Having 6 days of debate on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act in this Congress over a 2-year period does not indicate \nto me this is a ``high priority.''\n  We have about 15 days left in this Congress. We still have 11 \nappropriations bills to do. We have a minimum wage bill to complete. We \nhave the Patients' Bill of Rights bill to complete. We have \nprescription drug benefits to address. We have issues dealing with gun \nsafety, bankruptcy reform--the list of things we have not done is \nunending.\n  I believe to bring up, as was done by the majority today, this issue \ndealing with media, when right now Senator McCain and others are \nlistening to testimony of Senator Joe Lieberman as to what he believes \nshould be done in this regard. We know this is an artificial effort by \nthe majority to focus on this issue. There is no intention to bring \nthis up for debate. That is why the unanimous consent request given was \nso restricted that they would allow one amendment for 30 minutes. I \nthink it is obvious this was only an effort to bring up an issue and \ntalk about what they cannot get done.\n  Remember, the majority controls what goes on here on the floor. It is \nvery obvious to me one thing the majority does not want to go on is a \ndebate about education.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is an act that was part of \nPresident Johnson's war on poverty. It has been a successful program. \nTitle I, the largest program in the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct, was intended to help educational challenges facing high-poverty \ncommunities by targeting extra resources to school districts and \nschools with the highest concentrations of poverty. What it has done \nfor children who could not read is remarkable. We have a lot more to do \nbecause Title I, which relates to teaching kids who have fallen behind \nhow to read, has been so underfunded. Where it has been funded, it has \ndone remarkably well.\n  We want this program to continue. In 1994, the Democratic-led \nCongress and the Clinton-Gore administration worked together to enact \nfar-reaching reauthorization of Title I. We want to continue this, set \nhigh standards, and close the achievement gap. We want to do something \nabout class size reduction. We want to hire more teachers. There are \nall kinds of studies that show if teachers have fewer children to \nteach, the kids do better, but we do not need studies to prove that.\n  Common sense dictates if a teacher has fewer children to teach, she \nis going to do a better job of teaching those children. That is what \nthis legislation is about: Simple common sense; that is, if you have \nfewer children to teach, the kids are going to do better. We want to do \nthat. We want to have class size reduction.\n  It is very clear one of the reasons we have such a high dropout rate \nis because of the fact children are in classes that are so big and \nschools that are so big.\n  I did an open school forum in Las Vegas during the August recess. Las\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nVegas is the sixth largest school district in America with 230,000 \nchildren. It was interesting. The new superintendent of schools, Carlos \nGarcia, who came from Fresno, said that if a child is not reading up to \nstandard in the third grade, that kid is a good candidate for being a \nhigh school dropout. We need to make sure the children in third grade \ncan read. That is what this is all about. That is why we need to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is why we \nneed to have fewer kids for each teacher to teach. That is what we are \ntrying to do. That is why Senator Murray has worked so hard on her \nClass Size Reduction Act.\n\n  Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle reject our \nclass size reduction program by failing to provide a separate dedicated \nfunding stream. What we have done as a result of the intervention of \nthe Clinton-Gore administration is force at year end in the omnibus \nbill more money for teachers. As a result of that, we have hired almost \n30,000 new teachers so far under this program, directly benefiting over \n1.5 million children. It has been proven, if you have smaller class \nsizes, these kids outperform students in larger classes. It helps \nteachers, and it helps the students. I repeat, our friends on the other \nside of the aisle reject this.\n  I want to talk about something very important to me, and that is high \nschool dropouts. I mentioned briefly that if a kid cannot read in third \ngrade, he or she is a good candidate to be a high school dropout.\n  Three thousand children drop out of school every day, 500,000 a year. \nWe would be so much better off if we could do something to keep 500 of \nthose children in school every day, or 200 of those children. We would \nonly have 2,800 dropping out of school every day.\n  We have worked on this. Senator Bingaman and I have a dropout \nprevention bill which supports local school development and programs \nfor the prevention of dropouts. We successfully included $10 million in \nfunding for dropout prevention in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We \nhope that stays in conference. The conference has not been held, of \ncourse, as has conferences for most appropriations bills not been held. \nI hope money will stay in there. It is a few dollars. We need a lot \nmore money. If we are going to have an attack on keeping kids in \nschool, if we are going to have lower dropouts, we need to have in the \nDepartment of Education a dropout czar, somebody in charge of making \nsure there are programs throughout America to keep kids in school.\n  We need to focus on education. We are not going to in this Congress. \nThat is gone. We need to work on school modernization, support for \ndisadvantaged children, afterschool opportunities. It is clear--and \nSenator Boxer has worked very hard on afterschool programs--that if we \ncan keep kids occupied after school, they are simply not going to get \ninvolved in things they should not do. This has been proven and shown \nto be accurate. We need more money in afterschool programs. Senator \nBingaman has worked hard on school accountability. We support funding \naccountability provisions for failing schools; for example, putting a \nqualified teacher in every classroom within 4 years of this \nlegislation.\n  The record should be replete with the fact that this year this \nCongress has spent 6 days of debate on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. That is pathetic. We are concerned about children. We \nshould be able to debate the issue. We offered that this bill be \nhandled in the regular course of business. Request after request has \nbeen rejected. That is too bad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Oregon is recognized for 9 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I was not intending to speak on \neducation, but I want to respond to my friend from Nevada. I am a \njunior Member of this body, but the perception of what has gone on here \nwith respect to education is utterly different than my observation.\n  My observation is that this side of the aisle is anxious to talk \nabout education, not just to throw more resources at the status quo, \nnot to put up roadblocks to real reform but to truly find out ways to \nmake Washington less of a burden upon local education.\n  I have yet to go into a school district in Oregon and ask, ``Where \nare your problems?'' and they don't tell me it usually has to do with \nsome Federal mandate. The truth is, what we are trying to do is empower \nlocal folks who understand about educating children and to lower the \nburden of Washington.\n  This idea of 100,000 teachers is great, but everyone should \nunderstand that is about sloganeering; that is about TV ads. That has \nnothing to do with educating kids. The truth is, we need an awful lot \nmore than 100,000 teachers; We need 1 million teachers; but we ought to \ntrust people locally to be able to make that judgment whether to build \na school or to hire a teacher. We should not tie their hands. That is \nwhat has gone on, and the record should reflect that as well. This \nRepublican is prepared to vote for a lot more resources, but he thinks \nwe owe it to the parents of this country to give them reform as well.\n  Mr. President, I came here in morning business to try to interject \nmyself into the debate on PNTR.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend yield for a simple question?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I yield to my friend from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I have the greatest respect for the Senator from Oregon, \nbut I would just a question. I think what the Senator says is right. I \nthink we need reform. But doesn't he think we should have the ability \nto debate it on the Senate floor? How are we going to get it otherwise?\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I say to the Senator, I do think we should \ndebate it longer than we have. I grant you that. What I have observed, \nas a junior Member, however, is that every time we go to focus on \namendments, we can't get time agreements. We can't get agreements on \nsome reasonable amount of time. Look, I have already taken all the gun \nvotes. I will take them. I am for background checks. I am for things \nthat will protect kids in the classroom. But I do not know why I should \nbe asked to vote on them two and three and four times.\n  How many times do you need a vote to run a political ad against me? \nThe truth is, I have taken the votes. Let's get on to debating \neducation. We have done the gun debate.\n  Mr. REID. I just briefly say to my friend, we have stated publicly on \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act we would have as few as \neight amendments, with an hour time limit on each one of them, equally \ndivided. And we haven't been able to get that agreement. That seems \nfair to me.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. It seems fair to me, I say to the Senator. I \nwill certainly encourage my leadership to accede to that. What I am \nafraid of is the comment I read in USA Today, where Senator Daschle \nsaid: We are not interested in getting anything done. We are interested \nin obstructing this place and creating a train wreck because we think \nthat is good politics. That really concerns me.\n  I have to tell you, I am always optimistic, but I am discouraged by \nthe windup scene I am seeing develop here. We owe the American people \nsomething better than this. I think we need to get on to some reforms. \nI, for one, am committed to a generous and bipartisan effort in that \nregard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8441-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8441-S8443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHINA NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nH.R. 4444, a bill establishing permanent normal trade relations with \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  I strongly believe that permanent normal trade relations will have a \nsubstantial and long-term political, economic, and national security \nbenefit for our country. I have long maintained that as China becomes a \nmember of the global community, its government and its people will \nbenefit from these changes and the United States will benefit from \nbetter relations and, eventually, I believe, from a more liberal and \nless oppressive government.\n  Much of China's recent past has been marked by progression and \nregression, starts and fits toward economic liberalization that impact \nall levels of society, only to be matched by periods of oppression, \nwhen the government feels\n\n[[Page S8442]]\n\nthat things are getting out from underneath its thumb. This one-step-\nforward, two-steps-back pace shows how truly feared the market place is \nin a Communist country. And I believe that if you are a true Communist, \nyou do fear the marketplace. For it is that marketplace--the private \nsector--that will eventually prove to be the downfall of the Communist \nsystem in any country.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I am genuinely and deeply concerned about \nhuman rights abroad. For that reason, I traveled to China last year to \ninvestigate the human rights situation and to determine the state of \nreligious freedom in that country. WTO membership and normal trade \nrelations with China will eventually improve the human rights situation \nand, I believe, religious freedom in that country. The past few \ndecades' gradual opening of trade, investment, and cultural exchanges \nwith China have led to positive steps in the area of human rights and \nreligious tolerance. That is not to say that all is well. There is much \nwork to be done in the area of human rights, but on balance a ``carrot \nand a stick'' approach is better than the stick alone.\n  Globalization is part of ``the carrot.'' It is globalization--the \neconomic integration of their economy--that will introduce the Chinese \npeople to new ideas and information. I believe that as a free market \neconomy, we have a moral and ethical obligation to other nations to \nhelp them move toward free markets and into the global economy. Our own \nhistory shows the results of not pressing for this integration. During \nthe late 19th century and also following World War I, our negligence in \nintegrating both Japan and Germany had horrible results that \nreverberated through much of the 20th century. We must not make the \nsame type of mistake with China.\n  The economic benefits to the United States of H.R. 4444 are great. \nOur markets to a great degree are already open to Chinese goods; this \nlegislation will open their markets to our goods. This is good for \nAmerica. And it is good for the people of my home State of Oregon. In \nthe first year following China's membership in the global economy--\neconomists predict trade will double with the United States. China is \nthe sixth-largest market in the world for American agricultural \nproducts--and following WTO membership, that trade will account for \none-third of the growth in exports over the next 10 years. In addition, \naccording to the World Bank, China will spend an estimated $750 billion \nin new infrastructure over the next decade.\n  This is wonderful for the United States, but let me take a moment and \ntell you what it will do for Oregon. My State is the Nation's largest \nproducer of solid wood products and an important agricultural exporter. \nChina's accession to the WTO and normal trade relations will benefit:\n  Wheat.--Oregon is a large wheat-growing State and China's grain \npolicies will become more market-oriented. In addition, the 1999 U.S.-\nChina bilateral trade agreement resulted in more exports of Northwest \ngrain.\n  Vegetables.--Oregon is a major producer of beans, corn, and onions. \nUnder the new agreements, tariffs on vegetables will drop by up to 60 \npercent.\n  Fruit.--Oregon grows berries, pears, cherries, and plums. China will \nreduce tariffs by up to 75 percent for fresh and processed deciduous \nfruit; and tariffs on apples, pears, and cherries will fall from 30 \npercent to 10 percent.\n  Solid wood.--China is the world's third-largest wood importer and \nafter WTO accession, it will substantially reduce its remaining tariffs \non valued-added wood products within the next 4 years.\n  Much has been said on the floor of the Senate in these past few weeks \nregarding normal trade relations with China. I have to confess that I \ndo not think the arguments against this legislation stand on their own \nmerit. Most of what I have heard in opposition to NTR has reflected the \ndesire to punish China, the need to sanction China or the need to block \nChina.\n  Those opposing this legislation have formed their arguments around \nthe conclusion that NTR is really just a great plum for China and \nbenefits only China. Nothing could be farther from the truth. As I \npreviously stated our markets are already open to the Chinese--we \nalready buy Chinese goods. This legislation will open up their market \nand it is a vast pool of consumers, to our goods. It benefits the \nUnited States economy. This debate is about advancing American values \nhalfway around the world. Ninety-nine years ago Teddy Roosevelt, \nspeaking at a state fair, said: ``There is a homely adage which runs \n`Speak softly and carry a big stick; you will go far,' '' At that time, \nthe big stick meant America's warships and a show of American might \nabroad. Now the stick means America's economic might and American \nvalues. Free and fair trade is the weapon--the economic weapon of the \n21st century.\n  It is free and fair global trade that will strengthen the forces of \neconomic and political reform in China. It is free and fair global \ntrade that will bring greater prosperity to both the United States and \nthe Chinese people. It is free and fair global trade that will bolster \nhuman rights and improve religious freedom in that country. America can \nadvance its values and help China integrate into the world economy with \nthe help of this important legislation. I call on my colleagues to send \na clean PNTR bill to the President and ask for his swift signature.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 4132\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Thompson amendment which would \nadd a sanctions mechanism and annual review regarding Chinese \nproliferation of nuclear and other weapons. I would like to take a \nmoment and go over the problems with this legislation. While the issue \nof weapons proliferation is a serious one, most of the elements of the \nThompson legislation are already covered by current law. As many of my \ncolleagues have noted, there are already numerous laws regarding \nnuclear proliferation, some of these laws include:\n  No. 1, the Export-Import Bank Act; No. 2, the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Act; No. 3, the Arms Export Control Act; No. 4, the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act. This list goes on and on. \nFurther, I have never been a great fan of unilateral actions. \nMultilateral programs agreements are by far the best and most effective \napproach.\n  The problem with unilateral sanctions is that they, at the end of the \nday, are rarely effective in achieving foreign policy goals. The \nhistory of our foreign policy is littered with a trail of ineffectual \nunilateral sanctions. The really harmful impact of this set of \nunilateral sanctions will fall on American exporters. Many of these \nsanctions will, at the end of the day, have the effect of blocking our \nexport sales, by blocking U.S. credits or preventing financing. These \nactions will not have an effect on the underlying problem--they will \nonly replace all sanctioned American products with foreign products. \nAnd we are not talking about military sales in many cases. The scope of \nthis legislation is exceedingly broad and includes civilian transfers \nthat do not actually contribute to proliferation problems.\n  The Thompson amendment will also tie the hands of future \nadministrations. It will not allow any flexibility for a future \nPresident to make a decision based on contemporary issues involving the \nstate of the Sino-American relationship at that time. And finally, as \nwe all know, the politics of the situation dictate a clean PNTR bill. \nSimply put, this legislation will effectively kill this bill. If we are \nto pass PNTR during this Congress it is imperative we have a bill that \nwill not require another vote in the House.\n  Mr. President, as I have shown up on the floor and have listened to \nthe debate on PNTR. I have seen many people, Republican and Democrat, \nproposing amendments to this bill that have great appeal to me. They \nhave great appeal to me because they advance noble principles. They \nadvance American ideals. They advance the best of what we want to \nspread around the world. Economic freedom, human rights, improved labor \nconditions, improved environmental conditions, all of these things I \nsupport. But I fear the real motive behind some of these is to scuttle \nthis trade agreement. I oppose that.\n  I also point out, as many others have, when it comes to these \nsecurity issues, slavery issues, and whatnot, we already have these \nlaws on the books to protect this country. We should not accede in this \nenvironment, in this debate, on a vote this important to scuttle this\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\ntrade agreement because to do so would shortchange the American people \nand certainly the people of my State.\n  I conclude with this story from my own life. The story is a lesson \nthat has, frankly, governed much of my thinking with respect to trade \nand military security and foreign relations since I have been an adult.\n  I was a student at Brigham Young University, taking a class in \nmilitary history. It was at the end of the Vietnam war. My professor \nwas a retired Air Force general. There was great turmoil on the \ncampuses of the United States. He made a comment that struck me and \ncaught my attention. This professor's name was Phillip Flammer.\n  He said: We made a mistake to bomb the North Vietnamese with military \narmaments. That caught my attention--in a conservative place like this \nuniversity, that a statement such as that would be made.\n  I thought: That is interesting.\n  He said: We should have bombed them, but we should have bombed them \nwith Sears catalogs.\n  I thought: Hmm, there is a lesson I will remember.\n  His point was, if we want to tear down the walls of communism, we do \nit with our trade. We do it with our commerce. We do it with our \nculture. We do it with our communications to the world.\n  We have seen in Communist country after Communist country that when \nthey are exposed to the miracles of the marketplace, what happens is a \nmiddle class develops. When a middle class develops, people begin to \ndemand, with economic liberty, that they have political liberty as \nwell.\n  So if you are interested in improving human rights, improving the \nenvironment, improving access for Americans to their markets, then this \nvote on PNTR is perhaps the most important vote that we will cast in \nthis Congress, or perhaps any other for the economic future of our \ncountry.\n  If you care about spreading American values, resist these amendments, \nresist voting no to PNTR because you will do more to spread American \nvalues, American democracy, and advance American security by supporting \nthis agreement than you can ever do by trying to amend it, to kill it, \nor by trying to vote in opposition to it when we come to a final vote.\n  I do not, for a moment, question the motives of anyone who is against \nthis. Again, I admire the ideals advanced. But I simply question this \nmethod, this bill, at this time, to scuttle this most important \nagreement.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote for PNTR and vote against the \nThompson amendment--well-motivated but misguided at this time, given \nthe laws we already have.\n  America needs this. We should not cede the Chinese market to the \nEuropean nations. We should be there ourselves. They are already here. \nWe have yet to go there.\n  I urge an ``aye'' vote on the agreement and a ``no'' vote on the \nThompson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say, before my friend leaves the \nfloor, how much respect I have for the Senator from Oregon and the \ngreat example he sets for everyone in the bipartisan consideration of \nlegislation.\n  I do want to say, though, before my friend leaves, that one of the \npleasures of my service in the Senate is that I have been able to work \nwith Senator Daschle. We served in the House together. We have served \nin the Senate together. He is the leader. I am the assistant leader.\n  There are very few meetings he attends that I am not there. For \nexample, we had a meeting yesterday with the bipartisan leadership of \nboth Houses. At that meeting with the President of the United States, \nSenator Daschle was very clear in saying he wanted to get things done \nthis year. He gave a list of things he thought we could accomplish.\n  We are so close to being able to do something on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights, which the Senator from Oregon has voted, I believe, the \nright way on many occasions.\n  Senator Daschle in that meeting said that he wanted to get things \ndone. He gave a list of things that should be done. Senator Daschle, in \nprivate meetings and in public meetings, has said the most important \nthing we can do is complete legislation that is already before the \nSenate, including the 11 appropriation bills that have not been \ncompleted.\n\n  I don't know what appears in U.S. News and World Report or whatever \npublication my friend from Oregon mentioned. The fact is, Senator \nDaschle has continually said publicly and privately the most important \nthing that we can do is enact legislation for the American people.\n  I think the record should be very clear that there is no intent on \nbehalf of the minority to prevent anything from going forward. We want \nto move legislation. First of all, let's do the appropriations bills, \nand if we have time left over, do the other items, which I believe we \nwill do, as indicated in a meeting with the President yesterday. Let's \ndo them.\n  I express my appreciation to the Senator from West Virginia for his \npatience.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time before the \nscheduled votes be extended for whatever time I have used under leader \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8443-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8443-S8444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                           REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will now be 1 \nhour for closing remarks on the Byrd amendment No. 4131 and division 6 \nof the Smith amendment No. 4129, with 15 minutes each under the control \nof the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth; the Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan; the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd; and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Smith.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4131\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on my amendment. Then I \nwill yield back the remainder of my time. I want to get to a markup of \nan appropriations bill by the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent \nAgencies, of which I am a member.\n  In simple language, my amendment adds surety for American firms and \nAmerican workers who are caught up in the confusing process of seeking \nrelief from a surge of unfair imports. The process of getting the U.S. \nGovernment to agree with a firm's firsthand judgement that a flood of \nunfairly dumped imports is undercutting a U.S. manufacturer is complex \nand time consuming. Language in the House-passed bill is an \nimprovement, but it leaves a serious loophole. The House language \nprovides deadlines for the government and the President to agree or \ndisagree that relief is needed, but if the President fails to meet his \ndeadline for a decision, nothing happens. No relief can be forthcoming \nuntil the President acts. And the President might be under other \npressures, from the State Department, for instance, warning that an \naffirmative Presidential decision might upset some other, unrelated \nnegotiation. The State Department is not charged with worrying about \nthe fate of individual U.S. firms. The State Department is not charged \nwith worrying about the fate of steel companies, for example.\n  But for a firm hanging on by its fingernails, unable to pay its bills \nor secure needed financing, and for workers unsure when their lay-offs \nmight end and their bills get paid, this uncertainty can be \ncatastrophic. So the Byrd amendment says that if the President fails to \nact by the appointed deadline, the decision of the ITC will be \nimplemented as though the President had agreed. So firms and workers \nwill know on what date certain they will get their answer. The steel \ncompanies will know when they will get their answer. Coal miners will \nknow, because they are affected by steel imports as well. That is what \nmy amendment does. And for those affected firms, and those workers, \nthat is pretty important. They need to know, and their bankers and \ncreditors need to know. They need to be able to plan, and no other \nconcerns should come before them, in my opinion. I've seen too many \nfamilies suffering when the plant shuts down, too many towns hollowing \nout and falling into disrepair when people just give up. We need to \ngive our citizens, our firms, an efficient and sure process to seek \nrelief and to get relief when it is warranted.\n  This is our chance. This is our chance to strike a blow for the steel \nindustry, which is a very important industry in the State represented \nby the current Presiding Officer. It is a very important industry in my \nState, exceedingly important. Now is the time to strike a blow for \nfreedom, for the freedom of those men and women who work in these \nindustries, freedom to know when relief is coming. They should not have \nto wait until a President seeks his own convenient moment. They should \nknow the date. And when that date comes, it should happen. Let's make \nit happen by my amendment.\n  I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator Byrd's amendment \nregarding safeguards.\n  I do so even though I share my colleague's concern regarding the \nPresident's utter disregard for statutory deadlines in our trade remedy \nlaws. The President's failure to issue timely decisions in recent \nsection 201 cases was simply unacceptable. Also unacceptable is the \nPresident's failure to meet the deadline set for modifying the \nretaliation list in the bananas dispute at the WTO. This pattern of \nutter disregard for statutory deadlines simply must stop.\n  With that said, I must still oppose this amendment for both \nsubstantive and procedural reasons.\n  With regard to substance, it is vitally important for the Finance \nCommittee to be given the opportunity to consider this proposal before \nit is adopted into law. As I noted yesterday, there are serious flaws \nin this amendment that could make it unworkable in certain \ncircumstances. It would be reckless to adopt such a significant change \nto our trade laws without adequate review, particularly given the flaws \nthat are already apparent in what my good friend has proposed.\n  I am also concerned that we are isolating the Chinese for \ndifferential treatment through this proposal. The agreement may not be \ninconsistent with the U.S.-China bilateral agreement, but it does \ncreate a procedure that differs sharply from our other trade remedy \nprograms.\n  I must also oppose the amendment because of the potential impact that \nthis amendment will have on the passage of PNTR. In my view, a vote for \nany amendment, including this one, is a vote to kill PNTR.\n  Mr. President, such a result would be devastating for our workers and \nfarmers. That is why I urge my colleagues to vote against my good \nfriend's amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I asked for morning business because I am \nnot sure where we are focused, but I want to continue to talk about \nPNTR, a topic that I hope we are able to conclude shortly.\n  Certainly one of the most important issues we have before us is the \nissue and the way I come to the conclusion. We all talk about the \nproblems that exist. Obviously, there are problems that exist. I serve \nas chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs that \nhas dealt over a number of years with the issue of China. I don't think \nthere is a soul here who wouldn't wish things were different there with \nrespect to human rights, some of the issues with respect to \nproliferation, some of the issues with respect to freedom, and market \nsystem changes. I don't think that is the issue. The issue is how we \nbest bring about that change. That is really what it is all about.\n  Do we do it through threats to the PRC? Do we do it with sanctions? I \nthink people have learned quite a bit in seeking to deal with Cuba with \nsanctions. It has had very little impact and very little effect. I \nhappened to be in Beijing where we were having the great debate over \nsome of the things that were controversial. They canceled a large order \nwith Boeing. What did they do? They bought Airbuses from France. \nSanctions don't work.\n  I happen to come from a State where we are very interested in \nagriculture. So we need to do that.\n  Someone suggested during the course of the discussion over the last \ncouple of days that this bill, if it passed, to grant permanent trade \nrelations would be, in a word, ``rewarding'' China. I don't agree with \nthat. The fact is, we would\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\nbe rewarding ourselves with regard to trade. The opening has already \nbeen given to China. We are the ones to whom they have agreed, if this \nhappens, to lower tariffs on a number of our things that go there. It \nreally doesn't change the situation much with regard to China. It gives \nus a better opportunity to do that.\n  We also argue about how we implement these changes. Are we more \nlikely to bring about changes if we are part of a multilateral group \nsuch as the WTO or are we more likely to do it with the unilateral \nkinds of things for ourselves? I happen to believe we would be better \noff to have an organizational structure such as the WTO to go through \nto talk about some of the things we think are not being done properly. \nDoes that mean we don't continue to monitor things such as human \nrights, that we don't continue to monitor things such as weapons \nproliferation? Of course not. The question really is, Do we go ahead \nwith this bill as it is and at the same time go ahead and monitor the \nother things as well?\n  I am opposed to the Thompson amendment, which is an amendment to the \nbill to establish normal trade relations.\n  First of all, as I mentioned, I am chairman of the subcommittee that \nhas jurisdiction over some of these issues. Neither the Foreign \nRelations Committee nor the Banking Committee has been afforded the \nopportunity to consider and debate this issue before it was brought to \nthe floor. That is not the customary way to deal with issues that are \nas far reaching as this one. To bring it to the floor without going \nthrough the committees and giving the committees of jurisdiction the \nopportunity to consider it--the Banking Committee, as you know, which \nhas jurisdiction over a portion of these kinds of arrangements, is very \nupset about this process.\n\n  We, of course, argue that under the time constraints it is most \ndifficult. The House passed a bill to open normal trading relations. By \nthe way, the Senate has done it every year for normal trading \nrelationships. This is really a departure from what has been done. But \ncertainly, if we amend it at this time in this session, we will have a \ndifficult time getting it completed.\n  My first problem is jurisdictional, of course. It was introduced by \nSenator Thompson. We had plenty of time and could have done it in May. \nIt could have gone through those committees. But it didn't go to either \ncommittee. Certainly the kinds of changes that would be made there \nwould apply. We ought to have that kind of process and not limit the \nprocess entirely. The House, of course, has passed this bill by a large \nmajority, and we need to move forward with it.\n  Aside from the jurisdictional concerns, I have a fairly large number \nof substitute concerns regarding issues of proliferation, and \nparticularly the problem of transfers to Pakistan. I don't believe this \namendment will do anything to change the situation. Instead, it would \nturn us to the discredited, failed strategy of mandatory unilateral \nsanctions and annual votes on the status of China trade.\n  We have already talked a great deal, of course, about the passage of \nan amendment and the impact it would have on the relationship. I want \nto stress again that trying to work with China on some of those things \ndoes not make us oblivious to the things on which we disagree with \nthem. Surely, human rights we are going to continue to champion.\n  Again, we have to consider how to best have an influence on bringing \nabout change--change that has not occurred as completely as I would \nlike. I can tell you from my experience that there is change. The more \nvisibility the people of China have to the outside world--the fact of \nmarket systems, the fact that personal freedoms provide a much better \nway of life, it is becoming more and more evident. For years, of \ncourse, they have not had any opportunity to see what is going on in \nthe world. For example, things have changed substantially in China. Now \nthey see it. It is important to encourage changes that need to take \nplace.\n  Of course, with respect to another statute that does something about \nproliferation, we already have numerous statutes available to the \nPresident. There is a long list, including the Export-Import Bank Act, \nthe Arms Control Disarmament Act, the Arms Export Control Act, and the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act. It goes on and on. They \nprovide the very authority that is being talked about in some of these \namendments. They are in place.\n  Someone said it gives the President the opportunity to decide and be \nflexible about it. Then the author--in this case, the Senator from \nTennessee--assures Members that this also has a waiver and it gives the \nPresident the opportunity to change. We have very little reason to have \nmore legislation in this area.\n  Finally, I vote against this amendment for the same reason I voted \nagainst all the amendments that preceded it. I am, along with the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, and many others, opposed to adding amendments that will, \nindeed, have the effect of delaying or killing the PNTR bill. Most any \namendments would have that effect. I believe most of the Members of \nthis body also believe that because each of the amendments that have \nbeen offered have not survived and have lost by a rather substantial \nvote. I hope we continue to do that.\n  It is pretty unrealistic while we are trying to complete the work of \nthis Congress to think we can spend another week going back and forth \nin conference with the House and get this done.\n  I know there are justifiable differences of view. That is what this \nsystem is all about. We ought to talk about those. It is my view we \nhave talked about them and there ought to be an end game so we can move \non. We keep talking about the things we have to do, including 11 \nappropriations bills out of 13 that have not yet been passed. Several \nhave not even been marked up. We have less than 3 weeks, 14 days, to \nwork on these. We know very well that the President is going to create \nsome obstacles to the completion of our work so he can have more \nleverage to get the kinds of spending he wants and put the pressure on \nthe majority party in the Congress.\n  All these things are real and realistic and not unusual. I think we \nneed to understand where we are. I think we need to take a look at the \njob we do have to do so the American people can continue to be served \nby those programs that are in the appropriations, that we continue to \nstrengthen education, so we can do something about fairness and tax \nrelief, so that we can move forward in moving some of this money to \nlower the debt. We ought to continue to work in seeking to get some of \nthe pay back for strengthening Medicare so some of those reductions \nthat have been made can be replaced so we have services in the country. \nI have particular interest in that as cochairman of the rural caucus \nfor health care. Some of the small hospitals and small clinics need it \nto happen. We need to move forward and not spend 2 weeks on a \nrepetitious review of the same issues. There comes a time we should \nmove forward.\n  Therefore, I strongly urge we do move forward and that we do not \namend the bill before the Senate. Conclude it and send it to a \nsatisfactory signing at the White House and move forward on the issues \nfacing the Senate.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8445-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8445-S8492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TO AUTHORIZE EXTENSION OF NONDISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT TO THE PEOPLE'S \n                      REPUBLIC OF CHINA--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4129\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, very shortly there will be \na vote on one of the divisions in my amendment to the PNTR legislation. \nThis is a particular odious practice that occurs now in China called \norgan harvesting. It is hard to imagine that any nation in the world \ntoday would conduct activities as odious as this, but it does happen.\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\n  As we know from the debate that has been occurring on the permanent \nnormal trade relations with China, most of the predictions are it is \ngoing to pass, perhaps overwhelmingly. I personally oppose the \nlegislation. But if we are going to pass it, I believe we have an \nobligation to at least call to the attention of the rest of the world, \nand frankly to our own people here in America, the barbaric practices \nthat are occurring in this country to which we are about to give \npermanent normal trade status.\n  Permanent is a pretty strong word. Permanent means permanent. Under \nthe permanent normal trade relations bill, there is a process for \nmonitoring the activities. There is a commission that is set up. My \namendment is very simple. It says:\n\n       The Commission shall monitor the actions of the government \n     of the People's Republic of China with respect to its \n     practice of harvesting and transplanting organs for profit \n     from prisoners that it executes.\n\n  So all my colleagues know, this amendment simply says the commission \nshall monitor these activities in China as best they can and report to \nthe American people what they find. I believe very strongly it is wrong \nfor us as a nation to look the other way and say it is OK to make \nmoney, to trade with China, sell our agricultural products, and ignore \nthese types of human rights violations.\n  In the debate yesterday I discussed this briefly. We heard a lot \nabout not delaying the bill. The House has sent us over a bill--which, \nby the way they amended, they added some things to the monitoring--and \nthey sent it back to the Senate. Now many of my colleagues who are \nsupporting PNTR are saying: Let's not delay this. If we agree to these \namendments, the Smith amendment or the Thompson amendment or the \nWellstone amendment or any other amendment that has been offered, we \nare going to delay the process. Maybe it is a good idea to call \nattention to the fact they are harvesting organs obtained unwillingly \nby executing prisoners, but we don't want to mess up the whole debate \nhere. We do not want to mess up an agreement we have with the House.\n  We go to conference on hundreds of bills year after year. We are \ngoing to go to conference on 13 appropriations bills. It is what you \ndo. That is why we have a House and a Senate. It is what the Founding \nFathers wanted us to do. So if it takes a few days or a few hours--most \nlikely a few minutes--to conference an amendment such as the one we are \nabout to vote on, which I am about to speak on in a moment--if it takes \na few minutes to have the House agree to it, so what. What is the big \ndeal?\n  This is very disturbing. Yet my colleagues are saying to other \ncolleagues: Don't vote for the Smith amendment, the Wellstone \namendment, the Helms amendment, the Thompson amendment, or any other \namendment because it is going to require us to have to conference with \nthe House, and therefore it might slow the bill down.\n\n  If we are giving permanent status to China, what is a few more \nminutes? If we pass it, the House passes it, we amend it here, send it \nover to the House this morning or this afternoon, by dinnertime the \nHouse agrees to it, puts it on the President's desk, he has breakfast \ntomorrow morning--has a glass of juice, coffee, whatever, a muffin--and \nthen signs the bill. What is lost?\n  When we do that, we could get some of these amendments. This \nmonitoring language we should have in this bill. To do otherwise, with \nall due respect to my colleagues, is simply to say: I am going to look \nthe other way while organ harvesting takes place in China. We don't \nwant to rock the boat. We don't want to offend the Chinese. We don't \nwant to make anybody unhappy. We don't want to offend the House because \nthey didn't put it in, so therefore we are not going to conference \nthis. We don't want to rock the boat.\n  That is wrong. To put it bluntly, that is wrong.\n  Let me speak briefly about the content of my amendment. Organ \nharvesting, there was an expose done on this in 1997 by ABC News. This \nis not Bob Smith talking. This is one of the three major networks that \ntelevised a documentary on the practice of organ harvesting in \nCommunist China. In that documentary, in 1997, it depicted prisoners--\nthese are not necessarily murderers. These are just prisoners. Some of \nthem just put in there, actually charged with nothing--so-called crimes \nagainst the state. But it showed prisoners who were videotaped, lined \nup against a wall and executed with a bullet directly to the head. \nThis, unlike a lethal injection, preserves the organs for harvesting.\n  The documentary also claimed the prisoners were executed on a routine \nbasis. This was not an exception. Their organs were sold to people who \nwere willing to pay up to $30,000 for a kidney, for example.\n  Human rights organizations have estimated that at that time, the time \nthe documentary aired, more than 10,000 kidneys alone--just kidneys, \nnot to mention any other organs--10,000 kidneys alone from Chinese \nprisoners had been sold, potentially bringing in tens of millions of \ndollars to--guess where the money goes--the Chinese military. Does this \nsound like Huxley's ``Brave New World'' or what--executing prisoners to \nget their organs to get the money to the Chinese military.\n  The Chinese Government, as it does with most human rights abuses, \ndenies this practice takes place. But it is important to keep in mind \nthat China does not have a rule of law.\n  Prisoners are subject to arbitrary arrest and arbitrary punishment \nwithout due process. People of religious faith, environmental \nactivists, human rights activists, opponents of coercive abortion, \nstudent demonstrators, and anyone who appears to be questioning or \nchallenging the Government of China is subject to harassment, \nintimidation, arrest, incarceration, including in the infamous laogai, \nor slave labor camps, and, in certain cases, execution.\n  When Tiananmen Square occurred in 1989, peaceful student protesters, \nincluding the sons and daughters of the Communist Party's elite, were \nmowed down, run over by PLA tanks. There are far fewer dissidents in \nChina than there were 11 years ago after that experience.\n  Even the Falun Gong, which practices breathing and meditation \nexercises, has been subject to brutal repression by Chinese \nauthorities, and many of these worshipers have disappeared in the \nChinese gulags, and some have died in police custody--great candidates \nfor organ harvesting.\n  ABC's report also found that Chinese nationals living on student \nvisas were marketing these organs to Americans and other foreigners who \nhad the funds to make a $5,000 deposit and who then traveled to China \nto the People's Liberation Army hospital where they received a kidney \ntransplant.\n  These kidneys are tissue typed and the prisoners are also tissue \ntyped in order to achieve an ideal match. Think about that. Prisoners \nare executed, some of them for doing nothing more than protesting \nagainst the Government of China. They are sent to prison and executed \nso that people can pay up to $30,000 for one of their kidneys or some \nother organ, and the money goes to the Chinese military.\n  I ask my colleagues, with all due respect--and I respect the rights \nof Members to exercise their own views and votes; of course, it goes \nwithout saying, but I ask you: Is it unreasonable to ask my colleagues \nto put this in the monitoring provisions of PNTR so that we can monitor \nthese activities and report to the world what is happening? Is that so \nbad? If it delays this bill a few hours, if we have to conference it \nwith the House--it is permanent--is that so bad?\n  We might save a few lives. The more the world knows about this, and \nthe more world public pressure comes to the Chinese, we might save some \nlives. For the sake of a little time before we pass this bill that has \nbeen debated now for several days--it has been talked about for a year \nor two--is it so bad for my colleagues to vote to allow a commission to \nstudy and report on this? I ask them, is it really that big a deal for \nus to try to save people whose basic human right, the right to life, is \nbeing denied for the sake of organ donors? To make it worse, in some \ncases Americans are buying those kidneys, hearts, livers, and other \norgans.\n  U.S. law prohibits this activity. It is unlawful in the United States \nfor ``any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer \nany human organ for valuable consideration for use in human \ntransplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce.''\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\n  Congresswoman Linda Smith, before she left office, introduced a \nresolution 3 years ago which deplored this practice and called upon the \nadministration to bar from entry to the United States any Chinese \nofficial directly involved in the practice of organ harvesting. It \nurged the prosecution of individuals engaged in marketing and \nfacilitating these transplants under U.S. law.\n  There is no one in the House or Senate who would not recognize the \nname of Harry Wu, the renowned human rights activist and Chinese \ndissident who was arrested in China, detained, and finally released. \nThanks to the work of Laogai Research Foundation, we are aware of \nongoing Chinese engagement in organ harvesting of executed prisoners.\n  It is unreasonable, it is unfair for us to add this provision that \nwill expose this to the world and say, once and for all, that it is \nwrong and that we are not going to allow ourselves to be dragged into \nsaying that, for the sake of profit, for the sake of selling wheat, \ncorn, rice, and other agricultural products, for the sake of greed and \nprofit, we are going to ignore this? How can we do that in good \nconscience?\n  The sad part, frankly--the American people may not understand this--\nabout what is happening in the Senate is that people are saying: Don't \nvote for the Smith amendment because that is going to slow the process \ndown; don't vote for it.\n  It is not going to slow the process down enough to matter, and this \nis important. It is a commission. It is a study. That is all it is, and \nthat is all we are asking.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print an article on \nincidents regarding organ harvesting in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the International Herald Tribune, June 15, 2000]\n\n     An Execution for a Kidney--China Supplies Convicts' Organs to \n                               Malaysians\n\n                           (By Thomas Fuller)\n\n       Malacca, Malaysia.--The night before their execution, 18 \n     convicts were shown on a Chinese television program, their \n     crimes announced to the public. Wilson Yeo saw the broadcast \n     from his hospital bed in China and knew that one of the men \n     scheduled to die would provide him with the kidney he so \n     badly needed.\n       Mr. Yeo, 40, a Malaysian who manages the local branch of a \n     lottery company here, says he never learned the name of the \n     prisoner whose kidney is now implanted on his right side. He \n     knows only what the surgeon told him: The executed man was 19 \n     years old and sentenced to die for drug trafficking. ``I knew \n     that I would be getting a young kidney,'' Mr. Yeo says now, \n     one year after his successful transplant. ``That was very \n     important for me.'' Over the past few years at least a dozen \n     residents of this small Malaysian city have traveled to a \n     provincial hospital in Chongqing, China, where they paid for \n     what they could not get in Malaysia: functioning kidneys to \n     prolong their lives. They went to China, a place most of them \n     barely knew, with at least $10,000 in cash. They encountered \n     a medical culture where kidneys were given to those with \n     money and a doctor could stop treatment if a patient didn't \n     pay up. Surgeons advised them to wait until a major holiday, \n     when authorities traditionally execute the most prisoners.\n       China's preferred method of capital punishment, a bullet to \n     the back of the head, is conducive to transplants because it \n     does not contaminate the prisoners' organs with poisonous \n     chemicals, as lethal injections do, or directly affect the \n     circulatory system, as would a bullet through the heart.\n       More than 1,000 Malaysians have had kidney transplants in \n     China, according to an estimate by Dr. S.Y. Tan, one of \n     Malaysia's leading kidney specialists. Many patients go after \n     giving up hope of finding an organ donor in Malaysia, where \n     the average waiting period for a transplant is 16 years. \n     Interviews with patients who underwent the operation in China \n     reveal how the market for Chinese kidneys have blossomed \n     here--to the point where patients from Malacca negotiated a \n     special price with Chinese doctors.\n       In 1998, two doctors from the Third Affiliated Hospital, a \n     military-run complex in Chongqing, came to Malacca and spoke \n     at the local chapter of the Lions Club about their \n     procedures. Kidney patients worked out a deal with the \n     doctors: Residents of Malacca would be charged $10,000 for \n     the procedure instead of the $12,000 paid by other \n     foreigners. It goes without saying that the kidney \n     transplants these doctors perform are highly controversial. \n     The Transplantation Society, a leading international medical \n     forum based in Montreal, has banned the use of organs from \n     convicted criminals. Human rights groups call the practice \n     barbaric. But patients here who have undergone the operation \n     in China say they were too desperate at the time to consider \n     the ethical consequences. Today they are simply happy to be \n     alive. The trip to Chongqing offered them an escape from the \n     dialysis machines, blood transfusions, dizziness and frequent \n     bouts of vomiting. And why, they ask, should healthy organs \n     be put to waste if they can save lives?\n       ``Ethics are only a game for those people who are not \n     sick,'' says Tan Dau Chin, a paramedic who has spent his \n     career working with dialysis patients in Malacca. ``Let me \n     put it this way: What if this happened to you?'' Simon Leong, \n     35, a Malaccan who underwent a successful operation two years \n     ago in Chongqing, says the principle of buying an organ is \n     ``wrong.'' ``But I was thinking, I have two sons. Who's going \n     to provide for them?'' Corrine Yong, 54, who returned from \n     Chongqing two months ago after a successful operation, was \n     told that if she did not receive a transplant she would \n     probably not live much longer. ``I didn't have a choice,'' \n     she says of her decision to go to China. For kidney patients \n     in Malaysia the chances of obtaining a transplant from a \n     local donor are slim. Despite an extremely high death rate on \n     Malaysian roads--in a country of 22 million people, an \n     average of 16 people are killed every day in traffic \n     accidents--the organ donation system is woefully undeveloped.\n       Kidneys were transplanted from just eight donors last year. \n     Thousands of people are on the official waiting list. Dr. \n     Tan, the Malaysian kidney specialist, says the small number \n     of donors in Malaysia is partly due to religious and cultural \n     taboos. Malaysian Muslim families in particular are reluctant \n     to allow organs to be removed before burial, although this is \n     not the case in some other Muslim countries, such as Saudi \n     Arabia, which has a relatively high number of donors.\n       Organ donation has always been an uncomfortable issue. The \n     terminology is euphemistic and macabre: Doctors speak of \n     ``harvesting'' organs from patients who are brain-dead, but \n     whose hearts are still beating. And when the issue of \n     executed prisoners come into play, transplants become \n     politically explosive. ``It is well known that the death \n     penalty is often meted out in China for things that most \n     people in Western countries would not regard as capital \n     crimes,'' said Roy Calne, a professor of surgery at both \n     Cambridge University and the National University of \n     Singapore. Using organs from executed prisoners is not only \n     ethically wrong, he says, but discourages potential donors to \n     step forward in China: ``If the perception of the public in \n     China is that there's no shortage of organs you're not likely \n     to get any enthusiasm for a donation program.''\n       It is impossible to know exactly how many Asians travel to \n     China for organ transplants. But data informally collected \n     from doctors in at least three countries suggest the numbers \n     are in the hundreds every year. Also impossible to confirm is \n     whether all patients in China receive organs from executed \n     prisoners and not other donors. But patients interviewed for \n     this article say doctors in China make no secret of where the \n     organ comes from. The day before convicts are executed--\n     usually in batches--a group of patients in the hospital are \n     told to expect the operation the next day.\n       Melvin Teh, 40, a Malacca businessman who received a kidney \n     transplant from a hospital in Guangzhou two years ago, says \n     doctors did not offer the names of the prisoners. ``They just \n     tell you it was a convict,'' he said. ``They don't tell you \n     what he did.''\n       Mrs. Young says doctors told her that the donors were all \n     ``young men'' who had committed ``serious, violent'' crimes. \n     Chinese officials have admitted that organs are occasionally \n     taken from convicts, but deny that the practice is \n     widespread. ``It is rare in China to use the bodies of \n     executed convicts or organs from an executed convict,'' an \n     official from the Health Ministry was quoted as saying in the \n     China Daily in 1998. ``If it is done, it is put under \n     stringent state control and must go through standard \n     procedures.'' That view does not jibe with the stories that \n     patients from Malacca tell, where kidneys are essentially \n     handed out to the highest bidders, often foreigners.\n       Mr. Leong, the Chongquing patient, and his wife, Karen Soh, \n     who accompanied him to China, say money was paramount for the \n     surgeons involved in the operation. They recounted how \n     another malaysian kidney transplant patient who suffered \n     complications while in Chongqing had run out of cash. ``They \n     stopped the medication for one day, ``Mrs. Soh said, \n     referring to the anti-rejection drugs. The patient was \n     already very sick and eventually died of infection upon her \n     return to Malaysia, according to Mrs. Soh. Patients say they \n     are advised by friends who have already undergone a \n     transplant to bring the surgeons gifts. Mrs. Young brought a \n     pewter teapot and picture frame. Mrs. Soh and her husband \n     brought a bottle of Martell cognac, a carton of 555 brand \n     cigarettes and a bottle of perfume for the chief surgeon's \n     wife. ``They call it `starting off on the right foot,' '' \n     Mrs. Soh said.\n       After the operation was complete, the couple gave two of \n     the doctors ``red packets'' filled with cash: 3,000 yuan \n     ($360) for the chief surgeon, and 2,000 yuan for his \n     assistant. Other patients also ``tipped,'' although the \n     amounts varied. It might be tempting to see the market for \n     Chinese organs as part of the more general links that \n     overseas Chinese have with the mainland. Many of the patients \n     are indeed, ethnically Chinese and come from countries--\n     Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand--with either links to the mainland \n     or large ethnic Chinese populations. Yet if the experience of \n     Malaysian patients is any\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\n     indication, the tip to China provides a severe culture shock. \n     Patients recalled unsanitary conditions, and for those who \n     did not speak Mandarin the experience was harrowing.\n       Mr. Leong, who speaks little Mandarin, was helped by his \n     wife who wrote out a list of phrases for her husband to \n     memorize. The list included: ``I'm feeling pain!'' ``I'm \n     thirsty.'' ``Can you turn me over?'' Mr. Leong would simply \n     say the number that corresponded to his complaint and the \n     nurse would check the list. But more difficult than \n     communicating is paying for the transplant. For the Leongs it \n     involved pooling savings from family members and appealing \n     for funds through Chinese-language newspapers. The cost of an \n     operation amounts to several years' salary for many \n     Malaysians. Yet despite financial problems and culture shock, \n     all four patients interviewed for this article said they had \n     no regrets.\n       Mr. Yeo enjoys a life of relative normalcy, maintaining a \n     regular work schedule and jogging almost every day. He says \n     he was so weak before his transplant that he had trouble \n     crossing the street and climbing stairs. Four-hour sessions \n     three times a week on dialysis machines were ``living hell.'' \n     Does it disturb him that an executed man's kidney is in his \n     abdomen? ``I pray for the guy and say, `Hopefully your after \n     life is better,' '' Mr. Yeo said, And has he ever wondered \n     whether the prisoner might have been innocent? Mr. Yeo pauses \n     and stares straight ahead. ``I haven't gone through that \n     part--the moral part,'' he said. ``I don't know. I can't \n     question it too much. I have to live.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Wang Chengyong: Brokering Chinese Organs for American Patients\n\n       In February of 1998, an acquaintance informed Harry Wu of a \n     man named Wang Chengyong who was attempting to arrange kidney \n     transplants for U.S. patients in the People's Republic of \n     China. Wu videotaped conversations with Wang, a former \n     prosecutor from Hainan Province in China, who was attempting \n     to sell kidneys from executed prisoners in China to potential \n     recipients in the U.S. Wu turned over the video material to \n     the FBI, who conducted their own sting operation and arrested \n     Wang.\n       Mr. Wu participated in several taped conversations with \n     Wang Chengyong discussing the possibility of organ \n     procurement involving executed Chinese prisoners. In these \n     conversations, Harry Wu posed as a doctor from Aruba whose \n     patients were waiting for kidney transplants. Their \n     conversations revealed the entire process by which organs of \n     executed prisoners from China's Laogai are harvested and used \n     in transplant operations. [All quotes and information in \n     reference to conversations of Harry Wu and Wang Chengyong can \n     be found in the transcripts from case files of The United \n     States of America vs. Cheng Yong Wang, United States District \n     Court, Southern District of New York, government exhibit 1T.] \n     This evidence confirms the testimonies and reports from many \n     human rights organizations that have reported on this \n     practice in years past.\n\n\n                a prosecutor's view of the organs trade\n\n       In conversations negotiating potential organ deals, Mr. \n     Wang revealed many details regarding his own role as a \n     prosecutor within the process of conviction and execution of \n     Chinese prisoners, and how officials at all levels within \n     this process collaborate to harvest the organs of the \n     prisoners they execute. He stated that it could be arranged \n     for a doctor to come into the detention center to perform \n     blood tests on prisoners prior to their execution, matching \n     their blood with potential donors and ensuring that they were \n     in good health. These would be the same doctors who would \n     administer a shot of anti-coagulants directly before a \n     prisoner was shot to ease the process of organ retrieval.\n       Mr. Wang informed Mr. Wu that he should prepare his \n     patients for travel to China around the time of a national \n     holiday. ``Executing criminals during the holidays can \n     frighten criminals and maintain social safety,'' Wang \n     explained. ``Back in China, there will definitely be \n     executions before May 1st (Chinese National Labor Day), there \n     is no question about that. I have done that for a long time . \n     . . In China, every year their death-row prisoners total like \n     over 40% of the whole world's. Execution by shooting happens \n     a lot. Every year, right before the four festivities take \n     place, a group of people will surely get killed, one hundred \n     percent. It has been going on like this for decades.'' When \n     patients arrive in China, there would be no problem to \n     arrange a spot in a hospital where the operation would be \n     performed. The Public Security Bureau informs the hospital of \n     execution dates, allowing doctors to predict the time of an \n     operation. Such prediction is completely unheard of in other \n     hospitals where organs come from donors who must first sign \n     their consent for donation and then die of natural causes \n     before their organs can be removed.\n       Organs are harvested at the sight of execution. Mr. Wang \n     referred directly to Chinese regulations that forbid vehicles \n     that are market as ambulances from entering execution \n     grounds. [On October 9, 1984, a joint regulation was signed \n     entitled The Provisional Regulations of the Supreme People's \n     Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Ministry of Public \n     Security, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Public Health, and \n     Ministry of Civil Affairs on the Use of Dead Bodies or Organs \n     from Condemned Criminals. The document stipulates that \n     ``Vehicles from medical institutions may be allowed to enter \n     into the execution ground to remove organs, but vehicles \n     displaying the logo of medical institutions are not be be \n     used.''] Instead, the marked vehicles wait directly outside \n     the execution area and within minutes after the shot is \n     fired, they are permitted inside to retrieve organs from the \n     executed prisoners. Mr. Wang describes the process as \n     follows: ``Regarding the coordination by the hospital, that \n     is, we must tell them about the situation ahead of time. . . \n     . When the time comes, the hospital's vehicle will follow the \n     execution vehicle, from behind. However, the hospital vehicle \n     can't enter within the warning security line, they can only \n     park outside of the line. But once the gun shot is heard . . \n     . the medical vehicle will come in, arriving on the site. And \n     if there's anything that can be done on the scene, do that or \n     just bring it back to the hospital.'' Mr. Wang affirmed that \n     due to this efficient process of retrieval and transport, the \n     organ is only out of the body for a few short hours, \n     preserving its quality. In the US where organs must be \n     retrieved from whatever location a donor happens to die, \n     doctors are often forced to preserve organs outside the body \n     for longer periods of time.\n\n\n                          The Issue of Consent\n\n       In his conversations with Harry Wu, Wang Chengyong also \n     mentions the issue of consent. According to Wang, consent \n     must only be asked of the accused's family members. If the \n     family gives consent, authorities are free to do what they \n     will with the body after execution. If they refuse their \n     consent, they will be bribed and coerced until they give in. \n     If a criminal has no family, as Wang states the job is easier \n     still because then consent is of no issue whatsoever. When \n     asked about consent of the prisoner, Wang responds, ``. . . \n     in China this thing is different from the United States, \n     regarding this issue of dead people's organs . . . Death \n     penalty prisoners who are being executed . . . have lost all \n     their political rights.'' In reference to family consent, \n     Wang states, ``as long as one gets the family's consent, and \n     if there is no family, once he is executed, we'll just \n     directly take the corpses away . . . It is not necessary to \n     tell them about taking their organs.''\n       Due to the phenomenon of migrant labor entering cities all \n     over China, many prisoners have no family in the provine \n     where they were arrested. Wang Chengyong estimated that in \n     the prisons of Hainan (one of China's booming ``special \n     economic zones'') where he had served as a prosecutor, that \n     about one quarter of prisoners had no family in the province. \n     Regarding these migrants, Wang says, ``say you are a \n     wandering criminal . . . And once you wandered to Hainan, you \n     got arrested and you'll be killed over there. Before you are \n     killed, your family members will be notified . . . But the \n     family members may not necessarily come to collect the \n     cadaver, he may not have any family members at all.''\n\n\n             collaboration in the organ harvesting process\n\n       In China today, this blatant violation of international \n     standards of medical ethics and human rights law is \n     manipulated to create a moneymaking enterprise for all \n     parties involved. As a former prosecutor, Wang Chengyong also \n     benefited from his role in the process, and spoke of how \n     everyone receives their own payoff in collaboration for organ \n     retrieval. Wang named these separate parties as follows: \n     ``these are the several aspects, the Public Security Bureau, \n     the procuratorate, the court, the judicial organization, plus \n     hospitals and the families. Let us say, there ought to be \n     these six aspects.'' In negotiations with Mr. Wu, Wang \n     mentions each of these parties and calculates a large amount \n     of money that he will take from any individual coming from \n     the U.S. to China seeking a transplant operation. As all \n     these governmental units collaborate to make this process \n     possible, this amounts not to black market oriented scandal, \n     but an effort that is sanctioned, coordinated and carried out \n     by the Chinese government.\n       Many of Wang Chengyong's most chilling statements involve \n     the vastness of China's system of removal of organs from \n     executed prisoners for use in transplant operations. \n     According to many of Wang's statements, this procedure is \n     highly common in China and well known among all participating \n     levels. He even brags about the execution procedures in \n     Hainan Province that are especially conducive to kidney \n     harvesting. He says, ``In Hainan, they shoot at the heart, \n     from the back. And they have court doctors to confirm . . . \n     where the bullet enters. Once shot, the bullet will just go \n     through the heart . . . the heart and the kidney, they are \n     far from each other. The shots will not be off target, lest \n     damaging the kidney.'' He also quickly and easily estimates \n     that there will be at least 200 executions in Hainan Province \n     every year and that he personally can gain access to kidneys \n     and other body parts from at least fifty of these 200. He \n     tells Mr. Wu, ``Chinese hospitals do not lack for cadavers . \n     . . in China there are too many executions by shooting. The \n     medical schools can just get them any time they want . . . \n     China is not lacking in corpses.'' Later he once again \n     emphasizes this point, ``China has no lack of this . . . \n     China lacks other things. China has lots of people, lots of \n     death-row prisoners.''\n       As Wang Chengyong attempted to profit from the harvesting \n     of organs from this seemingly limitless supply of death-row \n     prisoners, he mentions the possibility of procurement of \n     kidneys, corneas and other body parts. He is an integral part \n     of a system that perpetuates this practice all over China to\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\n     the profit of Chinese governmental officials and adding one \n     more gruesome example to the list of human rights violations \n     that occur in the Chinese Laogai system.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to \nvote for the Smith amendment on organ harvesting. Do not listen to the \ntalk on the floor that we need to stay together on PNTR and not have \nany amendments which might slow down the process. I urge my colleagues \nto vote yes not only on the Smith amendment but other amendments that \nare offered by colleagues that will expose some of the basic human \nrights violations that have occurred in China and are still occurring \nin China. It is wrong to look the other way and to sanction it while we \nprovide aid, food, and trade to this nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this proposal \noffered by my distinguished colleague from New Hampshire. I must do so \nbecause its passage will endanger H.R. 4444, not because of the \nsentiments expressed in the proposal.\n  As the State Department Human Rights Report of 1999 states, in recent \nyears there have been credible reports that organs from executed \nprisoners in China were removed, sold, and transplanted. Chinese \nofficials have even confirmed that executed prisoners are among the \nsource of organs for transplant. Of course, they maintain that they get \nthe consent of prisoners or their relatives before organs are removed.\n\n  Needless to say, China's organ harvesting practices are as gruesome \nas they are indefensible. But ending trade with China is unlikely to \nforce the Chinese to change their behavior in this area. Indeed, by \nopening China to trade and to global standards of economic behavior we \nmay well prod China to abandon its practices regarding organ \nharvesting.\n  Let us remember as well that H.R. 4444 establishes a congressional-\nexecutive commission on China which I believe holds promise for \npressuring China to curb its human rights abuses, including the \ngrotesque practice of harvesting organs.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I must urge my colleagues to vote against \nthis proposal.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Smith amendment would require the \nCongressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China to \nmonitor the actions of the Government of the People's Republic of China \nwith respect to the harvesting of organs from executed prisoners. I \nbelieve the allegations that Chinese officials harvest organs from \nexecuted prisoners are extremely serious. However, the Congressional \nExecutive Commission already has jurisdiction to look at this practice \nbecause it is a human rights violation and the Commission has \njurisdiction to monitor and report on human rights violations in the \nPRC. This very serious allegation should not be singled out among all \nthe human rights abuses of the Chinese government when it is already \ncovered as part of what the Commission can monitor and report on.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 4131\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4132\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we have had a good debate over the last \n2 or 3 days on the amendment Senator Torricelli and I have set forth. \nWe have had a good discussion about the continued reports we have that \nthe Chinese, Russians, and North Koreans continue to litter this world \nwith weapons of mass destruction. And it endangers our country.\n  Bipartisan groups all across the board, just over the last 2 years, \ncontinue to remind us of this threat that is growing--it is not \ndiminishing; it is growing. These same people tell us that the key \nsuppliers are these three countries.\n  As late as 1996, we were reminded, once again, that the People's \nRepublic of China was the worst proliferator of weapons of mass \ndestruction in the entire world. We have had a good discussion on that. \nWe have had a discussion about the fact that the leaders of the PRC \nhave told us they are going to continue to do that, whether we like it \nor not, as long as we talk about protecting ourselves with a missile \ndefense system and as long as we continue to befriend Taiwan.\n  We have sent three delegations of distinguished Americans and \nleaders, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, high-level \npeople, to try to get them to relent and stand down from activities \nthat endanger us, our children, and our grandchildren and make this \nworld a more dangerous place. The leadership of the Chinese Government \ngive us basically the back of their hand. They make no pretense that \nthey are not going to act any differently in the future.\n  So the issue presented to us is: Are we, the United States \nof America, the most powerful country in the world, going to do \nanything about it? That is the issue before us today.\n\n  We have set forth an amendment which basically tracks a lot of \nlegislation that is already on the books in terms of cutting off \nmilitary-related items and dual-use items to these governments if they \nare caught in this activity. But what we add is a more extensive \nreporting requirement so we have a better understanding and a more \ndetailed understanding than the reports we receive now give us.\n  Under our amendment, it makes it a little bit more difficult for a \nPresident to game the system. The President, of course, has been quoted \nas saying that when the law requires him to impose sanctions on a \ncountry that he does not want to impose on them, sometimes he has to \nfudge the facts, and the law makes him do that. That kind of attitude, \nwhen they are caught sending M-11 missiles to Pakistan and they are \ncaught sending the ability to enrich uranium to go into nuclear \nmaterials--they are caught doing all that, with no sanctions imposed--\nall of that has resulted in a more dangerous world, not a new \nrelationship built upon trust and friendship and a strategic \npartnership--a more dangerous world.\n  So this is a good debate. My friends who oppose this amendment say \nall that may be true, we may be facing a situation where these nations, \nincluding China, are conducting themselves in a way that is detrimental \nto our interests; they may be making the world a more dangerous place, \nand especially the United States. If these rogue nations have the \nability to hit countries with their missiles, containing biological \nweapons that are indescribable in their effect, I doubt if it is going \nto be Switzerland they choose to threaten with this type weapon. We are \non the front line. We have a right to be concerned.\n  Apparently we are concerned, because we are now in the midst of a \ndebate on a national missile defense system because of this very \nthreat. Yet as we consider this new trading relationship with China, \nsome of us are refusing to consider the fact that China is one of the \nprimary reasons we have this threat because they are supplying these \nrogue nations with this weaponry.\n  There is no need to go through the list again and again and again and \nagain, the public list--not to mention the classified list that cannot \nbe disclosed--of proliferation activities and the charts we have shown \nabout the missile technology they are sending and the missile \ncomponents they are sending--our CIA reports indicate the missile \nactivity with regard to Pakistan is increasing. Practically on the eve \nof the vote for this new strategic relationship, this new partnership \nthat is going to enrich us, they are blatantly increasing their \nactivity. This is what we are facing.\n\n  It has been a good discussion. I disagree with my friends who think \neven though we have this facing us, we should put it aside for another \nday. We don't have a solution. We haven't done anything in the past. \nThere is no reason to think we are going to do anything about it in the \nfuture. There is certainly no reason for the Chinese Government to \nthink we are going to do anything about it in the future.\n  Wait for our friends and our allies to come together so we can have a \nmultilateral approach. That sounds pretty good, but how long has it \nbeen since we have had a multilateral approach on anything? We don't \nhave the ability in this country anymore to rally our allies as we once \ndid, much less do something that might cost them some trade dollars.\n  We have a threat to this country. Clearly a multilateral approach \nwould be preferable, but if we can't do that, as we obviously can't \nbecause we haven't, then we have to take action on our own.\n  So what do we do? Cut off agricultural products? Cut off trade across \nthe board? Cut off automobiles and all that? No. If they are caught \ndoing that, we cut off military equipment. We cut off dual-use items \nand others of that nature. We tell them their companies can't continue \nto use the New York Stock Exchange to raise billions of dollars when \nour Deutch Commission tells us that some of the worst proliferators, \nthese companies that are doing this activity that are owned by the \nChinese Government, are raising billions of dollars in our stock \nmarket. Does that make sense? Surely we have peace and prosperity now, \nbut how long are we going to have it? How long can we be oblivious to \nwhat is going on around us?\n  We are having this debate. Reasonable people can disagree. Some say \nwe should not get all this caught up in trade policy; We should keep \nour focus on trade; that trade is important; that we need to not \ncomplicate the trade issue. No one here has had a more consistent \nrecord than I in terms of free trade. I believe in it; whether it is \nNAFTA or fast track for President Clinton, I believe in it. Free trade \ncan lead to open markets. Open markets can lead to more open societies. \nEventually, in the long run, it can have a beneficial effect. I think \nit is going to be a much longer run in China than a lot of people \nthink, but that is another story. I am for that.\n  This is different. This is not just a trade issue. In fact, it is not \na trade issue at all. It should not be lumped in as a trade issue. I \ntried my best to get a separate vote on our amendment for 2 months. The \nsupporters of PNTR apparently thought it would be easier to\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\ndefeat me if they forced me on to this PNTR bill. So that is where we \nare. So be it.\n  But this is a national security issue. Some would say this is one of \nthose rare circumstances that we see every once in a while where we \nhave legitimate free trade interests we want to promote and expand, \neven with those who are guilty of human rights violations, even with \npeople with whom we strongly disagree, even with people who \nproliferate.\n  I intend to support PNTR. But what Senator Torricelli and I are \nsaying is that along with that, not in opposition to that, or not as \nsubstitute for that, we must take into consideration the totality of \nour relationship with this country because they are doing things that \nare dangerous to this Nation. That is the primary obligation of this \nNation. The preamble to our Constitution says the reason we even have a \nGovernment is to look after matters such as this.\n\n  It is a good debate. We have had a good back and forth for the most \npart. We steer off course a little bit every once in a while. \nUnfortunate statements are made on all sides, but that happens when \nissues are important. We spend enough time around here on things that \nare not important. It is kind of rejuvenating when we are actually \ntalking about something that is. I can't think of anything more \nimportant than this.\n  But it has taken on a new dimension. This issue has taken on a new \ndimension now because what we have seen is unprecedented lobbying and \npressure efforts to defeat the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. I hope we \ndon't flatter ourselves with that assessment. Lobbying and pressure are \nfairly common around here. People have a right to express their \nopinions.\n  But on this issue--not on any of these other issues, apparently, but \non this issue--it has brought out those who fear that in some way some \ntrade might be affected. Never mind that we have taken agriculture and \nAmerican businesses off the board; they are not involved in this at \nall. Never mind that it is not a general goods sanction or anything \nsuch as that that we are narrowly focused on here. They just believe \nthat in some way it might irritate the Chinese and they might retaliate \nin some way. We can't afford to irritate them. What we need to do is \ncontinue down the road of giving them WTO, give them veto power on our \nnational defense system, turn a blind eye to their theft of our nuclear \nweapons, turn a blind eye to the proliferation activities, go over to \nTaiwan, adopt the three noes the Chinese want us to do and put our \nallies in Taiwan in a nervous state. We need to continue down that road \nbecause it has gotten us so far, it has done so much for us, that is \nthe way we need to continue.\n  I picked up the New York Times this morning and read in an article by \nEric Schmitt the lead paragraph:\n\n       Corporate leaders and several of President Clinton's \n     cabinet officers intensified pressure today on wavering \n     Senators . . .\n\n  All you wavering Senators out there, I extend my condolences because \napparently corporate leaders and the White House have stepped up the \npressure. I don't know why. They have said all along they have the \nvotes to beat Thompson-Torricelli. I don't know why all of the \nnervousness. I don't know why all of the intensity. The President now \nhas sent out a letter that says, among his complaints, that our \namendment is unfair. I assume unfair to the Chinese Government. That is \nsuch a remarkable statement, I don't think I even need to reply to it.\n  He also has a problem because he says they have joined the \nnonproliferation treaty. They have joined the Chemical Weapons \nConvention. The Chinese Government has joined the Biological Weapons \nConvention and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. The only \nproblem with that is they have routinely violated every treaty they \nhave ever joined. And they won't join the ones that require safeguards \nso people go in and inspect these facilities. He complains that it \napplies a different standard for some countries. Well, yes, it does. \nWhy is that? Because our intelligence agencies have identified certain \ncountries as being key suppliers of weapons of mass destruction. Do we \nnot have a right to identify them and single them out? Have they not \nearned that privilege?\n  I think the integrity of the Senate is at stake with this kind of \npressure being brought to bear on a matter of national security by \nthose who do not know anything about issues of national security.\n  Many of my colleagues here, of course, are experts in this area--some \nof them. But these folks who call themselves corporate leaders--and I \ndon't think there are many of them, but they are very intense and are \ninterested in trade, so more power to them--apparently now they have \ntaken on additional portfolios. They have responded to a higher calling \ninvolving issues of war and peace. Now they advise us as to what we \nshould or should not do with regard to these proliferation issues.\n  Why do I say that the integrity of the Senate is at stake, and that \nthere are those out here who on this vote are trying to emasculate the \nprocess with the proposition that the House can act, and when they act \nand put in all of their favorite causes, justified as they are, \nincluding Radio Free Asia and things such as that, which they try to \nexpress a concern about and all that, and God bless them, that is fine; \nbut it comes over to the Senate and we are supposed to rubberstamp \nwhatever it is that is in that House bill.\n  Why is that? Even though this is such an overwhelmingly obvious boon \nto the United States, they are fearful that if we add our concerns \nabout nuclear proliferation to that list of items, if it goes back to \nthe House, even though they won by a 40-vote margin, at the last minute \npeople going into an election will switch their votes. They will look \nat our bill and say: My goodness, it has a proliferation aspect to it \nand we can't vote for that.\n  Ridiculous. It would not be 24 hours before the deed would be done. \nThat battle has been fought and won. We are going to pass PNTR. The \nreal question is, Are we going to relent to the pressure being applied?\n  Exhibit B is the same New York Times article:\n\n       Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber \n     of Commerce, warned of retribution against senators who \n     support the Thompson-Torricelli measure.\n\n  In case anybody thinks they misheard what I said, let me read that \nagain:\n\n       Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber \n     of Commerce, warned of retribution against senators who \n     support the Thompson-Torricelli measure.\n\n  You know, it would be comical if it were not so serious. One of my \ngreat disappointments in this debate is that there have been some \nbusiness leaders who have been drawn into this who really have no dogs \nin this fight because their businesses are not even affected, but they \nhave been told they are affected. They put their blinders on and they \njustly argue the benefits of trade. But they resent it, when we have \nbeen elected by the entire population--people who are not corporate \nleaders--when we address in addition to that matters of national \nsecurity.\n  That is very disappointing. It should not be that way. I don't think \nsome of these people really represent who they pretend to represent. I \ndon't know of anybody who has a better record of voting with the \nChamber of Commerce position than myself, whether it be taxes or \nregulation or any of those matters. Some of my friends in the Chamber \nof Commerce in Tennessee are here. I haven't talked to them yet. But I \nwill bet you that to a person they will say: Thompson, we elected you \nto look out for these things. We are for trade and we want trade, but \nif you think that in addition to that we need to send a signal about \npeople who are making this a more dangerous world for our kids, you \nsend that signal; we expect that of you. And if by some unforeseen \ncircumstance we lose a dollar, so be it.\n\n  I think that is the way most people think. I think that is the way \nmost businessmen and businesswomen think. I think that these little \npeople who strut around up here making implied threats on campaign \ncontributions and warning us of how we ought to vote for this, that, \nand the other, who don't know what they are talking about, need to be \ntaken down a notch or two. I haven't been around here very long, but I \nhave never seen anything such as that. He is warning of those who allow \nthese folks to get tangled up in the politics of nuclear proliferation. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nthe small-mindedness we deal with here regarding this statement.\n  I feel sorry for the men and women out there in all the Chambers of \nCommerce around this country, to have this kind of representation in \nthe New York Times and how people think that that represents their idea \nof the priorities that we have in this country. The lobby is intense. I \nassure you it is on one side.\n  You will not see the Halls littered with people out here saying \n``keep our country safe.'' There are no lobbyists being paid to do \nthat. No one makes any money off of our amendment. There are no tanks \nbought; there is nothing sold. All of the lobby, all of the pressure, \nall of the threats are on one side. So why it would be that the \nopponents of our amendment who claim they have the votes don't want to \neven give us a vote is something that perhaps ought to be contemplated.\n  Could it be that people really don't want to go on record because \nthey realize they are casting their fate to the good graces of the \nleadership of the Chinese Government--and they have a consistent \npattern of this activity and we catch them from time to time? It is \ngoing to continue and we are going to continue to catch them. Could it \nbe that some people don't want to have cast a vote against a modest \nattempt for a better reporting requirement, a more transparent process, \ngiving Congress an opportunity, in unusual circumstances, to have their \nsay?\n  Again, there are two issues here now, it seems to me. One is on the \nmerits and another is the integrity of the Senate and how we are going \nto handle this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenator from California finishes, I be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object, if the Senator will \namend the request that I be recognized following him, I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Reserving the right to object, I would like to follow the \nSenator from New Jersey, as well. I have been waiting.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might the chairman present a request in \nwriting as to the timing? I think we can get that up right quick.\n  Mr. ROTH. In the meantime, let the Senator from California proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Thompson \namendment, and then I hope I can make a few comments on what I believe \nto be one of the most important pieces of legislation on which this \nCongress will be voting. Let me begin by saying this. If I believed \nthis amendment would keep our country safe, I would vote for it. I do \nnot believe that is the case. Rather, I believe the amendment is deeply \nflawed and it has major procedural and review problems. I want to point \nthose out.\n  Let me say, first of all, to most of us, the draft of this amendment \nwas available Monday night, a little more than a day ago. Yet it is a \nmajor, long-range piece of legislation that has major implications for \nnational security, for peace, and stability in the Asia Pacific region. \nTo pass it without careful analysis, without full hearings, and without \ncareful judgment is something to which I am not willing to be a party. \nThere have been no hearings on this or any draft of this legislation. \nThe National Security Council and the State Department have not had the \nopportunity to provide a full analysis of this latest version of the \namendment or assess its likely short- and long-term impact.\n  I am one of those who believes it would, in fact, doom giving China \npermanent normal trading status. I am simply not willing to do that. \nMost importantly, from what I have been able to perceive, I believe the \nlegislation has serious flaws.\n  First, it focuses on three countries. It separates them from all the \nother countries. It applies a standard to them that exists for no one \nelse. And I do not believe that is in the best interests of sound \ndecisionmaking.\n  Second, the mandatory sanctions put in place by this amendment have \nhair triggers which are tripped by minimal evidence--indeed not \nnecessarily even evidence. The raw intelligence data that provides the \n``credible information'' trigger of this amendment requires followup, \nsubstantiation, and analysis before it is used to initiate action. It \nshould be the starting point for processes that weigh options and \nconsider appropriate action, not an end point that instantly triggers \nstrong responses.\n  Let me give you one example: In 1993, the Yin He incident, where \nbased on ``credible information'' the United States publicly accused \nChina of shipping proscribed chemical precursors to Iran. The Chinese \nfreighter in question was diverted and every single container searched, \nat great cost and inconvenience to all involved. There were no banned \nchemicals aboard. The Thompson amendment would have mandated sanctions.\n  Second, there is no way to target the sanctions which would be \ntriggered by this amendment, and no effective Presidential waiver for \nnational security interests. It is a blunt instrument more likely to \nhurt American interests than to change China's behavior.\n  Third, the amendment invites diplomatic and, yes, maybe even legal \nproblems with other countries, including allies. The amendment as \ndrafted could create a situation whereby sanctions would be placed on \ncorporations of allied countries that are not acting illegally.\n  Fourth, especially chilling is the way in which the amendment's \nwording could, in effect, blacklist any company tagged as a \nproliferating agent under this amendment's low standard of proof.\n  These are just a few of the examples of some of the problems with \nthis amendment. Several of my colleagues have discussed other \nshortcomings at greater length.\n  Automatic sanctions set off by low thresholds of evidence offer \nlittle to entice allies to join us in implementing an effective \nsanctions regime, but they most certainly will damage U.S.-China \nrelations. They most certainly will weaken our ability to engage the \nChinese in any kind of worthwhile dialog or influence them to change \ntheir behavior.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to this amendment.\n  Let me, if I might, say a few things about the bilateral agreement \nthat really is the issue before us today. I reviewed it carefully, and \nI believe that in this agreement China has made significant market-\nopening concessions to the United States across virtually every \neconomic sector.\n  For example, on agricultural products, tariffs will drop from an \naverage of 31 percent to 14 percent by January of 2004. Industrial \ntariffs will fall from an average of 24.6 percent in 1997 to 9.4 \npercent by 2005.\n  China agrees to open up distribution services, such as repair and \nmaintenance, warehousing, trucking, and air courier services.\n  Import tariffs on autos, now ranging between 80 percent and 100 \npercent, are broken down to 25 percent by 2006 with tariff reductions \naccelerated.\n  China will participate in the Information Technology Agreement and \nwill eliminate tariffs on products such as computers, semiconductors, \nand related products by 2005.\n  It will open its telecommunications sector, including access to \nChina's growing Internet services, and expand investment and other \nactivities for financial services firms.\n  The agreement also preserves safeguards against dumping and other \nunfair trade practices. Specifically, the ``special safeguard rule''--\nto prevent import surges into the United States--will remain in force \nfor 12 years, and the ``special anti-dumping methodology'' will remain \nin effect for 15 years.\n\n  No matter how you look at it, this benefits the United States.\n  I think many people have confused this PNTR vote with a vote to \napprove China joining the World Trade Organization. It needs to be \nunderstood that China will likely join the WTO within the next year \nregardless of our action. The issue will, in fact, be decided by the \nWTO's working group and a two-thirds vote of the WTO membership as a \nwhole.\n\n[[Page S8453]]\n\n  Under WTO rules, only the countries that have ``nondiscriminatory'' \ntrade practices--that is PNTR--are entitled to receive the benefit of \nWTO agreements. Without granting China permanent normal trading status, \nthe United States effectively cuts itself out of China's vast markets, \nwhile Britain, Japan, France, and all other WTO nations are allowed to \ntrade with few barriers.\n  In my view, this has been an interesting exercise because it has been \nhighly politicized. The bottom line is if we don't grant China PNTR \nbased on the November bilateral agreement, an agreement in which the \nUnited States received many important trade concessions and gave up \nnothing, we effectively shoot ourselves in the foot. We take ourselves \nout of the agreement, China still goes into the WTO, and those other \nstrategic trading blocks such as the European Union receive the \nbenefits of the bilateral agreement. We do not.\n  I think it is much broader than this. But I think there is an \nultimate issue at stake. That is this: The People's Republic of China \nis today undergoing its most significant period of economic and social \nactivity since its founding 50 years ago. The pace is fast and the \nchanges are large.\n  I am one who studies Chinese history. I have been watching China for \nover 30 years. I made my first trip in 1979. I try to visit China every \nyear, if I can, and I have watched and I have seen.\n  In a relatively short time, China has become a key Pacific rim \nplayer, and a major world trader. It is a huge producer and consumer of \ngoods and services--a magnet for investment and commerce. Because of \nits size and potential, the choices China makes over the next few years \nwill greatly influence the future of peace and prosperity in Asia.\n  In a very real sense, the shaping of Asia's future begins with \nchoices America will make in how to deal with China.\n  I come from a Pacific rim State; 60 percent of the people of the \nworld live on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. The trade on that ocean \nlong ago over took the trade on the Atlantic Ocean. It is, in fact, the \nocean of the future.\n  We can try to engage China and integrate it into the global \ncommunity. We can be a catalyst for positive change. Few objective \nobservers would argue that despite the problems that still remain, \nthere have not been significant benefits and advances in China that \nhave come from two decades of interaction with the United States and \nthe West. Or, we can deal antagonistically with China. We can lose our \nleverage in guiding China along positive paths of economic, political, \nand social development, and sacrifice business advantage to competitor \nnations while gaining nothing in return.\n  As I see it, for the foreseeable future America faces no greater \nchallenge than the question of how to persuade China that it is in \nChina's own national interests to move away from authoritarian \ngovernment and toward a more open, a more pluralistic and freer \nsociety. How do we convince China to make the political, economic and \nsocial changes that will help China evolve the leadership that will \nmake it guarantor of peace and stability in the Pacific rim, throughout \nAsia and the world?\n  I am convinced that Congress will debate few issues more important \nthis year than the question of China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization and whether or not we will deal with the Chinese on the \nbasis of a permanent normal trade relationship.\n  Trade means change in China. Economic engagement with the United \nStates has been one of the prime motivating factors in China's decision \nto move toward a market economy and away from its self-isolation of \ndecades. The past 20 years have brought massive social reform and \neconomic advancement for China's people. I remember the first time I \ntraveled to China in 1979. I saw a land of subdued people, grey Mao \nsuits, few consumer goods, no conveniences, poor living conditions and \nlittle personal, economic or political freedom. The economy was all \ncentrally controlled; little private property and private business \nexisted.\n  Today, the goods, services, housing, and freedoms available to \nresidents of Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou are \ngreatly improved. People have become interested in what happens outside \nof China. People will speak more freely. Living standards are higher. \nChina is increasing turning to private ownership--as much as 50 percent \nof the economy is in private hands in boom areas like the Pearl River \nDelta in Southern China.\n  Large, inefficient state enterprises are closing or being converted \nto private ownership. Entrepreneurship is on the rise in the cities in \nmuch of the countryside. Cutting our bilateral economic ties will \naccomplish nothing except to turn back the clock in China to favor more \ngovernment controls, seek to isolate this growing economy, and very \nlikely strengthen repressive political interests linked to \nprotectionism and economic nationalism within the PRC.\n  It is evident to me that flourishing business relationships have \ndeveloped increased contacts, improved mutual understandings, and \npersonal relationships between Americans and Chinese.\n  This, in turn, has fostered many positive changes, as different ways \nof thinking percolate through Chinese society at many levels. It is \nthere; I have seen it. American firms have brought new management \nstyles, innovative ideas, and new work styles to China. Through their \npresence in China's economy, Americans have spread their corporate \nphilosophies, teaching Chinese entrepreneurs, managers, and workers \nabout market economics, commitment to free flows of information, the \nrule of law--the most important thing--dedication to environmental \nresponsibility, and worker rights and safety.\n  Yes, it is far from perfect. But are things changing? The answer by \nany objective criteria has to be yes. Are there flaws? Are there \nproblems? Does China very often do stupid things? Yes: The crackdown on \nFalun Gong, in my view a stupid thing, an unnecessary thing, something \nthat, once again, pushes it backwards rather than forwards. Its \ntreatment of Tibet--has China done the wrong thing? Absolutely. For 10 \nyears I have been saying that and will continue to say it. It makes no \nsense for a great nation to treat a major minority the way in which the \nTibetan people are treated. I will say that over and over again. I will \nwork to change it. And one day we will succeed and do that, too. But we \ncannot do it if we isolate China. We cannot do it if we play into the \nhands of the hardliners. We cannot do it if we create the kind of \nadversarial relationship that is determined to make China into the next \nSoviet Union. I believe that firmly, and 30 years of watching has \nconfirmed it.\n  American firms exercise a very real influence over the changes \noccurring in Chinese society. That influence will not survive the \nelimination of PNTR. American businesses in China bring American values \nto China. But, they cannot bring them if their ability to operate is \nundercut. History clearly shows us a nation's respect for political \npluralism, human rights, labor rights, and environmental protection \ngrows alongside that nation's positive interaction with others and \nachieving a level of sustainable economic development and social well-\nbeing.\n  People who have a full stomach then begin to say: What is next? \nPeople who have an education then begin to question the leadership. \nThat will happen in China just as it did in Taiwan, just as it did in \nSouth Korea. Not too long ago, both were governed by dictatorships. \nGiven a chance, China can change as well.\n  If we are serious about building a peaceful, prosperous and stable \nAsia, if we are serious about being a force for good in the Pacific rim \nin the 21st century, if we are serious about working to bring about \ndemocratic reforms, human rights reforms, and labor reforms in China, \nwe also must establish permanent normal trade relations with China. \nThis is part of the equation for making China into a member of the WTO \nand the world community as a whole, and saying that China must, in \nreturn, play by the same rules all other members follow. It also \nexposes China to sanctions in the WTO should they not. As a WTO member, \nChina commits to eliminate barriers to its markets; to accept WTO \nrulings concerning trade practices and procedures; and to abide by WTO \ndecisions concerning trade disputes.\n\n[[Page S8454]]\n\n  The November 15, 1999 U.S.-China WTO Agreement marked successful \ncompletion of 13 years of difficult U.S.-China negotiations.\n  I, for one, am convinced that normalizing our trade relationship with \nChina is absolutely in our own best interest. But it is absolutely in \nthe best interests of seeing China becoming a pluralistic society, of \ndeveloping the concern for human rights that we in the Western World \nhold so dear, of understanding the freedoms provided to us because of \nour due process of law, of understanding how important it is that a \njudiciary be independent from the politics of government, having a \nmodern commercial code and a modern criminal code. None of these things \nChina has today.\n\n  As has often been said, it has to be remembered that China, for 5,000 \nyears, has been ruled by despotic emperors and for 50 years by \nrevolutionary leaders who had no education. This is really, in over \n5,000 years, the first time this largest nation on Earth has had an \neducated leadership who is now, today, striving to open the door to the \nWestern World.\n  Remember the Boxer Rebellion? Remember what happened? Remember the \nhumiliation, the isolation of China, and look what happened. We now \nhave a chance in this legislation to take a different course. Most \nimportantly--and this is what has amazed me so much about this debate--\nPNTR is nothing special. It simply means we will conduct our trade with \nChina in the same manner and under the same rules that we conduct trade \nwith almost every other nation in the world. In fact, there are only \nsix countries with which we do not have normal trade relations--\nAfghanistan, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Serbia-Montenegro, and Vietnam. \nAll of them are small nations.\n  In my view, the damage of denying China permanent normal trade \nrelations would strike even deeper. Punitive U.S. economic policies \naimed at unpalatable Chinese domestic practices will not only cut into \nAmerican jobs, it will slice at China's newly emerging market-oriented \nentrepreneurial class, the driving force behind the very changes we \nseek to cultivate without eliminating the targeted abuses in Chinese \nsociety. What kind of sense does that make?\n  Responsible American voices in business, in education, in law, and in \nreligion understand that attacking China through economic ties is \ncounterproductive. It endangers the very social elements within China \nthat are most compatible with ethical American norms.\n  Trade relations do not only benefit business. They are a key part of \nthe foundation that supports the entire U.S.-China relationship. I \nbelieve that not only do we shoot ourselves in the foot by denying \nPNTR, we strike a blow against encouraging China to see that it is to \nits interest to make the necessary changes, to understand that it, too, \nby open doors, more ties across the Pacific, more pluralistic \ngovernment, more freedoms for its people evolves as a stronger nation, \nnot a weaker nation. That was the case with Taiwan. That has been the \ncase with South Korea. I submit to you, Mr. President, it is the case \nof virtually every country that lives under dictatorship or absolute \nrule.\n  Pluralism results from an evolution and a growth in human standards, \nin economic standards, in interaction with the rest of the world. China \nwill be no different if we enable it to open itself to the world. We \nshould be prudent, we should be watchful, we should be strong, we \nshould confront them where wrong--no question about that. I believe we \nhave the adequate tools to do it.\n  I have seen sanctions placed since I have been in this body, and I do \nnot believe the amendment before this body will encourage the kind of \nbehavior that can enable China to eventually be a stable, sound partner \nanywhere in the Pacific or elsewhere. I feel very strongly about this. \nI thank the Chair for his forbearance. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I support and will vote for granting \npermanent normal trade relations status to the People's Republic of \nChina .\n  I will do so because the agreement negotiated between the United \nStates and China will help level the playing field for a wide range of \nAmerican companies who seek to do business in China.\n  I also support the bipartisan amendment offered by Senators Fred \nThompson and Robert Torricelli to require certain reports and to impose \nsanctions on entities identified by the President for their sale or \ntransfer of dangerous technology to rogue regimes.\n  We cannot stand idly by while China continues to proliferate nuclear \nweapon and missile technology to unstable regions.\n  There are numerous reports that this pattern of dangerous behavior by \nBeijing is continuing. For example, the CIA Director George Tenet \nrecently issued a report to Congress on recent developments in \nproliferation.\n  That report asserts that China has increased its missile-related \nassistance to Pakistan and continues to provide missile-related \nassistance to Iran, North Korea, and Libya.\n  These are governments which our own State Department has labeled as \nstate sponsors of terrorism.\n  Who are the ultimate targets for these missiles and nuclear and \nchemical weapons in the hands of terrorist states? It is the American \npeople, our friends and allies, and our military forces deployed in \nhot-spots such as the Persian Gulf.\n  Let me state it differently: When China proliferates dangerous \ntechnology to dangerous states, it directly and very negatively affects \nour national security.\n  The Clinton administration says it, too, is concerned about this \nbehavior. But it has failed--resoundingly failed--to stop it. Our CIA \ntells us that these activities are on-going today.\n  So we need to do more, and this bipartisan amendment makes a strong \nstatement that either this proliferation behavior stops or real and \ncredible penalties will be imposed.\n  I say to my colleagues who, like me, support granting PNTR for China: \nLet's not lose sight of the national security issues at stake here.\n  I, like Senator Thompson, would have preferred to consider this \nimportant legislation on another bill and not on H.R. 4444. In fact, I \nmade every effort to see to it that the Thompson-Torricelli legislation \ncould be considered either as a free-standing measure or as an \namendment to some other piece of legislation.\n  However, my efforts to have the Thompson-Torricelli amendment \nconsidered separate from the China PNTR legislation was blocked.\n  Therefore, we now are faced with a vote on the Thompson-Torricelli \namendment on H.R. 4444. Given this situation, I will support the \namendment and oppose the motion to table.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I share Senator Thompson's and Senator \nTorricelli's concerns about weapons proliferation, and I appreciate \ntheir bringing this important matter up for debate in a non-partisan \nfashion. However, I believe that the amendment they have offered to \nH.R. 4444, legislation that will grant permanent normal trade relations \nto the People's Republic of China, does not address the issue in the \nmost positive way.\n  My first concern with the China Nonproliferation Act is with the name \nitself. The original legislation proposed by the sponsors of this \namendment specifically singled out China. But, the current amendment \nadds North Korea and Russia as nations that are named as covered \ncountries under this proposal. I believe it is correct to expand the \nlist of initial countries beyond China, but I still feel that on the \nissue of proliferation, every country should be treated with a uniform \nstandard.\n  The second concern is that this amendment attempts to curtail the \nspread of weapons with a unilateral rather than a multilateral \nsolution. It is clear to me that this issue is sufficiently complex to \ndemand the cooperation of the international community in stopping the \nproliferation of weapons. While this amendment singles out North Korea, \nRussia, and China as covered countries, it also opens the door to \npossible sanctions on our closest allies. This is because of the \nrequirement that countries listed in the annual section 721 report that \nis mandated under the fiscal year 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act \nbe covered by this amendment. This report singles out those nations \nthat are a source of dual-use technology which, in recent years, has \nincluded such countries as\n\n[[Page S8455]]\n\nGermany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. I do not believe that \nsanctioning our closest allies--those that traditionally support our \ninterests--will further our non-proliferation goals. Furthermore, using \nunilateral sanctions rather than working with our allies to develop \nmultilateral strategies is not the most effective means of curtailing \nproliferation.\n  Another concern with the amendment is that the sanctions would deny \nall state-owned enterprises of a covered country access to U.S. capital \nmarkets. This was one reason why Alan Greenspan publicly spoke out \nagainst this amendment at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee. He \nstated that ``. . . to the extent that we block foreigners from \ninvesting or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut \nthe viability of our own system.''\n  Finally, I am concerned that this amendment will not provide the \nnecessary flexibility for the executive and legislative branch to \nconduct policy on proliferation issues. The amendment gives the \nPresident only 30 days from the time he issues a report to Congress on \nproliferation to impose five unilateral mandatory sanctions. After the \nPresident makes this determination, the amendment allows for as few as \n20 Senators to initiate a reversal of the President's decision. It \nwould take only 20 Senators to ensure that a resolution of disapproval \nbe referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations. The committee would \nthen only have 15 calendar days to consider such a resolution. If the \nresolution is not reported in that timeframe, it would be sent to the \nfloor with debate limited to 10 hours and a vote required within 15 \ndays. Given the inadequate evidentiary standard of ``credible \ninformation'' that is provided for in this amendment, this expedited \nprocedure is a recipe for bad policy.\n  I do look forward to discussing this matter further both here on the \nSenate floor and within the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This \ncomplex issue requires further review and debate separate from the \ncurrent business of granting permanent normal trade relations to the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nThompson-Torricelli amendment, or the ``China Nonproliferation Act.''\n  I do so as a Senator who has long been concerned about the threat \nposed by China's reckless proliferation of nuclear, missile and other \ntechnologies, and as chairman of the Intelligence Committee, with \nresponsibility for our intelligence efforts against this critical \nnational security threat.\n  While this amendment applies to other countries, including Russia and \nNorth Korea, we are considering it in the context of Permanent Normal \nTrade Relations for the People's Republic of China, or PNTR. Therefore, \nmy remarks will, for the most part, focus on that country.\n  I should say at the outset that I intend to support PNTR because I \nbelieve that, on balance, taking this step will further U.S. national \ninterests.\n  But China remains, in the words of the Director of Central \nIntelligence, a ``key supplier'' of sensitive technologies to Iran, \nPakistan and other countries.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Intelligence Committee has prepared \nand made available to Members a summary and compendium of recent \nintelligence reporting on PRC proliferation. It remains available for \nyour review.\n  I understand that only a handful of Senators have availed themselves \nof this opportunity. I urge each of you to review this very disturbing \nand revealing material. Without having done so, you will be voting on \nthis amendment ignorant of the facts as we know them.\n  Whether you choose to vote for or against this amendment, you must \nnot do so without a full appreciation of the facts.\n  Suffice it to say that China has not improved its poor proliferation \nrecord.\n  In light of the poor Chinese proliferation record, I believe that \nrisks associated with approving PNTR are managed better if the \nThompson-Torricelli amendment is enacted with our new trade \nrelationship with China.\n  Since the sponsors and other Senators are addressing the threat to \nour national security posed by Chinese proliferation, I will focus \nprimarily on some of those aspects of the problem of greatest concern \nto the Intelligence Committee.\n  Tracking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has been \namong the Intelligence Committee's very highest budgetary priorities.\n  This is because proliferation is one of our most daunting and \nresource-intensive intelligence challenges. The materials and \ntechnology to build nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons and the \nmissiles to deliver them are not shipped in the open. They are smuggled \nacross borders and shipped under false documents.\n  Vital technical support to a country's missile or nuclear program may \nfit on a single computer disk or take the form of clandestine visits by \ntechnical experts.\n  The materials used in making weapons of mass destruction and their \nmeans of delivery are often dual use, meaning that they may also be \nused for peaceful purposes.\n  Our intelligence analysts must compile all the facts to determine the \nlikely use of these materials. This really is rocket science, and \nnuclear science, and biological and chemical science.\n  Tracking proliferation is not only difficult, it is a critical \nmission. Timely intelligence provides us with the information we need \nto support our efforts to deter or dissuade countries, like the \nPeople's Republic of China and Russia, from selling nuclear, chemical, \nbiological or missile technologies to rogue states or regions of \ninstability.\n  When deterrence and dissuasion fail, timely intelligence also will \nsupport efforts to counter the proliferation and use of missiles and \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  What is especially frustrating for me, as chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, is that while the Intelligence Community is \ndoing its job, gathering intelligence at great expense and risk about \nwho is selling and who is buying technologies of mass destruction, this \nintelligence is ignored by policymakers.\n  Policy makers have frequently circumvented our sanctions laws by \navoiding reaching a determination that could trigger sanctions. They \nhave ensured that the bureaucratic process for reaching a determination \nthat would lead to sanctions is never started, or completed, or \nimpossible standards of evidence are set, so that a judgment never has \nto be reached.\n  A case in point is the notorious M-11 missile. After years of closed \ndoor deliberations on this issue, in September of last year, for the \nfirst time, the Intelligence Community stated publicly its longstanding \nconclusion that ``Pakistan has M-11 SRBMs [Short Range Ballistic \nMissiles] from China. . . .''\n  Lest anyone miss the significance of these Chinese missiles now in \nthe hands of Pakistan, or their contribution to instability in South \nAsia, the community assessed further that these missiles may have a \nnuclear role.\n  Sales of M-11 technology have twice triggered sanctions against the \nPRC under the Arms Export Control Act and Export Administration Act. \nThe sale of M-11 missiles should, under current law, have triggered \nadditional, even stricter, sanctions.\n  But despite the clear, and public, conclusion of the Intelligence \nCommunity, the State Department has suggested that the Intelligence \nCommunity's finding that the M-11 missiles were sold by the PRC to \nPakistan did not meet its ``high standard of evidence.''\n  Failure to follow through on the facts, however unpleasant the facts \nmay be, undercuts the credibility of our entire nonproliferation \npolicy.\n  I am hopeful that the Thompson-Torricelli amendment will force a more \nrobust response to the intelligence collected on proliferation. Under \nthis amendment, policy makers will be forced--on an annual basis--to \ncollect the evidence of proliferation and provide a report to Congress.\n  This report will be more comprehensive and focused than those we have \nreceived to date.\n  The report must identify persons from China, Russia, North Korea and \nother states when there is credible evidence that this person has \ncontributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic missiles.\n  The report also will identify any person of a covered country that is \nengaged in activities prohibited under the\n\n[[Page S8456]]\n\nrelevant treaties and agreements regarding the possession and transfer \nof chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons.\n  The President is directed in the China Nonproliferation Act to report \ninformation on noncompliance with international arms control and \nproliferation agreements by the covered countries.\n  Finally, the report must include an assessment of the threats to our \nnational security, and that of our allies, resulting from \nproliferation--whether or not this proliferation can be determined to \nmeet the legal or evidentiary standards the State Department asserts to \navoid reaching sanctions judgements.\n  This will go a long way towards compelling the State Department to \nacknowledge serious instances of nuclear and other proliferation.\n  Furthermore, the Director of Central Intelligence is required to \nreach a determination regarding what transfer or sale of goods, \nservices, or technology have a ``significant potential to make a \ncontribution to the development, improvement, or production of nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical weapons or of ballistic or cruise missile \nsystems.''\n  Again, mandating this report will allow us to avoid the unpleasant \nsituation we have been in for years in which the President has been \nable to avoid reaching necessary judgements about proliferation \nactivities and their consequences.\n  This report will contribute significantly to the ability of the U.S. \nCongress to conduct oversight and to make informed judgements on \nmatters of national security.\n  The information detailed in the report should better enable us to \njudge the appropriateness and, over time, the effectiveness of the \nsanctions provided for in this amendment.\n  Some have complained that this bill forces the President to impose \nsanctions. This is not the case.\n  The amendment provides adequate flexibility to the President since he \ncan waive the sanctions.\n  However, he must specify his reasons for doing so, and Congress may \ndisagree through procedures set out in the bill. This legislation will \nmake Presidential decision-making more transparent and will ensure that \nthe President's decisions are based on the best intelligence available.\n  Mr. President, would our citizens want to continue to sell items on \nthe United States Munitions List to an individual that has \n``contributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise \nmissiles'' for a third party or state.\n  Would our citizens want to continue to license dual-use items that \ncould contribute to this individual's proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction?\n  Would our citizens want to continue to provide that individual \nGovernment assistance in the form of grants, loans, or credits?\n  Would our citizens want to continue co-development or co-production \nof items on our munitions list with that individual?\n  Of course not. Of course not.\n  I hope we can agree that the United States should neither reward nor \ncontribute to proliferation of the weapons that threaten our own \nNation.\n  Without question, the imposition of sanctions against another nation \nor foreign companies is always a serious matter.\n  The imposition of sanctions has significant foreign and economic \npolicy consequences for the United States and should not be undertaken \nlightly.\n  Because sanctions can be costly for our own American industries, we \nmust be sure there is a clear national security interest that will be \nadvanced by the sanctions.\n  Curbing proliferation meets this test. The President has declared the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction to be a ``national \nemergency,'' and I think most of us agree with that declaration.\n  I support the Thompson-Torricelli amendment because it takes a \nbalanced, measured approach to the problem of sanctioning Chinese \nproliferation activities, and similar activities of other countries.\n  In particular, it creates a process to ensure that the U.S. response \nto future activities of proliferation is never again the inaction, \nindifference, and self-deception that characterizes the current \nprocess.\n  I believe this bill will bring us closer to a situation in which the \nPRC and other supplier nations clearly understand--for the first time--\nthat there will be serious consequences when they engage in \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction that threaten the United \nStates, its allies, and friends.\n  Mr. President, I again urge my colleagues to review the available \nintelligence. The facts speak for themselves, and they speak very \nloudly indeed.\n  I urge adoption of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, as this body discusses the China Non-\nproliferation amendment, I would like to comment briefly on Chinese \nactions that have not only damaged the national security of the United \nStates, but are antithetical to the peace and stability of the entire \nworld--weapons of mass destruction and missile proliferation. I am \ndismayed that the government of the People's Republic of China has \nconsistently brutalized its own population, intimidated its neighbors, \nand provided the world's most dangerous technology to ``States of \nConcern''--in direct violation of international agreements, domestic \nlaw, and fundamental international standards of behavior. It is time \nfor the Senate to speak in a clear, definitive voice against China's \nactions.\n  The facts are that China has provided nuclear, biological, and \nchemical weapons technology, along with ballistic and cruise missiles \nto ``States of Concern''--previously referred to as ``Rogue Nations''--\nincluding Iran, Pakistan, Iraq, Libya, Syria, North Korea, and Algeria. \nCongress should not stand idly by as China continues these practices. \nPassage of the China Non-Proliferation amendment is a prudent step in \nthe right direction to address this problem. The amendment is both a \nreasonable and measured response to the serious situation that this \nAdministration has allowed to continue.\n  While I prefer to see this bill, the China Non-proliferation Act, \npassed as a separate measure and not as an amendment to the China-\nPermanent Normal Trade Relations, PNTR, bill, it is now clear that the \ncritical and timely nature of this issue, combined with the \ncounterproductive actions of those trying to prevent its consideration, \nhave left us in the position of having to vote on this today. I reject \nthe notion that a vote on this amendment is a vote against granting \nPNTR to China. This is simply not the case. The Thompson amendment will \nnot kill PNTR or even place conditions on granting PNTR for China. This \namendment will simply stem the flow of unauthorized information on \nnuclear, biological, and chemical weapons technology by creating real \nconsequences for proliferating countries. I believe that these \nconsequences, coupled with strong leadership by the Executive Branch, \ncan dramatically slow proliferation.\n  Senator Thompson's amendment addresses proliferation concerns by \nrequiring the President to submit a report to Congress identifying \nevery person, company, or governmental entity of the major \nproliferating nations--China, Russia, and North Korea are currently on \nthis list--against which credible evidence exists that the entity \ncontributed to the design, development, production, or acquisition of \nnuclear, chemical, or biological weapons or ballistic or cruise \nmissiles by a foreign person. Based on this report, the President would \nthen be required to impose specific measures against foreign companies \nin these countries who have been identified as proliferators. For \nexample, under this amendment if a Chinese company provided nuclear \ntechnology to Iran, the United States would deny all pending licenses \nand suspend all existing licenses for the sale of military items and \nmilitary-civilian dual-use items and technology as controlled under the \nCommerce Control List to that company. Additionally, the President \nwould be required to impose an across-the-board prohibition on any U.S. \ngovernment purchases of goods or services from, and U.S. government \nassistance, including grants, loans, credits, or guarantees, to this \ncompany.\n  In addition to the mandatory sanctions imposed on proliferating \nforeign\n\n[[Page S8457]]\n\ncompanies, the amendment would also authorize the President to impose \ndiscretionary measures against the key supplier countries. Foreign \ncompanies do not act alone in the proliferation of weapons; it is quite \nclear that China, Russia, and North Korea all actively support \nproliferation activities, and therefore must be held accountable for \ntheir actions. This amendment recognizes this truth and would empower \nthe President to apply discretionary measures against them as well, \nsuch as:\n  Suspension of all military-to-military contacts and exchanges between \nthe covered country and the United States;\n  Suspension of all United States assistance to the covered country by \nthe United States Government;\n  Prohibition on the transfer or sale or after-sale servicing, \nincluding the provision of replacement parts, to the covered country or \nany national of the covered country of any item on the United States \nMunitions List, which includes all military items, and suspension of \nany agreement with the covered country or any national of the covered \ncountry for the co-development or co-production of any item on the \nUnited States Munitions List.\n  Suspension of all scientific, academic, and technical exchanges \nbetween the covered country and the United States;\n\n  Prohibition on the transfer or sale to the covered country or any \nnational of the covered country of any item on the Commerce Control \nList, which includes military-civilian dual-use items, that is \ncontrolled for national security purposes and prohibition of after-sale \nservicing, including the provision of replacement parts for such items;\n  Denial of access to capital markets of the United States by any \ncompany owned or controlled by nationals of the covered country;\n  Prohibition on the transfer or sale to the covered country or any \nnational of the covered country of any item on the Commerce Control \nList and prohibition of after-sale servicing, including the provision \nof replacement parts for such items.\n  Due to the highly sensitive national security issues involved in \ncases of proliferation, any of the sanctions can be waived by the \nPresident if he determines: (1) that the person did not engage in the \nproliferation activities; (2) that the supplier country was taking \nappropriate actions to penalize entities for acts of proliferation and \nto deter future proliferation; or (3) that such a waiver was important \nto the national security of the United States.\n  I believe that these measures, affecting both the proliferating \ncompany and country, if applied consistently and fairly by the \nPresident, can and will stem the serious problem of weapons \nproliferation. China, along with Russia and North Korea, must \nunderstand that there are real consequences for continuing this \nreckless behavior, and the United States must take a stand and lead the \ncharge to stop such proliferation. Passage of the Thompson amendment \nwill accomplish that goal.\n  A firm stand against proliferation is desperately needed. Chinese \nproliferation, along with that of Russia and North Korea, is continuing \nunabated to the detriment of America's national security. It is well \ndocumented that China has provided sensitive technology to at least \nseven States of Concern, including Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, Syria, North \nKorea, and Algeria. Most of these states have explicitly threatened the \nsecurity of the United States and actively sponsored terrorism. The \nremaining countries are in regions where war is commonplace and the \nconsequences for the use of WMD would be especially devastating. Of \nthese proliferation cases, the two most horrendous cases are Pakistan \nand Iran.\n  Pakistan is a nation of tremendous unrest and instability, and China \nhas provided it with extensive nuclear and missile technology. Born in \nconflict, Pakistan was created with India out of one people and one \nterritory, and conflict has defined this nation throughout its history. \nPakistan fought three wars and numerous border skirmishes against \nIndia, its principal adversary. These battles have been mostly fought \nover the hotly contested Kashmir region bordering northeast Pakistan. \nThe Kashmir conflict is widely accepted by International Affairs and \nDefense experts as one of the most likely conflicts to erupt into a \nnuclear war. China, to a great extent, has not only fostered the \nconflict through political posturing and land-grabbing, but it has also \nprovided the nuclear weapons that would be used in such a war. China \ncontinues to provide critical nuclear and missile related technology to \nPakistan, thereby further escalating the arms race and underlying \nconflict.\n  In May 1998, India and Pakistan tested a total of eleven nuclear \ndevices. This ushered Pakistan into--and reestablished India as part \nof--the world's most exclusive club of nuclear weapon states. Although \nIndia's nuclear program was created from mostly indigenous sources, \nPakistan's nuclear program was purchased from the People's Republic of \nChina. A recently declassified Central Intelligence Agency report \nstates that during the early 1980's, China provided Pakistan blueprints \nof a full Chinese nuclear design that was tested in 1966. It appears it \ntook Pakistan almost 20 years to test a weapon because they had \ndifficulty translating the blueprints from Chinese.\n  Since the 1980's, China has consistently provided Pakistan additional \nnuclear components and missiles. China has operated the Pakistani \nCowhide Uranium-enrichment plant (needed for nuclear weapons \nproduction), provided designs for additional bombs and reactors, sold \nweapons grade uranium, sold 5,000 ring magnets for a nonsafeguarded \nnuclear enrichment program, and continues to provide assistance to \nnuclear facilities that are not safeguarded by the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, IAEA. The IAEA ensures that nuclear facilities are not \nproducing nuclear weapons grade material.\n  China has also provided Pakistan with complete nuclear-capable \nmissile and missile components. The most widely reported missile \ntransfers are the M-11 missile, also called the CSS-7 or Ababeel. This \nnuclear capable missile, designed and produced in China, has a 300-\nkilometer range--placing many highly populated Indian cities at risk. \nAlthough it is unclear how many M-11s Pakistan currently possesses, it \nappears that China has been providing these missiles for almost a \ndecade.\n\n  Pakistan's nuclear-capable Medium Range Ballistic Missiles, (MRBM), \nnamed Ghauri and Shaheen, were developed as a result of extensive \nChinese technology and assistance. The Ghauri has a quoted range of \n1500 km, but during the actual flight test, the Ghauri flew only 600 \nkm. Even at this shorted range, some of India's largest cities, \nincluding New Delhi and Bombay, would be at risk. The Shaheen, although \nnot flight tested, is reported to have a range of 700 km, making its \nstrike distance comparable to the Ghauri.\n  What is especially disturbing is that this is just the beginning of \nthe Chinese proliferation record regarding Pakistan. These transfers \nhave allowed Pakistan to amass an incredibly capable and frightening \nnuclear and missile force. These transfers are in direct violation of \ninternational and domestic law. It is apparent that China and Chinese \nbusinesses have violated the Missile Technology Control Regime, the \nArms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act, the Non-\nProliferation Treaty, the Export-Import Bank Act, and the Nuclear \nProliferation Prevention Act.\n  With all these violations of international and domestic law, one must \nask the question, ``What has the Clinton Administration done to stem \nthe flow of nuclear and missile technology?'' The answer is sadly, \n``very little.'' The Clinton Administration imposed only mild sanctions \non China for providing the M-11 technology. However, these sanctions \nwere quickly lifted when China ``agreed'' not to continue providing \nmissile technology to Pakistan. Despite this ``agreement,'' China has \nnot stopped the provision of missile and nuclear technology.\n  I am troubled that the President seems to have accepted Chinese \npromises and reassurances without thoroughly examining the facts. For \nexample, a July 1997, CIA report concluded that ``China was the single \nmost important supplier of equipment and technology for weapons of mass \ndestruction'' worldwide, and that China continues to be Pakistan's \n``primary source of nuclear-related equipment and technology. . .'' The \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai, responded \ncharacteristically to these charges by stating that ``China's position \non nuclear proliferation is very\n\n[[Page S8458]]\n\nclear . . . It does not advocate, encourage, or engage in nuclear \nproliferation, nor does it assist other countries in developing nuclear \nweapons. It always undertakes its international legal obligations of \npreventing nuclear proliferation . . . China has always been cautious \nand responsible in handling its nuclear exports and exports of \nmaterials and facilities that might lead to nuclear proliferation.'' \nThe Clinton Administration was apparently reading from the Chinese \nscript when Peter Tarnoff, Under Secretary of State, said during a \nCongressional hearing that, `` . . . we (the United States) have \nabsolutely binding assurances from the Chinese, which we consider a \ncommitment on their part not to export ring magnets or any other \ntechnologies to unsafeguarded facilities . . . The negotiating record \nis made up primarily of conversations, which were detailed and \nrecorded, between US and Chinese officials.'' With the overwhelming \nevidence, it is mystifying that the Chinese spokesman could make such \nstatements with a straight face, and it is extremely disappointing that \nthe Administration apparently took China at its word.\n  More than one and half billion people live in South Asia. I believe \nthat Pakistan would not be in the position to start a nuclear war \nwithout Chinese assistance. Although we cannot reverse proliferation in \nPakistan, we can, and should, take a stand to stop further transfers to \nPakistan and other countries through passage of the China Non-\nProliferation Act. Without taking a stand here, what will stop China \nfrom providing nuclear and missile technology to Palestine, or Sudan, \nor the renowned terrorist Osama Bin Ladan? The United States must take \nthe lead, as the world's only Superpower, and stand against nuclear \nproliferation, which damages the security of the entire nation.\n  Not only has China provided nuclear and missile technology to the \ndangerous and unstable region of South Asia, China has provided \nsensitive technology to Iran. Iran has been identified by U.S. \ngovernment agencies, organizations, and entities, along with \nindependent national security experts, as one of the major threats to \nUS security. Iran's threat stems from several significant factors \nincluding its large population and armed forces; its geo-strategic and \npolitical location in the Middle East--along the straits of Hormuz and \nthe Caspian Sea; an Islamic fundamentalist government; a drive to \nobtain weapons of mass destruction along with their associated delivery \nvehicles; stated opposition to the United States and United States' \nnational interests; opposition to the Israeli-Palestinian Peace \nProcess; the de-stabilization of Lebanon--Israel's northern neighbor; \nand the use and sponsorship of terrorism in its own country and around \nthe world. Due to these facts, the idea of providing nuclear, \nbiological, chemical, and missile technology to Iran seems \nunbelievable, but it is a sad reality.\n\n  According to a 1999 CIA report, ``Iran remains one of the most active \ncountries seeking to acquire Weapons of Mass Destruction, WMD, and \nAdvanced Conventional Weapons, ACW, technology from abroad. In doing \nso, Tehran is attempting to develop an indigenous capability to produce \nvarious types of weapons--nuclear, chemical, and biological--and their \ndelivery systems.'' Iran is obtaining much of this technology from \nChina and Russia.\n  The CIA report continues, ``for the second half of 1999, entities in \nRussia, North Korea, and China continued to supply the largest amount \nof ballistic missile-related goods, technology, and expertise to Iran. \nTehran is using this assistance to support current production programs \nand to achieve its goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production \nof ballistic missiles. Iran already is producing Scud short-range \nballistic missiles, SRBMs, and has built and publicly displayed \nprototypes for the Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile, MRBM, which \nhad its initial flight test in July 1998. In addition, Iran's Defense \nMinister last year publicly acknowledged the development of the Shahab-\n4, originally calling it a more capable ballistic missile than the \nShahab-3, but later categorizing it as solely a space launch vehicle \nwith no military applications. Iran's Defense Minister also has \npublicly mentioned plans for a ``Shahab 5.'' Such statements, made \nagainst the backdrop of sustained cooperation with Russian, North \nKorean, and Chinese entities, strongly suggest that Tehran intends to \ndevelop a longer-range ballistic missile capability in the near \nfuture.'' These longer ranged missiles would be capable of striking \ntargets in Europe and perhaps in the United States.\n  China is ``a key supplier'' of nuclear technology to Iran, with over \n$60 million annually in sales and at least fourteen Chinese nuclear \nexperts working at Iranian nuclear facilities. In 1991, China supplied \nIran with a research reactor capable of producing plutonium and a \ncalutron, a technology that can be used to enrich uranium to weapons-\ngrade. (Calutrons enriched the uranium in the ``Little Boy'' bomb that \ndestroyed Hiroshima, and were at the center of Saddam Hussein's effort \nto develop an Iraqi nuclear bomb.) In 1994, China supplied a complete \nnuclear fusion research reactor facility to Iran, and provided \ntechnical assistance in making it operational. China also continues to \nwork with two Iranian nuclear projects, a so-called ``research \nreactor'' and a zirconium production facility. It is well documented \nthat China has provided Iran ``considerable'' chemical and biological \nweapon-related production equipment and technology. China has also \nprovided sensitive ballistic missile technology for Iran's growing \nmissile capability. Among other transfers, in 1994, China provided \nhundreds of missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools. \nThis is just the beginning of Chinese proliferation to Iran.\n  The sad fact is that Iran would not have these capabilities without \nChinese assistance and American inaction. Although these transfers \nviolate almost every non-proliferation law on the books, the Clinton \nAdministration has only taken small and random acts against selected \nChinese companies. These meaningless acts have done nothing to stem the \nproliferation, and without stronger laws, Chinese proliferation will \ncontinue.\n  It is time for the United States to respond with authority to the \ncontinued threat of weapons proliferation. Although we need a President \nwho is willing to lead, we also need more effective laws mandating the \nPresident to impose sanctions on foreign companies when they engage in \nproliferation, and authorizing him to take actions against nations \nviolating international law. This is what the China Non-Proliferation \nAct will do, and I support passage of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nSenators be permitted to speak for up to the designated times in the \nfollowing order: Senator Kyl, 5 minutes; Senator Biden, 10 minutes; \nSenator Torricelli, 10 minutes; Senator Hutchison, 10 minutes; Senator \nGramm, 10 minutes; Senator Thompson, 10 minutes; Senator Roth, 5 \nminutes. I further ask consent that the vote occur no later than 1:45 \np.m. this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from \nCalifornia. To return the debate to the Thompson amendment, the \nquestion before us immediately is not whether PNTR should be granted \nbut whether the Thompson amendment dealing with national security \nissues should be supported. PNTR is going to pass this body early next \nweek. The question is whether at about 1:45 p.m. or so this body will \ntable the Thompson amendment.\n  The Thompson amendment would set up a regime that would help stop the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction by China. In the past, \neach year we have been able to review the Chinese trade, national \nsecurity, and even human rights issues, and because we had an annual \nreview, we were able to deal with those issues in this body, as well as \nfrom a diplomatic point of view the administration's dealings with \nChina.\n  PNTR will remove that annual review, the requirement that we \naffirmatively act each year. It will allow China then to join the WTO, \nand that is fine as a matter of trade. But we have to have some \nparallel way of ensuring\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nfrom a national security standpoint that China stops the proliferation \nof weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Thompson amendment sets up a process whereby the Chinese actions \nare reviewed and the President can impose sanctions, if it is \nappropriate, but if he does not impose sanctions in those \ncircumstances--he does have a waiver authority--he is required to \nreport to Congress why not. There is nothing unreasonable about this \nparticular proposition.\n  Yesterday I talked at length about the reasons for it. I will mention \ntwo: The proliferation of M-11 missiles by China to Pakistan, for \nexample, which has not resulted in appropriate sanctions by the United \nStates and, more recently, the transfer of sea-based cruise missiles to \nIran.\n  We remember what happened to the Stark, the U.S. destroyer in the \nPersian Gulf, when several Americans lost their lives as a result of a \nsea-based cruise missile. The question here is particularly interesting \nbecause the Senate voted 96-0 that the Chinese actions in supplying \nthese cruise missiles to Iran was a violation of the Gore-McCain Iran-\nIraq Nonproliferation Act. In other words, China is not supposed to \nsend this kind of weapon to countries such as Iran. The Senate has been \non record unanimously that it was a violation of the act. The \nadministration has done nothing to impose sanctions or otherwise act to \nstop China from that kind of proliferation. That is why the Thompson \namendment is necessary.\n  Trade, in other words, cannot be the only thing that defines the \nrelationship between the United States and China. The Senate has to \nbalance other things than trade, including our national security \nobligations.\n  It has been said that we cannot support the Thompson amendment, not \nbecause it is not a good idea but because if there is any change to \nthis bill in the Senate, if it goes back to the House of \nRepresentatives, they will not pass it. One of two things is true: \nEither there is support for PNTR and the House of Representatives will \nquickly act on the Thompson amendment, and, in fact, if the two are \njoined and sent to the House, as I was advised yesterday, support would \nfall off in the House to the point where there are 40 people over there \nwho no longer support PNTR and would not vote for the bill.\n  Obviously, it would be an anti-democratic action for us to proceed \nwith something that no longer enjoys a majority support in the House of \nRepresentatives. I cannot believe that many people would switch their \nvote on PNTR. They still, of course, can vote against the Thompson \namendment if we send it over to them.\n  The fact is, we have 5 weeks to go. The House of Representatives has \nplenty of time to deal with this issue. They are committed to PNTR, as \nI know the leadership of the Senate is. I cannot believe amending the \nbill with the Thompson amendment would destroy PNTR. Remember, too, \nthat it is the opponents of the Thompson amendment who forced Senator \nThompson into using this vehicle of amending PNTR as the only way to \nachieve his goal of establishing a nonproliferation regime with respect \nto China. He offered to do it in freestanding legislation. He was \nrebuffed. He offered to do it after the debate. He was rebuffed. In \neffect, they knew they had the best chance of defeating him if they \ncould force him to offer an amendment to PNTR because then they could \nargue they were all for it in substance, but they did not dare let it \npass as a procedural matter because the House then would have to deal \nagain with PNTR.\n  I think this is the most cynical of strategies. I wish the issue had \nnot come up in this way. I urge my colleagues at the appropriate time, \nin about 45 minutes, not to table the Thompson amendment. Give Senator \nThompson an up-or-down vote on his amendment. It is the fair thing to \ndo. It is the right thing to do and, from the standpoint of the \nresponsibilities of all of us in this Chamber as Senators who have \nresponsibility both for trade and for national security, the Thompson \namendment is the right thing to support.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Under the previous order, Senator Biden was to be \nrecognized at this point. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nproceed under his time and that, in turn, he proceed following the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I think it is important to remind the \nSenate of the issue before the body. It has been argued that China \nshould be allowed into the World Trade Organization. That is not a \nquestion of this amendment. China is coming into the World Trade \nOrganization under PNTR.\n  It has been argued that there should not be an interference in trade \nbetween China and the United States; it was argued strenuously by my \nfriend and colleague from California. That is not before the Senate \nunder this amendment.\n  It has been argued that the internal politics of China should not \ninterfere with trade. That is not before the Senate. The Senate has \ndefeated the measures on internal matters in China. It is going to \nsupport WTO and the PNTR. The issue before the Senate is narrowly \ndefined.\n  Under Thompson-Torricelli, there is a single issue before this body: \nWhether repeated acts of violations of nonproliferation agreements by \nChinese companies will give the President the authority, which he will \nhave the right to waive, to interfere with Chinese access to American \ncapital markets. That is the only issue before the Senate.\n  I recognize that we come to this institution with a variety of local \ninterests. Some of us represent agriculture and some industry; some \nlabor and some business; some in the West, some in the North; some in \nthe South; some in the East; some rural; some suburban. We have one \nunifying common interest--the national security of the United States. \nWherever we are from, whatever our priorities, whatever our philosophy, \nthat single guiding responsibility unites us all.\n  I recognize there are economic interests in the country that are on \ndifferent sides of the issue of PNTR. But on this single issue, the \nproliferation of dangerous weapons of mass destruction that are a \nthreat to the life and the security of the United States of America, we \ncan find common ground.\n  Indeed, as enthusiastic as any individual farmer in America may be to \nget access to Chinese markets, notwithstanding the fact that this \namendment does not deal with agricultural exports, I would challenge \nany Member of this Senate to find an individual American farmer who, \neven if this amendment did threaten agricultural exports, would trade a \nsingle sale for the United States not being resolved in denying Chinese \ncompanies the ability to export missile or nuclear or biological \ntechnology that threatens the American people.\n  Find me a single high-tech executive, given the choice between an \nindividual contract and the ability to restrict a single Chinese \ncompany from selling technology that threatens the United States of \nAmerica, find me one who would not take a stand for this amendment.\n  Individual interests, I understand them.\n  My friend and coauthor of this amendment, Senator Thompson, stood on \nthe floor reciting comments by the president of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, who threatened retribution against Senators who support \nThompson-Torricelli and cited the ``politics of nuclear \nproliferation.''\n\n  What have we come to as an institution? The ``politics of nuclear \nproliferation''? I thought the issue of nonproliferation knew no \npolitics, was supported by Democrats, Republicans, liberals and \nconservatives. We can all differ on some of the strategies of defending \nthe United States. We may differ on the question of a missile shield \ndefense. We may differ on how we allocate our national defense \nresources. But I thought the question of proliferation was the one \nuniting aspect of our foreign policy that knew no bounds--we are all \nunited in the question that there are some governments that are so \nirresponsible, some nations that live so far out of the norms of \naccepted behavior, that they must be denied these weapons.\n  The evidence is unmistakable that the People's Republic of China, \ndespite\n\n[[Page S8460]]\n\n20 years of commitments to accede to this policy of denying these rogue \nnations these technologies, continues to export this dangerous \ntechnology. The evidence is overwhelming.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence reported to this Congress, last \nmonth, that China has increased its missile-related assistance to \nPakistan, continues to provide assistance to Iran, North Korea, Libya; \nthat China has proliferated to Pakistan.\n  This Senate has debated what to spend and how to spend to defend \nourselves against the possibility, by 2005, of nuclear-tipped missiles \nfrom North Korea. We have all lived in anguish with the destruction of \nAmerican citizens by the terrorism in Libya and Iran.\n  Now before this Senate is the most modest of amendments--not an \ninterference with trade; not a restriction on exports, though indeed \nthat may be justifiable; not a sanction against the violations of \nworkers' rights or human rights, though that may be arguable. We have \nnot dared, in the most modest of positions, to ask, to request, to \nsuggest any of those things. Just this: That the authority exists to \ndeny companies in the People's Republic of China that consistently, \nregularly are found, by overwhelming evidence, to be proliferating \ndangerous technologies that threaten the United States of America, \naccess to our capital markets. But, indeed, that would be too ambitious \nto ask, so we have given the President waiver authority to cancel that \nrestriction and simply tell the Congress why he did so.\n  Is there a man or woman in the Senate who thinks this request is so \nambitious, would so threaten the economic life of the United States, \nthat we cannot ask this? I challenge my colleagues in the Senate, if \nyou will not accept the evidence from the Director of Central \nIntelligence on this proliferation, if you will not cede the warning, \naccept the overwhelming evidence of this proliferation and the threat \nit constitutes to the United States of America, then have the \nintellectual honesty and courage to rise on the floor of this Senate to \nsay the Central Intelligence Agency no longer provide this evidence. \nBecause if you will not read it, you will not accept it, and you will \nnot act upon a request that is this modest in scope, then have the \nintellectual honesty not to even receive it.\n  I say to my colleagues, it has been stated on this floor that the \nhistory of economic sanctions has been uniformly disappointing; that \nthere is no evidence that they succeed. In the long history of economic \nsanctions, this would be the most modest. We interfere with no trade, \nrestrict no product, restrict no market, only the raising of capital, \nand only then if the President does not exercise a waiver.\n  But even if this were a more ambitious amendment, do my colleagues in \nthe Senate really want the record to reflect that we do not believe \neconomic sanctions are ever justifiable or ever successful, \nparticularly members of my party?\n  The birth of economic sanctions was from Woodrow Wilson, former \nGovernor of my State, who believed they were the civilized alternative \nto avoiding armed conflict and war. They are not a perfect weapon, but \nthey have avoided conflict.\n  Who here would rise and say that unilateral sanctions by European \nstates against South Africa and apartheid was wrong, or against \nRhodesia or against the Soviets after invading Czechoslovakia? Who here \nwould argue that they were wrong against Cambodia after the death \ncamps? Who would argue they were wrong against fascist Italy, against \nAbyssinia and Ethiopia? Who here would argue that Roosevelt was wrong \nin using them against the Nazis or the Japanese invasion of Manchuria \nor Wilson himself against unrestricted submarine warfare in the North \nAtlantic? For the entire 20th century, these sanctions have been used--\nnot a perfect tool, not always successful, but always an alternative to \nconflict and in defense of the national security.\n  That issue is before the Senate again. Because while these may not be \nsanctions, because it may appear the Senate, given the economic \nopportunity, would not accept them, Senator Thompson and I have offered \nsomething far less ambitious, a simple standby authority. But it is an \nalternative.\n  What will we say to the American people if one day we discover that \nmissile or nuclear or biological weapons are in the hands of our most \nfeared enemies threatening the lives of the American people? Someone on \nthis floor would be right to rise and quote the old Bolshevik maxim: \nThey will sell us the rope with which we will hang them.\n  No one on this floor wants to provide that explanation. I urge \nsupport for the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. It is right. It is \nmodest. I believe the Senate would be proud to take this stand.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous order, the Senator has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment by the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Although well-intentioned, the Thompson amendment--the so-called \n``China Nonproliferation Act''--is a deeply flawed approach to \naddressing the proliferation problem.\n  At the outset, let me stipulate to a couple of points about which the \nSenator is correct.\n  First, I fully agree with the Senator that the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction poses a serious threat to our national \nsecurity. I commend him for his concern, which I know is sincere.\n  Second, I agree with the Senator's assertion that the People's \nRepublic of China has a poor proliferation track record. China's \nexports of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them \nhave made the world a more dangerous place.\n  Unfortunately, our concerns are not all historical. You won't find \nmuch argument in this body if the Administration decided today to \nimpose sanctions on China--using existing law--for its continuing \nexport of ballistic missile technology to Pakistan.\n  The debate isn't about whether China has a clean record in the area \nof nonproliferation. It does not. Period. No, this debate is about how \nwe get the Chinese and other proliferators to clean up their act. So I \nask my colleagues to keep their eyes on the ball.\n  The question each of us should ask as we evaluate the Thompson \namendment is this: At the end of the day, is the Thompson amendment \nlikely to improve U.S. security by reducing the spread of weapons of \nmass destruction and the means to deliver them?\n  I believe the answer is no. The legislation offered by Senator \nThompson is deeply flawed. Since its introduction, the Thompson \namendment has been revised at least three or four times. I give the \nSenator credit for trying to fix the bill's many flaws. Unfortunately, \nwith each version, this bill has not substantially improved.\n  In its earliest iteration, at least we knew what this bill was all \nabout. It was all about undercutting the very normal trade relations \nthat we are about to vote to make permanent with China and instead \ntreating China like a virtual enemy.\n  The likely effect of the original version of the ``China \nNonproliferation Act'' was to gut normal trade relations with China, \nshut down trade in dual-use items, deny China access to our capital \nmarkets, end educational and scientific exchanges, and suspend the \nbilateral dialog on a range of important issues, including counter-\nnarcotics and counter-terrorism.\n  It was clear-cut. It was unambiguous. And it was unambiguously \ncontrary to the national interest.\n  The current version of the amendment does not have that coherence. \nRather, it is a legislative stew containing an assortment of \ningredients, not all of which go together. It has several major flaws.\n  The first major flaw is that although the sponsors have advertised \nthe amendment as targeting certain rogue states, in fact it also \ntargets American firms and firms located in several western nations.\n  On its face, the amendment purports to target only those countries \nhighlighted by the Director of Central Intelligence in a seminannual \nreport as ``key suppliers'' of weapons of mass destruction and missile \ntechnologies. Those countries, under the most current version of this \nreport, released\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\nearlier this summer, are China, Russia, and North Korea.\n  But closer examination of the amendment reveals that it would likely \nexpose some of our closest allies--and even U.S. firms--to scrutiny \nunder this bill.\n  Let me explain. This is a bit complicated, so I hope colleagues will \nbear with me.\n  Under the amendment, the President must submit a report to Congress \nannually--``identifying every person of a covered country for whom \nthere is credible information indicating that such person'' has \ntransferred dangerous technology to other foreign entities or has \ndiverted U.S. technology in such a way so as to contribute to \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction.\n  A ``covered country'' is a term that is defined in the bill: it is \nany country identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as a \n``source or supply'' of dual-use or other technology in the most \ncurrent report required under Section 721 of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997. A country is also a ``covered \ncountry'' if it was so identified in this report at any time within the \nprevious five years.\n  Guess what? In 1997, this report by the Director of Central \nIntelligence specifically named the United States, as well as several \nWestern European nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Germany \nand Italy, as ``favorite targets of acquisition for foreign weapons of \nmass destruction programs, especially for dual-use goods not controlled \nby [certain] multilateral export control regimes.'' That makes those \nnations a ``source or supply'' of dual-use or other technology under \nthe terms of the Thompson amendment.\n  So what does this mean?\n  It means the President will have to report to Congress on any \n``credible information'' that the Executive Branch has on either (1) \nUnited States firms, or (2) European firms regarding transfers of \ndangerous technology. Sanctions are unlikely to result against U.S. or \nEuropean firms, for two reasons.\n  First, after this report is provided to Congress, the President must \nthen formally determine that the firm has actually engaged in the \nproliferation activity--not merely that there is credible information \nthat it has.\n  Second, even if the President makes such a determination, the \namendment exempts from the sanctions any nation that is part of a \nmultilateral control regime on proliferation--as the United States and \nthe major Western powers are.\n  But for the firms named in this original report, the damage will have \nbeen done.\n  First, the companies will surely be subject to negative publicity \nbased on the very low ``credible information'' standard--and suffer \nfinancial and other damage that may flow from such publicity. Second, \nSection 8 of the amendment requires the firm, if its stock is listed on \nU.S. capital markets, to make this information--that is, the \ninformation that they have been cited in the presidential report--\navailable in reports and disclosure statements required under the \nSecurities Exchange Act.\n  In short, the bill places a ``scarlet letter'' on the reputation of \nfirms--based on information that may later prove to be unfounded.\n  This is a pretty breathtaking provision--which requires the President \nto shoot first, and ask questions later.\n  The second major flaw of the bill is that the amendment is its \nrigidity. It imposes a one-size-fits-all straitjacket on the \nPresident--forcing him to impose numerous sanctions against an \noffending company, no matter the gravity of the violation, and it \nrequires him to impose the same set of sanctions in every instance.\n  Under the amendment, if the President determines that a person or \nfirm has engaged in prohibited proliferation activity, then the \nPresident must apply five different penalties on such firms--including \na ban on military and dual-use exports from the United States to such \nfirms, and a ban on the provision of any U.S. assistance, including any \nloans, credits, or guarantees to such firms.\n  This would include Export-Import Bank financing and assistance from \nthe Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\n  The President has no flexibility to tailor the penalty to fit the \ncrime. He must impose all five punitive measures against the offending \nperson for at least one year--even if the behavior is corrected \nimmediately. He cannot dangle carrots encouraging the firm or nation to \nclean up its act.\n  The only flexibility he would have is to invoke a national security \nwaiver. And I doubt such a high waiver will be justifiable in each and \nevery case.\n  I believe it is extremely unwise to tie the President's hands in this \nmanner.\n  We are not clairvoyant, and we should give the President flexibility \nto calibrate his response--and the power to cope with changing \ncircumstances which we cannot foresee.\n  It is also unwise to impose the same set of penalties on different \ncases. Should we treat the transfer of an item on Category Two of the \nMissile Technology Control Regime the less serious of the two \ncategories in that regime--such as telemetry software--the same as a \ntransfer of a complete missile system? Current missile sanctions law \npermit this sort of differentiation. The Thompson amendment does not.\n  On Monday the Senator from Tennessee implied that the sanctions under \nthis provision are somehow discretionary--that the President has the \nflexibility on whether or not to impose sanctions under Section 4 of \nthe amendment. This is simply not true.\n  Under Section 4 of the amendment, ``if the President determines that \na person identified in a report submitted pursuant to section 3 has \nengaged in an activity described under section (3)(a)(1), the President \nshall apply to such person'' the sanctions for not less than one year.\n  In other words, if the President finds that a person engages in a \nproliferation activity, he must apply the sanctions. He has no \ndiscretion--if he sees that the requisite facts exist, he must impose \nsanctions.\n  Don't take my word for it.\n  A few years ago, the Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of \nJustice interpreted similar language in another non-proliferation law--\nthe Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act \nof 1991. It concluded that the President ``has a duty to make \ndeterminations, not merely the discretion to do so.'' And once he makes \nthose determinations, then the sanctions under the law are triggered.\n  So, too in the Thompson amendment. If the President determines that \nthe proliferation action has occurred, then the sanctions must be \nimposed.\n  To be sure, the bill allows the President to waive the sanctions. But \nthe act of making the initial determination is not waivable.\n  The third major flaw is that the bill will undermine the credibility \nof existing sanctions laws because it has an extremely low burden of \nproof and does not differentiate serious violations from trivial ones.\n  Let me explain first how sanctions are triggered in the bill.\n  Two kinds of behavior are sanctionable: the first is any transfer of \ntechnology of any origin by a person of a covered country--and \nremember, ``covered country'' includes the United States and several \nEuropean allies--which contributes to the ``design, development, \nproduction, or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons \nor ballistic or cruise missiles'' by a foreign person.\n  The second action that is sanctionable is any contribution to a \nweapons of mass destruction program made by the diversion of U.S.-\norigin technology to an unauthorized end-user. Such diversions are \nsanctionable even if they occur within China or Russia.\n  The bill penalizes either of these actions--technology transfers or \ndiversion--regardless of whether they are either ``knowing'' or \n``material.''\n  Nearly all of our current proliferation sanctions laws contain these \n``knowing'' and ``material'' requirement--they do not attempt to punish \ntransfers that are unintentional or are relatively inconsequential.\n  For example, Section 73 of the Arms Export Control Act--the existing \nmissile sanctions law--requires sanctions whenever a foreign person \n``knowingly'' transfers equipment or technology controlled by the \nMissile Technology Control Regime, MTCR.\n  Items controlled by the MTCR meet the test of ``materiality'' because \nthey\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\ninvolve either complete missile systems or significant components of \nsuch systems.\n  The Thompson bill, however, punishes all transfers--regardless of \nwhether the firm intentionally engaged in the prohibited conduct or \nwhether the transfer made any difference to the program of the \nrecipient nation.\n  The only standard is whether is it ``contributes'' to the ``design, \ndevelopment, production, or acquisition'' of weapons of mass \ndestruction programs. This, potentially, has a very broad sweep.\n  Does a vehicle supplied by Russia, the United States or a western \ncountry and used by the People's Liberation Army to transport goods \nfrom one weapons plant to another ``contribute'' to ``production'' of \nChinese missiles?\n  Does cement for a Chinese cruise missile plant ``contribute'' to the \n``production'' of such missiles? Does advice from an efficiency expert \n``contribute'' to ``production''?\n  Surely they do ``contribute'' in some way to the production occurring \nat the facility.\n  Under the Thompson amendment, all ``contributions''--even these \nrelatively inconsequential examples I just cited--would appear to be \ntreated equally.\n  If we are going to impose sanctions, we should have a rule of \nreason--and punish transfers that matter. Do we really want to trigger \nthe vast machinery of sanctions over transfers that are not of serious \nconcern?\n  Additionally, do we want to trigger a vast array of sanctions if the \ncompany did not act intentionally?\n  The fourth major flaw of the amendment is that it could undermine our \nproliferation policy by singling out China, Russia, and North Korea.\n  A law that singles out the worst proliferators might, at first blush, \nmake sense. But it sends an odd message to the world that we care only \nabout proliferation from those countries. Why shouldn't we care just as \nmuch about proliferation by Libyan or Syrian firms as by Chinese firms?\n  To be effective, U.S. sanctions law should be defensible to the \nworld. We can logically explain that proliferation to Iran or Iraq \ndeserves special attention--because of the rogue behavior of those \ncountries. But what is the logic for treating proliferation from China, \nRussia, and North Korea more seriously than proliferation from other \ncountries?\n  Moreover, country-specific legislation is unnecessary.\n  If China, Russia, and North Korea are the worst actors in this area, \nthen any law that applies generally will fall on them \ndisproportionately.\n  In fact, current proliferation sanctions laws have been used against \nthese three countries more than most others.\n  The fifth major flaw of the amendment is that it will impose an \nincredibly burdensome reporting requirement on the intelligence \ncommunity and the Executive Branch officials responsible for enforcing \nnon-proliferation policy.\n  The amendment requires that all ``credible information'' about \nproliferation activity, no matter whether it is proven or not, no \nmatter whether the activity is significant or not, be included as part \nof a new magnum opus. This low ``credible information\" standard is \nderived from the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. Under this \nstandard, one piece of information from a source deemed to be credible \nmust be reported--even if that evidence later proves to be false.\n  Congress has yet to receive the first report required under that Act. \nBut we do have some information about the burden it is imposing.\n  To date, the Intelligence Community has found 8,000 pages of \ninformation that is ``credible'' just on chemical and biological \nweapons and missile proliferation alone.\n  Many thousands of staff hours will be required to assemble and \nanalyze the information for this report. Does it really make sense to \nhave our government's non-proliferation specialists devoting so much \ntime to assembling yet another report--rather than combating the \nproliferation danger?\n  Congress hardly suffers from a lack of information about \nproliferation. We already require a range of reports on the subject. \nFor example:\n  Congress receives an annual report on proliferation of missiles and \nessential components of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons--\nrequired since 1991;\n  Congress receives an annual report on the threat posed to the United \nStates by weapons of mass destruction, ballistic and cruise missiles--\nrequired since 1997;\n  Congress receives an annual report on the efforts of foreign \ncountries to obtain chemical and biological weapons and efforts of \nforeign persons or governments to assist such programs --required since \n1991;\n  Congress receives an annual report on the transfer of chemical agents \nand the trade precursor chemicals relevant to chemical weapons--\nrequired since 1997 under the Senate resolution consenting to the \nChemical Weapons Convention;\n  Congress receives an annual report on compliance with international \narms control agreements, which includes a detailed assessment of \nadherence of other nations to obligations undertaken in \nnonproliferation agreements or commitments--required since the mid-\n1980s.\n  In addition, Members of Congress have full access to a range of \nregular intelligence reports on the subject of proliferation.\n  In sum, we do not need another report that will divert officials in \nthe Executive Branch from the daily business of trying to actually stop \nproliferation.\n  Mr. President, I understand the motivation at work here. \nProliferation by Russia or China makes me angry too! I would have \nthought that the limitations of this kind of sledgehammer approach that \nI have just described would have been made evident by now.\n  So I remind my colleagues: Keep your eye on the ball! This \nlegislation is not likely to be effective in reducing proliferation by \nirresponsible actors.\n  Let me make one final point.\n  One underlying assumption of the Thompson bill seems to be that there \nare few non-proliferation statutes on the books. Any such assumption \nwould be false--over the last decade Congress has enacted numerous \nproliferation laws. Let me highlight a few:\n  The Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination \nof 1991 contains numerous provisions restricting technology to, or \nimposing sanctions on, to countries or persons proliferating chemical \nor biological weapons technology;\n  The Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994 bars U.S. Government \nprocurement in the case of foreign persons who materially contribute to \nthe efforts of individuals or non-nuclear weapons states to acquire \nnuclear material or nuclear explosive devices, and requires sanctions \non financial institutions that finance the acquisition of nuclear \nmaterial or nuclear explosive devices.\n  The Foreign Assistance Act bars U.S. foreign assistance to nations \nthat engage in certain proliferation activities;\n  The Arms Export Control Act provides for sanctions against nations \nthat transfer unsafeguarded nuclear materials or against non-nuclear \nstates which use nuclear devices, including the Glenn Amendment \nsanctions which were imposed on India and Pakistan in 1998.\n\n  The Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 requires sanctions \nagainst persons or countries who knowingly and materially contribute to \nthe efforts by Iran or Iraq to acquire chemical, biological, or nuclear \nweapons or to acquire destabilizing numbers and types of advanced \nconventional weapons.\n  The Export-Import Bank Act bars financing for U.S. exports to any \ncountry or person which assists a non-nuclear weapons state to acquire \na nuclear device or unsafeguarded special nuclear material.\n  Finally, a Presidential Executive Order (#12938) requires the \nSecretary of State to impose certain sanctions against foreign persons \nwho materially contribute or attempt to contribute to the efforts of \nany foreign country to obtain weapons of mass destruction or a missile \ncapable of delivering such weapons.\n  In short, it is a delusion to think we have a shortage of laws.\n  What the senator is complaining about is a failure to use these laws \nto punish the Chinese and other bad actors. This failure is hardly \nunique to this Administration.\n  During President Reagan's term, China provided nuclear know-how to \nPakistan and missiles to Saudi Arabia. The United States responded by \nselling\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\nadvanced conventional weaponry to the People's Liberation Army--\ntorpedoes for its navy, advanced avionics for its air force, and \ncounter-battery artillery radars for its army.\n  In President Bush's administration, China sold missile technology to \nPakistan. The United States responded by briefly imposing sanctions--\nand then subsequently liberalizing export controls on a wide range of \nhigh technology, including the launch of U.S.-made communication \nsatellites by China.\n  The Clinton Administration has twice sanctioned China for \nproliferation of missile and chemical technology, but has balked at \nimposing sanctions in response to China's most recent misdeeds.\n  The failure of Executive Branch to use sanctions authority occurs in \nboth Republican and Democratic administrations. It is often lamentable. \nBut the appropriate response is not enactment of a severely flawed \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me sum up.\n  I understand the Senator's concerns. I agree with him that Chinese \nproliferation is a serious problem. I disagree with his remedy.\n  I would be pleased to work with him next year in trying to move \nserious legislation to fill any gaps that may exist in our \nproliferation laws through the Committee on Foreign Relations--the \ncommittee of jurisdiction.\n  But I believe that it would be extremely unwise to pass this \nlegislation, as well-intentioned as it is--because I believe it has so \nmany flaws that it is beyond fixing at this late date. This \nlegislation, as currently written, would not succeed, and could \nseriously harm our non-proliferation efforts.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the Thompson amendment.\n  To reiterate, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from \nTennessee have made some good arguments but on the wrong bill. If you \nlisten to the debate of the proponents, you would assume there is no \nsanction legislation that exists now relative to China. The irony is \nthat there is significant sanction legislation on the books now.\n  This quarrel is about two things. Half the people who are for this \namendment are against trade with China. The other half of them--I don't \nmean literally half--are made up of a mix of people, people who are \nagainst the bill, the permanent trade relations bill which my senior \ncolleague is managing, and some who are desperately concerned about the \nprospect of further proliferation by China.\n  The truth is, what the real fight should be about is why President \nBush, President Reagan, and President Clinton have not imposed the laws \nthat are on the books now. We don't need any new sanction laws. We \nparticularly don't need ones that are so desperately flawed as this \none, which lowers the threshold so low you can't be certain that, in \nfact, there is proliferation going on, raises so many questions that we \nwill spend our time litigating this among ourselves more than we will \nbe doing anything about the problem. And further, this is a \ncircumstance where I don't think there is anyone on the floor who would \nrise up and criticize this administration if they did what I have \npublicly and privately suggested to them: Impose sanctions now under \nexisting law.\n  I am sure none of my colleagues would do this but their staffs may. I \nrefer them to the last third of my statement where I laid out in detail \nhow many laws are on the books now which were enacted relative to \nproliferation: the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare \nElimination Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994, the \nForeign Assistance Act, the Arms Export Control Act, the Iran-Iraq Arms \nNonproliferation Act, the Export-Import Bank Act, which bars financing \nof U.S. exports, the Executive Order No. 12938, which requires the \nSecretary of State to impose certain sanctions, et cetera. All the laws \nare there now. They exist.\n  What this is really about is the unwillingness in the minds of our \ncolleagues, some of our colleagues, for this administration to once \nagain impose sanctions, or the last administration to impose sanctions.\n  We became fairly cynical around here because of what happened during \nthe terms of the last two Presidents. What was the response to \ndocumented proliferation by China, for example, during President \nReagan's term; when China provided nuclear know-how to Pakistan and \nmissiles to Saudi Arabia? The U.S. response, under President Reagan, \nwas to sell advanced conventional weaponry to the People's Liberation \nArmy, torpedoes for its navy, advanced avionics for its air force, and \ncounterbattery artillery radars for its army.\n  In the Bush administration, China sold missile technology to \nPakistan. The United States responded by briefly imposing sanctions and \nthen subsequently liberalizing export controls on a wide range of high-\ntechnology issues, including the launch of U.S.-made communications \nsatellites by China.\n  This isn't about whether or not nonproliferation laws exist. It is \nabout whether or not we have the will to impose upon the President the \nrequirement that he enforce the law now.\n  Why not pass a resolution here and now and say that the Senate goes \non record saying, Mr. President, you should impose sanctions on China \nnow? There is enough of a case to do it now. Why not do that, if you \nare really concerned about sanctions? This goes beyond that.\n  Everybody knows if this or any other amendment passes attached to \nthis bill, the larger issue of trade with China is dead, for this term \nanyway.\n  In the brief time I have remaining, let me jump to another point. My \nfriends talk about this in terms of--and I don't doubt their \nsincerity--their strategic concerns. They talk about the fact of what \nis going to happen if China sells technology again; what are we going \nto do? The implication being, had we acted on this amendment favorably \nand passed it, then China wouldn't sell any more weapons technology. \nThat is a bit of a tautology. They would sell it whether or not this \namendment is here. The question is what retribution we take and in what \nform we take it.\n\n  I ask the rhetorical question to my friends from Tennessee and New \nJersey, and others who support this amendment. Right now we are trying \nvery hard to deal with two things in North Korea: the existence of \nfissile material that is able to make nuclear bombs, and their ability \nto produce a third stage for their Taepo Dong missile that would allow \nthat missile to reach the United States, although it is problematic \nwhether they could put a nuclear weapon on it even if it had a third \nstage because of the throw-weight requirements.\n  So what have we been doing? Former Secretary of Defense Perry, and \nthe last administration as well, have been trying to get the Chinese to \nuse their influence on North Korea not to develop long-range missiles. \nAnd what has happened? It is kind of interesting that the first \namelioration, the first thawing of the ice came with the Agreed \nFramework during Perry's tenure. The Agreed Framework made sure that \nNorth Korea would not be able to acquire more fissile material for \nnuclear weapons. They stopped making fissile material. It is working. \nSurprise, surprise.\n  The second thing is, because of our intercession with China, at least \nin part, the Chinese had a little altar call, as we say in the southern \npart of my State, with the North Koreans. The North Korean leader, the \nguy we were told was holed up, who is manic depressive, a guy who was \nsupposedly schizophrenic, everything else you hear about him, went to \nBeijing. He came back. Guess what. He had a public meeting with South \nKorea. Guess what. He concluded that they would stop testing their \nmissile, the third stage of their missile. He further concluded that \nthere should be some rapprochement with the south.\n  And lo and behold, Kim Jong-il concluded that he, and the North \nKoreans, wants American troops in South Korea. Surprise, surprise. Why? \nThey don't want the vacuum filled by an Asian power if we leave. China \ndoesn't want North Korea to have a nuclear capacity. It is not in their \ninterest for that to occur.\n  Now, somebody tell me how we solve the problem of the proliferation \nof sophisticated nuclear weapons on the subcontinent of India, \nincluding Pakistan and India, as well as China, if we are not engaging \nChina. I don't get this. From a strategic standpoint, I don't get how \nthis is supposed to accomplish the strategic goal because my\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\nfriend from Tennessee and my friend from New Jersey parse out and make \na clear distinction between the strategic objective of their amendment \nand the economic objective. They say they have no economic objective. \nTherefore, they are for free trade.\n  They don't want to scuttle the trade agreement. They say their \ninterest is in the strategic problem of proliferation. I respectfully \nsuggest that amendment is not going to, in any way, change China's \nproliferation instincts. What is going to change China's proliferation \ninstincts will be a larger engagement with China on what is in our \nmutual interests--discussions about strategic doctrine, national \nmissile defense, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. That will effect relations \nwith China, potentially, in a positive way.\n  Passing this amendment, as my friend from New York said in another \nvenue when I was with him yesterday, will be the most serious foreign \npolicy mistake we will have made in decades. I share his view. I \nrealize it is well intended. My friend from Tennessee says no one has \nan answer as to how we are going to stop China. I don't have an answer, \nbut I have a forum in which you do that. It is not in the trade bill. \nIt is engaging them in their mutual interests and ours on the future of \nNorth Korea, and engaging them and making it clear to them that it is \nnot in their interest to see India become a nuclear state with multiple \nnuclear warheads and hundreds, if not thousands, of ICBMs. This isn't \nthe way to do it.\n  I thank my colleagues. I realize my time is up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this is a very important vote. It is a \nvery important issue. I have been a strong supporter of opening \nrelations with China, of opening trade with China, not because China \nhas been the kind of ally we would all hope it would be but because I \nhave believed that having open trade relations with them would improve \nthe relationship; that if we had some leverage in a trade relationship, \nwe would be able to ask them and have some leverage for them to have \nfair trade, to recognize intellectual property rights, and to become a \npart of the community of nations.\n  But it seems to me we are saying we want free and open trade and \nnothing else should matter; that if we have free and open trade, we \nshould not stand up for our national security interests. That is what I \nhave been hearing on the floor now for 2 days. If we are going to \nengage China on issues such as North Korea and weapons proliferation to \nIran and Iraq, as was proposed by the Senator from Delaware, how can we \nengage them if we say, by the vote today, it is not really a big issue \nto us, that weapons proliferation takes second place to trade?\n  For me, national security doesn't take second place to anything. I \nthink it should be the position of the Senate that we are responsible \nfor the national security of our country and that that is our most \nimportant responsibility. If we know China is sending its nuclear \nformulas to places such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq, and that that is \ngoing to put American citizens in direct harm's way and stop the \nbalance of power between North and South Korea and make it heavily \nfavoring North Korea, are we really going to stand by and say we will \ntry to engage them when we have not spoken to them in any way when we \nhad the chance to do it, as we do right now? I hope not.\n  It has been said that it will kill this bill if we add an amendment. \nI wasn't elected to the Senate to rubber stamp the House of \nRepresentatives. I wasn't elected by the people of Texas to rubber \nstamp the President. I was elected to the Senate to do what I think is \nright and to fulfill my responsibilities to the people I represent. \nNational security is my No. 1 responsibility. If it kills a bill \nbecause the Senate adds an amendment and allows us to talk to the \nPresident about it and talk to the House of Representatives, then I \nthink that is our role and our responsibility. I reject totally those \nwho would say don't vote for this amendment; it is a killer amendment; \nit will kill the bill.\n  It will not kill the bill. We have brains. We know we might have to \ncompromise in some way, but we want to be forceful that we are not \ngoing to allow China to spread nuclear weapons of mass destruction \naround the world, especially to rogue nations that would do our country \nwrong. We are not going to stand up and say today, I hope, that we are \nafraid to amend a bill because it might kill it. No, that is not why I \nwas elected to the Senate. I was elected to the Senate to do what I \nthink is right. I hope the Senate will speak very forcefully today that \nwe can work with the House and with the President and we will pass free \ntrade with China, with national security addressed. That is the issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for their people, as they were \nelected to do. Let's work this out and have a free and fair trade \nagreement that is good for both countries. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, Senator Gramm from \nTexas is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Thompson \namendment. I oppose it because it is a bad amendment. Its logic is \nflawed. It would hurt America more than it would punish China. Let me \ntry to explain why.\n  First of all, the Thompson amendment goes far beyond denying China \naccess to American dual-use technology that could have defense \napplications. The Thompson amendment would take American capital \nmarkets and inject politics into them by denying access, for the first \ntime, to a nation that is not engaged in a direct conflict with the \nUnited States of America, under our traditional definition of conflict.\n  Some people seem to have the idea that by adopting PNTR we will be \nhaving a marriage with China--that somehow, because we are endorsing \nnormal trade relations with China, we would in effect be endorsing \nChinese policies on how they treat their workers, how they protect \nreligious freedom, how they protect the environment, and how they \nconduct their foreign policy. We are not doing any of those things.\n\n  Every criticism of China that has been made is valid. Senator \nThompson talked earlier about not wanting to irritate the Chinese. I am \nperfectly willing to irritate the Chinese. But this legislation is \nabout establishing normal trade relations--the same relations we have \nwith virtually every country in the world except countries directly \ninvolved in terrorism--with China. We are not talking about a military \nalliance or a political marriage. We are talking only about normal \ntrade relations.\n  The Thompson amendment to the PNTR bill would impose political \ncontrols on the American capital market with regard to China. Federal \nReserve Chairman Greenspan says that the Thompson amendment's financial \nsanctions ``would undercut the viability of our own system and would \nharm us more than it would harm others.'' The Securities and Exchange \nCommission says the Thompson amendment is ``antithetical to the United \nStates approach to capital market access and free movement of \ncapital.'' The Securities Industry Association, which represents \nsecurities markets nationwide, says the Thompson amendment ``could \nseriously disrupt investor confidence in United States markets and \njeopardize their continued vitality, debt and liquidity.''\n  Senator Thompson says he wants a vote on his amendment. I have no \nobjection to Senator Thompson having a vote. But he doesn't want \nanybody else to have a vote on it. If we are going to consider major \nlegislation like the Thompson amendment, as chairman of one of the \ncommittees with jurisdiction over major elements of that amendment I \nwould like to have an opportunity to offer my own amendments to it. I \nknow we can get carried away with amendments. And Senator Thompson \nmakes a good point. Committees of jurisdiction aren't everything. But I \nthink it is important that we get Alan Greenspan and other people who \nunderstand our financial markets to give us input before we take a \nmajor step like instituting controls on America's capital markets.\n  The capital markets and financial institutions controls in the \nThompson legislation go against what we have been trying to achieve \nwith the Chinese for many years. For years we negotiated with the \nChinese to get them\n\n[[Page S8465]]\n\nto open their markets to American financial services companies. We want \ncitizens in China to be able to own a piece of the rock and to invest \nin retirement accounts in America. Senator Thompson's amendment would \nset up a mechanism to deny them the very rights for which we negotiated \nso long and hard.\n  I am not here to endorse China's practices--far from it. I condemn \ntheir policies with regard to the environment, with regard to their \nworkers, with regard to religious freedom, and with regard to \nproliferation. But that is not what we are talking about here. We are \ntalking about establishing normal trade relations. And the key point \nis: Does anybody believe any one of these areas of concern will be \nbetter if we reject PNTR?\n  I remind my colleagues that in 1948 there were 23 countries that \nsigned the agreement that founded the GATT, now called the WTO. Their \ncommon goal was to expand economic trade. One of those 23 countries was \nChina. But one year later, China turned to the dark side. They wanted \nto remake their society. They wanted to build a ``ladder to heaven.'' \nThey wanted to create equality, except for their political leaders. And \nthey did it--they made everybody poor. Chinese per capita income \nnosedived. By 1978, Taiwan, which started with fewer economic \nresources, had a per capita income of $1,560 a year. China's was $188. \nToday, Taiwan has a $13,000 per capita income, while China's is just \n$790.\n  But the good news is that fifty-two years later, China wants to \nreverse the terrible decision she made back then, and re-enter the \nworld of trade. China is turning away from the dark side. She is back \nknocking on the door. Now the question is, Are we going to slam the \ndoor in their face?\n  I say no. Trade promotes freedom. If you are concerned about workers \nrights in China, do you believe that workers will have more rights in a \ngrowing private sector, where they can work for somebody other than the \nGovernment? I don't see how you can help but believe that. And if you \nbelieve it, then you are going to be for normal trade relations with \nChina. If you want political and religious freedom in China, then give \npeople economic freedom, which ultimately promotes political freedom, \nas we have seen in Korea and in Taiwan. Developing economic growth in \nChina, so that people have a stake in economic freedom, will ultimately \nproduce a demand on their part for political freedom. And in the \nprocess they will begin to change China.\n\n  The Thompson amendment is legislation that needs dramatic changes. If \nwe don't table this amendment, it is not going to be adopted. We are \ngoing to offer amendments to it. I would be perfectly happy to see this \namendment brought up as a freestanding bill, but I want the opportunity \nto debate it and to amend it. Senator Thompson wants to have a vote on \nhis legislation, but he doesn't want anybody else to have a vote on \ntheir amendments to his legislation. I think that is what ultimately \nbrought us to where we are now.\n  There are security concerns with China. They need to be dealt with. \nBut they cannot be dealt with within the context of PNTR, with a bill \nthat has never been through a committee, that has never had a hearing \non its impact, that has not been looked at it to see whether it makes \nsense. Will it do what we want it to do? Will it hurt us more than it \nhurts other people?\n  So I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to adopt normal \ntrade relations with China. We are not endorsing China. We are trying \nto trade with them. We are trying to promote economic freedom because \nwe know economic freedom not only enriches us and them, but ultimately \nproduces an irresistible demand by people to have political freedom. \nWhen they have economic freedom, China will change.\n  This is a bad amendment. It is not ready to be adopted. I hope we \ntable it. As I said, if we don't table it, we are going to amend it; \nand then we are going to be in a long debate about a subject that is \nrelevant and important. But it is a subject that does not have to do \nwith establishing normal trade relations with China, which is the point \nof the underlying legislation and which I support.\n  I will, therefore, vote to table this amendment. I urge my colleagues \nto do the same. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the end of \nthe list of speakers my name be placed next in order to speak not to \nexceed 15 minutes in opposition to the motion to table.\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object, I must say we have agreed \nthat we would have the vote at quarter of 2. If there is any time left \nthat I have allotted, I will yield it. It looks to me as if I am not \ngoing to have any time.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wouldn't want to take away the Senator's time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the distinguished Senator--I regret the situation has \ndeveloped this way, but we have a number of Senators who are leaving so \nwe have fixed a time for the vote specifically at quarter of 2.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I didn't know anything about that agreement \nuntil I heard it put and accepted.\n  Mr. ROTH. I have to object to the request, with all due deference.\n  Mr. BYRD. I know the Senator regrets doing that.\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will ask for a quorum before the vote that will take \nlonger than 15 minutes. I am entitled to that.\n  Mr. ROTH. Parliamentary inquiry: Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A quorum call is in order before the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask the Senator from Tennessee to please proceed.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I withdraw my request for the time being so \nthe Senator may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, one brief comment and then I am going to \nyield 5 minutes of my time to the Senator from Ohio.\n  I say in response to Senator Gramm, surely I did not hear the basic \nproposition that I would not do something for him on something else and \ntherefore he is not going to do something for me? Surely I \nmisunderstood that part.\n  The only other response I would have is at least the Senator from \nTexas interjected a new way to address this proliferation we are seeing \ncoming from China. His response is trade with them and one day we will \nmagically wake up and they will be dismantling their armaments; they \nwill be quitting selling weapons of mass destruction to these rogue \nnations, and they will be happy and friendly. All we have to do is have \nmore and more and more trade, and that will solve the proliferation \nproblem.\n  When that happens, Mr. President, I will present the tooth fairy on \nthe floor of this body.\n  With that, I yield 5 minutes to my friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Thompson-\nTorricelli amendment. This amendment will give us more of a chance to \nhold the People's Republic of China, or any nation, accountable for \nproliferating weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem.\n  This amendment would not have been necessary had this administration \nshown effective leadership in nonproliferation policy. When the \nadministration sat down with China last year to negotiate an agreement \non China's admission to the World Trade Organization, that was an \nextraordinary opportunity to discuss China's weapons proliferation \npractices. It was a once in a lifetime opportunity to insist that China \nchange its ways on proliferation once and for all and advance the \nsecurity of all nations.\n  That opportunity, sadly, was lost.\n  The bilateral agreement reached between China and the United States \nlast November is the price China has to pay for our Nation to agree to \nPNTR and China's admission into the WTO. So the fundamental question is \nthis: Have we imposed a high enough price on the Chinese Government? \nSadly, I think the answer is clearly no.\n  Yes, the bilateral agreement arguably is a good economic document for \nboth countries. However, it is by no means an acceptable document for \nour own national security. If we are going to sacrifice our annual \nreview of normal trade relations with China, then our next President \nand the next Congress must have new tools in place to pursue our \nnational security objectives.\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n  It is that simple. And that is why we need to adopt the Thompson \namendment.\n  As my colleagues know, China is a signator of the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty. Article VI of that treaty states that nuclear \npowers are to:\n\n       . . . pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \n     measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an \n     early date. . . .\n\n  No nation has violated that specific article in the NPT more \negregiously, more openly, and more willingly in the last decade than \nthe People's Republic of China. That is the truth.\n  In Asia and the Middle East, our Nation and China hold two \nfundamentally different visions of the future direction of these two \nregions. Right now, China has used its expertise in nuclear and missile \ntechnology to effectively advance their interests and destabilize the \nregion.\n  For example, at the beginning of the last decade, Pakistan possessed \na very modest nuclear weapons program inferior to India's.\n  That was then. Now the balance of nuclear power has shifted, and it \nis a far more different and far more dangerous region today.\n  In the Middle East, it is the same story. News reports have \ndocumented China's contributions to Iran's nuclear development, and \nballistic and cruise missile programs, including anti-ship missiles \nthat are a threat to our naval presence and commercial shipping in the \nPersian Gulf. And published news reports say a CIA report issued last \nmonth confirmed that Chinese Government multinationals are assisting \nthe Libyan Government in building a more advanced missile program.\n  China certainly does not see our Government as a serious enforcer of \nnonproliferation policy--and why should they? As a result, weapons of \nmass destruction are in far more questionable hands and the world is a \nfar more dangerous place.\n  The high priority China placed on WTO membership certainly presented \nour Government with an opportunity to reassert its nonproliferation \ncredentials.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. I object.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. Under the previous order, \nthe Senator from Delaware is to be recognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, did I not have additional time?\n  Mr. ROTH. No, the vote is set for 1:45. But, we are trying to work \nthis out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote was to occur at 1:45.\n  Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask consent Senator Byrd now be recognized for up to 10 \nminutes and, following those remarks, I be recognized in order to make \na motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will certainly not object, but I just \nadd to that, if I can have 2 additional minutes to finish my comments \nand we can then proceed?\n  Mr. ROTH. Unfortunately, we are in a very tight timeframe. I \nrespectfully ask the Senator from Ohio to please comply. We must \nproceed. I have tried to satisfy everybody. I ask him not to proceed.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I certainly will not object to the request of the \nchairman of the committee. I have enough respect for my colleague, if \nthat is what my colleague thinks is absolutely necessary to not object.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, we also had a unanimous consent for an \nadditional, I think, 5 minutes that was allotted to me. I think the \nSenator from Ohio should be given at least an additional 2 minutes, if \nthat is the case. I certainly agree Senator Byrd should be given some \ntime. There is no reason why we cannot work this out.\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me say to the distinguished Senator, I am yielding my 5 \nminutes. I am not speaking.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I am not speaking either, and I will yield the \nremainder of my time after the Senator from Ohio is finished. I will \nyield the remainder of any time I have.\n  Mr. ROTH. All right. We will let the Senator from Ohio have--what is \nit, 2 minutes?\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modified request? \nWithout objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we can make up for this lost opportunity \nby passing this amendment. It is vitally important, I believe, that we \ndo this and we move forward.\n  This amendment is not just about holding other nations accountable as \nproliferators, it is also about holding our President accountable as \nthe world's principal nonproliferation enforcer.\n  With this amendment, Congress would receive a comprehensive report \neach year from the President about the proliferation practices of other \nnations. This report would require comprehensive information on \nproliferation practices, how these acts threaten our national security, \nand what actions are being taken by the President in response to these \nviolations.\n  This reporting requirement will prevent future administrations from \nrepeating the approach taken by the current administration, which ran \nand hid from our nonproliferation laws and responsibilities.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Tennessee would dramatically \nimprove the PNTR legislation. I say this because PNTR is not just about \ntrade--it is about U.S. foreign policy. We cannot let our trade policy \nwith China supercede our national security policy. The lessons learned \nfrom the Cox Commission were clear: foreign policy and national \nsecurity policy must drive trade policy and not the other way around.\n  I ask my colleagues: Have we asked enough of China? Has this \nadministration done enough to advance our foreign affairs with China? I \nbelieve the answer to both is a resounding ``no.'' The Thompson-\nTorricelli amendment gives the Senate a chance to insist on more from \nChina and more from this administration. If both China and future \nadministrations are going to take this Senate seriously as a clear and \nstrong voice in our national security policy, we should stand together \nto support this amendment.\n  I thank my colleagues, I thank my colleague from Tennessee, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Senator Fred \nThompson and Senator Torricelli. They are speaking the people's \nlanguage. They are talking plain, commonsense. They are right in \noffering this amendment.\n  Senator Thompson is asking that we in this Senate pay attention to \nthe national security concerns of this Nation, asking that we put \nnational security ahead of greed. What is wrong with that? He is asking \nthat we put the national security of the United States of America ahead \nof election-year politics.\n  What is the matter with this Senate? Can we not see the handwriting \non the wall?\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--nuclear weapons, \nballistic missiles, chemical weapons, biological weapons--is a growing \nmenace to world stability. Can we not see that? The acquisition of \nnuclear weapons by such rogue nations as North Korea, Iran, and Iraq is \nthe driving force behind the costly and complicated effort by the \nUnited States to deploy a national missile defense system. Can we not \nsee that?\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is forcing the \nnations of the world, including the United States, to reevaluate their \nown national security and to confront once again the nightmarish \npossibility of nuclear war. Can we not see that?\n  The main perpetrators behind the spread of weapons of mass \ndestruction are China, Russia, and North Korea. According to the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, in a report to Congress released last \nmonth, this unholy trinity of proliferators were the key contributors \nto the pipeline of ballistic missile related supplies and assistance \ngoing into the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa.\n  It seems ludicrous to me that we would even consider standing here \nand debating the merits of extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations \nstatus\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\nto the People's Republic of China without addressing the issue of \nChina's leading role in the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The Thompson-Torricelli amendment, of which I am a \ncosponsor, is essential to tightening our scrutiny of and control over \nthe illegitimate trafficking in weapons of mass destruction by Chinese \nentities.\n  What weak dishwater is the excuse that we cannot add anything to the \nHouse-passed bill that would force a conference that might make some \nmembers of the House uncomfortable. What a sorry spectacle is a Senate \ncompletely cowed by the possibility that we might upset the Chinese if \nwe add this provision.\n  What a travesty that the Secretary of Defense is reported to be \ncalling Senators to oppose an amendment that puts the Chinese on notice \nabout their egregious actions regarding the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction--weapons that threaten the safety of the planet.\n\n  I care nothing about a President's legacy if this is the price. I \ncare nothing about profits for multinational companies if this is the \nprice.\n  I took an oath to defend the Constitution of the Unites States \nagainst all enemies, foreign and domestic, and so did every other \nmember of this body. Are we to tear up that oath for the election-year \npolitics and greed?\n  Do we think that the American people are watching this debate with \npride today? Do we think the American people are willing to auction off \nthis Nation's security interests for the low bid of a Chinese promise \nto reduce tariffs?\n  China's string of broken promises is longer than its Great Wall.\n  We are talking here about the wanton export of nuclear weapons, of \nchemical weapons, of biological weapons and of long-range missiles. And \nwhat do we hear as a defense against addressing such dangerous and \ndiabolical behavior? We hear the tepid, water-logged response that such \naction we might take would endanger passage of this trade bill.\n  I have been in legislative bodies for 54 years, Mr. President. This \nis the first time I have ever seen anything such as this. When I was in \nthe House of Delegates in West Virginia, I objected to being bound by a \ncaucus, and I have never yet intended to be bound by any cabal or any \ncommitment that, regardless of what the merits may be on a given \namendment, we will vote against it. I have never seen that happen. I \nhave never been one to believe in that approach.\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina, Senator Hollings, the world's \ngreatest deliberative body is quaking and wringing its hands over an \namendment that would send a shot over the bow of the rogue elephant \nbehavior of the Chinese.\n  We tremble at the thought of Chinese displeasure. Our lips quiver at \nthe thought of displeasing big business or the president of the Chamber \nof Commerce or Cabinet members of the Clinton administration or the \nPresident himself as they dial for dollars and for votes. Those of us \nwho refuse to roll over like good dogs just don't get it. We know that \nthe fix is in on this fight, but we just keep slugging anyway. Maybe we \nwill land a good punch or two if we fight on. Maybe the powers that be \nin China will notice there were some in the Senate who refused to \nlegitimize China's outrageous disregard for the safety of the world by \nhanding them the trophy of PNTR. Thank God for the likes of Senator \nPaul Wellstone, Senator Fred Thompson, Senator Fritz Hollings, and \nSenator Bob Torricelli, and the 33 brave souls--33 brave souls, I want \nyou to know--who dared to vote with me on a couple of modest amendments \nto this ill-advised trade bill. I thank them.\n  I believe the American people know what we are trying to do, and I \nbelieve they will put patriotism over pandering for profit any day.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an item from the New \nYork Times titled ``Wavering Senators Feeling Pressure on China Trade \nBill.'' I will have more to say about that later.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 13, 2000]\n\n         Wavering Senators Feeling Pressure on China Trade Bill\n\n                           (By Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington, Sept. 12.--Corporate leaders and several of \n     President Clinton's cabinet officers intensified pressure \n     today on wavering senators to reject an amendment that could \n     jeopardize passage this year of a trade bill with China.\n       As the Senate girds for a crucial vote on the measure this \n     week, supporters of legislation to establish permanent normal \n     trading relations with China are pressing for a bill free of \n     amendments. Those supporters say there is not enough time \n     before Election Day to reconcile an amended Senate bill with \n     the version that the House passed in May.\n       At a White House meeting with Congressional leaders today, \n     Mr. Clinton urged speedy approval of an unamended bill. The \n     measure is one of his top remaining foreign policy goals and \n     a necessary step for American companies to benefit fully from \n     a deal reached last year by the United States and China that \n     paves the way for China's entry into the World Trade \n     Organization. That 135-member trade group sets rules for \n     global commerce.\n       At issue is an amendment sponsored by Senators Fred \n     Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, and Robert G. Torricelli, \n     Democrat of New Jersey, that would impose sanctions on \n     Chinese companies if they were caught exporting nuclear, \n     chemical or biological weapons or long-range missiles.\n       Defense Secretary William S. Cohen; Treasury Secretary \n     Lawrence H. Summers; Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, \n     Samuel R. Berger; and the United States trade representative, \n     Charlene Barshefsky, began telephoning senators today, \n     arguing that the amendment would not only imperil the trade \n     bill, but would also actually hamper American efforts to \n     combat the spread of sophisticated weaponry.\n       Senate aides negotiated the timing of votes. Senators could \n     take up Mr. Thompson's amendment on Wednesday or Thursday. \n     Final passage of the overall bill, which has overwhelming \n     support, could occur as early as Friday or as late as next \n     Tuesday.\n       China will enter the W.T.O. no matter how the Senate votes. \n     But without Congress's blessing, Beijing could withhold some \n     of the trade benefits, including lower tariffs, from the \n     American farmers and companies that it will extend to other \n     members in the trade group.\n       Thomas J. Donohue, president of the United States Chamber \n     of Commerce, warned of retribution against senators who \n     support the Thompson-Torricelli measure.\n       ``Should this vote get tangled up in the politics of \n     nuclear proliferation and other amendments to the extent that \n     it might not be passed,'' Mr. Donohue said, ``I think that \n     would have a very serious political implication for those who \n     were a party to that action.''\n       Senators easily dispatched several other amendments today, \n     including those on prison labor and human rights in China, as \n     well as subsidies from Beijing to Chinese companies. But on \n     the floor and in news conferences, the focus was on the \n     Thompson-Torricelli amendment. ``This is the vote on \n     P.N.T.R.,'' Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana said as \n     he used the bill's abbreviation.\n       Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, \n     stated that opponents ``have the votes to defeat Senator \n     Thompson's amendment.''\n       Even Mr. Thompson acknowledged that he faced an uphill \n     battle. ``We've always known it was going to be a tough \n     vote,'' Mr. Thompson told reporters. ``A lot of people are \n     saying they would like to vote for it. But since it is on \n     P.N.T.R., they're afraid it will complicate P.N.T.R.''\n       Supporters said the measure was necessary to clamp down on \n     Chinese exports of sophisticated weaponry to Iran, Libya, \n     North Korea and Pakistan.\n       ``What is especially troubling about the Chinese activities \n     is that this sensitive assistance is going to the most \n     dangerous nations in the most volatile areas of the world,'' \n     said Mr. Torricelli.\n       Backers of the amendment scoffed at fears that amending the \n     bill would doom the larger bill this year. ``To say we cannot \n     amend a bill that has been passed by the House would be the \n     height of irresponsibility,'' said Senator Kay Bailey \n     Hutchison, Republican of Texas.\n       But amendment critics, including farm-state Republicans, \n     said it was senseless to jeopardize a trade bill that would \n     lower barriers to China's vast markets. ``Approval for this \n     bill will keep the United States economically and \n     diplomatically engaged with one-fifth of the world's \n     population,'' said Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas. \n     ``I cannot support a redundant and counterproductive \n     amendment that would effectively kill this legislation.''\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I close by thanking Senator Roth, Senator \nMoynihan, and other Senators who have been so considerate and \ncourteous. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I spoke at length about my opposition to the \nThompson amendment on Monday. But I want to briefly reiterate that I \nbelieve this amendment, while well-intentioned, is seriously flawed. In \nparticular, this legislation relies on unilateral sanctions that are \ntoo widely drawn and too loosely conceived to prove effective in \ncountering proliferation. In a global economy, shutting off\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\nChinese and Russian access to American goods, agricultural and capital \nmarkets will not change Chinese or Russian behavior. Indeed, such \nactions would isolate the United States, not China, giving our \ncompetitors an open road to the world's biggest nation and fastest-\ngrowing market.\n  And make no mistake about it: though there have been changes to the \nbill to reduce the impact on farmers, virtually every member of the \nfarming community--from the Alabama Farmers Federation to the National \nChicken Council--has said in a letter that they are absolutely against \nthe Thompson amendment. Moreover, for the first time, U.S. securities \nmarkets will be used as a sanctioning tool. That's why Alan Greenspan \nopposes this legislation.\n  The unilateral sanctions in this amendment are also indiscriminate in \ntheir application and could be applied to some of our closest allies, \nsuch as Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. Surely such \nactions will make future multilateral cooperation--which is absolutely \nessential to solving proliferation problems--far more difficult. \nAnother problem with this amendment is that even though the President \nis theoretically able to waive sanctions, Congress gains the power to \noverturn the President's waiver through a procedure exactly the same as \nthe counterproductive one we currently use in annually renewing normal \ntrade relations with China.\n  In addition, the evidentiary standard used to trigger sanctions, one \nof ``credible information,'' is too low. Surely, critical national \nsecurity actions should be based on a higher standard, especially when \nthey are could very well be applied to our closest allies. It also \nappears that the Thompson amendment could have a disastrous effect on \nour Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--better known as the Nunn-\nLugar Program--with Russia and Russian entities.\n  Section 4 of the Thompson amendment contains language that would ban \nNunn-Lugar assistance to any Russian entity identified in the report \nrequired by the amendment of the President. And so this amendment could \nactually have the perverse effect of decreasing our ability to stem \nproliferation problems in Russia. The Thompson amendment also raises \nserious constitutional concerns. For example, Congress' disapproval of \nthe President's determination could result in severe sanctions against \npersons for actions that were perfectly legal when taken. The ex post \nfacto effect raises serious due process questions. The standard of \nproof, which could result in sanctions against individual U.S. citizens \nbased on suspicions, rather than proof, raises separate due process \nconcerns. The congressional disapproval procedures raise separation of \npowers problems. In reversing the President's determinations regarding \nsanctions, Congress will, in effect, implicitly be second-guessing the \nexercise of the President's prosecutorial discretion.\n  Proliferation is a matter of vital national interest. I applaud my \nfriend from Tennessee for raising this issue, and I hope he will \ncontinue his work in this critical area next year, when I hope we can \ncome to agreement on a measure that will gain the support of an \noverwhelming majority of this Chamber. But I must urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in opposing the Thompson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the Thompson amendment No. 4132, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: I think under the \norder, my colleague and friend from North Carolina is to be recognized \nto offer an amendment at this juncture. I have had a brief discussion \nwith my colleague from North Carolina. I don't know whether I need to \nask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 minutes prior to Senator Helms \nbeing recognized or not in order to achieve that result. May I inquire \nwhat is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Recognition of the Senator from North Carolina \nis to occur at 2:30. The Senator from Connecticut has the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Does the Senator from Connecticut need the full 10 \nminutes? I wanted to speak for a few minutes as in morning business if \nhe didn't need it all.\n  Mr. DODD. If the Chair will inform the Senator from Connecticut when \n8 minutes have transpired, I will leave a couple minutes for my friend \nfrom Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I intended to offer these remarks prior to \nthe consideration of the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, but time did \nnot permit it. I am pleased with the outcome of the vote in this \nChamber regarding the Thompson amendment. I do regret, in a sense, that \nwe had to take the vote. I am concerned that the powers that be in the \nPeople's Republic of China, or elsewhere, may misread the vote as \nsomehow rejection of our concern on the issue of nuclear proliferation. \nNothing could be further from the truth. This vote that occurred is \nobviously one where most of us felt very deeply that the underlying \nagreement is of critical importance, as is the subject matter of the \namendment offered by our friends and colleagues from Tennessee and New \nJersey. But it is the strong view of many of us that this was an \nunrelated matter and the amendment, as drawn, was flawed in several \nrespects.\n  Specifically, the amendment called for the imposition of unilateral \nsanctions against the People's Republic of China, Russia, and North \nKorea for past and prospective proliferation activities. Although the \namendment did give the President the authority to waive these sanctions \nunder certain circumstances, it also provides for the congressional \nchallenge of the President's use of that authority under expedited \nprocedures. Clearly, the issue the sponsors sought to address in this \namendment is a deeply serious one, with significant national security \nand foreign policy implications.\n  I, for one, would not attempt to stand here and argue that the \nPeople's Republic of China, or North Korea, or Russia, or several other \nnations for that matter, have always steadfastly adhered to the \ninternational standards\n\n[[Page S8469]]\n\nset forth in the existing multilateral nonproliferation agreements and \narms control regimes. Nor would I suggest that China does not have the \nsame obligations that every other nation has to ensure that its exports \nof sensitive nuclear weapons-related technology to North Korea, Iran, \nLibya, and other states seeking to acquire such dangerous weapons \ncapability cease to occur.\n  I do wonder, however, whether the underlying legislation is the \nappropriate place to be having a debate about an issue that is, after \nall, a global problem that goes well beyond our trade relations with \none nation.\n  Nor is the is problem likely to be solved by our simply legislating \nsanctions against one country or another. This is a multilateral \nproblem that isn't going to be contained without meaningful cooperation \nand the involvement of all nations with a stake in containing the \nspread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\n  I am also fearful that whichever way the vote turned out--and in this \ncase it was defeated--it will be misinterpreted by those who want to \nbelieve that the U.S., and specifically the U.S. Senate, does not care \nabout the issue of nuclear proliferation, and therefore potential \nproliferators are free to do whatever they want.\n\n  I don't believe that is an accurate nor wise message to be sending. \nNor do I think it serves to further international nuclear \nnonproliferation cooperation.\n  As to the specifics of the amendment just adopted, I am puzzled by \nhow the sponsors have chosen to approach what is, after all, a global \nproblem. They have chosen to single out three countries--China, Russia, \nand North Korea--for their participation in proliferation activities, \nwhile effectively ignoring similar actions taken by other smaller \nnations. The list is much larger than those three nations. Any action \ntaken should be global in its focus.\n  I also don't understand why our existing nuclear nonproliferation \nlaws don't provide at least what I believe for the time being \nsufficient authority to the President to respond accordingly to \nviolations of international nonproliferation standards by China or any \nother potential exporter.\n  These laws include: the Arms Control and Disarmament Act, Arms Export \nControl Act, International Emergency Economic Powers Act, Export \nAdministration Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control Elimination \nAct, Iran-Iraq Nonproliferation Act, Nuclear Proliferation Prevention \nAct, and the Iran Proliferation Act of 2000. These laws cover a full \nrange of dangerous proliferation activities.\n  The mechanics of the amendment just rejected also gave me great \npause. The low evidentiary standards in the amendment could \nautomatically trigger a number of mandatory unilateral sanctions that \nwould ultimately hurt, or could hurt, our foreign policy, economic, and \ntechnological interests. We must ensure that only those who traffic in \narms are affected by those sanctions.\n  Proliferation is a very delicate and complex issue that affects our \neconomic and foreign policy agendas. Ensuring the fullest cooperation \nof all the major participants in this sector is by its very nature a \ndynamic process with significant diplomatic ramifications. Attempting \nto legislate the mechanics of this effort is akin to attempting to \nperform brain surgery with a hacksaw, in my view.\n  China has problems--serious ones--with proliferation. Nobody here is \ngoing to claim that China is a benevolent democracy, and I am sure we \nall agree that there is much China must do to meet the standards we \nexpect of civilized nations who are going to join the World Trade \nOrganization. Yet, I also believe we should recognize that there has \nbeen some positive movement in this area.\n  Recent efforts at U.S. engagement have resulted in China joining a \nnumber of major multilateral arms control regimes in assisting us to \ndefuse a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula, and in participating \nconstructively in international efforts to contain the escalating arms \nrace between India and Pakistan.\n  How can we build on that progress? Are we going to do it by denying \nChina PNTR or mandating the imposition of unilateral sanctions? Surely, \nthere has to be a better way to encourage additional cooperation from \nChinese authorities in this area.\n  I respectfully suggest that the Thompson amendment should not be \nmisinterpreted because, as important as it is, it would be misguided, \nin my view, to include it as was attempted in this particular \nlegislation. There is a far greater chance that we are going to get the \nkind of cooperation as a result of China being a part of the World \nTrade Organization than isolating them further.\n  I hope we will have another opportunity to address the proliferation \nissue. It is one that needs to be addressed. This would have been the \nwrong place.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order \nfor me to deliver my remarks seated at my desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4128\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, during the course of the Senate's \nconsideration of handing China the permanent most favored nation \nstatus--that is what it amounts to; just giving it to them--several of \nus have highlighted the abhorrent human rights record of the Communist \nChinese Government.\n  China's practice of forcing its women citizens to submit to abortions \nand/or sterilization--usually both--is not only revolting; it is \nshameful, because it is a practice that has been repeatedly documented \nfor 20 years now. In fact, the most recent State Department Human \nRights Report on China contains a detailed account of the cruel, \ncoercive measures used by Chinese officials, such as forced abortion, \nforced sterilization, and detention of those who even dare to resist \nthis inhumane treatment.\n  My pending amendment proposes to put the Senate on record as \ncondemning the Chinese dictatorship's barbaric treatment of its own \npeople.\n  Although the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party officially \nsays--and I say absurdly says, and they say it--that forced abortion \nhas no role in China's population control, it is, to the contrary, a \nknown fact that the Chinese Government does indeed, absolutely, and \nwithout question, force women to submit to forced abortion and to \nsterilization. Communist Chinese authorities strictly enforce birth \nquotas imposed on its citizens. They pay rewards to informants tattling \non the women for having more than one child while making certain that \nlocal population control officials using coercion are left absolutely \nunrestrained in the way they conduct themselves.\n  For example, I have in hand reports of this cruel situation from many \nChinese citizens. I received this information in my capacity as \nchairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. These citizens have \nwitnessed firsthand countless episodes of this bloody cruelty. A \ndefector from China's population control program testified before a \nHouse International Relations Committee hearing in June a couple of \nyears ago that the Central Government policy in China strongly \nencourages local officials to use every conceivable coercive tactic in \nenforcing the one-child policy. They have described to me in person the \nresults of women crying and begging for mercy simply because they were \nprepared to deliver a child.\n  Furthermore, Communist China's population control officials routinely \npunish women who have conceived a child without Government \nauthorization. They subject the women to extreme psychological \npressures, enormous fines which they can't possibly pay, along with the \nloss of their jobs, and with all sorts of other physical threats.\n  If women in China dare to resist the population control policy on \nreligious grounds, they have to confront especially gruesome \npunishment. Amnesty International reported to us, and publicly, that \nCatholic women in two villages were subjected to torture, to sexual \nabuse, and to the detention of their relatives for daring to resist \nChina's population program.\n\n[[Page S8470]]\n\n  Very credible reports indicate that if ``these'' methods aren't \nenough to convince women in China to abide by the regime's population \ncontrol program, forced abortions are carried out publicly in the very \nlate stages of pregnancy.\n  I think it was back in 1994 when it began. Since that time, forced \nabortion has been used in Communist China not only to regulate the \nnumber of children born but under the policy known as the ``Natal and \nHealth Care Law,'' pregnancies are terminated on a mandatory basis if a \nGovernment bureaucrat arbitrarily declares that an unborn child is \ndefective. Nobody checks on him. He doesn't have to present any \nevidence. He just says the child is defective. That is it.\n  I believe it is common knowledge that I am a resolute defender of the \nsanctity of life. I have tried to do that ever since I have been a \nSenator, and prior to that time. But the pending amendment is not \nmerely about life; it seems to me it is about liberty. Bureaucrats \nterrorizing women into unwanted abortions or medical operations \npermanently depriving them of their capability to have children, it \nseems to me, is the ultimate appalling affront to freedom.\n  My pending amendment urges the President to ask the Chinese \nGovernment to stop this ungodly practice. My amendment also calls on \nthe President to urge the Chinese Government to stop putting Chinese \nwomen in jail whose crime is resisting abortion of a child or \nsterilization.\n  I think this is a modest measure. It doesn't condition PNTR on \nChina's Government changing its abhorrent behavior. It simply asks the \nPresident of the United States to say to the Chinese that we want to \ndefend the rights of women in China and ask the Chinese officials to \nsee that that happens.\n  The question that comes to my mind is, Can the Senate proceed to \naward China with permanent trade privileges while refusing to express \nour revulsion at a basic violation of women's freedom?\n  The amendment I shall propose and call up in just a moment will not \nat all endanger passage of PNTR. We need not worry about that. I don't \nthink PNTR ought to be approved at this time. But this amendment will \nnot forbid or do any danger to the enactment of PNTR. It will simply be \na matter of the Senate doing and saying the right thing before it \nhappens.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4128\n\n (Purpose: To express the Sense of Congress regarding forced abortions \n                   in the People's Republic of China)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I now call up amendment No. 4128.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms) proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4128:\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 702. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING FORCED ABORTIONS IN \n                   CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For more than 18 years there have been frequent, \n     consistent, and credible reports of forced abortion and \n     forced sterilization in the People's Republic of China. These \n     reports indicate the following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion has no role \n     in the population control program, in fact the Communist \n     Chinese Government encourages forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization through a combination of strictly enforced \n     birth quotas, rewards for informants, and impunity for local \n     population control officials who engage in coercion.\n       (B) A recent defector from the population control program, \n     testifying at a congressional hearing on June 10, 1998, made \n     clear that central government policy in China strongly \n     encourages local officials to use coercive methods.\n       (C) Population control officials of the People's Republic \n     of China, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical punishment.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. According to \n     a 1995 Amnesty International report, the Catholic inhabitants \n     of 2 villages in Hebei Province were subjected to enforcement \n     measures including torture, sexual abuse, and the detention \n     of resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy, including \n     numerous examples of actual infanticide.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion has been used in Communist \n     China not only to regulate the number of children, but also \n     to destroy those who are regarded as defective because of \n     physical or mental disabilities in accordance with the \n     official eugenic policy known as the ``Natal and Health Care \n     Law''.\n       (3) According to every annual State Department Country \n     Report on Human Rights Practices for the People's Republic of \n     China since 1983, Chinese officials have used coercive \n     measures such as forced abortion, forced sterilization, and \n     detention of resisters.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should urge the People's Republic of \n     China to cease its forced abortion and forced sterilization \n     policies and practices; and\n       (2) the President should urge the People's Republic of \n     China to cease its detention of those who resist abortion or \n     sterilization.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the clerk. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays. I don't believe I will be able to get \nthem at this moment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I simply want to inquire about how much \ntime I have remaining on my side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order for \nme to request and to receive a rollcall on the pending amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Reserving the right to object, I think the hope is that we \nwill set the vote aside and have several votes later.\n  Mr. HELMS. Do I have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I say to the distinguished chairman that I am aware of \nthat and I favor it. However, I do want to get the yeas and nays on my \namendment. The scheduling of a whole series of amendments suits me just \nfine.\n  Mr. ROTH. We join the Senator in asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nChina's record on family planning and its use of forced abortion is \nindefensible. The country's policy violates the most fundamental human \nrights. That is why the United States does not contribute funds \ndirectly or indirectly to China's family planning programs.\n  My good friend and distinguished colleague from North Carolina is to \nbe commended for bringing the matter of Chinese forced abortions to our \nattention. I do not oppose his amendment on its merits. I only oppose \nit as an amendment to H.R. 4444.\n  As I said, if PNTR is amended, a conference and another round of \nvotes on H.R. 4444 will be necessary, likely destroying any chance for \nPNTR. Therefore, I must ask that my colleagues join me in voting \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If no one yields time, time will be equally \ncharged on both sides.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we have a Senator on the way to the Chamber \nto speak on the pending amendment. I suggest, to save time, the pending \namendment be laid aside temporarily so I can call up a second \namendment.\n\n[[Page S8471]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making a unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I hope \neveryone will agree to the unanimous consent--to lay aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I wish to renew my request that it be in \norder for me to be seated during the presentation of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4123\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Commerce to consult with leaders \nof American businesses to encourage them to adopt a code of conduct for \n           doing business in the People's Republic of China)\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4123 and ask it be \nstated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Helms], proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4123.\n       At the end of the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. CODE OF CONDUCT FOR BUSINESSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Chief Executive of Viacom media corporation told \n     the Fortune Global Forum, a gathering of hundreds of \n     corporate leaders in Shanghai to celebrate the 50th \n     anniversary of communism in China in September 1999, that \n     Western media groups ``should avoid being unnecessarily \n     offensive to the Chinese government. We want to do business. \n     We cannot succeed in China without being a friend of the \n     Chinese people and the Chinese government.''.\n       (2) The owner of Fox and Star TV networks has gained favor \n     with the Chinese leadership in part by dropping programming \n     and publishing deals that offend the Communist Government of \n     China, including the book by the last British Governor of \n     Hong Kong.\n       (3) The Chief Executive of Time Warner, which owns the \n     Fortune company that organized the Global Forum, called Jiang \n     Zemin his ``good friend'' as he introduced Jiang to make the \n     keynote speech at the conference. Jiang went on to threaten \n     force against Taiwan and to warn that comments by the West on \n     China's abysmal human rights record were not welcome.\n       (4) The Chief Executive of American International Group was \n     reported to be so effusive in his praise of China's economic \n     progress at the Global Forum that one Chinese official \n     described his remarks as ``not realistic''.\n       (5) The founder of Cable News Network, one of the world's \n     richest men, told the Global Forum that ``I am a socialist at \n     heart.''.\n       (6) During the Global Forum, Chinese leaders banned an \n     issue of Time magazine (owned by Time-Warner, the host of the \n     Global Forum) marking the 50th anniversary of communism in \n     China, because the issue included commentaries by dissidents \n     Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and the Dalai Lama. China also \n     blocked the web sites of Time Warner's Fortune magazine and \n     CNN.\n       (7) Chinese officials denied Fortune the right to invite \n     Chinese participants to the Global Forum and instead padded \n     the guest list with managers of state-run firms.\n       (8) At the forum banquet, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji lashed \n     out at the United States for defending Taiwan.\n       (9) On June 5, 2000, China's number two phone company, \n     Unicom, broke an agreement with the Qualcomm Corporation by \n     confirming that it will not use mobile-phone technology \n     designed by Qualcomm for at least 3 years, causing a sharp \n     sell off of the United States company's stock.\n       (10) When the Taiwanese pop singer Ah-mei, who appeared in \n     advertisements for Sprite in China, agreed to sing Taiwan's \n     national anthem at Taiwan's May 20, 2000, presidential \n     inauguration, Chinese authorities immediately notified the \n     Coca-Cola company that its Ah-mei Sprite ads would be banned.\n       (11) The company's director of media relations said that \n     the Coca-Cola Company was ``unhappy'' about the ban, but ``as \n     a local business, would respect the authority of local \n     regulators and we will abide by their decisions''.\n       (12) In 1998, Apple Computer voluntarily removed images of \n     the Dalai Lama from its ``Think Different'' ads in Hong Kong, \n     stating at the time that ``where there are political \n     sensitivities, we did not want to offend anyone''.\n       (13) In 1997, the Massachusetts-based Internet firm, \n     Prodigy, landed an investment contract in China by agreeing \n     to comply with China's Internet rules which provide for \n     censoring any political information deemed unacceptable to \n     the Communist government.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that in \n     order for the presence of United States businesses to truly \n     foster political liberalization in China, those businesses \n     must conduct themselves in a manner that reflects basic \n     American values of democracy, individual liberty, and \n     justice.\n       (c) Consultation Required.--Not later than 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce \n     shall consult with American businesses that do business in, \n     have significant trade with, or invest in the People's \n     Republic of China, to encourage the businesses to adopt a \n     voluntary code of conduct that--\n       (1) follows internationally recognized human rights \n     principles, including freedom of expression and democratic \n     governance;\n       (2) ensures that the employment of Chinese citizens is not \n     discriminatory in terms of sex, ethnic origin, or political \n     belief;\n       (3) ensures that no convict, forced, or indentured labor is \n     knowingly used;\n       (4) supports the principle of a free market economy and \n     ownership of private property;\n       (5) recognizes the rights of workers to freely organize and \n     bargain collectively; and\n       (6) discourages mandatory political indoctrination on \n     business premises.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, the pending amendment proposes that the \nSecretary of Commerce be requested to consult with American businesses \non drafting and adopting a voluntary code of conduct for doing business \nin China. Such a voluntary code of conduct would follow internationally \nrecognized human rights, work against discrimination and forced labor, \nsupport the principles of free enterprise and the rights of workers to \norganize, and discourage mandatory political indoctrination in the \nworkplace.\n  The purpose of this amendment is this: So often in this debate, the \nargument has been advanced that only by exposing the Chinese Government \nand the Chinese people to our values through expanded trade and \ninvestment can we hope to bring about political change in China, and \nthe only way we can help that desired achievement is to do as the \namendment proposes.\n  I have always been skeptical about this because businesses are not in \nthe business of expanding democracy. I am not going to comment on what \nthe businesses support in PNTR and the way it is being supported. Be \nthat as it may, businesses exist, quite frankly, to make money. I \ncertainly have no problem with that. But let's be honest on the process \nof what we are doing here in this Senate Chamber. American businesses, \neven if viewed in the most charitable light, are not likely to lift a \nfinger to promote democracy in China. Unfortunately, it is difficult to \nview some of the American businesses charitably when we examine their \nattitude toward China. If I step on some toes here, I am sorry, but I \nbelieve I must have my say for the benefit of the Senate.\n  The powerful lure of potential huge Chinese markets has obviously \nclouded the judgment of some of our top companies and some of their \nexecutives. With regret, I have concluded that some of America's top \nbusinesses have been willing to supplicate to the Communist Government \nof China, hoping that the Chinese Government will allow them someday to \nmake a profit there.\n  I want the Senate to consider the following statements and actions by \nAmerican businesses in China, which are stated as findings in the \npending amendment:\n  No. 1, the chief executive of Viacom media corporation told the \nFortune Global Forum, a September 1999 gathering of hundreds of \ncorporate leaders in Shanghai gathered to celebrate--get this--the 50th \nanniversary of communism in China--They gathered to celebrate the fact \nthat western media groups, ``should avoid being unnecessarily offensive \nto the Chinese Government.''\n\n  No. 2, the owner of Fox and Star TV networks has repeatedly gained \nfavor with the Chinese leadership by dropping programming and \npublishing deals that offend the Communist Government of China, \nincluding a book written by the last British Governor of Hong Kong.\n  No. 3, the Chief Executive of American International Group was \nreported to be so effusive in his praise of China's economic progress \nat this global forum that one Communist Chinese official described the \nremarks as ``not realistic.''\n  No. 4, the founder of CNN, one of the world's wealthiest men, proudly \ntold the global forum, ``I am a socialist at heart.''\n  No. 5, in 1998, Apple Computer voluntarily removed images of the \nDalai Lama from its ``Think Different'' ads in Hong Kong, stating at \nthe time,\n\n[[Page S8472]]\n\n``Where there are political sensitivities, we did not want to offend \nanyone.''\n  No. 7, in 1997, the Massachusetts-based Internet firm, Prodigy, \nlanded an investment contract in China by agreeing to comply with \nChina's Internet rules which provide for censoring any political \ninformation--now get this--``deemed unacceptable to the Communist \ngovernment.''\n  I am forced to wonder if some of our business leaders understand what \nthey are doing when they make such statements and make such decisions. \nObviously, they are trying to curry favor with the Communist Government \nof China in which they aim to do business. But isn't there a limit to \nwhat they would do to accomplish what they seek? To say things that are \nso clearly untrue, or to agree to self-censorship when some of them are \nin the media business, it seems to me, undermines the ultimate goal of \nthese companies--their higher profits--by legitimizing a Communist \ngovernment that manifestly does not even believe in the free enterprise \nsystem.\n  In any event, some U.S. businesses certainly did not seem to get a \nvery good return on their investment of goodwill. Just consider how the \nChinese Government repaid Time-Warner, for example. At the very moment \nthat Time-Warner was sponsoring a conference in Shanghai for American \nbusiness leaders to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Chinese \ncommunism, Chinese leaders banned the then-current issue of Time \nmagazine, which is owned, of course, by Time-Warner. They removed it \nfrom the Chinese news stands--because of what? Because that issue \nhappened to include commentaries by some Chinese dissidents and by the \nDalai Lama. Then China blocked the web sites of Time Warner's Fortune \nmagazine, as well as CNN, the founder of which is a self-described \nsocialist. I didn't say it; he said it.\n  Chinese officials denied the conference organizers the right to \ninvite certain Chinese participants to the forum. Instead, the Chinese \nleaders padded the guest list with managers of--what? Chinese-run \nfirms.\n  That is the way they do business over there. That is the crowd that \neverybody in this country seems to be clamoring to bow and scrape to.\n  I have to say this for the Chinese leaders: at least they stood up at \nthe banquet at the conclusion of the conference and harshly lashed out \nat the United States for daring to speak about human rights while in \nCommunist China, and for defending democratic Taiwan, of course.\n  So I wonder if our corporate executives woke up the next morning \nfeeling a little bit underappreciated. But even if they did not, one \nthing is for certain. This type of attitude and conduct by American \nbusinessmen will never, never, never promote democracy in China, let \nalone participate in causing it to come about. If the presence of \nAmerican businesses truly purports to aid in bringing democracy to \nChina, then those businesses, it seems to me, must conduct themselves \nin a manner reflecting basic American values--such as individual \nliberty and free expression and free enterprise.\n\n  That is what the pending amendment's voluntary--and I repeat \nvoluntary--code of conduct calls for. Of course, I realize that some \nAmerican firms have already adopted their own ethical rules and codes \nfor international business, but they generally are limited, narrow \nbusiness practices, don't you see, and certainly have not prevented the \nsort of kowtowing to China's ruling Communists whom I have just \ndescribed.\n  The point is this, and I will conclude. I fail to see any reason on \nthe face of the Earth why the Senate should not take this step at least \nbefore concluding that trade will automatically bring democracy to \nCommunist China.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor, let me request, by the same \nmethod as previously, that I be granted the yeas and nays on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4128\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nreturn to the Helms amendment No. 4128.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, how much time is remaining \non the amendment--on Senator Helms' time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina retains 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask the Senator from \nNorth Carolina, if he desires to finish the debate on this, please \ninterrupt me and I will be happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. HELMS. Inasmuch as the Chair has yielded me the right to comment \nfrom my seat at my desk, let me say I yield all the time to the Senator \nthat he requires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, let me take the \nopportunity to say again publicly on this floor to the Senator from \nNorth Carolina what an honor it is to serve with him and to know him as \na friend. He is one of the finest people I have ever met in my life. I \ndon't say that lightly. There are a lot of people, especially the \nunborn children of this world, who know who has been carrying the torch \nhere for children who cannot speak for themselves in the womb. They owe \nyou a lot. We owe you a lot. I am proud to be here in the Senate with \nyou.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am proud to stand in \nsupport of the Helms amendment. On August 24 of this year, publications \nall around the world ran headlines very similar to this:\n\n       Chinese kill baby to enforce birth rule.\n\n  The article went on to describe how five Chinese Government officials \nintruded into the home of a woman who had given birth against the \nstate's oppressive ``one child'' policy. They waited in her living room \nuntil she returned from the hospital. When she arrived, the officials \nripped the baby boy from her arms where--to the horror of his mother \nand onlookers--they walked outside to a rice paddy and drowned the \nchild in front of his parents' eyes.\n  A wave of anger obviously enveloped this small township in the \nfollowing hours of the child's murder. However, this is China. \nVillagers are kept from speaking out against this atrocity, and they \nfind themselves in a terrible state of unified silence as a fear of \nretribution, harm, or even death for their own families settles upon \nthem.\n  This is the China to which we are giving permanent trade status with \nthis bill. I find it unbelievable that we cannot get these kinds of \nhuman rights atrocities addressed in this permanent normal trade \nrelations bill for China. We are saying this is fine, we will ignore \nit, not talk about it, as long as we can sell them wheat, corn, \nwhatever, and make money. So we can ignore this.\n  I am the first to admit we cannot intrude, unfortunately, into the \npolicies of the Government of China, but we can make known these \npolicies to the world and we can say as a nation, supposedly the moral \nleader of the world, that this is wrong.\n  I am proud of Senator Helms for bringing this to the attention of the \nSenate during this debate, and I cannot understand, for the life of me, \nwhy we cannot allow simple sense-of-the-Senate language to this \npermanent normal trade relations bill in an effort to stop this \nhorrible, barbaric behavior.\n  The Helms amendment simply expresses the sense of Congress that, one, \nCongress should urge China to cease its forced abortion and forced \nsterilization policies, and two, the President should urge China to \ncease its detention of those who resist abortion and sterilization. It \nis a good amendment. There is nothing wrong with this amendment. It is \nfair and it is reasonable.\n  In addition, I also believe that Chinese women should have the right \nto choose. It is interesting, those who have been the strongest \nproponents of abortion in this Chamber--when it comes to a Chinese \nwoman's right to say, ``I want to have my child,'' the silence is \ndeafening. When a woman says, ``I have the right to choose to have an \nabortion,'' they are out here in full force. A little inconsistency?\n  The point is, a Chinese woman is told, in spite of the fact she wants \nto\n\n[[Page S8473]]\n\nhave her child, that she cannot, and not only can she not have it, it \nis aborted forcefully.\n  I had constituents, a young couple, a few months ago come to me. They \nwere both Chinese. They had been visiting America. She was about 5 or 6 \nmonths pregnant and was told if she went back to China the child was \ngoing to be aborted. I turned all hands on deck to get that case \nresolved so they did not have to go back, and she did not go back. She \nhad that child, now an American citizen, born in freedom, but that \nchild would have been aborted in China against the wishes of the \nmother. We cannot even get this issue addressed with sense-of-the-\nSenate language before we pass on the fast track permanent normal trade \nrelations.\n  There is so much talk about choice, but the choice only runs one \nway--when one is talking about the woman's ``right'' to an abortion. \nWhen it comes to the right to choose to have her baby, silence.\n  It is a stated position of the Chinese Communist Party that forced \nabortion and forced sterilization have no role in the population \ncontrol program. In fact, the Chinese Communist Government encourages \nboth forced abortion and forced sterilization. I emphasize ``forced.'' \nThey accomplish this through a combination of strictly enforced birth \nquotas and immunity for local population control officials who use \ncoercion to force abortion.\n\n  Nobody really knows for sure how many women undergo these abortions. \nWe do not exactly have a population count on that score. Most women are \nafraid to report. The numbers are kept secret.\n  According to Harry Wu, the director of the Laogai Research \nFoundation, who once lived in China and now monitors and writes about \nhis native homeland, the city of Janjiang alone experienced 1,141 \nforced abortions in one 9-month period in 1997. Those were women who \nwanted to have their children and were forced to have an abortion.\n  One can imagine the horror of the woman who has to go through that. I \nsay with the greatest respect for those who disagree with the issue, \nwhere are you today? If you are for a woman's right to choose to have \nan abortion, why can you not be for a woman's right not to have one? \nWhy the silence? Where are the votes on this amendment?\n  I want to spend the next minute or two telling about one brave woman \nwho dared to come out of Red China to talk about this so-called planned \nbirth policy. Her name is Ms. Gao. She testified before the House \nSubcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights a couple of \nyears ago. According to Ms. Gao, in order to successfully carry out the \npolicy, precise records of the women in her province were compiled, \nnoting their names, births, marriages, pregnancies, reproductive \ncycles--all sorts of information.\n  Women who met the planned birth committee's criteria were then issued \na ``birth allowance,'' while those women who did not meet the criteria \nwere given ``birth not allowed'' notices.\n  This is the country to which we are giving permanent normal trade \nrelations. Senator Helms is not forcing us to do anything except to put \nthis language in the bill as a sense of the Senate that alerts the \nworld to this practice. That is all he is asking. We are told if we \nsupport Senator Helms, we are going to delay the passage of the bill. \nSo? Permanent is permanent. What are a few more days, hours, minutes? I \nventure to say, if we sent this back to the House with the Helms \nlanguage in it, it would take the House about 5 minutes to approve it, \nand that would be the end of it.\n  What they are really afraid of is offending the Chinese--that is what \nthis is about--because we do not want to lose the sales of our \nagricultural products. Sales of agricultural products are more \nimportant than the lives of children who are forcibly killed in front \nof their parents. If a woman is found to be pregnant and does not \npossess a birth-allowed certificate, she is immediately given an \nabortion, no matter how far along the pregnancy is. I repeat--no matter \nhow far along the pregnancy is.\n  Enforcement is a crucial component of China's planned parenthood \npolicies. Mandatory medical inspections for women of childbearing age \nis required. One can imagine the secrecy, trying to hide the fact you \nare pregnant if you want to have the child, maybe even keeping it from \nyour own family, certainly friends, relatives, for fear you are going \nto be turned in to Big Brother, Communist China Government. Those who \nfail to undertake these medical examinations at the preordained time \nface jail and monetary fines.\n  Night raids to apprehend women in violation of state policy are \nfrequent. Where are the proponents of women's rights on this debate? \nWhy are they not standing with Senator Helms?\n  If the Chinese Government cannot locate the woman, they will detain \nher husband or her parent or anyone in her family until she comes \nforward and surrenders to have that abortion.\n  This is happening in China. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's not \npretend it does not happen. It is happening in China.\n  I want to read from Ms. Gao's testimony in 1998. It is pretty \ncompelling, and it is not pleasant. She said:\n\n       Once I found a woman who was 9 months pregnant but did not \n     have her birth-allowed certificate. According to the policy, \n     she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery. In the \n     operation room, I saw how the aborted child's lips were \n     sucking, how its limbs were stretching. A physician injected \n     poison into its skull, and the child died and was thrown into \n     a trash can. To help a tyrant do evils was not what I wanted \n     . . . I could not live with this on my conscience. I, too, \n     after all, am a mother.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       All of those 14 years, I was a monster in the daytime, \n     injuring others--\n\n  and killing babies--\n\n     by the Chinese communist authorities' barbaric planned-birth \n     policy, but in the evening, I was like all other women and \n     mothers, enjoying my life with my children. I could not live \n     such a dual life anymore. Here, to all those injured women, \n     to all those children who were killed, I want to repent and \n     say sincerely that I'm sorry! I want to be a real human \n     being. It is also my sincere hope that what I describe here \n     today can lead you to give your attention to this issue, so \n     that you can extend your arms to save China's women and \n     children.\n\n  Senator Helms has fulfilled that lady's expectations by bringing this \nto the attention of the Senate, the American people, and the world, on \nbehalf of China's women and children.\n  What is a real shame is, what the Senator is asking here will be \nrejected as we vote no.\n  Finally, Ms. Mao stated:\n\n       My conscience was always gnawing at my heart.\n\n  You see, because the official religion of the Chinese Government is \natheism, as it is with all Communist regimes, their policies and \nofficials do not have to answer to any higher power except to the \nstate. There is no sense of morality behind their Government's \ndecisionmaking process.\n  But let me ask a very poignant question. Is there a sense of our \nmorality to ignore it? What does it say about our morality to say we \nwill sell corn and wheat and make a profit and ignore this? Why not \nsay: Stop this and we will sell you the corn and the wheat? Isn't that \nbetter? Aren't we supposed to be the moral leader?\n  When God is absent, human life is invaluable, isn't it? It does not \nhave much meaning because we are children under God. If you do not \nbelieve that, then life has no meaning other than how it exists here on \nthis Earth.\n  That is why you have forced abortions. That is why you have \npersecution. That is why you have guns pointed at students' heads. That \nis why you have tanks poised to run over protesters.\n  That is why you have harvested organs. I talked about that this \nmorning in my amendment, I say to Senator Helms, which got 29 votes, \nincluding the Senator's, for which I am very grateful. They also do \nthat. That is another issue. China harvests organs--not from willing \ndonors--from prisoners who sometimes do nothing more than protest \nagainst the state. They are executed by being shot in the head, and \nthen organs are taken and sold for $30,000 apiece for a kidney, and the \nmoney is given to the Chinese military.\n  We lost on that amendment, I say to Senator Helms, by a vote of 60-\nsomething to 29. What does that say? That we are unwilling to send this \nback to the House for 5 or 10 minutes in conference and pass it?\n  That is why I am strongly supporting this amendment by Senator Helms. \nI am proud to support this amendment. I am proud to stand here on the \nfloor of the Senate and say that this is wrong.\n\n[[Page S8474]]\n\nSometimes you have to say things whether you win the debate or not. \nSometimes it does not matter whether you win the debate or not; it is \njust having the debate that matters.\n  His amendment would encourage the Chinese Government to stop this \natrocity, to stop this barbaric act, to stop forcing abortion on unborn \nchildren and forcing women to have those abortions.\n  It is not unreasonable to ask my colleagues to support this amendment \nwhich is vital to human rights in China. It is vital to the rights of a \nwoman and it is vital to the rights of a child.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe remarks from Harry Wu on forced abortions in China.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Forced Abortion and Sterilization in China--The View from Inside\n\n\n                        A Burgeoning Population\n\n       It has been over twenty years since the People's Republic \n     of China, which has 22% of the world's population, began \n     implementing its population-control policy, or planned birth \n     policy in mainland China. In the years following the 1949 \n     victory of the Communist Party in the PRC, Communist leader \n     Mao Zedong promoted population growth, regarding a large \n     population as an asset for both production and security. In \n     the most recent decades, as the focus of the Chinese \n     government has shifted towards economic development, the \n     Communist government has taken to blaming the cultural \n     traditions of its own people for the population explosion. \n     The need to promote growth and combat the traditions of large \n     families became justifications for one of the most barbaric \n     abuses of government power ever revealed: the infamous ``one \n     child'' policy.\n       Since 1979 when the population-control policy was first \n     implemented, it has been a top-down system of control: the \n     central government establishes general policy guidelines, and \n     local governments institute and enforce specific directives \n     and regulations to meet these guidelines. In addition to the \n     original one-child policy itself, the Marriage Law of 1980 \n     requires the practice of family planning. The law encourages \n     the policy of late marriage and late birth, and sets the \n     minimum marriage age at 22 years of age for men and 20 years \n     of age for women. Provincial regulations enacted in the \n     eighties established artificial quotas, which planned birth \n     cadres were to enforce strictly. Leaders in Jiangxi, Yunnan, \n     Fujian, and Shaanxi provinces, for example, received orders \n     to strictly limit the number of births in excess of their \n     authorized targets by forcing women to have abortions, \n     euphemistically referred to as ``taking remedial measures.''\n       In May of 1991, the Chinese Communist Party Central \n     Committee enacted the ``Decision to Intensify Planned-Birth \n     Work and Strictly Control Population Growth.'' This policy \n     paper contains provisions suggesting the use of IUD's, \n     sterilization, and pregnancy termination in some \n     circumstances. In all, the policy aims to create a greater \n     uniformity between central and provincial family planning and \n     laws. While there have been alternate tightenings and \n     relaxations of the policy, evidence brought to light at \n     the June 10, 1998 hearing before the House Subcommittee \n     and International Operations and Human Rights revealed \n     that the coercive practices first implemented in the \n     eighties persist to this day. Never before has this system \n     been exposed to the world in its entirely. In fact, up \n     until this point, the Chinese government has been \n     internationally applauded for its effective population \n     control efforts. The Chinese government has always \n     insisted that it uses only voluntary methods for \n     controlling the amount of children born into Chinese \n     families. Unfortunately, the evidence repeatedly \n     contradicts this empty assertion.\n\n\n                   china's population policy exposed\n\n       Gao Xiao Duan, a former cadre in a planned-birth office in \n     Yonghe Town in Fujian Province, testified before the House of \n     Representatives Subcommittee on International Operations and \n     Human Rights on June 10, 1998, and exposed the system of \n     oppression before a packed hearing room. Gao, still Chinese \n     citizen, was employed as an administrator at the Yonghe town \n     planned-birth, where her job was to ``work out and implement \n     concrete measures pursuant to the documents of the Central \n     Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the State \n     Council on planned-birth.'' In other words, she was to carry \n     out the dictates of the communist regime in accordance with \n     the ``One child'' policy. Her day-to-day duties were as \n     follows:\n       To establish a computer data bank of all women of child-\n     bearing age in the town (10,000+ women), including their \n     dates of birth, marriages, children, contraceptive ring \n     insertions, pregnancies, abortions, child-bearing \n     capabilities, menstruation schedule, etc.\n       To issue ``birth allowance'' certificates to women who met \n     the policy and regulations of the central and provincial \n     planned-birth committees, and are therefore allowed to give \n     birth to children. Without this certificate, women are not \n     allowed to give birth to children. Should a woman be found to \n     be pregnant without a certificate, abortion surgery is \n     performed immediately, regardless of how many months she is \n     pregnant.\n       To issue ``birth-not-allowed notices.'' Such notices are \n     sent to couples when the data concludes that they do not meet \n     the requirements of the policy, and are therefore not allowed \n     to give birth. Such notices are made public, and the purpose \n     of this is to make it know to everyone that the couple is in \n     violation of the policy, therefore facilitating supervision \n     of the couple.\n       To issue ``birth control measures implementation notices.'' \n     According to their specific data, every woman of child-\n     bearing age is notified that she has to have contraceptive \n     device reliability and pregnancy examinations when necessary. \n     Should she fail to present herself in a timely manner for \n     these examinations, she will not only be forced to pay a \n     monetary penalty, but the supervision team will apprehend her \n     and force her to have such examinations.\n       To impose monetary penalties on those who violate the \n     provincial regulations. Should they refuse to pay these \n     penalties, the supervision team members will apprehend and \n     detail them as long as they do not pay.\n       To supervise ``go-to-the-countryside cadres.'' The \n     municipal planned-birth committee often sends cadres from \n     other areas to villages, for fear that local cadres could \n     cooperate with villagers, or that a local backlash would \n     develop against the cadres who conscientiously carry out \n     their duties.\n       To write monthly ``synopses of planned-birth reports,'' \n     which are signed by the town head and the town communist \n     party, and then are submitted to the municipal people's \n     government and the communist party committee. They wait for \n     cadres for superior government organs to check their work at \n     any time.\n       To analyze informant materials submitted in accordance with \n     the ``informing system,'' and then put these cases on file \n     for investigation. Some materials are not conclusive, but \n     planned-birth cadres are responsible for their villages, and \n     to avoid being punished by their superiors and to receive the \n     bonuses promised for meeting planned-birth goals. The cadres \n     are under tremendous pressure from the central and \n     provisional regulations to carry out the policy. Even if the \n     cadres brutally infringe on human rights, there has never \n     been evidence of cadres being punished for their actions.\n       Whenever the planned-birth office calls for organizing \n     ``planned-birth supervision teams,'' the town head and \n     communist party committee secretary will immediately order \n     all organizations--public security, court, finance, economy--\n     to select cadres and organize them into teams. They are then \n     sent to villages, either for routine door-to-door checking or \n     for punishing of local violators. Supervision teams are \n     makeshift, and to avoid leaks, cadres do not know the village \n     to which they will be sent until the last minute. Planned-\n     birth supervision teams usually exercise night raids, \n     encircling suspected households with lighting speed. Should \n     they fail to apprehend a woman violator, they may take her \n     husband, brother(s), or parent(s) in lieu of the woman \n     herself, and detain them in the planned-birth office's \n     detention room until the woman surrenders. They then would \n     perform a sterilization or abortion surgery on the woman \n     violator.\n       Gao also outlined several policies that are carried out in \n     the wake of ``planned-birth supervision''.\n       House dismantling. No document explicitly allows \n     dismantling of a violator's house. To the best of her \n     knowledge, however, this practice not only exits in Fujian \n     Province, but in rural areas of other provinces as well.\n       Apprehending and detaining violators. Most planned-birth \n     offices in Fujian Province's rural areas have their own \n     detention facilities. In her town, the facility is right next \n     door to her office. It has one room for males and one room \n     for females, each with a capacity of about 25-30 people. To \n     arrest and detain violators, the planned-birth office does \n     not need any consent by judicial or public security \n     institutions, because their actions are independent of those \n     organizations.\n       Detainees pay Y8.00 per day for food. They are not allowed \n     to make phone calls, or to mail letters. The majority of \n     detainees are, of course, either women who are pregnant \n     without ``birth allowance certificates,'' women who are to be \n     sterilized, or women who have been slapped with monetary \n     penalties. As stated previously, if they do not apprehend the \n     women themselves, they detain their family members until the \n     women agree to the sterilization and abortion surgeries.\n       Sterilization. The proportion of women sterilized after \n     giving birth is extraordinarily high. Sterilization can be \n     replaced with a ``joint pledge,'' with 5 guarantors jointly \n     pledging that the woman in case shall not be pregnant again. \n     Much of the time, however, this kind of arrangement is \n     impossible, because five people are unlikely to be willing to \n     take on the liability of having to guarantee that a woman \n     will not become pregnant. It is important to remember that if \n     she does, by some chance, become pregnant, they are \n     responsible for her actions, too.\n       Abortion. According to government regulations, abortion for \n     a pregnancy under 3 months is deemed ``artificial abortion,'' \n     and if the pregnancy exceeds three months, it is\n\n[[Page S8475]]\n\n     called ``induced delivery.'' In her town, an average of 10-15 \n     abortion surgeries are performed monthly, and of those \n     surgeries, one third are for pregnancies exceeding 3 months.\n       Every month her town prepares a report, the ``synopsis of \n     planned-birth report.'' It enumerates in great detail the \n     amount of births, issuing of birth-allowed certificates, and \n     implementation of birth-control measures in Yonghe Town; \n     Following its completion, it is submitted to the planned-\n     birth committee. For instance, in January-September 1996, of \n     all the women of child bearing age with 1 child, 1,633 \n     underwent device-insertion surgeries, or underwent \n     subcutaneous-device-insertion surgeries, and 207 underwent \n     sterilization surgeries; of women of child-bearing age with 2 \n     children, 3,889 underwent sterilization surgeries, 167 \n     underwent device-insertion surgeries, and 10 took birth-\n     control medications (among the group with 2 children, of the \n     186 women who had 2 daughters, 170 were sterilized). In \n     January-September 1996, a total of 757 surgeries in five \n     categories were performed. They included: 256 sterilization \n     surgeries (35 for two daughters), 386 device-insertion \n     surgeries (23 cervical ring insertions), 3 subcutaneous-\n     device-insertions, 41 artificial abortion surgeries, and 71 \n     induced delivery surgeries. In the first half of the year of \n     1997, a total of 389 surgeries in 5 categories were \n     performed. They included: 101 sterilization surgeries (12 for \n     two daughters), 27 induced delivery surgeries, 228 device-\n     insertion surgeries, and 33 artificial abortion surgeries. \n     Gao's office had to submit all of this data to the municipal \n     planned-birth committee monthly and annually so that it could \n     be kept on file.\n\n\n                        personal tales of sorrow\n\n       Gao and her husband were married in 1983, and gave birth to \n     their daughter one year later. Despite their desire to have \n     more children, they were not allowed to give birth to a \n     second child due to the planned-birth policy. In late 1993, \n     Gao and her husband adopted a boy from Harbin, a province in \n     northeast China. They had no choice but to keep him in \n     someone else's home. For fear of being informed against by \n     others in the town, the child never referred to Gao as \n     ``mama'' in the presence of outsiders. Whenever government \n     agencies conducted door-to-door checks, her son had to hide \n     elsewhere.\n       Her elder sister and her elder brother's wife have only two \n     daughters each. Both of them were sterilized, their health \n     ruined, making it impossible for them to ever live or work \n     normally.\n       During her 14-year tenure in the planned-birth office, she \n     witnessed how many men and women were persecuted by the \n     Chinese communist government for violating its ``planned-\n     birth policy.'' Many women were crippled for life, and many \n     were victims of mental disorders as a result of their \n     unwanted abortions. Families were ruined or destroyed. Gao, \n     with tears streaming down her face, told during her testimony \n     of how her conscience was always gnawing at her heart.\n       She vividly recalled how she once led her subordinates to \n     Yinglin Town Hospital to check on births. She found that two \n     women in Zhoukeng Town had extra-plan births. In a move \n     approved by the head of the town, she led a planned-birth \n     supervision team composed of a dozen cadres and public \n     security agents. Sledge hammers and heavy crowbars in hand, \n     they went to Zhoukeng Town, and dismantled the women's \n     houses. Unable to apprehend the women in the case, they took \n     their mothers and detained them in the planned-birth office's \n     detention facility. It was not until a month and a half later \n     that the women surrendered themselves to the planned-birth \n     office, where they were quickly sterilized and monetary \n     penalties were imposed. Gao spoke at length about how she \n     thought she was conscientiously implementing the policy of \n     the ``dear Party,'' and that she was just being an exemplary \n     cadre.\n       Once Gao found a woman who was nine months pregnant, but \n     did not have a birth-allowed certificate. According to the \n     policy, she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery. In the \n     operation room, she saw the aborted child's lips sucking, its \n     limbs stretching. A physician injected poison into its skull, \n     the child died, and it was thrown into the trash can. ``To \n     help a tyrant do evils'' was not what she wanted.\n       Also testifying at the hearing was Zhou Shiu Yon, a victim \n     of the Chinese planned-birth policy. Zhou, who had known her \n     boyfriend since childhood, became pregnant at age nineteen. \n     She did not have a birth allowance certificate, so her \n     pregnancy was considered illegal. When she became ill and was \n     hospitalized, it was discovered that she was pregnant, she \n     had her boyfriend pay the nurse to leave the window open; she \n     jumped out, and her boyfriend was waiting with a car to flee \n     to Guangzhou where they boarded a boat to the United States. \n     On the boat, Zhou became extraordinarily seasick, and had \n     complications with her pregnancy. Once in the United States, \n     she lost her baby while being treated in a San Diego \n     hospital. Now, she is unsure of whether or not she will ever \n     be able to have children again. Stories like hers are all too \n     common in China today. Congressman Christopher Smith of New \n     Jersey, chair of the subcommittee, said that the Chinese \n     policy is ``so vile that [it] will cause people to recoil in \n     horror across the centuries.''\n\n\n                     The Population Policy Analyzed\n\n       I testified at the hearing to show how the Chinese policy \n     is truly a top-down system. For many years I have collected \n     many stories about the tragic experiences of people who are \n     affected by the planned-birth policy. Their personal \n     experiences may be more emotionally shocking, but I want to \n     explain China's internal documents that I have collected over \n     the years. The basic arguments for China's population policy \n     are:\n       China's living and land resources are limited, which \n     tremendously impedes its development, added to which is \n     population growth. To become a prosperous nation, China must \n     control its population growth.\n       Limited economic resources and overpopulation cause \n     disruption of education, the environment, health services, \n     and negatively affect quality of life issues in China.\n       In short, the Chinese government wishes people, especially \n     Chinese citizens, to believe that overpopulation makes China \n     a backward nation, and that controlling it will allow them to \n     develop as a nation. Such a point of view is preposterous, \n     and is countered by the following two observations:\n       Certain nations such as Japan have even more limited per \n     capita living resources than China, but are nevertheless \n     extraordinarily prosperous.\n       Is it not the lack of a rational social and economic system \n     that retarded China's development in the years following the \n     rise of the Communist Party? For several years after the 1949 \n     Communist victory, China's economy did in fact make great \n     strides--without a population control policy. Economic \n     backwardness resumed because of failed communist economic \n     experiments. After economic reforms that started in the late \n     70's under Deng, the economy has again improved. The economic \n     advances that China has made in the last two decades should \n     be attributed to economic reforms rather than to the strict \n     population policy. This is not to say that population control \n     had nothing to do with the economic growth China has \n     experienced, but it is a well-known observation that as \n     economies prosper, fertility rates decrease. This explains \n     why fertility rates have declined more naturally in the urban \n     areas of China; the relatively economically progressive \n     cities do not have to be as coercive with the policy, because \n     the couples who live there today do not wish to have as many \n     children as their rural counterparts.\n       It is the communist political and economic system that \n     makes it difficult to develop China's economy, and is the \n     fundamental reason for the contradiction between an exploding \n     population and a retarded economy. Therefore, the fundamental \n     way to solve China's population problem is to change its \n     irrational political and economic system. Planned-birth \n     targets every family, every woman.\n       If you are interested in obtaining full copies of the \n     testimonies, along with pictures and videotapes, please \n     write, call, fax, or email the Laogai Research Foundation in \n     Washington, DC. Our contact information is listed below. Help \n     us stamp out this egregious abuse of government power. \n     Millions of women and children need your support. If China \n     requires a population policy, it must be based on \n     volunteerism and education, not coercion and intimidation. To \n     give birth and plan one's family is a fundamental human \n     right, and should be deprived from no one.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                     Harry Wu,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n                                       Laogai Research Foundation.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in the remaining couple of \nmoments, I will just conclude by saying, I have been out here a number \nof times following, frankly, in the huge footsteps of Senator Helms, in \na very small way, to talk about protecting the lives of unborn \nchildren.\n  But this goes far beyond that. This debate now has taken a new level. \nIt is now forcing abortions on women against their wishes. I hope that \nsomeday Senator Helms and I, and others, will have the opportunity to \nstand here in the well and see this practice of abortion ended in this \ncountry. Because who knows what is next? If we do not respect the lives \nof our children, then what do we respect?\n  Children are a lot smarter than we give them credit for. I have \nraised three. A lot of you out there listening to me now have raised \nmore than that. They are smart. They know when you say: Johnny, go off \nto school, be a good boy today, mind your teacher--meanwhile we will \nabort your sister.\n  Forty million children have died in this country alone from abortion. \nThose 40 million children will never get to be a Senator, a spectator \nin the gallery, a mother, a pastor, a CEO. They are never going to have \nthe chance to be a page. They never had a chance, 40 million of them. \nWe did.\n  So maybe we should not be too surprised that the Senate is willing to \nlook the other way while they do it in China. We should not be real \nsurprised. But someday I pray that I will be able to stand here and say \nthank you to at least 67 of my colleagues who put a\n\n[[Page S8476]]\n\nstop to it. Maybe that day will happen some time in my lifetime. I sure \nlook forward to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4123\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's \namendment.\n  The amendment is designed to force the Secretary of Commerce to \nimpose so-called ``voluntary codes of conduct'' on American businesses \noperating in China. The fact is, if the proposed codes were truly \nvoluntary, there would be no need to compel the Secretary of Commerce \nto pressure U.S. businesses into adopting such codes.\n  More importantly, American businesses already do operate under codes \nof conduct. The most important code of conduct is, of course, U.S. law.\n  Another code of conduct American companies are bound to follow is \nlocal law, which American companies are bound to operate under when \nselling abroad.\n  In addition, U.S. companies also follow their own internal codes of \nconduct. There has been a revolution in corporate thinking over the \nlast decade about compliance issues and corporate business practices. \nAmerican business has applied the philosophy of ``best practices'' that \nbegan in the manufacturing sector, but now has also been used as a risk \nmanagement tool.\n  In other words, adopting an internal--and truly voluntary--internal \ncode of conduct has become a way of minimizing the risk, both legal and \nfinancial, that flows from some part of a company operating in a manner \nthat is at odds with the law or corporate ethical standards.\n  Bluntly, there is a reason that corporations do this and it is not \naltruism. The greatest force ensuring the adoption of these internal \ncodes of conduct is the capital markets. Poor corporate behavior, even \nif it does not violate the law, has an immediate impact on share prices \nin today's capital markets.\n  As a consequence, American businesses take their environmental and \nemployment standards with them when they operate overseas.\n  I have with me a copy of a report prepared by the Business Roundtable \nthat details precisely what American companies are doing in China in \nthe way of ``best practices'' in terms of the environment and \nemployment and other social concerns.\n  The way those companies operate is one of the primary reasons that so \nmany Chinese workers are leaving state-owned enterprises to look for \nwork with American companies in China whenever they can find the \nopportunity. Their wages, benefits and working conditions are almost \ninvariably higher than any other workplace they can find.\n  My point is that there is no need to force American companies to \nadopt so-called voluntary codes of conduct with respect to their \noperations in China. They are already providing opportunities in China \nthat confirm that there is a race to the top, not a race to the bottom, \nwhen American firms operate overseas.\n  Given the potential beneficial impact that our firms can have in \ndirect contacts with employees, other businesses in China and directly \nwith consumers under the WTO agreement, I would think we would want to \ndo everything we could to ensure that American exporters were free to \noperate in China, rather than compelling the Secretary of Commerce to \ndictate to American companies on exactly how they should conduct their \noperations in China.\n  The reason I say that and the reason I oppose this amendment and \nsupport PNTR is that each American company hiring a Chinese employee is \nsowing the seeds of political pluralism at the same time. That is \nprecisely how we can best foster both economic and peaceful political \nreform in China.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the Executive Summary \ncontained in the Business Roundtable report to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       U.S. companies with operations in China are contributing to \n     the improvement of social, labor, and environmental \n     conditions in China. By exporting to China not only their \n     products and services, but also their operating standards, \n     best business practices, values, and principles, U.S. \n     companies serve as agents of change. When U.S. companies set \n     up operations in China, they bring with them U.S. ethical and \n     managerial practices. These practices shape the way they run \n     their factories, relate to their employees, and contribute to \n     local community activities. Through these practices, U.S. \n     companies set a positive example of corporate citizenship and \n     contribute to the evolution of norms within Chinese society. \n     Indeed, many of these practices are increasingly being \n     adopted by domestic enterprises in China.\n       U.S. companies with international operations often \n     establish global business practices that are implemented in a \n     similar and appropriate way across all the countries in which \n     they operate. In pursuing such policies in China and \n     elsewhere, U.S. companies advance the cause of important \n     social, labor, environmental, and economic objectives, \n     including improved health, safety, and environmental \n     practices; consistent enforcement of high ethical standards; \n     increased compensation, training, and educational \n     opportunities for workers; accelerated market reforms; \n     transparent government regulation; and the rule of law.\n       To highlight the positive impact of U.S. companies, we have \n     compiled a sample of the best practices currently in use by \n     U.S. companies in China. Together, these practices tell a \n     remarkable story about the role of companies in China beyond \n     providing goods and services.\n       These practices span eight principal areas:\n       Ethical and responsible business behavior;\n       Corporate codes of conduct;\n       New ideas and information technology;\n       Western business practices;\n       Environmental, energy efficiency, health, and safety \n     standards;\n       Compensation, benefits, and training;\n       Volunteerism, charitable giving, and community activism; \n     and\n       Rule of law.\n\n\n  I. U.S. COMPANIES PROMOTE ETHICAL AND RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS BEHAVIOR \n     WITHIN THEIR FACILITIES AND WITH THEIR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS\n\n       U.S. companies strive to integrate their Chinese operations \n     seamlessly into their world-wide operations. They conduct \n     substantial ethical training for their employees in China, as \n     they do for their employees worldwide. This training is more \n     than simply a set of rules to follow. The training \n     concentrates on fundamental concepts such as \n     integrity, mutual respect, open communication, and \n     teamwork. And it is collaborative: company officers go on-\n     site to Chinese locations to offer guidance on compliance, \n     to listen to employees' concerns, and to observe the \n     practices in use. In addition, to facilitate candid \n     communication, the companies also have procedures for \n     employees to communicate with management confidentially.\n\n\n  ii. u.s. companies uphold comprehensive corporate codes of business \n                           conduct and ethics\n\n       These corporate codes cover an array of topics, from \n     managing supplier relationships, to protecting the \n     environment, abiding by antibribery laws, supporting equal \n     employment opportunity, and offering job advancement based on \n     merit. The codes are translated into local languages, and as \n     with ethics training, companies back up these codes with \n     programs to ensure compliance. For example, companies conduct \n     ethical renewal workshops to keep concepts fresh in \n     employees' minds, keep employees current with revisions to \n     the code, and underscore the importance of compliance.\n\n\n iii. u.s. companies contribute to a more open chinese society through \n      the introduction and dissemination of ideas and information \n                              technologies\n\n       By giving Chinese employees and consumers access to \n     information technology, U.S. companies are giving individual \n     Chinese citizens the opportunity to communicate with people \n     inside and outside China, in the United States and in the \n     rest of the world. U.S. companies are exposing Chinese \n     citizens to new information, ideas, values, and behavior. \n     They do so by giving their employees in China access to the \n     Internet, Chinese-language web pages, and worldwide e-mail, \n     which allow them to exchange information with people around \n     the world instantaneously. U.S. companies provide access to \n     international business, political, and financial news. They \n     also sponsor employee newsletters to exchange information \n     among sites across China. In addition, U.S. companies expose \n     Chinese government officials to new ideas, such as through \n     informal roundtable discussions with officials in Chinese \n     ministries to exchange ideas and experiences.\n\n\n  iv. u.s. companies accelerate exposure to, and adoption of, western \n                        best business practices\n\n       U.S. companies accelerate adoption of Western business \n     practices in two ways: by--\n\n[[Page S8477]]\n\n     bringing Chinese professionals to the United States to see \n     the practices in action, and by bringing the practices to \n     China to show them in action there. Accordingly, U.S. \n     companies support substantial foreign travel by their Chinese \n     employees, as well as Chinese officials, to give them direct \n     exposure to market economy forces and Western social and \n     political structures. U.S. companies with operations in China \n     send literally thousands of their employees, Chinese \n     officials, and students to the United States every year. \n     And these visitors spend a substantial stay in the United \n     States, from several weeks to as much as six months. They \n     come to the United States to see U.S. practices first-\n     hand--touring factories and offices across the United \n     States. They also visit Washington, D.C. to observe our \n     democratic political process and meet with Members of \n     Congress and other government officials. For many of the \n     Chinese visitors, this trip is not only their first trip \n     to the United States, it is also their first opportunity \n     to travel outside China.\n       In addition, U.S. companies teach global workforce, \n     management, and manufacturing principles to all of their \n     employees in China. This training is a comprehensive, \n     ``hands-on'' experience which covers principles and practices \n     such as participative management, empowered workforce, \n     employee teaming, total quality management, and just-in-time \n     systems. Chinese managers also receive training in \n     fundamental market economics, and cutting-edge management \n     practices; some even receive Western MBAs through these \n     programs. And to further exposure to Western business \n     practices, U.S. companies in China organize symposia on \n     economics, finance, management and other business topics. \n     These symposia bring Chinese professionals in contact with \n     Americans and other foreigners from a wide array of \n     corporations, academia, government, and other institutions to \n     exchange ideas and experiences.\n\n\nV. U.S. Companies Provide for and Promote Higher Environmental, Energy \nEfficiency, Health, and Safety Standards within Their Facilities and in \n             the Communities in Which They Operate in China\n\n       U.S. companies apply, and achieve, higher environmental, \n     energy efficiency, health, and safety standards than Chinese-\n     owned factories achieve--higher even than Chinese law \n     requires. U.S. multinational companies set worldwide \n     operating principles for their international facilities, \n     including China, and these principles are based on U.S. \n     standards. By setting an example of exceeding the Chinese \n     standards, U.S. companies put pressure on domestic Chinese \n     enterprises to comply with these higher, international \n     standards. And U.S. companies not only bring higher \n     standards, they bring the technology to meet these higher \n     standards, by providing advanced environmental protection and \n     energy efficiency technology and by sponsoring environmental \n     protection symposia in China to exchange information about \n     these standards and how to meet them. Finally, by creating \n     jobs and raising living standards in China, U.S. companies \n     are creating the wealth necessary to help China pay for \n     higher environmental, worker safety, and energy efficiency \n     standards.\n\n\nVI. U.S. Companies Provide Desirable Employment Alternatives to Chinese \n   Workers, Including Enhanced Compensation, Benefits, and Training \n          Opportunities for Advancement on the Basis of Merit\n\n       U.S. companies are raising the bar for employment \n     opportunities. They provide enhanced compensation and \n     benefits, sponsor on-going training opportunities, and \n     offer advancement on the basis of merit. U.S. companies \n     pay their Chinese employees substantially higher wages \n     than Chinese-owned firms do. In addition, U.S. companies \n     offer forward-looking benefits programs, such as subsidies \n     to encourage home ownership, and on-site day care. \n     Companies also offer performance-linked rewards systems \n     and incentives for good safety practices. Together, these \n     benefits lead to low employment turnover rates.\n       U.S. companies also offer comprehensive technical training. \n     They have technical training centers located throughout \n     China, some so comprehensive that the companies call them \n     their corporate ``university.'' Many companies establish \n     minimum training hours for each worker per year, which they \n     offer substantially exceed. In addition, companies offer \n     scholarships to students at China's leading universities to \n     ensure that the next generation of Chinese workers has the \n     technical skills necessary to succeed in a more competitive \n     workplace.\n\n\n  vii. u.s. companies export u.s. concepts of volunteerism charitable \n                     giving, and community activism\n\n       U.S. companies in China are setting an example of \n     volunteerism and community activism. They have donated \n     millions of dollars to support a variety of charitable causes \n     in China including scholarships for students to attend \n     university, donations to flood victims, medical care for \n     children, and support for primary education in rural \n     districts. These funds empower local communities, and \n     individuals, to work toward improving their own \n     circumstances. Company volunteers add a human link, through \n     tutoring and mentoring programs.\n\n\n viii. u.s. companies support advancement of the rule of law in china \n                   and effective enforcement measures\n\n       U.S. companies have taken an active role in encouraging and \n     developing the rule of law in China. They have been working \n     with Chinese officials to develop new laws governing property \n     rights, taxation, corporations, and other commercial areas. \n     Industry-by-industry, they provide expertise and set an \n     example of how to operate successfully while respecting the \n     rule of law.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       While this summary gives some flavor of the practices in \n     place by U.S. companies, the real story is in the details. We \n     encourage you to take a look at the full paper, which \n     provides a unique opportunity to see the steps being taken by \n     individual companies.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have what I think is pretty good news for \nmy colleagues in the Senate and for the administration which I would \nlike to share and which relates directly to the legislation pending \nbefore us.\n  I believe that by this time next week, the Senate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair inquires about whose time the \nSenator is using.\n  Mr. KYL. I presumed I would be using time on the majority. I inquire \nof the Chair, am I correct that Senator Feingold was to speak at 4 \no'clock and prior to that time there would be time I could use on this \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We don't have an order for Senator Feingold. \nWe simply want to know whose time the Senator is using.\n  Mr. KYL. If I may take the majority time, I don't need unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may do so.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, the point is that we are going to be considering PNTR \nfor China, which will enable China to join the World Trade Organization \nwithin the week, and presumably that will be done in accordance with \nthe bill passed by the House of Representatives.\n  It is important that we ensure the other party to this equation is \ntaken care of because there don't appear to be any more roadblocks to \nthe Senate's consideration of PNTR and China's entry into the body from \na legislative perspective. But there could have been.\n  It is also important that Taiwan enter into the WTO. I believe \nvirtually every Senator and every Member of the other body is committed \nto that. I know the administration is committed to that. But there \ncould have been a roadblock to China's PNTR and WTO accession had we \nnot clarified something with respect to Taiwan.\n  It has been agreed since 1993 that Taiwan would enter the WTO. It has \nbeen virtually ready to do so. But out of deference to China and to \nensure China could enter first and then Taiwan second, Taiwan's entry \nhas been delayed. But we believe neither China nor anyone else in the \nworld would object to Taiwan's entry into the WTO, and indeed the \nworking group that deals with the specifics of Taiwan's entry I think \nis in very good shape.\n  There has been a commitment by the administration to ensure that when \nthe Senate and the House have approved PNTR for China, the United \nStates can therefore move forward with China's accession and that we do \nso with respect to Taiwan as well. Unfortunately, however, since the \nHouse acted, there has been an unfortunate string of comments made by \nhigh Chinese officials that have cast some doubt on whether or not \nChina would make good on its commitment to support Taiwan's accession \ninto the WTO.\n  While the leaders of China had said they would support Taiwan's \nentry, they said it must be under terms provided by China. \nSpecifically, that meant it had to be Taiwan entering the WTO as a \nprovince of China. That, of course, is contrary to the agreement that \nheretofore had been worked out, contrary to all the wishes of the \nmembers of the working study group and the United States, and of course \nTaiwan.\n  The administration has taken a firm position that they will not \nsupport that kind of language; that Taiwan must come in as a separate \ncustoms territory or separate trading territory and not as a province \nof China.\n\n[[Page S8478]]\n\n  This has been enough of a matter of concern--these statements made by \nChinese leaders--that we sought assurances from the administration and \nhad meetings with administration officials to clarify. Specifically, a \ngroup of Senators met with Charlene Barshefsky to inquire about the \nstatus of the matter, particularly since Jiang Zemin is quoted as \nhaving made statements in New York a few days ago that China would only \nagree to Taiwan's entry under this term expressing Taiwan as a province \nof China.\n  I will have printed in the Record some items. One is a Wall Street \nJournal lead editorial from yesterday in which the Wall Street Journal \nnotes:\n\n       Addressing a business group during his visit to New York \n     for the United Nations summit, Mr. Jiang said of course \n     Taiwan could join the WTO, but only as part of China.\n\n  The editorial goes on to note that is unacceptable to the United \nStates, and that the Senate needed to act with respect thereto.\n  Ms. Barshefsky confirmed that President Clinton told Jiang that \nTaiwan would have to come in under the terms originally negotiated, not \nas a province of China. Jiang responded with the Chinese position, and \nthe President then responded with the U.S. position again. The \ncontroversy, in other words, was not put to bed.\n  Earlier, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuxi is reported to \nhave said: The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position. Taiwan \ncan join WTO as a separate customs territory of China.\n  These comments, of course, are of concern to us. The House has \nalready acted to approve PNTR, but you now have high Chinese officials \nsaying Taiwan's accession must be as a province to China, contrary to \nthe position of the working group, of the United States, of Taiwan. As \na result, we thought something had to be done to clarify this.\n  Some time ago, a group of 40 Senators had written to the President \nand asked for his assurances that he would support Taiwan's entry into \nthe WTO simultaneous with that of mainland China. In a letter to me and \nto other Senators, dated August 31, the President said:\n\n       China has made clear. . . that it will not oppose Taiwan's \n     accession to the World Trade Organization.\n       Nevertheless, China did submit proposed language to their \n     working party stating Taiwan is a separate customs territory \n     of China. We have advised the Chinese that such language is \n     inappropriate and irrelevant to the work of the working party \n     and that we will not accept it. We believe that this position \n     is widely shared by other WTO members.\n\n  When we met with Ms. Barshefsky yesterday, we noted other statements \nhave been made and clearly some action needed to be taken by the United \nStates to make it crystal clear that we would not approve PNTR with \nthis issue outstanding. I prepared an amendment and filed it with the \nclerk. I have not offered it yet, but that amendment would have made it \nvery clear our approval of PNTR was subject to Taiwan acceding to WTO \nmembership under the original terms negotiated--not as a separate \nprovince of China. The administration strongly opposes any amendments \nbeing attached to PNTR because of its concern that the House of \nRepresentatives would not, a second time, pass the legislation, and, as \na result, inquired whether other kinds of assurances would suffice in \nlieu of action by the Senate on this matter.\n\n  We indicated our purpose was not to try to derail the PNTR but rather \nto have an assurance that the administration would insist upon the \nentry of Taiwan under the original terms and that it would not allow \nentry by China and not entry by Taiwan in the appropriate way.\n  A day later, yesterday, the President sent a letter to the majority \nleader, with copies to those who had been in the meeting, dated \nSeptember 12, in which the President advises the leader on two matters \npending. One was the Thompson amendment dealt with earlier today, but \nthe other was the matter that we discussed, and as I understand it, \nthis was explicitly inserted in the letter to provide the assurance \nthat we had requested the day before.\n  Let me quote from the President, indicate what I think this means, \nwhy it is important, and why as a result it will not be necessary to \nproceed with the amendment which I filed earlier.\n  The President says:\n\n       There should be no question that my Administration is \n     firmly committed to Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I \n     reiterated in my September 8 meeting with President Jiang \n     Zemin. Based on our New York discussions with the Chinese, I \n     am confident we have a common understanding that both China \n     and Taiwan will be invited to accede to the WTO at the same \n     WTO General Council session, and that Taiwan will join the \n     WTO under the language agreed to in 1992, namely as the \n     Separate Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and \n     Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese Taipei''). The United States \n     will not accept any other outcome.\n\n  That is important because the President of the United States has \ndefined exactly the appropriate language for Taiwan's accession to WTO \nas a separate customs territory of Taiwan, not as the Chinese had been \ninsisting, as a province of China. And the President notes, and I again \nquote the last sentence: ``The United States will not accept any other \noutcome.''\n  I can't think of a clearer statement by the President of the United \nStates that we will insist upon Taiwan's accession under appropriate \nterms--those specifically identified here--and, at the same time, that \nChina is admitted to the WTO. In my view, this provides the necessary \nassurance that the President, those working on his behalf, will see to \nit that this is done in a proper way. As a result, it seems to me \nunnecessary to pursue the amendment which I had earlier filed.\n  As a result, I spoke with Senator Murkowski, Senator Helms, Senator \nSessions, Senator Roth, and others who I thought were interested in the \nissue. They have all concurred that this language is sufficient, and as \na result I will not be offering the amendment.\n  I applaud the President's action in this regard. I appreciate the \naction of Ms. Barshefsky and her counsel, and certainly reiterate my \nintention of working with the administration on this important matter. \nOf course, Taiwan represents an extraordinarily important trading \npartner for the United States and a very good ally, an ally of which we \nneed to continue to be supportive.\n  I will identify specifically the documents I will have printed in the \nRecord at this time. First, a letter to me from the President of the \nUnited States dated August 31; second, a letter to the majority leader \nfrom the President of the United States dated September 12; third, a \nWall Street Journal editorial dated September 12; fourth, a letter a \ngroup of Senators had sent to the President initially dated July 27, \n2000; and finally, a copy of an AP story I quoted from earlier, the \nheadline of which is ``China Asserts Claim Over Taiwan,'' dated \nSeptember 7, 2000. I ask unanimous consent to have these documents \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, August 31, 2000.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     Taiwan's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). My \n     administration remains firmly committed to the goal of WTO \n     General Council approval of the accession packages for China \n     and Taiwan at the same session. This goal is widely shared by \n     other key WTO members.\n       China has made clear on many occasions, and at high levels, \n     that it will not oppose Taiwan's accession to the WTO. \n     Nevertheless, China did submit proposed language to their \n     working party stating that Taiwan is a separate customs \n     territory of China. We have advised the Chinese that such \n     language is inappropriate and irrelevant to the work of the \n     working party and that we will not accept it. We believe that \n     this position is widely shared by other WTO members.\n       Again, thank you for writing concerning this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 12, 2000.\n     Hon.Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader: I want to commend you for commencing \n     debate on H.R. 4444, which would extend Permanent Normal \n     Trade Relations to the People's Republic of China. This \n     crucial legislation will help ensure our economic prosperity, \n     reinforce our work on human rights, and enhances our national \n     security.\n\n[[Page S8479]]\n\n       Normalizing our trade relationship with China will allow \n     American workers, farmers, and businesspeople to benefit from \n     increased access to the Chinese market. It will also give us \n     added tools to promote increased openness and change in \n     Chinese society, and increase our ability to work with China \n     across the road range of our mutual interests.\n       I want to address two specific areas that I understand may \n     be the subject of debate in the Senate. One is Taiwan's \n     accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). There should \n     be no question that my Administration is firmly committed to \n     Taiwan's accession to the WTO, a point I reiterated in my \n     September 8 meeting with President Jiang Zemin. Based on our \n     New York discussions with the Chinese, I am confident we have \n     a common understanding that both China and Taiwan will be \n     invited to accede to the WTO at the same WTO General Council \n     session, and that Taiwan will join the WTO under the language \n     agreed to in 1992, namely as the Separate Customs Territory \n     of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu (referred to as ``Chinese \n     Taipei''). The United States will not accept any other \n     outcome.\n       The other area is nonproliferation, specifically the \n     proposals embodied in an amendment offered by Senator Fred \n     Thompson. Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction and the means to deliver them is a key goal of my \n     Administration. However, I believe this amendment is unfair \n     and unnecessary, and would hurt our nonproliferation efforts.\n       Nonproliferation has been a priority in our dealing with \n     China. We have pressed China successfully to join the Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the \n     Biological Weapons Convention, and the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty, and to cease cooperation with Iran's nuclear program. \n     Today, we are seeking further restraints, but these efforts \n     would be subverted--and existing progress could be reversed--\n     by this mandatory sanctions bill which would single out \n     companies based on an unreasonably low standard of suspicion, \n     instead of proof. It would apply a different standard for \n     some countries than others, undermining our global leadership \n     on nonproliferation. Automatic sanctions, such as cutting off \n     dual-use exports to China, would hurt American workers and \n     companies. Other sanctions, such as restricting access to \n     U.S. capital markets, could harm our economy by undermining \n     confidence in our markets. I believe this legislation would \n     do more harm than good.\n       The American people are counting on the Congress to pass \n     H.R. 4444. I urge you and your colleagues to complete action \n     on the bill as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Wall Street Journal, September 12, 2000]\n\n                        Jiang Muddies the Waters\n\n       Chinese President Jiang Zemin is nothing if not a gambler. \n     Just days before this week's crucial U.S. Senate vote on \n     granting China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) with \n     the U.S. Mr. Jiang raised an issue that will have many \n     Senators seeing red. He said, in effect, that Taiwan should \n     not be admitted to the World Trade Organization on any \n     conditions other than those set by Beijing.\n       Addressing a business group during his visit to New York \n     for the United Nations summit, Mr. Jiang said that of course \n     Taiwan could join the WTO, but only as a part of China. Now, \n     this statement is subject to various interpretations, and \n     some might say it is only semantics. But many Senators will \n     want to know whether they are being asked to approve PNTR \n     under conditions laid down solely by China, with little \n     regard for U.S. interests.\n       We have argued here that granting China PNTR as a prelude \n     to China's admission to the WTO is a good idea. It would open \n     China further to Western trade and investment, hastening the \n     development in China of free enterprise and a propertied \n     middle class. A more enlightened and influential electorate \n     will gradually demand more explicit civil rights and require \n     governments at all levels to become more responsive to the \n     wishes of the people.\n       But we also have supported the right of the Taiwanese, who \n     already have a functioning democracy, to chart their own \n     course toward better relations with the mainland, without \n     undue pressure from Beijing. This attitude toward Taiwan is \n     shared by an influential bloc in Congress that won't \n     appreciate Mr. Jiang laying down conditions for Taiwan's WTO \n     membership. It is well known in Congress that Taiwan \n     qualified, in a technical sense, for membership a long time \n     ago. It was thought that Taiwanese membership was an implicit \n     part of the deal that grants China PNTR.\n       If there has been a dangerous misunderstanding here, it is \n     largely Bill Clinton's fault. On his visit to China in 1998 \n     he imprudently agreed to what the Chinese government called \n     the ``Three No's.'' At the root of these three demands was \n     the requirement that the U.S. not grant Taiwan admission to \n     any world body that required statehood as a condition of \n     membership. While that didn't specifically apply to the WTO, \n     Mr. Clinton's agreement was tantamount to allowing China to \n     set the conditions for future Western policy toward Taiwan. \n     It came close to an acknowledgement that Taiwan is a Chinese \n     province.\n       So now Mr. Jiang feels emboldened to come to the U.S. and \n     give speeches implying that Taiwan must accept China as it \n     parent if it wants to get the same trading privileges that \n     the Senate is about to grant to China. No doubt Mr. Jiang was \n     inspired by other recent U.S. concessions.\n       For example, because of Chinese objections, the Dalai Lama \n     was not allowed to participate in the religious gathering \n     that preceded the summit. China's harsh control of Tibet, \n     like its hoped-for acquisition of Taiwan, is seen by Beijing \n     as nobody else's business, and one might easily get the \n     impression that the Clinton Administration agrees.\n       Given all the kow-towing that Bill Clinton has done, not to \n     mention the China angle in the Clinton-Gore campaign fund-\n     raising scandals, it was no surprise that the Chinese \n     president treated him with some disdain when the two sat \n     down for a chat last Friday. Mr. Clinton, in yet another \n     concession to China, had just announced that his \n     Administration would make no further efforts to build a \n     national missile defense. When Mr. Clinton raised the \n     issue of missiles as a threat to Western security, Mr. \n     Jiang responded with silence. And when Taiwan came up, he \n     favored Mr. Clinton with a long monologue laying out \n     China's historical claims to Taiwan. In short, Mr. Clinton \n     got a cold shoulder on both of these important issues.\n       These are the fruits of a Clinton policy that has, in \n     effect, left Taiwan blowing in the wind. Try as he may now, \n     Mr. Clinton is hard pressed to put a positive spin on his \n     China legacy. The nuclear proliferation issues that have \n     bedeviled Sino-U.S. relations since he took office in 1993 \n     remain essentially unresolved. And by violating the security \n     assurances of his Republican Party predecessors, he has left \n     his successor a tinderbox situation in the Taiwan Strait.\n       That is why Mr. Clinton knows China's accession to the WTO \n     is about much more than the mutual benefits of expanded \n     global trade. He's gambling it will head off--Communist Party \n     or no--the kind of militant Chinese nationalism that could \n     spark a shooting war across the Taiwan Strait, force a U.S. \n     military response and perhaps envelop the rest of Asia.\n       Thus, the peace dividend; within China, WTO will empower a \n     bloc of interests favoring outward-oriented growth and the \n     conditions required to secure it, including peace and the \n     rule of law. Dependent on Taiwanese and Western commerce, \n     China would reconsider military adventurism as too costly and \n     counterproductive.\n       It all sounds good. Indeed, China's membership in the WTO \n     is, in the words of one observer, the ``Rubicon of its \n     opening to the outside world,'' since all previous efforts to \n     integrate its economy with the world trading community have \n     been unsuccessful. But this assumes a lot.\n       It assumes China's behavior amid change will be \n     predictable, that it will set aside the longstanding \n     historical grievances and nationalist claims that fuel its \n     commitment to an extension of regional power in Asia through \n     the acquisition of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. \n     It assumes that, in the absence of stronger cooperative \n     security ties with Europe and Japan and deterrents such as \n     theater missile defense, future U.S. administrations will be \n     able to ``manage'' relations with China.\n       In the best of the possible worlds we imagine, \n     international economic institutions like the WTO may very \n     well help spread among some nations the practice of a \n     decentralized and pluralistic brand of governance. But trade \n     agreements and their trickle-down effects alone cannot \n     suffice for a coherent, long-term national security policy \n     that squarely faces up to the realities of America's emerging \n     strategic threats.\n       At the least the debate will serve notice that some very \n     sensible people in the Senate realize the U.S. cannot hang \n     its future security relationship with China, and Taiwan, on \n     WTO, as President Clinton seems to have done. It remains for \n     the next Administration to fix this mistake.\n       For now, WTO is the matter before the Senate. It is too bad \n     that Mr. Jiang and Mr. Clinton have gone out of their way to \n     make it difficult for Senators to vote in favor of this \n     otherwise positive step in U.S.-China relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2000.\n     President William J. Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: As the Senate nears consideration of \n     legislation extending permanent normal trade relations to the \n     People's Republic of China (PRC), we are writing to express \n     concern that Beijing may be planning to take actions that \n     would have the effect of blocking Taiwan's accession to the \n     World Trade Organization (WTO). According to press reports, \n     the PRC recently offered a proposal at the WTO calling for \n     that organization to recognize the PRC's position that Taiwan \n     is part of the mainland. Taiwan is the United States' eighth \n     largest trading partner, and we support its admission to the \n     WTO as soon as it meets the criteria for membership.\n       On several occasions, Administration officials have \n     indicated that Taiwan's accession to the WTO would closely \n     follow the PRC's. For example, in February, U.S. Trade \n     Representative Charlene Barshefsky testified to the House of \n     Representatives that ``. . . the\n\n[[Page S8480]]\n\n     only issue with respect to Taiwan's [WTO] accession . . . \n     pertains to timing . . . there is a tacit understanding . . . \n     among WTO members in general--but also, frankly, between \n     China and Taiwan--that China would enter first and China \n     would not block in any way Taiwan's accession thereafter, and \n     that might be immediately thereafter or within days or hours \n     or seconds or weeks. . . .'' Later that same month, in \n     response to a statement by Sen. Roth that ``there's a great \n     deal of concern that Taiwan might be blocked [from entering \n     the WTO] once China secures such membership,'' Ambassador \n     Barshefsky testified ``. . . the United States would do \n     everything in our power to ensure that that does not happen \n     in any respect because Taiwan's entry is also critical.''\n       We respectfully request that you clarify whether your \n     Administration continues to believe that Taiwan's entry to \n     the WTO is critical, whether you remain committed to that \n     goal, and whether you remain convinced that Taiwan will enter \n     the WTO within days after the PRC's accession. Furthermore, \n     is the Administration aware of any efforts by the PRC to \n     impose extraordinary terms and conditions on Taiwan's \n     accession to the WTO? What specific assurances has Beijing \n     provided regarding the timing and substance of Taiwan's \n     accession to the WTO? And what steps has your Administration \n     taken to ensure that Taiwan will in fact join the WTO \n     immediately following the PRC's accession?\n       We would appreciate a response to this inquiry by August \n     18, in order to consider its contents prior to Senate debate \n     on extending permanent normal trade relations to the PRC.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jon Kyl, Orrin Hatch, Larry Craig, Mike Enzi, Don \n           Nickles, Trent Lott, Bob Smith, Frank Murkowski, Conrad \n           Burns, Gordon Smith, Wayne Allard, James Inhofe, Mike \n           DeWine, Fred Thompson, Mitch McConnell, Slade Gorton, \n           Pete Domenici, Jesse Helms, Connie Mack, Tim \n           Hutchinson, Mike Crapo, Arlen Specter, Strom Thurmond, \n           Jeff Sessions, Jim Bunning, Spencer Abraham, Craig \n           Thomas, Robert Bennett, Phil Gramm, Susan Collins, Dick \n           Lugar.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 7, 2000.\n\n                    China Asserts Claim Over Taiwan\n\n       Beijing (AP).--Pushing its claim over Taiwan into complex \n     trade negotiations, Beijing insisted Thursday that the World \n     Trade Organization only admit Taiwan as a part of China.\n       The demand by Beijing threatens to impede Taiwan's \n     membership bid as both the island and China near the end of \n     their separate years-long negotiations to join global trade's \n     rule-setting body. It also complicates a debate in the U.S. \n     Senate this week on whether to approve a WTO pact with China.\n       Influential senators released a letter from President \n     Clinton on Wednesday weighing in on Taiwan's side. Clinton \n     wrote that his administration opposes Chinese efforts to call \n     Taiwan ``a separate customs territory of China.''\n       Brushing aside the opposition, Chinese Foreign Ministry \n     spokesman Sun Yuxi said Thursday that China wanted its \n     sovereignty claim to Taiwan written into the terms for \n     Taiwanese membership to WTO.\n       ``The Chinese side has a consistent and clear position: \n     Taiwan can join WTO as a separate customs territory of \n     China,'' Sun said at a twice-weekly media briefing. He \n     accused Taiwan of using the WTO negotiations to engage in \n     separatism.\n       The dispute over what the WTO should call Taiwan \n     underscores the 51-year split between the island and the \n     mainland and China's attempts to coax Taipei into \n     unification. It also revives a debate that has simmered for \n     years in working groups negotiating terms for Taiwan's entry \n     to WTO and its predecessor, GATT.\n       Taiwan applied to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and \n     Trade in 1990 as ``the customs territory of Taiwan, Penghu, \n     Kinmen and Matsu,'' thereby avoiding the questions of \n     sovereignty and statehood. Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu are small \n     island groups under Taiwan's control. GATT and now WTO rules \n     allow regions in control of their trade but without full \n     statehood to join as separate territories.\n       Under a 1992 agreement that allowed separate working groups \n     to negotiate Chinese and Taiwanese bids, GATT members \n     acknowledge China's sovereignty claim to Taiwan and out of \n     deference said Taiwan could only join after Beijing.\n       Sun, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, insisted that the 1992 \n     agreement recognized Taiwan as a separate customs territory \n     of China.\n\n  Mr. KYL. In conclusion, as I said in the beginning, I think this is \ngood news for the Senate, for the House, for the administration, and \nfor all friends of Taiwan and for those who believe both in permanent \nnormal trade relations with China, as well as the entry into WTO of \nboth China and Taiwan; certainly Taiwan entering in terms that are \nappropriate as a trading partner of the United States, as a separate \ncustoms territory and not as a province of China.\n  This is good news. I hope it portends an early conclusion to the \ndiscussions that will form the basis for accession by both China and \nTaiwan into WTO. I appreciate the cooperation, as I said, of my \ncolleagues here as well as the representatives of the President and the \nPresident himself.\n  Mr. ROTH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. I yield.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator for the \nleadership role he has played on this important matter. I think all of \nus feel very strongly that Taiwan must and should become a member of \nWTO. Under no circumstances should this imply a change in its trading \nstatus. Taiwan is our eighth largest trading partner--isn't that \ncorrect? It would be ironic if her status did not change. She is \nqualified. I think all the work has been completed for her to become a \nmember.\n  I want to tell my colleague how much I appreciate the leadership he \nhas provided.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just 2 days ago, the Washington Times \ncarried a fine article by our former colleague, Rudy Boschwitz, and \nRobert Paarlberg, who is a professor of political science at Wellesley \nCollege, entitled ``China Trade Boosts Farmers,'' subtitled, ``Senate \nshould back PNTR.''\n\n       Farm state legislators should be particularly sensitive to \n     the fact that China's joining the WTO will be a pre-emptive \n     strike benefiting American farmers. Membership in the WTO \n     will preclude China from later raising trade barriers on \n     agricultural products.\n\n  It is a very thoughtful, factual, and persuasive article. In view of \nthe serendipitous visit to this Chamber by our former colleague, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 11, 2000]\n\n                       China Trade Boosts Farmers\n\n\n                        senate should back PNTR\n\n                (By Rudy Boschwitz and Robert Paarlberg)\n\n       Executive branch officials routinely exaggerate the \n     expected payoffs from new trade agreements to win support for \n     those agreements in Congress. The recent U.S.-China agreement \n     setting terms for China's protocol for accession to the World \n     Trade Organization (WTO) has been hyped accordingly. Yet in \n     the area of agriculture, the gains from this new agreement \n     are actually greater than U.S. officials have so far dated to \n     claim.\n       Additionally, farm state legislators should be particularly \n     sensitive to the fact that China's joining the WTO will be a \n     preemptive strike benefiting American farmers. Membership in \n     the WTO will preclude China from later raising trade barriers \n     on agricultural products. Every other nation has raised such \n     barriers as it has become industrialized.\n       Furthermore, on joining the WTO, China would undoubtedly \n     find reason to curtail internal subsidies. Such subsidies \n     would surely further increase China's agricultural \n     production. China has already found such subsidization to be \n     costly and to cause grain surpluses that are both hard to \n     store and cope with.\n       The official claim, from the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture, is that China's participation in the WTO will \n     produce an annual gain of $1.6 billion in new U.S. exports of \n     grains, oilseeds and cotton by 2005. It will also lead to \n     $350-$450 million annually in additional U.S. exports of \n     other products such as poultry, pork, beef, citrus, other \n     fruits and vegetables, and forest and fish products.\n       This optimism is well-founded, since under the agreement \n     China has agreed to allow imports of a minimum of 7.3 million \n     tons of wheat virtually duty-free (only a nominal 1 percent \n     tariff), and this quantity will increase to 9.3 million tons \n     over five years. Those tonnages represent 11 to 15 percent of \n     the wheat crop in the United States. For soybean and soybean \n     meal imports, China's current tariffs will be located in at 3 \n     percent and 5 percent respectively, and for soybean oil China \n     will reduce and bind its current tariff from 13 percent to 9 \n     percent--and increase the quota of imports allowed under this \n     lowered tariff from 1.7 to 3.2 million tons over the six year \n     implementation period.\n       Those numbers also represent a meaningful percentage of our \n     production. For corn, China has agreed to allow imports of \n     4.5 million tons (at just a 1 percent tariff) increasing to \n     7.2 million tons. It also promises to stop using export \n     subsidies to dump its own surplus production (roughly 8 \n     million tons of corn this year) onto other markets in East \n     Asia, opening up still more trading space for highly \n     competitive U.S. corn exporters.\n       These market-opening gains are impressive measured against \n     the standard of China's\n\n[[Page S8481]]\n\n     current farm trade policies. Yet they are even more \n     impressive if measured against China's likely future farm \n     trade posture, absent any WTO disciplines. The new agreement \n     does not simply codify future farm trade liberalizations that \n     China might have been expected to undertake anyway. Instead, \n     it operates pre-emptively against what might have otherwise \n     been a damaging increase in Chinese farm sector protection.\n       The tendency of all nations as they industrialize is to \n     increase policy protection in the agricultural sector.\n       Earlier in the 20th century, industrial development has \n     also helped bring differing degrees of farm sector protection \n     to most of Europe and to the United States. Continued rapid \n     industrial development in China might thus have been \n     expected, before long, to trigger an increase in China's farm \n     trade protection from the current level. It is fortunate that \n     China will now come into the WTO and bind its protection \n     levels for agriculture before this natural, post-industrial \n     tendency to extend lavish protection to relatively \n     inefficient farmers has expressed itself.\n       This is good for U.S. agricultural exporters, but the \n     Chinese know it is good for them as well, which is why they \n     are doing it. The Chinese do not want to be stuck several \n     decades from now struggling, like the Japanese and the \n     Europeans, to escape a costly and burdensome system of \n     subsidies to inefficient farmers. China's agricultural \n     policies, which are not yet heavily protectionist, have \n     nonetheless already begun to generate periodic surpluses of \n     corn, wheat, and rice, and officials have learned these \n     surpluses are expensive to store at home and costly to export \n     under subsidy. China welcomes the import policy disciplines \n     it is accepting in WTO as an incentive to avoid moving toward \n     costly farm subsidy policies in the years ahead.\n       All that remains is for the U.S. Senate to approve \n     Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) for China, so that \n     U.S. farmers will be able to share in the gains from this new \n     trade liberalizing agreement. Without a PNTR policy in the \n     United States, the expanded agricultural trade benefits from \n     China's accession to the WTO are likely to be captured more \n     by farmers in Canada or Australia, and less by the United \n     States.\n       With the U.S. farm sector currently struggling under a \n     burden of low prices brought on in part by sluggish exports \n     to East Asia, the China option is not one to be missed. Farm \n     state legislators in Congress need to see these facts clearly \n     when the time comes to vote on PNTR status for China.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, seeing no Senator seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it appropriate for the \nSenator from New Mexico to speak at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this bill before us is a decisive step \ntoward normalizing trade relations with China. Chairman Roth has \ncharacterized this vote, the one we will make on this bill, as the most \nsignificant vote we will take this Congress. I agree.\n  While we will be concerned with many more issues that seem more \nimportant to individual Senators, and certainly we will be looking \nafter our parochial interests in our sovereign States as we work as \nSenators--and that is all very important--but when we look at America \nand what she stands for in the world as it is evolving and developing, \nthe final vote on this measure is probably the most significant vote we \nwill take this year and maybe in many years.\n  Senator Roth, I repeat, said that. I agree wholeheartedly. I am quite \nsure the tenor of Senator Moynihan's suggestions--I have not been \nprivileged to hear them here with the Senate--would agree with that. \nThis is a very important issue.\n  This is the one vote that will be heard around the world. This is the \none vote which recognizes that countries must play by the same rules in \na globalized market if the market is to be efficient and function \nproperly.\n  We hear so much talk about what is happening to the world--\nglobalization. International trade, as part of globalization, must be \nefficient and effective.\n  This is the one vote that will do a great deal to encourage democracy \nfor one in five people living on this Earth. I say encourage democracy \nbecause I truly believe this is the one vote that invites China to be \nour trading partner and, at the same time, determines whether American \nmanufacturers, farmers, and service industries will get the benefit of \ntrade and of an agreement pursued and negotiated by three different \nAmerican Presidents.\n  They cannot all be wrong. As a matter of fact, they were all right. \nChina is joining the WTO and have implemented a lot of reforms in order \nto be eligible. Furthermore, it has made promises to do certain other \nthings. So that the U.S. can benefit from this new WTO members' market, \nCongress needs to grant permanent normal trade relations to China. It \njust took us a long time to understand and to work our way to this day \nwhen granting China permanent trade relations is finally before us.\n  On the subject of PNTR for China, Chairman Greenspan said:\n\n       History has demonstrated that implicit in any removal of \n     power from central planners and broadening of market \n     mechanisms . . . is a more general spread of rights to \n     individuals. Such a development will be a far stronger \n     vehicle to foster other individual rights than any other \n     alternative of which I am aware.\n\n  That is precisely what globalization and international trading--China \ntrading with America--have a chance to do.\n  Exposure to democracy and capitalism, information, and \ntelecommunications and communication technology will increasingly \ninfluence the course of global affairs, without any question.\n  Imagine what Internet success means to a one-party, authoritarian \nstate such as China. Even if China's economic growth and military \nmodernization appear to be threatening, our relationship with China \nwill evolve within the context of a very different world, a world \nincreasingly reliant on information to achieve economic growth, \nprosperity, and jobs.\n  Anyone who has gone to China recently or, for that matter, watched \nrecent television programming regarding what is going on with the labor \nforce in China will know that Chinese men and Chinese women will move \nto get good jobs. They are already moving from the countryside to the \ncities without any retribution. They are smiling. They are taking risks \nbecause they see the opportunity to get a good paycheck. Make no bones \nabout it, they want jobs that pay them money so they can move up their \nstandard of living in this world.\n  That force, if turned loose in China, will change China forever. In \nparticular, since China does not have the kind of central government \nthe Soviet Union had, although we have from time to time called them \nboth Communist countries, they are certainly very different in terms of \nthe ability to control people and whether or not the central government \nreally has as much control or is as despotic as the government that was \nmanaged by a small oligarchy in the Soviet Union.\n  I am not suggesting the trade, the Internet and computers will topple \nauthoritarian structures in China overnight, but I do believe that for \nmany years information control was equivalent to people control, but \ninformation control is quickly becoming more and more impossible.\n  Exposure to our economic system through trade, telecommunications, \nand the Internet will encourage strides toward freedom, in my humble \nopinion. For every argument that China is a risk to America's future, I \nargue that China trading with America is a move in a direction of \nfreedom that takes away from the risk of the future, takes away from \nthe risk of a centralized powerful Chinese Government being dangerous \nto the world. Not that they are not, not that they could not be, but I \nsubmit it will be more and more difficult for that to occur as free \ntrade permeates the cities and suburbs of China and the people who live \nthere and the businessmen who will prosper by it.\n\n  I offer that while it is not at issue, education is another catalyst \nfor economic freedom and democracy. Chinese students attending American \nuniversities is an important part of any effective economic trade and \nforeign policy for the United States. I know there are a lot of young \nChinese coming to American universities to be students here, and living \nour way of life while they get educated. I asked my staff to find out \njust how many. Fifty thousand Chinese students from China now, not \nTaiwan--attended American universities last year. The number grows by \nthe thousands every year.\n\n[[Page S8482]]\n\n  The important thing is that these students are not studying math and \nscience and culture by remote control. They are doing this by being \nphysically present in American cities across this land. I submit, the \nmore the young people of China experience America and are exposed to \nAmerican freedom and watch capitalism work in America, the more likely \nit becomes that the future of China will be subtly but unalterably \ninfluenced in a positive direction.\n  Whether these Western-educated, young Chinese people are involved in \npolitics or business--I would add in science or math or physics--their \nviews about democracy and the free market economics will not be \ncontrolled or dominated by the so-called party.\n  Over the long run, experience and exposure will have a direct and \nsignificant impact on mainland China. And the leaders know what is \nhappening.\n\n  The Chinese leaders do not attempt to stop their students from coming \nto the greatest universities in the world and get educated in the best \nway in the world. In fact, sometimes I think they must be aware that \nthere is a better way than what they have in their country, and to some \nextent they may think a better way is substantially the free way, the \nAmerican way.\n  China is a big, big market. It has been estimated that the PNTR would \nincrease U.S. exports to China by about $13 billion annually and will \ngrow every sector of this economy. China is densely populated. It is a \ncountry in which one in five people alive today live. Think of that. \nThis is largely an open, untapped market, both for the mind and for \nsubstances of trade.\n  I will comment on my State, which is not looked at as an exporting \nState, but direct exports from New Mexico to China totalled $235 \nmillion in 1999; and adding indirect exports through Hong Kong, brings \nour total to about $320 to $350 million.\n  We often hear the expression ``everything from soup to nuts'' to \ndescribe something very comprehensive, something widespread. An apropos \nvariation of this colloquialism is ``China-New Mexico trade covers \neverything from chips to cheese.''\n  Agricultural tariffs will be cut by more than half. New Mexico has, \nbelieve it or not--and this is not because Pete Domenici is of Italian \nextraction, whose mother and father came to New Mexico as immigrants--\nthe largest mozzarella cheese plant in all the world. The mozzarella \ncheese for all of those delis they have in New York, where does it come \nfrom? New Mexico. And so is the case for China; it comes from New \nMexico. They are one of our large importers of that cheese, and many \nother cheese products made in our State.\n  Incidentally, I say to Senator Moynihan, while time has been passing, \nNew Mexico has been growing in terms of dairy cows and as part of \nAmerican milk production. Everybody thinks dairy product production is \na Wisconsin issue, but New Mexico is now ninth among all of the \nsovereign States in terms of the production of dairy products. That is \nwhy it turns out we are working with China.\n  PNTR and China joining the WTO will be a big help for the New Mexico \nproducers of milk products, as the Chinese people get the opportunity \nto compare the comparative culinary merits of Domino's, Pizza Hut, and \neven Papa Johns. I know my friend from New York is not here working on \nthis agreement because he wants to see more Pizza Huts in China, but I \nthink he would not disagree that the United States has an array of \nexport opportunities from State to State. When you add all those up, \nthey do go as far as the ingredients that go into a pizza, all the way \nto the ingredients and intellectual knowledge that goes into making \nfancy computer chips or to make anything that China makes and sells to \nthe world.\n  The tariff on agricultural products will drop. It will drop from 50 \npercent to 10 percent on cheese products; from 35 percent to 10 percent \nfor lactose and whey, both of which are produced in large quantities in \nthe States of the United States that have many dairy cows and much milk \nproduction.\n  It is not well known that Intel Corporation manufactures flash memory \nmicrochips in its Rio Rancho plant in New Mexico, right next to \nAlbuquerque. Flash memory chips are used in cellular phones, digital \ncameras, personal computers.\n  The flash memory chips are sent to Shanghai for assembly and testing \nbefore they are shipped to customers worldwide. In 2000, Intel earned \nover $500 million in revenue from the flash memory chips manufactured \nin New Mexico and tested in China. Both China and New Mexico added \nprofit to the product as it moved its way to market.\n  If we do not grant PNTR status to China, it is quite obvious that \nsomebody else will take our place in each of these markets that I have \ndescribed for my State in terms of being a manufacturer of products. \nObviously, someplace else in the world can decide, if we are going to \nleave that trade barrier up, instead of reducing it 50 percent and 30 \npercent, as I have described, to get the business and the profit \nmargin, where a foreign business could have the tariff rate that is not \nbeing adjusted.\n\n  China is discovering the necessity for cellular phones. I am talking \nabout a product with which we are all becoming very familiar. There \nwere 40 million cellular phones in China last year. This year, the \nestimate is 70 million. By 2003, China has projected to have more cell \nphones in use than any other country on the globe.\n  You can understand that because, you see, to some extent cellular \nphone use in America was inhibited by poles, with telephone lines, and \ntelephones that are attached to them. We had that before cellular \nphones were invented. While we think that is great, it is a burden to \nthe growth of cellular phones. Maybe the word ``burden'' is wrong, but \nat least cellular will not grow as fast.\n  Now enter into a Chinese city where they do not have any telephone \npoles, and all of a sudden they have cellular phones. They will never \nbuild telephone lines. That is why you can say they will go from 40 \nmillion to 70 million in 1 year. And who knows thereafter?\n  I guess we could then ask, how many telephone poles could they put in \nthe ground? And how many telephone lines could they put up? While this \nwas not part of my prepared text, I would speculate that they are not \ndoing hundreds of thousands of miles of telephone lines. Why would \nthey? They would just leapfrog to the newest technology. And that is \nwhat they began to use. That is what they will use for a long time \nhereafter.\n  Some have argued that PNTR is an attempt to move manufacturing jobs \noverseas. That is an argument we have to confront every time we talk \nabout lowering trade barriers with some country in the world. It was \nthe same argument when created the North American Free Trade zone with \nMexico, I say to my good friend from New York.\n  Let me illustrate that this is not the case with reference to that \ncontention. Last week, Intel broke ground on a new fabrication plant in \nRio Rancho, NM. This expansion had a total cost of $2 billion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Two billion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It will provide 500 to 1,000 more jobs for New Mexico, \nhighly paid, skilled jobs.\n  Obviously, local businesses will also profit from this expansion. \nThat is what expanded trade with China means to Americans and to New \nMexicans.\n  I gave you the example of the $2 billion investment because that \ninvestment is made to make one phase of the computer chip that I just \ndescribed. The other phase will be done in China. Both countries will \ngain employment and will gain in terms of the production of items that \nadd to our respective gross national products. I do not know which will \nhave more. I would assume they would have a few more workers doing \ntheirs, but we will have the master plant with the most modern \ntechnology.\n  The challenge to America in an international global market is the \nrisk that we are taking, and it is singular. It is one. It is that we \nwill not be able to produce the high-tech, high-paying jobs ahead of \nthe rest of world and keep them here. That is really the only \nchallenge. If we can do that, and train our people sufficiently to do \nthat, we will win all the time because we will keep the high-paid, \nhighly skilled jobs here, as we are currently doing vis-a-vis a country \nsuch as China or other countries in the world.\n  So granting PNTR to China makes practical economic policy, and it\n\n[[Page S8483]]\n\nmakes good foreign policy. I think they are tied together in this case.\n  I have had an opportunity to talk to Henry Kissinger, who I happen to \nknow quite well from a long, long time ago, when he came to my State \nwith his young son who is now grown up and is involved in the movie \nproduction business. He was 13 when he joined his father in my city \ndoing an event for me when I was a young Senator. He talked about the \nglobal policy significance, not just its economic significance. I \nagree. I agree that there is no doubt that this is good trade policy \nand good foreign policy.\n\n  Grant PNTR is practical economic policy, but it is also inescapable \neconomic policy because it is impossible, in this era of globalization, \nfor the United States to fence off 20 percent of the world's population \nand refuse to trade with them on the same trade terms we trade with \nothers. Trade relations with China are not the same as they were in \n1979 when China and the United States first resumed diplomatic \nrelations. At that time, all trade flowed through the Chinese \nGovernment in the form of state-owned enterprises. Today the private \nsector accounts for nearly 70 percent of China's output. Maybe I would \nput it differently because some of these centers of trade, we don't \nknow whether they are private sector, as we understand them, but the \nnongovernment sector, nonowned by the Government, is nearly 70 percent \nof the Chinese output compared with 30 percent Government-owned.\n  We understand the Government is not too happy with owning even the 30 \npercent because they really don't know how to run it. They are seeing \nwhat is happening in the competitive world, and big policy discussions \nare occurring there as to what do they do about that situation. They \nhave observed and have learned what happened to state-owned businesses \nin the former Soviet states, and they went from total ownership to \nnobody wanting ownership. There was nothing in between. We have the \nformer Soviet Union, at least Russia, with an economic production \nmachine that has been reduced to almost nothing. We will soon be \ncomparing the total gross domestic product of Russia with one of the \nsmaller countries in Europe. Imagine that.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will my distinguished friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would he know that the current best estimate is that \nthe GDP of Russia is now approximately that of Switzerland?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wouldn't.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. And that sequence, exactly as he has described it, \ntotal ownership to no ownership, as against the transformation before \nour eyes, is taking place in the PRC.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is absolutely correct. I might add that what is \nhappening in Russia, the Chinese have seen very clearly. They are never \ngoing to let that happen. We went from Government ownership to no \nownership to oligarchs who substituted here in the middle who became \npowerful, rich people who put these businesses together; bought them \nfrom the Government. Now a few groups own more businesses than anybody \nexpected in Russia and do not run it in any way consistent with \nRussia's future. It is just their own. Whether they pay taxes or not is \ntheir business. That is the way things go. It is not so good.\n  Let me talk about this trend that is occurring in China. I think it \nis excellent. It is a great sign because a growing market-based economy \nis the most effective path to democracy for China and should be \nencouraged as part of the American policy with other free nations in \nthe world.\n  There have been a lot of amendments offered to this bill. I owe the \nSenators who offered them, individually or for themselves and others, \nan explanation of why I voted against each and every one. Some of them \nare very good. Some of them, if freestanding and not burdening a \nmeasure of this magnitude, I probably would have come down and even \ndebated. I did not. I did not come and talk on any of them because I \nwas not going to vote for any. It appeared to me that my responsibility \nas a Senator was to see that this legislation got through here, at \nleast as much as I could. That meant don't add amendments to it that \nare apt to make it impossible for this legislation to get passed and \nsent to the President for signature.\n\n  I consider this to be the most important event of this year and maybe \nof a couple years. While it does not come out of my committee, I have \nbeen informed on it. I worked on it. I am very proud of the Finance \nCommittee and in particular the chairman, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Roth, and obviously, the ranking member, the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, before our beloved chairman of the \nBudget Committee, the Senator from New Mexico, leaves, may I thank him \nfor his remarks. All anyone need say is what he has said. I would just \nsupplement them with one comment to reinforce what he has said. We, the \nFinance Committee, held a long series of hearings on the bill. It \nhappens, in the last paragraph of the last witness, the Honorable Ira \nShapiro, who has been previously our chief negotiator for Japan and \nCanada at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, said thus:\n\n       This vote is one of an historic handful of congressional \n     votes since the end of World War II. Nothing that Members of \n     Congress do this year or any other year could be more \n     important.\n\n  He was not simply speaking of trade and the standard of living. He \nwas talking about the large geopolitical fact of do we include one-\nfifth of mankind in the world's system we wish to create, we have \ncreated, and are creating, or do we say, no, you are out, and invite \nhostility that could spoil the next half century?\n  We have not. Today we voted by a two-thirds majority to go forward. I \nthank the Senator for his vote and his leadership throughout. It is a \ncheering experience in what has not been always a cheering year.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Moynihan for those kinds \nwords and for his last observation.\n  Perhaps Mr. Shapiro said it more eloquently than I. I consider it one \nof the most important events, and I described that early on as I see \nit.\n  I would add one observation. I ask the Senator if he shares this. \nFrankly, I think it is very important, when China is granted PNTR, when \nit becomes a member of WTO, that they not leave with the American \npeople in the next few years, that they not let activity on their part \nhappen which would let Americans think that they are discriminating \nagainst the purchase of American goods and services. If we are \ncompetitive in this world, whether it be in services or in products or \nin agricultural products, we don't expect China to control that through \nits Government but rather leave it to the free and open market or, \nindeed, Americans will look at this as a sham.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Our companies are telling us they can compete. I know \nof many areas they can compete, and they are not competing because of \ntrade barriers, because of tariffs, and because of the selectivity of \nsome of the governmental entities in terms of who they pick and choose. \nThat part is a little risky on their end. It may be a small amount of \nproduct, but it could be a very big wave if they are not careful.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, if I might respond, there is an \nextraordinary symmetry to what we are doing today. Toward the end of \nthe Second World War, when China was our ally, we gathered at Bretton \nWoods in New Hampshire and drew up the plans for what became the World \nBank, the International Monetary Fund, and an International Trade \nOrganization to establish common rules for trade that would be abided \nby, a rule of law that could be adjudicated and settled. China was a \nfull participant at the Bretton Woods Conference. China joined the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade after the International Trade \nOrganization, sir, was defeated in the Senate Finance Committee.\n  They withdrew after the Chinese Red Army overran the mainland. But \nnow the People's Republic has asked to come back and join the revived \nInternational Trade Organization, now the\n\n[[Page S8484]]\n\nWorld Trade Organization, which has rules that are to be abided by, and \nnondiscrimination is the first rule.\n  That is why this measure is so important because we could not be in \nthe WTO with China if we had a provision that we must renew normal \ntrade relations status once a year. No, but each of us must abide by \nthe rules. It is now up to the vigilance of our Department of Commerce, \nthe Trade Representative, American business, and labor unions to see to \nit that the rules are abided by. You can't hope for more.\n  Let us go forward in confidence and determination, as the Senator \ndescribed. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I know my colleague from Wisconsin has \nbeen here before me. I have been asked by the majority leader to make a \nunanimous consent request. As soon as I make it, I hope the Chair will \nrecognize my colleague from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes \nequally divided for debate relative to the Feingold amendment regarding \na commission, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the \nvote.\n  I further ask consent that following that debate, Senator Wellstone \nbe recognized in order to resume debate on amendment No. 4120.\n  I further ask consent that following the use or yielding of that \ndebate time, the Senate proceed to a series of rollcall votes in \nrelation to the following amendments, with 2 minutes for closing \nremarks prior to each vote. Those amendments are as follows: Helms \namendment No. 4128; Helms amendment No. 4123; a Feingold amendment \nregarding a commission; Wellstone amendment No. 4120.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I inquire, I understand there are \nto be 2 minutes of debate between each of the specified votes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Yes, 2 minutes for closing remarks prior to each vote. So \nI assume that is 1 minute to each side. I understand this has been \nagreed to by the leadership on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be temporarily set aside so I may offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4138\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4138.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make technical changes relating to the recommendations of \n  the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of \n                                 China)\n\n       On page 44, beginning on line 4, strike all through page \n     45, line 12, and insert the following:\n       (g) Annual Reports.--The Commission shall issue a report to \n     the President and the Congress not later than 12 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, and not later than the \n     end of each 12-month period thereafter, setting forth the \n     findings of the Commission during the preceding 12-month \n     period, in carrying out subsections (a) through (c). The \n     Commission's report shall contain recommendations for \n     legislative or executive action, including recommendations \n     indicating whether or not a change in China's trade status is \n     merited.\n       (h) Specific Information in Annual Reports.--The \n     Commission's report under subsection (g) shall include \n     specific information as to the nature and implementation of \n     laws or policies concerning the rights set forth in \n     paragraphs (1) through (12) of subsection (a), and as to \n     restrictions applied to or discrimination against persons \n     exercising any of the rights set forth in such paragraphs.\n       (i) Congressional Priority Procedures.--\n       (1) Introduction and referral of resolutions.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 10 session days after \n     receipt of the Commission's report by a House of Congress, \n     the Majority Leader of that House shall introduce a joint \n     resolution in that House providing for the implementation of \n     such recommendations of the Commission's report as require \n     statutory implementation. In the case of the Senate, such \n     resolution shall be referred to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations and, in the case of the House of Representatives, \n     such resolution shall be referred to the Committee on \n     International Relations. In the consideration of resolutions \n     referred under this subparagraph, such committees shall hold \n     hearings on the contents of the Commission's report and the \n     recommendations contained therein for the purpose of \n     receiving testimony from Members of Congress, and such \n     appropriate representatives of Federal departments and \n     agencies, and interested persons and groups, as the \n     committees deem advisable.\n       (B) Session day defined.--The term ``session day'' means, \n     with respect to a House of Congress, any day on which the \n     House of Congress is in session.\n       (2) Procedure for discharge of committees.--If the \n     committee to which is referred such resolution has not \n     reported such resolution at the end of 15 calendar days after \n     its introduction, such committee shall be discharged from \n     further consideration of such resolution and such resolution \n     shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the House \n     involved.\n       (3) Motion to proceed.--When the committee to which a \n     resolution is referred has reported, or has been deemed to be \n     discharged (under paragraph (2)) from further consideration \n     of, a resolution described in paragraph (1), notwithstanding \n     any rule or precedent of the Senate, including Rule 22, it is \n     at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous \n     motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any \n     Member of the respective House to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the resolution, and all points of order \n     against the resolution (and against consideration of the \n     resolution) are waived. The motion is highly privileged in \n     the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate \n     and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, \n     or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall \n     not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration \n     of the resolution is agreed to, the resolution shall remain \n     the unfinished business of the respective House until \n     disposed of.\n       (4) The provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) are \n     enacted by\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this amendment will increase the \nstrength and the relevance of the Congressional-Executive Commission on \nthe People's Republic of China.\n  It is no secret that I oppose H.R. 4444, the bill extending permanent \nnormal trade relations to China. I believe it is a mistake to \ninstitutionalize a separation between our trading relationship with \nChina and our concerns regarding the deteriorating human rights \nsituation in China. I believe this compartmentalization of American \ninterests makes for policy that is confused, contradictory, and \nultimately ineffective.\n  I am not blind to the numbers; I am not blind to the likely votes. \nThis bill stands an excellent chance of passing the Senate, and we are \ndealing with legislation likely to become law. So I choose to take \nseriously the efforts made in the other body to somehow integrate human \nrights concerns into this legislation.\n  Perhaps I am supposed to assume those efforts are simply window \ndressing, mere political cover for those who feel obligated to address \nhuman rights issues but who are also disinclined to impede this trade \ninitiative with inconvenient complications. But I reject that \nassumption. If this bill passes, as it probably will, the \nCongressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China \nwill be important both in substance and as a symbol. It may well be the \nonly remaining bridge in our China policy between this country's \nhighest values and the pursuit of profit for the few. It will be the \nwatchdog, in a sense, responsible for ensuring that our trade policy \nundermines neither our national values nor our national character. Its \nstructure and its mandate will carry this burden. So I do think this \ncommission deserves our serious consideration.\n  As currently constructed, the commission would produce an annual \nreport. But it would not be required to include policy recommendations \nin this report, and neither the House nor the Senate would actually be \nrequired to debate the report or to hold any kind of vote on it. In \nshort, the commission would be extremely weak and then, of course, \ncould be easily be marginalized.\n  My amendment would strengthen the commission in several ways. First, \nit would require that the commission's report contain recommendations \nfor legislative and/or executive action,\n\n[[Page S8485]]\n\nrather than simply permitting such recommendations. As the debate on \nthis bill has shown, we do not lack for reports of gross human rights \nviolations in China. But simply stating the facts is not enough; our \nactions must reflect acknowledgement of those facts. Thick reports and \nhandwringing in and of themselves do not serve U.S. interests. Policy \nrecommendations have to be an explicit part of the commission's \nmandate.\n  In addition, this amendment would require that legislative proposals \ncontained in the report be considered by both the House International \nRelations Committee and by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. As \nit now stands, this commission reports only to the House. I urge my \ncolleagues in this body, the Senate, to recognize that the Senate needs \nto consider this report and its recommendations as well. We cannot \nleave this important work solely to our House colleagues and, in \neffect, wash our hands of it. We must protect the Senate's prerogatives \nand ensure that both Chambers of this Congress engage with this \nimportant commission.\n  Finally, this amendment lays out a procedure by which \nthis commission's recommendations could be considered by this body \nrather than simply gathering dust and assuaging consciences on our \noffice shelves. It would establish a procedure, one that is not \nunfamiliar or unprecedented, whereby commission recommendations, in the \nform of a resolution, would be considered by the appropriate \ncommittees. These committees would then hold hearings to review these \nrecommendations, allowing for public comment and opening up this \nprocess to democratic participation and actual debate.\n\n  Critically, after committee consideration, any Member of the House or \nSenate would have the right to call up the resolution on the floor. \nThis amendment ensures that the crucially important issues covered by \nthe commission can be considered by any Member, not only the members of \ncertain committees. As it now stands, only members of the House \nInternational Relations Committee would have the power to consider and \nweigh the commission report. That seems very odd to me for a bicameral \nlegislature. This amendment provides a mechanism for moving the \nsubstance of commission recommendations onto the floor and into the \nrealm of full congressional consideration.\n  This is hardly an extreme proposition. My amendment would give this \ncommission greater relevance, rather than relegating it to bureaucratic \nlimbo. Relevance seems like an eminently reasonable goal for a body \ncharged with the critically important work of reconciling U.S. support \nfor human rights with the U.S. trade policy toward China.\n  Those toiling in forced labor camps are relevant. This body ought to \nbehave as if they are relevant. The Tibetan and Chinese people, \nfighting every day for religious freedom, are relevant. Victims of \ntorture are relevant. The Congressional Executive-Commission on the \nPeople's Republic of China is where these people will now have to find \ntheir place in U.S. policy. I urge my colleagues to take this seriously \nand give it the strength it needs to be meaningful.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the Republican floor manager has indicated \nI could use his time to talk about this important piece of legislation. \nI don't have any remarks I am going to direct specifically to the \namendment; although, I find myself in the same position as the Senator \nfrom New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, in that there are many amendments that, \nunder different circumstances, I may very well have found myself \nsupporting. But because I think this is such an important piece of \nlegislation, I have decided to oppose any amendments that will be made \nto this bill because I think it will put it in jeopardy, and the \nchances of it passing the House are, from what I understand, not good \nif we put Senate amendments on this side.\n\n  I think we will have an opportunity in the future to address some of \nthe amendments that were attempted to be made to this particular piece \nof legislation. Under those circumstances, as I mentioned earlier, I \nwill probably support them.\n  I think this is a very important piece of legislation for this \ncountry. It is a very important piece of legislation as far as the \nState of Colorado is concerned. The State of Colorado has experienced \ntremendous growth in exports, and I attribute that to the type of \nindustry we have in the State of Colorado. We are primarily agriculture \nand light manufacturing, which includes high-technology. Those are \nareas where we have had a lot of growth in exports nationwide. Colorado \nhas been the benefactor of that.\n  I have come to the belief that we need to work to open trade \nbarriers. When we open these trade barriers, democracy is exported and \nwe prosper economically. Colorado would be one State in the Nation that \nwould be a good example of that.\n  Western civilization has been trading in some manner with China since \nthe Roman Empire anchored one end of the Silk Road. But it will not be \nuntil we pass this bill before us that our culture will have access to \nfree and open trade with this massive country called China.\n  I am glad most of us have recognized that the term ``most favored \nnation'' was a misnomer. This country needs to remember that China will \nnot actually be ``favored.'' China will be equally treated as we treat \nthe other 137 World Trade Organization countries such as Cyprus, \nJamaica, and Djibouti, or the newest WTO member nation, Albania. We are \nnot singling China out for special treatment, nor are we ushering them \ninto the community of nations. The World Trade Organization exists \nseparate from our decision.\n  I am struck most by this fact: That if the United States does not \npass permanent normal trading relations, it does not keep China out of \nthe WTO. It just keeps America from benefiting from China's presence in \nit.\n  China has 1.3 billion people, a purchasing power of $4.42 trillion, \nand a yearly import market of $140 billion. Nearly 20 percent of the \nworld lives within its borders--a fifth of the world. And many of the \nChinese people are just beginning to desire Western products such as \nthose made in Colorado--luxury goods, communication gear, computers, \nsoftware, western beef, wheat, and so much more. The rest of the world \nis scrambling ferociously to pass their own version of PNTR to capture \nthe China market.\n  If we turn down this opportunity or if we amend it into practical \nnullification, we will not stop China's human rights problems; we will \nnot force China to accept freedom of religion, speech, or other \nindividual liberty. All that will happen is the United States will be \ndenied the loosening of tariffs and import controls that the rest of \nthe world nations will gain.\n  If Congress balks at PNTR this year, 137 nations other than the \nUnited States will benefit from free trade with China while American \nworkers, farmers, ranchers, and small businesses are denied equal \naccess.\n  Everyone knows we trade with China now. Colorado exported $166 \nmillion worth of goods to China in 1998. Colorado Springs alone, one of \nour larger metropolitan areas, exported $41 million. Denver, another of \nour larger metropolitan areas, exported $16 million to China. And these \nnumbers are only going to grow. If we grant China PNTR, Colorado will \nbe assured a more prosperous future. Why? Because with PNTR-WTO \nmembership, China will have to lower their average tariffs on U.S. \ngoods from 24 percent to 9 percent. They will have to cut average \nagricultural tariffs in half and eliminate all tariffs on high-tech \ngoods. But Colorado and the United States will not have to undergo \nsimilar market restructuring. The United States already has open \nmarkets and engages in free trade.\n  It is China that will have to open their markets and end their \nprotectionism to benefit from WTO membership. This will then facilitate \nmore trade and higher profits for Colorado companies and Colorado \nworkers.\n  Why is China doing this? Because they know what we do. Free trade \nbenefits those who practice it.\n  Many export producing jobs pay better than basic service sector jobs. \nIncreasing trade generates more jobs of a higher quality, and that \npresents more opportunities for workers.\n\n[[Page S8486]]\n\n  For instance, since NAFTA, Colorado has increased exports to Mexico \nby $300 million. China PNTR will add to this export total.\n  If we were to set aside economic reasons, there are still many other \nreasons to favor PNTR. The first is humanitarian.\n  History has shown that it is the isolated, closed societies that are \nthe most brutal and repressed. International contact--such as would be \nbrought about by increased trade, with businessmen, foreign goods, \nexchanges, corporate presence and marketing--would serve to increase \naccess to a higher standard of living and a better quality of life.\n  We would be able to up-grade the everyday lifestyle of the ordinary \npeople of China, and that is not an opportunity to be ignored by those \nwho seek to aid the world's less fortunate.\n  The number one export from America is democracy.\n  PNTR will not only tear down the trade barriers for Colorado's \nworkers, farmers, and small businesses, it will also flood the Chinese \nculture with the American ideals of liberty and democracy.\n  When the freedom protesters took over Tiananmen Square in 1889 and \nbuilt a replica of the Statute of Liberty, they were not just \nexpressing support for the type of freedoms enshrined in our political \ndocuments.\n  They were expressing a desire for the liberty and benefits of a \nmodern, vibrant, and free United States that they saw on the current \nworld stage.\n  By increasing our relations with China, we can side step the \nadmittedly authoritarian regime in Beijing, and deal with the people \nthemselves through our products and our communications.\n  The Soviet Union did not fall because we passed resolutions against \nthem. It did not fall because we had bitter debates about their human \nright records, and it did not fall because we regularly reviewed their \ncivil liberties.\n  It fell for two reasons that remain relevant today: The Soviet Union \nfell because the oppressed people of Eastern Europe grew tired of being \nleft behind by the western prosperity they saw, and because their \nleaders realized that President Reagan would not let them take that \nprosperity by force. Unable to keep up with the western nations, they \nfell behind and eventually fell apart.\n  We need to remain aware of and secure against China's sometimes \nblatant hostility to us and our ideals. But we have less to fear from a \nChina that shares an engaged, mutually beneficial relationship than \nfrom an excluded China shut out of our markets.\n\n  Taiwan, the nation most under the gun from an aggressive China, \nsupports Chinese PNTR/WTO membership for this very reason. It suggests \nthat they too hope that increased trade will overwhelm the communist \nsystem and force it to grow and develop into a more mature, efficient, \nand equitable system.\n  Some oppose trade agreements because of security concerns. Trade \nagreements are not the reason for the loss of our nation's military \nsecrets.\n  We have seen serious security lapses in the Department of State, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Energy, and our national \nlaboratories. The responsibility of protecting our national secrets \nlies with the Administration, not our trade policies.\n  The most recent Department of Energy security blunder, losing two \nhard drives, coupled with the discovery of bugging devices in State \nDepartment conference rooms and the mishandling of classified \ninformation by the recently dismissed Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency, builds a very strong case for this \nadministration's blatant disregard for protecting our national security \nsecrets.\n  However, these wrongs pale in comparison to the Secretary of Energy's \ndecision to ignore the public law enacted by Congress last year to \nestablish a semi-autonomous National Nuclear Security Agency to correct \nknown security deficiencies within his department.\n  Fortunately, the recent Los Alamos incident expedited what had become \na stalled effort to confirm General John Gordon as Director of the \nnewly formed NNSA. With General Gordon in place, I sincerely believe we \nwill finally get some action to hasten security reform within this \nagency.\n  But these acts, all pre-PNTR, highlight a simple truth--weapons \nproliferation, national security, and defense are functions of a \nnation's leaders, not its merchants.\n  If we want a strong, pro-active national defense that diligently \nmaintains our vital interests, we can not expect to let trade \nagreements alone shoulder that burden.\n  It is my hope that the upcoming vote will confirm America's \ncommitment to free trade, international participation, and mutually \nbeneficial capitalism. That is why I will be voting in favor of China \nPNTR and against any amendments.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is my understanding that the Senator from Colorado \nhas yielded time in opposition to my amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield my time on the floor and I reserve the time we \nhave in opposition.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am prepared to yield back my remaining time.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I want to make sure the floor manager is comfortable \nyielding back on our side; if so, I yield back the remainder of time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I suggest to the Senator from Colorado that I will make a \nfew comments.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I yield my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Feingold \namendment.\n  This amendment would change the mandate of the Levin-Bereuter \nCommission created by H.R. 4444 by mandating that it make \nrecommendations to the Congress on legislative actions. Such \nrecommendations would have to be introduced in each body, be referred \nto the Foreign Relations Committee and the International Relations \nCommittee, and be considered by those committees and the Congress under \nrules similar to ``fast track.''\n  I oppose this amendment for many reasons. As a jurisdictional matter, \nI oppose a change in the rules of the Senate that would refer a revenue \nmeasure to a committee other than the Finance Committee, as this \namendment would do if the Commission recommended a change in the trade \nstatus of China, and I urge all Finance Committee members to support \nme.\n  Second, I see no need to compel a recommendation out of the \nCommission. As outlined in the mandate of the Commission, if they \nchoose, they may make a recommendation to the Congress on legislative \naction. Compelling the Commission to do so strikes me as misguided.\n  Third, I see no need to fast track a recommendation by the \nCommission. The Congress can consider any recommendation by the \nCommission under the regular order, just as we are considering PNTR.\n  Finally, as I have outlined with every amendment, I believe the \nadoption of this amendment would unnecessarily risk slowing the \nunderlying bill down. Therefore, I view a vote for this amendment as a \nvote to kill PNTR.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to the comments \nof the distinguished chairman.\n  Yes, this amendment, in terms of the commission that was established \nin the House consideration of the bill, says there ought to be some \nrecommendations coming out of this commission, there ought to be some \nreality. This is all we will have left of the opportunity to consider \nissues such as human rights in connection with China's trade status.\n  Instead of just having a series of documents or volumes on a shelf \ngathering dust, we suggest there ought to at least be a requirement \nthat there be recommendations coming forward. That seems to me to be \nvery modest. This is not something that would in any way undercut the \nlegislation or the purpose of the legislation. It would simply make \nsure that the work of the commission results in some recommendation.\n  What strikes me as even more strange about opposition to this \namendment is that the distinguished chairman would leave this \ncommission to be only a commission that reports to the House of \nRepresentatives. He would prefer that a commission that apparently is a \nserious commission, one that the chairman will support, as\n\n[[Page S8487]]\n\nhe votes for final passage of the bill, should not report to this body. \nI would think his institutional concerns of having to do with proper \nreferral to one committee or another in a revenue bill would also apply \nto the notion that a report should go to the Senate as well as to the \nHouse on something as significant and weighty as the question of human \nrights and other issues in connection with China's trade status. I find \nit baffling that the main proponent of this bill would not agree that \nthis Senate should receive the report, as well as the House.\n  The Senator makes the point, as well he should as chairman of the \nFinance Committee, that he believes there may be some concerns about \nproper jurisdiction in terms of committees. I am a member of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee, so I definitely believe this should go to \nthe Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\n  But I have no problem with certainly inviting an amendment that calls \nfor a joint reporting to both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nand the Senate Finance Committee. It seems to me that would take care \nof that concern. I know of a number of cases in my brief time in the \nSenate where we have had these joint referrals, and that would take \ncare of the chairman's concern.\n  Not only is this amendment not threatening to the underlying purpose \nof this legislation, it is simply an amendment that balances the \npurpose of this commission so that it has some relationship to the \nstructure of our Congress. It says there ought to be recommendations \ngiven and they should be reported to the Senate as well as to the \nHouse; that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee should continue to \nconsider these recommendations, as it has done in the past.\n  I can't think of a more modest amendment one could raise with regard \nto this bill. It is based on a commission that was already approved \noverwhelmingly in the House of Representatives and supported by all of \nthose who support this legislation. All we are trying to do is have a \nsimilar requirement with respect to a report in the Senate. It couldn't \nbe more modest. It is a sign of how desperate the proponents of this \nlegislation are to get this thing through without even the possibility \nof a modest, logical change such as having the Senate as well as the \nHouse receive a report.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of my time if the \nopposition to the amendment will do the same?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on our \nside.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I yield back the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4120\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my understanding is we are now \nconsidering amendment No. 4120.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would delay the effective date of PNTR \nuntil the President can certify that China has provided a full \naccounting of activists who have been detained or imprisoned for their \nlabor activities and China is making ``substantial progress'' in \nreleasing these activists from prison.\n  What we are really talking about here is that this amendment calls \nupon the President to delay the effective date of PNTR until we get \nfrom China an accounting of those citizens who have now been imprisoned \nin China because they have tried to exert their human rights to \norganize and bargain collectively so they can make a decent wage, so \nthey can work under civilized working conditions, so they can support \ntheir families.\n  What we are talking about is we want to see some evidence that China \nhas made substantial progress in releasing these activists from prison. \nWe do not have an exhaustive list of all the labor activists who are \nnow serving prison terms in China. There are many of them about whom \nthe facts are unknown. That is one of the reasons this amendment calls \non China to provide a full accounting. But I will draw from what \nempirical evidence I have as a Senator, a Senator who is concerned \nabout human rights and the right of people to be able to organize their \nown independent unions. I will draw from two sources of information. \nThe first is the U.S. State Department Human Rights Report which \nactually confirms that the Chinese Government has been persecuting and \nincarcerating labor activists.\n  According to the State Department:\n\n       Independent trade unions are illegal. . . . Following the \n     signing of the International Covenant on Economic, Social, \n     and Cultural Rights in 1997, a number of labor activists \n     petitioned the Government [Chinese Government] to establish \n     free trade unions as allowed under the Covenant. The \n     Government has not approved the establishment of any \n     independent unions to date.\n\n  Now I will talk about some specific examples. First, I will draw from \nthe State Department report--our State Department report of this past \nyear.\n  Two activists in January were sentenced to reeducation through labor \nfor 18 months and 12 months, respectively. Why were they arrested? They \nwere leading steelworkers in a protest because they had not been paid \nwages.\n  In January of this year, another activist, the founder of the short-\nlived Association to Protect the Rights and Interests of Laid-Off \nWorkers, unsuccessfully appealed a 10-year prison sentence he \nreceived--10 years in prison. He had been convicted--for what? \n``Illegally providing intelligence to a foreign organization.'' What \nwas that foreign organization? It was a Radio Free Asia reporter, and \nhe was talking about worker protests in Hunan Province. For that, a 10-\nyear prison sentence. Do we not care about this?\n  In April of this year workers announced the formation of the Chinese \nAssociation to Protect Workers' Rights. In July, a labor activist and \nChina Democracy Party member was arrested on subversion charges. He was \narrested after taking part in a workers demonstration outside the \nprovincial government building. He was sentenced to 6 years in prison.\n\n  In July, another labor activist was sentenced to 10 years, and two \nothers were sentenced to 2 years in prison for subversion. What is it \nthat they had done wrong? They were out there trying to organize \nworkers and the family of one of these activists alleged that the \npolice hung him by his hands in order to extract information on fellow \ndissidents.\n  In August, another labor activist in China was given a 10-year prison \nsentence for illegal activities in the 1980s, and more recently he was \nalso thrown in prison because he had organized worker demonstrations. \nThis time he was convicted for providing human rights organizations \noverseas with information on protests--a 10-year sentence, prison \nsentence, for a man who had the courage to try to organize people and \nwho then went to human rights organizations overseas with information \nabout worker protests in China. He is now serving 10 years in prison.\n  Don't you believe we could at least ask China to provide us with some \ncredible information that they were now letting these people out of \nprison; that they were doing something about all of the people who have \nbeen imprisoned?\n  This list is compiled by the ILO--Senator Moynihan talked about the \nILO yesterday on the floor of the Senate. A 28-year-old worker in a \nHunan Province electrical machinery factory, was sentenced in 1989 to a \nlife sentence for hooliganism. His reduced sentence is being served in \nprison and he now has been told he will get out in the year 2007.\n  A manual worker in Shanghai and a member of the Workers Autonomous \nFederation was sentenced in 1993 to 9 years in Shanghai prison for \norganizing a counterrevolutionary group. That from the ILO--my \nevidence.\n  A worker, organizer of another Workers Autonomous Federation was \nsentenced to 13 years imprisonment--for hooliganism again. That is the \ncharge any time you demonstrate, any time you try to organize people, \nany time you have the courage to stand alone and speak up for \ndemocracy.\n  Another worker in Hunan, again, Yueyang City in Hunan, organizer of \nthe Workers Autonomous Federation, was sentenced to 15 years--same \ncharge, hooliganism.\n  A 39-year-old lecturer in the Comparative Literature Department at \nthe Language Institute in Beijing was sentenced in 1995 to 20 years in \nPrison No. 2 for organizing and leading a counterrevolutionary group, \nand for committing counterrevolutionary propaganda and incitement.\n\n[[Page S8488]]\n\n  A 30-year-old medical researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at \nBeijing's Anding Hospital was sentenced to 17 years in Prison No. 2 in \nBeijing for organizing and leading a counterrevolutionary group.\n  A 40-year-old worker at a chemicals accelerator fluid plant in \nBeijing was sentenced to 13 years in Prison No. 2 for organizing and \nleading a counterrevolutionary group.\n  Another activist was sentenced to 11 years in prison for organizing \nand leading a counterrevolutionary group.\n  Colleagues, I have other names and other examples. But I think there \nare several reasons why we should be concerned about the persecution \nand imprisonment of labor activists in China.\n  First of all, labor rights, the right to organize, recognized by \ninternational law, are a fundamental human right. When men and women \nhave the courage to stand up for justice at the workplace, they ought \nnot be locked up, they ought not be treated like animals, they ought \nnot be serving 10-, 12-, 14-year prison sentences in China, and we \nshould speak up for them.\n  Labor rights have been recognized in the documents that enshrine the \nmost basic principles of human rights. The Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights in 1948 states, ``Everyone has the right to peaceful \nassembly and association. Everyone has the right to form and join trade \nunions for the protection of his''--and I would add ``or her''--\n``interests.''\n  In a speech before the Industrial Relations Research Association in \nBoston this past January, former World Bank chief economist Joseph \nStiglitz laid out an argument that economic development needs to be \nseen as part of a transformation of society and that workers \norganizations, the right to form a union, is key to this developmental \nprocess.\n  Do my colleagues know what he was saying? He was saying what we know: \nIndependent unions and the right to form an independent union means you \nmake a better wage; it means you have people who have enough money to \nconsume; it means you are building a middle class; it means you have \nmore economic justice; it means you have more stability. That is what \nMr. Stiglitz was trying to say.\n  I will give my colleagues one more example of this brutality. An \nApril 23, 2000, story in the Washington Post reported:\n\n       The number of labor disputes in China has skyrocketed -- to \n     more than 120,000 in 1999--as workers, in unprecedented \n     numbers get laid off, are paid late, or not paid at all \n     and feel cheated by corrupt officials who sell state \n     property for a pittance to friends, relatives, and \n     colleagues.\n\n  We are talking about unsafe working conditions. We are talking about \nlow wages. We are talking about the fundamental right of workers in \nChina to organize and the compelling need, I believe, for us to support \nthis right.\n  I will finish in a moment so we can have some votes, although I am \nanxious to hear whether there is any response. Above and beyond the \nhuman rights question, above and beyond the fact that we should not be \nsilent--I have said this for the last several days--above and beyond \nthe fact that we should be willing to speak up and vote for the rights \nof people to organize independent unions in China, we should not let \nthis Government with impunity put people in prison for 12, 14, or 16 \nyears because they have done nothing more than try to speak up for \nthemselves and form a union so they can make a decent wage and they can \nsupport their families.\n  There is another reason. Senator Sarbanes spoke about this on the \nfloor of the Senate the other day. It is this: What we are going to see \nis not necessarily more exports to China but more investment in China. \nIf we do not speak up for the right of workers to organize in China, \nChina will become the export platform in this new international economy \nthat we talk about, and it will be a magnet for any kind of company \nthat wants to go there that knows it can freely exploit workers, pay \nworkers 3 cents an hour, 10 cents an hour, 6 cents an hour, 20 cents an \nhour, all of which is happening right now, working people from 8 in the \nmorning until 10 at night with a half an hour, at most, for a break. \nThat is what we are going to see.\n  I do not know how many Senators will consider this before they vote, \nbut if you do not want to vote for this amendment for human rights for \nworkers in China, vote for this amendment for the people you represent \nin your own States because I am telling you--and this is just the \nfuture I am predicting--that our failure to adopt these amendments, our \nfailure to focus on human rights, our failure to vote on human rights, \nour failure to vote on religious freedom, our failure to vote on the \nrights of people to organize and bargain collectively is going to lead \nto a new international economy where China, with the size of the \ncountry and the population, will become a magnet, it will become a low-\nwage export platform, and the people in your States are going to say to \nyou: Where were you when you were asked to vote for us? Now you are \nsaying to us, Senator, that you want us to compete against people who \nget paid as little as 3 cents an hour under the most brutal, \nexploitative labor conditions, and now we are losing our jobs as \ncompanies are leaving our States to go to China, and you had a chance \nto vote for the right for people to organize in China so they could \nmake a decent wage and those workers would not be played off against \nus, and you didn't vote for it?\n  My colleagues should vote for this amendment because a vote for this \namendment is not only a vote for human rights in China, not only a vote \nfor the right of people to organize in China, but, most important of \nall, what this amendment is really about is simply saying to the \nPresident, before going forward with normal trade relations with China, \nat least--and I want to read this again--at the very minimum, the \nPresident needs to certify China has provided a full accounting of \nthese activists who are detained or imprisoned for their labor \nactivities.\n\n  That is all the amendment asks, and China can show it is making \nsubstantial progress in releasing these activists from prison. That is \nwhat this amendment is about.\n  In a broader sense, this amendment is also about the right of people \nto organize and bargain collectively, and this is an amendment that \nsays why should the people we represent in our States be put in a \nsituation where they lose their jobs and where our communities lose \nbusinesses that go to China because they know they can pay miserably \nlow wages, where people wind up in prison if they should dare get a \nbetter job, where they can actually export products made with prison \nlabor, and we are not voting for amendments that give the people we \nrepresent in our own States some comfort that they themselves are not \ngoing to lose their jobs because of these absolutely brutal working \nconditions.\n  I do not think it is too much to vote for an amendment that asks for \nonly one little piece of this. We will delay the effective date of PNTR \nuntil the President can certify that the Chinese Government has \nprovided a full accounting of those people who have been detained or \nimprisoned for doing nothing more than trying to organize or trying to \nstand up for themselves and their families, and some accounting that \nthis Government is releasing these innocent men and women from prison \nwho have done nothing more than protest deplorable working conditions \nor tried to form an independent union. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I conclude this way, which is the way this debate started. We are \nforever being told that we live in a global economy, and that is true. \nFor some reason, too many of my colleagues do not want to recognize the \nimplications of this. For me, if we are now working and living in a \nglobal economy, that means if we are truly concerned about human \nrights, we can no longer just concern ourselves with human rights at \nhome.\n  If we are truly concerned about religious freedom, we can no longer \nonly concern ourselves with religious freedom at home. If we are truly \nconcerned about the right of workers to organize and bargain \ncollectively, and earn a better living for themselves and their \nfamilies, then we can no longer concern ourselves with labor rights \nonly at home. If we are truly concerned about the environment, we can \nno longer concern ourselves with the environment only at home.\n  I will say it one final time: The men and women in this world, who \nhave been engaged in human rights issues, have long understood an \nessential, basic truth which is this: Americans,\n\n[[Page S8489]]\n\nSenators can never be indifferent to the desperate circumstances of \nexploited and abused people in the far reaches of the globe. When the \nmost basic human rights and basic freedoms of others are infringed or \nendangered, we are diminished by our failure to speak out.\n  This amendment is a test case of whether or not we are willing to \nspeak out. I say to my colleagues, since this is my last amendment, I \nbelieve we have made a big mistake--we will see what history shows us--\nin the rush to pass this piece of legislation. I think we have made a \nmistake because I believe the consequences, over the next 2, 3, 4, 5, \n6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years will be very harsh.\n  I believe the economics in this global economy we are all talking \nabout will become a major axis of American politics. I believe the \npeople that we represent are going to want to know where each of us \nstood. I believe we should have been making the effort to make sure \nthis new global economy--with China being such a major actor--would be \nan economy not only working for big multinational corporations and big \nfinancial institutions, which I know are very interested in passing \nthis, but it would also be a global economy that works for working \npeople, a global economy that works for human rights, a global economy \nthat works for children, a global economy that works for the \nenvironment.\n  I will say--and I am sorry because none of us can be sure we are \nright; and I understand that--I have not, in the course of this debate, \nseen very many Senators come out and present any empirical evidence to \nthe contrary of what I have had to say about these basic rights of \npeople. Why is it that we just turn our gaze away from this? I do not \nunderstand it.\n  I also think we have made a mistake in another way, I say to the \nPresiding Officer. I think we have made a mistake in the stampede to \npass this legislation, in this rush to passage, in this argument that \nwe dare not even pass an amendment. Even if it deals with the right of \npeople to practice their religion, even if it puts the U.S. Senate and \nour country and our Government on the side of human rights, we cannot \ndo that because then it would go to conference committee. I do not \nunderstand that argument, not when you think about what the stakes are, \nnot when you think about this in personal terms.\n  Whatever happened to the voice of the Senate? Whatever happened to \nthe strong clarion call for the Government of China, and all \ngovernments in the world, to respect the human rights of their \ncitizens? Whatever happened to our justice voice? Whatever happened to \nour human rights voice? Why were these concerns trumped by this \nheadlong stampede and rush to pass this legislation?\n  I conclude my remarks this way: We will see what happens in the \nfuture.\n  I thank my colleagues for their graciousness. I hope Senators will \nvote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The galleries are advised not to show any type \nof approval or disapproval.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my colleague's \namendment. I do not intend to address the merits of his proposal as a \nmatter of U.S. labor law. Rather, my point is a far simpler one.\n  The current business of this body is a bill to normalize our trade \nrelationship with China. This amendment simply does not belong on H.R. \n4444 and has nothing to do with China's trade status under our law.\n  But, the price of adopting the amendment could be very high for every \nworking man and woman in the United States. The reason is that the \namendment could result in delay or defeat of PNTR and the grant of PNTR \nis the one step we absolutely must take to ensure that American \nworkers, together with American farmers and American businesses, reap \nthe benefits of China's market access commitments under the WTO.\n  What we would be sacrificing is, according to independent economic \nanalysis, $13 billion in additional U.S. export sales annually. \nExpanding our export sales, as has been reiterated a number of times \nalready in this debate, creates new jobs. And I point out, jobs in U.S. \nexport sectors pay 15 percent more and provide 32 percent more in \nbenefits than average.\n  What that means in practical terms is that the passage of PNTR and \nthe exports we expect to expand under the WTO agreement with the \nChinese provide real, tangible benefits to workers in American society.\n  I ask, as a consequence, that my colleagues join me in opposing the \nproposed amendment.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota, are you ready to yield back time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have a very quick response to my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the \nWashington Post, dated January 11, 2000, entitled ``No Workers' \nParadise'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 11, 2000]\n\n                          No Workers' Paradise\n\n                           (By John Pomfret)\n\n       Shenzhen, China--Fei Mingli, a slight teenager from Sichuan \n     province, came to this bustling Chinese factory town in 1998 \n     to seek her fortune in a textile factory, cranking out \n     bluejeans and tank tops for the Western world. Sometime after \n     midnight July 22, she went out for a walk.\n       Dogs patrolling the factory grounds attacked the 17-year-\n     old, breaking her right leg and ripping chunks from her nose, \n     head and elbows. Fei had violated a company rule that ordered \n     all workers locked in their dormitories by midnight. She was \n     hospitalized for 62 days.\n       When her father came to Shenzhen asking for compensation, \n     the factory bosses added insult to her injuries by firing the \n     girl and paying only medical expenses.\n       Fei's case could have sunk into the oblivion of hundreds of \n     thousands of others like hers in China, where workers' rights \n     are routinely sacrificed at the altar of economic \n     development. But Fei and her father beat a path to a man who \n     has become famous for standing up for workers in a country \n     with one of the worst occupational safety records in the \n     world.\n       Lawyer Zhou Litai took the case, and late last year, after \n     proving that the factory did not have a dog permit and that \n     there had been six similar attacks since 1994, he won Fei a \n     $6,000 settlement--a big chunk of change in a country where \n     millions of laborers barely clear $1,000 a year.\n       ``Lawyer Zhou is a good man,'' said Fei Zhongming, Mingli's \n     father. ``Without him, we would have had nothing. He won \n     justice for us.''\n       China once advertised itself as a socialist workers' \n     paradise. But in its mad rush to become a modern \n     industrialized nation in the 20 years since economic reforms \n     opened doors to the West, China's cutthroat system has \n     victimized average laborers. With China preparing to enter \n     the World Trade Organization, the United States and other \n     advanced nations have pushed for some type of binding \n     international labor standards; this was one of the issues \n     behind demonstrations during he WTO's meeting in Seattle in \n     November. But China and other developing countries have \n     opposed such standards.\n       In the first nine months of last year, 3,464 miners died in \n     China--about the same as 1998--one of the worst rates per ton \n     of minerals mined in the world. The only place where official \n     statistics have been released for industrial accidents is \n     Shenzhen. In 1998, 12,189 workers were seriously injured and \n     80 died in industrial accidents in its 9,582 factories, \n     although the real number is believed to be much higher.\n       More than 90 percent of those injured lost a limb. \n     Statistics from the state hospital in Shenzhen's Bao'an \n     county tell a gruesome tale. In the hospital's Building 7, 47 \n     patients have lost hands; in Building 6, 21 patients have \n     third-degree burns; in Building 5, 42 patients have lost \n     legs.\n       After a ferry sank in November, killing 280 people, China's \n     Communist Party leadership called for a nationwide workplace \n     safety inspection campaign and acknowledged that despite \n     years of hand-wringing about the importance of safety, \n     serious health and safety hazards remain.\n       ``Since 1980, labor standards in China have gotten worse,'' \n     said Anita Chan, a senior research fellow of the Australian \n     Research Council and an expert on China's labor issues. ``In \n     the state sector, workers are losing their jobs, so labor \n     standards are almost as bad as foreign-funded or private-\n     sector factories in inland provinces. . . . As for foreign-\n     funded factories, exploitation and abuses have not diminished \n     in the 1990s. If anything, because of the Asian economic \n     crisis, it has gotten worse.''\n       Attempts by workers to seek help from the government \n     usually end in failure. The Communist government only allows \n     one union to exist--the All-China Federation of Trade \n     Unions--and it has crushed any attempt to organize \n     independent unions. The ACFTU is generally viewed as a \n     mouthpiece for the Communist Party, although in recent years \n     it has fought quietly against some policies and laws that are \n     clearly antilabor.\n       Born in Sichuan 42 years ago, Zhou was yanked out of school \n     by his parents in third grade and put to work on the land. \n     When he was 17, his father sent him to the forbidding\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n     Tibetan plateau as a soldier. He served for five years in \n     some of the harshest conditions on earth.\n       In 1979, he returned to Sichuan but again had to leave home \n     because his family was too poor to feed him. Zhou found work \n     in a brick factory in Hunan province, making a few dollars a \n     month lugging 220-pound bags of coal and handling scalding \n     bricks that singed the skin off his hands, arms and chest.\n       ``It was normal for the factory not to pay the workers,'' \n     Zhou recalled. ``People were fired for nothing. People were \n     beaten. It was bad.''\n       A friend encouraged Zhou to learn a skill. He took to law, \n     perhaps, he said, because he was infuriated by the \n     exploitation around him. In 1986, he set up shop in Kaixian, \n     his home town, in a poor county close to the smoky metropolis \n     of Chongqing.\n       Ten years later, Zhou took the first case that would \n     catapult him into national prominence but also land him in \n     serious debt. In May 1996, a husband and wife, both workers \n     at the Happy Toy Factory in Shenzhen, were walking on the \n     factory grounds when they were killed by a delivery truck. \n     The factory denied responsibility for their deaths, leaving \n     the couple's three young children and their aging parents \n     penniless.\n       The grandparents and the children were living in Sichuan--\n     source for most of the cheap labor that has driven the \n     economic miracle along China's eastern coast. They came to \n     Zhou as a last resort. No lawyer in Shenzhen would take such \n     cases because local governments had warned them against \n     ``affecting the investment environment,'' Zhou said.\n       As an outsider, Zhou could run a risk. He sued the Happy \n     Toy Factory and won $40,000--marking the first time in \n     Communist China that a court had ordered a factory to pay \n     damages to the family of deceased workers.\n       Zhou's experience in Shenzhen, meeting maimed workers with \n     tales of exploitation, 18-hour shifts, dormitory lock-downs, \n     dog attacks and decrepit machinery, convinced him that his \n     life's work lay not in Sichuan, but with the Sichuanese who \n     had come to Shenzhen.\n       ``If you don't protect your workers, it doesn't matter how \n     good your products are,'' he said. ``You are creating a \n     social volcano.''\n       Since the toy factory case, Zhou has filed 200 other \n     lawsuits in courts around Shenzhen. He has won 30; most of \n     the others are still pending. He sometimes works on \n     contingency and also receives donations. Along the way, he \n     has angered the Shenzhen city government, which tried to \n     disbar him in 1997 but lost in court.\n       In late 1997, Zhou found a house in a rough-and-tumble \n     neighborhood on the outskirts of Shenzhen. Since then, 70 \n     injured workers, out of jobs and penniless, have lived with \n     him.\n       Running the house has thrown Zhou into debt to the tune of \n     thousands of dollars. It has not helped that some of his \n     guests have skipped town after winning their cases without \n     paying him for room and board.\n       Most of Zhou's adversaries are factories run by Taiwanese, \n     Hong Kong or South Korean companies, which work on a contract \n     basis for Western firms. He has yet to sue a Japanese or \n     American company, he said, because their labor conditions are \n     better.\n       Workers in Shenzhen say the most dangerous machine is a \n     mold for plastic products called a piji. One false move and a \n     limb can be crushed by huge metal slabs at pressures varying \n     from 40 to 500 tons.\n       It was on such a machine that Peng Guangzhong lost his \n     right arm last spring. The factory had failed to buy \n     insurance, so his employers fired the 20-year-old \n     immediately. Then, because of his injury, Peng's girlfriend \n     dumped him. He attempted suicide. An arbitration committee \n     said the factory should pay him $4,500. With Zhou's help, \n     Peng sued and won $21,000 in court.\n       ``Lawyer Zhou saved my life,'' Peng said. ``Without him, \n     I'd be dead.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will read a couple of paragraphs from the article. \nThis was written by John Pomfret:\n\n       China once advertised itself as a socialist workers' \n     paradise. But in its mad rush to become a modern \n     industrialized nation in the 20 years since economic reforms \n     opened doors to the West, China's cutthroat system has \n     victimized average laborers.\n\n  Then it goes on to say:\n\n       ``Since 1980, labor standards in China have gotten worse,'' \n     said Anita Chan, a senior research fellow of the Australian \n     Research Council and an expert on China's labor issues.\n\n  I could go on and on.\n  I say to my colleague from Delaware, there are three parts to his \nargument that trouble me. First of all, this amendment has everything \nin the world to do with what is going on in China. This is not an \namendment about labor law reform in the United States. That is an \namendment I will bring to the floor at the very beginning of the next \nCongress. We will have a full debate about the right of people to \norganize in our country.\n  This is about China. This is about labor conditions in China. This \namendment is about people who have been imprisoned because they have \ndone nothing more than to speak out and protest against working \nconditions or trying to form a union.\n  This amendment just says, before the President goes forward, let's \ncertify that China is willing to let these people out of prison, and \nthat we are going to get some certification of some progress in that \narea. That is all this amendment is about.\n  The second thing I would say to my colleague from Delaware --we have \nhad some of this discussion before--is that even if I believed he was \nright--and I think he is wrong--that actually we are going to see more \nexports that will lead to higher wages for American citizens, I do not \nbelieve people in the United States of America would be comfortable \nwith the proposition that is being made on the floor of the Senate, at \nleast by some, that since there is profit to be made, and more money to \nbe made, and maybe more workers will do better in our country--which I \nwill question in a moment--we should, therefore, turn a blind eye, turn \nour gaze away from these deplorable conditions; that we should not be \nconcerned about the persecution of people who are trying to practice \ntheir religion; that we should not be concerned about human rights; \nthat we should not be concerned about people who are imprisoned because \nthey are trying to form a labor union. I do not believe most people in \nMinnesota or people in the country believe that.\n  Most people in Minnesota and the country believe these issues should \nbe of concern to the U.S. Senators. We, after all, are representing \npeople in our Nation. I think it is a very sad day when the United \nStates of America refuses to speak out for human rights in any country.\n  Indeed, this will be a debate that will go on. What will happen is, \ngiven the fact that we have Wal-Marts paying about 13 cents an hour--\nand I have given examples of companies paying far less--China is going \nto become the export platform where people know that if they should \ndare to try to organize a union, they are going to be thrown in prison. \nSo all these multinational corporations have carte blanche approval to \ngo to China, pay hardly anything in wages, have people working under \ndeplorable working conditions, and we are going to lose jobs.\n  We are not going to see a lot more exports. We will see a lot more \ninvestment. What better place to invest for some of the multinational \ncorporations than a country where you know you don't have to worry \nabout paying good wages, you know you don't have to worry about safe \nworking conditions because, if people dare to protest or challenge this \nfor the sake of themselves or their families, they wind up in prison.

We \nhave a responsibility to take that bill seriously, to actually examine \nits contents.\n  All my amendment will do is, first, require the Congressional-\nExecutive Commission to make recommendations in its report. Secondly, \nwe would require the commission to report to the Senate as well as to \nthe House. Currently, under the bill, the commission reports only to \nthe House International Relations Committee. And third, it will create \na mechanism whereby any Member of the Senate can call the commission \nrecommendations up on the floor so that these issues are not the \nexclusive purview of certain committees.\n  The amendment will not require the commission to affirmatively \napprove extension of PNTR. It will not infringe on any Member's right \nto amend legislation on the floor.\n  I think it is difficult to argue that this amendment does not improve \nthe commission and the bill. I urge my colleagues to take this process \nseriously. I urge them to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Delaware has 1 minute.\n\n[[Page S8492]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I oppose the Feingold amendment.

Mr. President, I have cited both the State Department \nReport on Human Rights and the International Labor Organization report \nthis past year of courageous men and women who have done nothing more \nthan protest deplorable working conditions and try to organize and \nbargain collectively and are now in prison.\n  This amendment simply says that PNTR depends upon an accounting from \nthe Chinese Government about these people who are in prison and helps \nCongress in releasing these people from prison. I say to my colleagues, \nI believe during this debate we have put human rights concerns aside; \nwe have put the rights of people who practice religion aside. These \nquestions dealing with human rights, whether people are free to \npractice their religion, or whether people are free to protest \ndeplorable working conditions, are important concerns. Thank you for \ngiving me the opportunity to speak out on these. I hope I will get a \ngood vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment would unilaterally impose \nconditions on the normalization of our trade relations with China that \nwould backfire by effectively barring access of U.S. companies to the \nChinese markets on terms at least as good as other WTO members. The \namendment would also eliminate the positive force that American \ncompanies can play in the Chinese market by potentially leading to the \ndelay in PNTR and cutting off the benefit of China's market access \ncommitment for U.S. firms.\n  The amendment would have the perverse effect of narrowing the private \nsector in China in which some limited organizing is permitted. The \npoint of this bill is to level the playing field between the United \nStates and China, all of which would be forfeited if this amendment \npasses and becomes law.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

I also ask that\n\n[[Page S8493]]\n\nno motions to commit or recommit be in order.\n  Those remaining first-degree amendments are as follows: Feingold, \nregarding a commission; Hollings No. 4134; Hollings No. 4135; Hollings \nNo. 4136; Hollings No. 4137; B.

However, votes can be expected throughout the \nday tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly applaud and congratulate the two \nmanagers of this bill to arrive at a point of a finite number of \namendments with time limits.\n  I say to the Senate in general, however, that just because these \namendments were in order doesn't mean the Senators have to offer them, \nand just because all the time agreements have been listed doesn't mean \npeople have to use that time. I hope the two leaders work toward \nfinding a way we can finish this bill tomorrow evening. There is a \ntremendous amount of work still left to be done in the Senate. I hope \nto finally resolve this legislation sometime tomorrow.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I very much support that view, and I \nthink our indefatigable chairman might also agree.\n  Mr. ROTH. I assure the distinguished colleagues I want to move as \nexpeditiously as possible toward completion of this critically \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. If I might say, these amendments get 18 votes, 22 \nvotes; we now have a pattern.\n  The Senate made its decision about this legislation midday. The \nsooner we are in the aftermath, the better relations will be, and the \nSenate can go on to other business.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Smith amendment \nto H.R. 4444, the bill to extend permanent normal trade relations to \nthe People's Republic of China. The Smith amendment would have extended \nthe mandate of the Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's \nRepublic of China to include responsibility for monitoring and \nreporting on organ harvesting in China. For years, chilling reports \nhave emerged out of China, detailing horrific scenarios in which organs \nare illicitly harvested for profit from executed prisoners. It is my \nunderstanding that the Chinese government has failed to take action to \nstop the criminal elements responsible for these abhorrent practices. \nCertainly careful monitoring and reporting on this issue is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today the Senate voted on several \namendments to the bill establishing permanent normal trade relations \nstatus for the People's Republic of China. Regrettably, I was unable to \nregister my votes on these amendments. Following are my thoughts \nregarding a few.\n  With respect to the amendment offered by Senator Byrd regarding \npotential import surges from China, I must state my opposition. While \nthe Senator from West Virginia deserves credit in his effort to protect \nthe American worker, the anti-dumping and surge protection mechanisms \ncontained in the bilateral agreement brokered between the U.S. and \nChina were crafted to address this very issue. Recognizing these two \nissues were considered ``deal breakers'' by U.S. trade interests, I \nhave every reason to believe his concerns have been addressed.\n  I must also state my opposition to Senator Bob Smith's amendment \nregarding the harvesting and transplanting of human organs. Without \nquestion, the issue of human rights and the treatment of Chinese \ncitizens should be of upmost concern to every American. I believe the \nhuman rights provisions agreed to in H.R. 4444 were established to \nconquer and address such atrocities.\n  In particular, I would have also supported the effort to table the \namendment offered by Senator Thompson. I have for quite some time, to \nthe knowledge of my constituency in Washington and my colleagues here \nin the Senate, criticized the Clinton-Gore administration's approach to \nnon-proliferation issues with China. However, I do not believe that \nCongress, by creating an entirely new sanctions policy or by \nestablishing an additional layer of export controls, can effectively \naddress these concerns nor strengthen U.S. national security. We must \napproach these measures with caution, we will approach them with a new \nadministration, and we must recognize that when we confront China about \nthese terribly significant issues, we will be approaching them as a \ntrading ``partner''. If in the coming years China does not \nappropriately address the issues of non-proliferation, I assure my \ncolleagues that I will be the first to raise concern.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues \na letter from numerous agricultural producers and organizations \nopposing any and all amendments to the bill to grant permanent normal \ntrade relations to the People's Republic of China. This letter \nspecifies the dangers the pending amendment relative to Chinese non-\nproliferation requirements would pose to agricultural producers.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                               September 12, 2000.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: It is critical to American agriculture \n     that H.R. 4444, the China Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n     (PNTR) legislation, moves forward without amendment. Any \n     amendments would require another vote in the House of \n     Representatives and send China and our competitors the \n     message that the United States is not serious about opening \n     the China market to U.S. products.\n       The Thompson amendment would require the President to \n     implement sanctions under various circumstances. Unilateral \n     sanctions have the effect to giving U.S. markets to our \n     competitors. While there are efforts to exempt food, medicine \n     and agriculture from the existing language, American \n     agricultural producers, regardless of exemptions, would be \n     put at risk. If the United States sanctions or even threatens \n     sanctions for any products, agriculture is often first on the \n     other country's retaliation list.\n       Additionally, further consideration of the China \n     Nonproliferation bill should not delay action on a vote for \n     PNTR. The U.S. agriculture industry continues to face \n     depressed prices. Agricultural producers and food \n     manufacturers should not have to face burdens erected by \n     their own government such as unilateral sanctions or failure \n     to pass PNTR.\n       We urgently request your help in achieving a positive vote \n     on PNTR without amendment.\n       Thank you for your help and we look forward to working with \n     you on these important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n         AgriBank,\n         Agricultural Retailers Association,\n         Alabama Farmers Federation,\n         American Crop Protection Association,\n         American Farm Bureau Federation,\n         American Feed Industry Association,\n         American Meat Institute,\n         American Seed Trade Association,\n         American Soybean Association,\n         Animal Health Institute,\n         Archer Daniels Midland Company,\n         Biotechnology Industry Organization,\n         Bunge Corporation,\n         Cargill, Inc.,\n         Cenex Harvest States,\n         Central Soya Company; Inc.,\n         Crestar USA,\n         CF Industries, Inc.,\n         Chocolate Manufacturers Association,\n         CoBank,\n         Distilled Spirits Council of the United States,\n         DuPont,\n         Farmland Industries, Inc.,\n         Grocery Manufacturers of America,\n         IMC Global Inc.,\n         Independent Community Bankers of America,\n         International Dairy Foods Association,\n         Land O'Lakes,\n         Louis Dreyfus Corporation,\n         National Association of State Departments of Agriculture,\n         National Association of Wheat Growers,\n         National Barley Growers Association,\n         National Cattlemen's Beef Association,\n         National Chicken Council,\n         National Confectioners Association,\n         National Corn Growers Association,\n         National Council of Farmer Cooperatives,\n         National Food Processors Association,\n         National Grain and Feed Association,\n\n[[Page S8494]]\n\n         National Grange,\n         National Milk Producers Federation,\n         National Oilseed Processors Association,\n         National Pork Producers Council,\n         National Potato Council,\n         National Renderers Association,\n         National Sunflower Association,\n         North American Export Grain Association,\n         North American Millers' Association,\n         Pet Food Institute,\n         Pioneer Hi-Bred International,\n         Rice Millers' Association,\n         Snack Food Association,\n         Sunkist Growers,\n         The Fertilizer Institute,\n         United Egg Association,\n         United Egg Producers,\n         USA Poultry and Egg Export Council,\n         U.S. Canola Association,\n         U.S. Dairy Export Council,\n         U.S. Meat Export Federation,\n         U.S. Rice Producers Association,\n         U.S. Rice Producers' Group,\n         U.S. Wheat Associates,\n         Wheat Export Trade Education Committee,\n         Zeeland Farm Soya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8494-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the issue of \nthe marriage penalty. Today, the House of Representatives voted \noverwhelmingly, 270-158, in favor of eliminating the marriage penalty \ntax. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean it is going to become law because \nthe President has vetoed the bill, and even the overwhelming margin of \n270-158 is not enough to override the President's veto.\n  So 21 million American couples are going to have to suffer an \ninequity in the Tax Code again this year. They are going to have to \nsuffer and pay $1,400, average, in taxes just because they decided to \nget married. If two people, a policeman and a schoolteacher, get \nmarried, they get hit the hardest because they suffer from the marriage \npenalty tax.\n  I am very proud of the House of Representatives for trying to \noverride the President's veto. I am proud that they spoke \noverwhelmingly, even though it was 20 votes shy of the two-thirds \nmajority that was necessary. But we need to fix the marriage penalty \ntax. We need a President who will sign marriage penalty relief, and we \nneed a President who will work with us to have real tax relief for the \ncitizens of our country who are working so hard to make this economy \ngreat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8494-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE AWARDING OF THE PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM TO SENATOR GEORGE \n                                McGOVERN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride and \nsatisfaction to address an occasion of great significance that occurred \nduring the Senate's August recess. On August 9, President Clinton \nawarded the highly prestigious Medal of Freedom to former United States \nSenator George McGovern. This medal is the very highest award presented \nto civilians by the United States Government, and is an honor that is \nrichly deserved.\n  Throughout his long and remarkable career, George McGovern has \ndistinguished himself as a scholar, a political leader, a humanitarian \nand a person of extraordinary integrity. A generation of American \npolitical leaders still define themselves as McGovern Democrats.'' At \nDakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell, South Dakota, George McGovern \neffectively emphasized the great importance of public service and civic \ninvolvement. As President Kennedy's Director of Food for Peace he \nhelped launch our nation's commitment to combat world hunger. On the \nfloor of the United States Senate, McGovern was a powerful voice for \nrural America, for our nation's disadvantaged, as well as for an end to \nthe Viet Nam conflict. Today, as ambassador to the United Nations Food \nand Agricultural Organization in Rome, Ambassador McGovern has \ncontinued his work on nutrition and has articulated a visionary plan \nfor a world school lunch program.\n  As my colleagues are very aware, Senator McGovern won the Democratic \nnomination for President of the United States in l972 in what turned \nout to be an unsuccessful presidential campaign. Historians will long \nponder what the course of American history might have been if that \ncampaign had turned out differently. But we don't have to wait for the \njudgment of historians to know George McGovern's life has had an \nincredibly important and lasting impact on America and the world. \nGeorge continues to persevere and his commitment to a better planet \ncontinues to shine.\n  We in South Dakota understandably feel a profound pride in the life \nand career of George McGovern--a son of a South Dakota minister, a \nmilitary hero, a national political leader, and a diplomat of the \nhighest order. I extend my enthusiastic congratulations to Senator \nMcGovern and wish he and his family the very best as he continues his \ncritically important work in Rome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8494-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the \nColumbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on \nsensible gun legislation.\n  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. \nUntil we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of \nthose who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and \nwe will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.\n  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight.

September 13, 1999: Jonathan Holmes, 32, Detroit, MI; Edward \nLuckenbill, 51, Louisville, KY; Adrian Offutt, 19, Louisville, KY; \nFinnis Parron, 31, Houston, TX; Sherlyn Robinson, 37, Houston, TX; \nUnidentified Male, 29, Norfolk, VA; and Unidentified Male, 43, Norfolk, \nVA.\n  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. \nThe deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to \nenact sensible gun legislation now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8494-5", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8494-S8495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARKETING VIOLENCE TO CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the Senate Commerce Committee held a \nhearing today on the critical issue of the entertainment industry's \nmarketing of violent material to children. While I am not a member of \nthe Senate Commerce Committee, I appreciated Chairman McCain and \nRanking Member Hollings giving me the opportunity to share my \nperspective as the parent of three children and some insights on the \nissue I have gained from a series of youth violence meetings in South \nDakota.\n  In response to the numerous school shootings around our country, I've \nheld a series of roundtable discussions in South Dakota with parents, \nstudents, school officials, and local law enforcement. I heard \nrepeatedly from parents and students themselves that no one believes \nthat explicitly violent movies, video games, or music are the sole \ncauses for violence among our nation's youth. However, South Dakota \nstudents acknowledged that the entertainment industry has a large \ninfluence on their daily lives, and South Dakota parents specifically \nasked for additional resources they can use to help keep violent \nmaterial out of their children's hands.\n  My wife, Barbara, and I recently accompanied our youngest child to \nher first day at college. Seeing our daughter settle into her new home \nin the freshman dormitory brought feelings of sadness at the inevitable \npassage of time. Barbara and I also were relieved, in a sense, by the \nfact that our daughter's first day of college also marked the \nsuccessful completion of her childhood. I can sympathize with the \nparents of children just entering their teen years who are concerned \nthat it will be increasingly difficult to keep objectionable material \nfrom their sons and daughters as they grow up.\n  That is why I am troubled by the results of the Federal Trade \nCommission's (FTC) Report on the Marketing\n\n[[Page S8495]]\n\nof Violent Entertainment to Children. As you know, the President asked \nthe FTC to investigate two simple questions: Do the movie, music \nrecording, and computer game industries market to young people products \nthat contain violent content in a way that undermines the ratings they \nthemselves apply to their products? If so, is that target marketing \nintentional? According to the recently-released FTC report, the answer \nto both questions appears to be yes.''\n  The FTC report found that 80 percent of movies rated R'' for violence \nwere targeted to children under 17. A movie industry document even \nacknowledged that [o]ur goal was to find the elusive teen target \naudience and make sure everyone between the ages of 12-18 was exposed \nto the film.'' Another document spoke of using youth groups such as Boy \nScouts, Girl Scouts, and 4-H Clubs in the market testing of R-rated'' \nfilms.\n  Teenagers apparently have also been the target of the music \nindustry's efforts to sell CDs with explicit content labels. According \nto the FTC report, all music recordings used in the study were in some \nway targeted toward children under 17. This practice included the \nplacing advertising in media specifically aimed at a youth audience. \nFinally, the FTC report noted that 70 percent of all video games with \n``Mature'' ratings for violence were targeted toward youth.\n  It is important to note that the FTC report also conducted studies on \nchildren's ability to access these products. The FTC found that most \nretailers make little effort to restrict children's access to products \nwith violent content. Almost half of the movie theaters used in the \nstudy admitted children ages 13 to 16 to R-rated'' films even when not \naccompanied by an adult. The FTC study also showed that unaccompanied \nchildren were able to buy explicit recordings and Mature-rated'' video \ngames 85 percent of the time.\n  The FTC's findings are staggering, and I am eager to hear the \nentertainment industry's response to the report. Clearly, the \nentertainment industry and its retail partners must refocus their \nefforts and work with the FTC and concerned members of Congress like \nmyself to keep violent material out of the hands of children.\n  It is my hope that the entertainment industry will take this \nopportunity to help restore the faith of the American public in its \nvoluntary ratings system. Parents in South Dakota and around the \ncountry must also have resources they can trust to help them prevent \nyouth violence in their own communities.\n  I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues and members of \nthe industry on ways to keep violent material out of the hands of \nchildren without infringing on fundamental First Amendment rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8495-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8495]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Today I offer a tribute to a great Floridian who \nhas advanced the cause of quality judicial appointments to an \nindependent Federal judiciary: Mr. Benjamin Hill III of Tampa.\n  For four years, Mr. Hill has served as chairman of Florida's non-\npartisan Federal Judicial Nominating Commission, which screens \ncandidates for federal judgeships. Mr. Hill has done an outstanding job \nof leading the Commission and saluting the principle that those \nappointed to the federal judiciary should be among the best in the \nlegal profession.\n  This year the United States Senate has confirmed six new federal \njudges for Florida; five in the Middle District and one in the Southern \nDistrict. The investiture ceremony for two of those new judges, the \nHonorable James Moody and the Honorable James David Whittemore, will be \nheld September 18, 2000, in Tampa, Florida, followed by other \ninvestitures elsewhere in our state. The federal judiciary, the legal \nprofession and the public welcome these new federal judges.\n  As we applaud new jurists, we also recognize the tireless work of Mr. \nHill in managing a judicial-selection process focused on meritorious \nappointments. A leader in his community, his church and his profession, \nMr. Hill is a past president of the Florida Bar and a current member of \nthe Board of Governors Executive Committee of the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  The United States Constitution specifies that one of the functions of\n\n[[Page S8496]]\n\nthe United States Senate is to offer ``advice and consent'' on the \nexecutive branch's nominations, which includes the nomination of \nfederal judges for our independent judiciary.\n  Perhaps the most visible aspect of the advise-and-consent clause is \nthe Senate's power to confirm nominations or reject them, thus denying \nconsent. There are myriad ways to offer advice to the executive branch; \nhere's a brief description of our process in Florida.\n  Florida's Federal Judicial Nominating Commission, a diverse non-\npolitical panel comprised of attorneys and lay persons, receives and \nreviews applications from prospective federal judges. The Commission \nforwards top candidates to my attention. This screening process evolved \nso that Senator Connie Mack and I jointly interviewed leading \napplicants and made joint recommendations to the White House.\n  During the period that Mr. Hill has served as chairman of this \nCommission, the United States Senate has confirmed the nominations of \nthe following Floridians to serve as United States District Court \njudges:\n\n                            Middle District\n\n     The Honorable John Antoon II\n     The Honorable Richard Lazzara\n     The Honorable James Moody\n     The Honorable Gregory Presnell\n     The Honorable John Steele\n     The Honorable James David Whittemore\n\n\n                           Northern District\n\n     The Honorable Stephan Mickle\n\n\n                           Southern District\n\n     The Honorable William P. Dimitrouleas\n     The Honorable Alan Gold\n     The Honorable Paul C. Huck\n     The Honorable Adalberto Jordan\n     The Honorable Donald Middlebrooks\n     The Honorable Patricia A. Seitz\n\n  By any measure, this is an impressive list. We express our \nappreciation to the Senate Judiciary Committee and its chairman, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, for prompt and thorough review of nominees from \nFlorida.\n  As we approach the end of the 106th Congress, we salute the citizen \ninvolvement of the dedicated men and women who serve on Florida's \nFederal Judicial Nominating Commission.

Mr President, the Speaker of the House of the \nNevada State Assembly is one of Nevada's treasures and he happens to be \na very close personal friend of mine.\n  I have been privileged to know Joe Dini since I first served with him \nin the state assembly during the 1969 legislative session and I \ncontinue to value his friendship.\n  Joe Dini was born and raised in the small town of Yerington, NV, he \nattended the University of Nevada and returned to the community of his \nbirth to work along side his father in the family business.\n  In 1966 he was elected to the Nevada State Assembly, the first of his \n17 terms; a record unrivaled since our state entered the union in 1864.\n  As a legislator, he has become the legislature's leading authority on \nwestern water issues. He served on the Western States Water Council and \nchaired the Water Policy Committee of the Council of State Governments-\nWest.\n  In 1973, he was selected by his colleagues to serve a Speaker Pro \nTempore and the following session, in 1975, as Majority Leader.\n  During his long and distinguished tenure, the State of Nevada has \nundergone dramatic changes. The state's population has increased by \nmore than five fold. Nevada has become more urban and most of the \nstate's population growth has been in Southern Nevada which now \naccounts for two-thirds of the state's population.\n  Not only is Joe Dini the longest serving member of the Assembly, but \nhe has also been elected by his peers as the Speaker of the Nevada \nState Assembly an unprecedented eight times. Another record \nunparalleled in our state's history.\n  This extraordinary accomplishment is even more remarkable when one \nconsiders that rural Nevada, Joe Dini's political base, today \nrepresents just 15 percent of the state's over all population. He is a \nNevada treasure, the likes of which we will surely not see again.\n  Now in the twilight of his career of public service, he is being \nshowered with the honors and recognition he so richly deserves.\n  As with so many of us who have pursued a life of public service, \nJoe's family, his wife and his children have sacrificed much to make \nhis service possible. Nevadans owe a debt of gratitude to Joe Dini's \nfamily as well.\n  I am pleased to join with Joe's many friends in paying my respect, to \nmy friend--the much loved and respected, and Pizen Switch's number one \ncitizen, Joe Dini.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8496-2", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROGER SANT\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my privilege to recognize \nthe truly world-changing efforts of Roger Sant, a distinguished and \nsuccessful businessman who, in his six years as Chairman of World \nWildlife Fund, has brought profound changes to the way conservation is \naccomplished here in the United States and, indeed, around the world.\n  Having taught corporate finance at Stanford University's Graduate \nSchool of Business early in his career, Mr. Sant moved east to lead the \nFord Administration's energy conservation efforts as head of the energy \nconservation program at the Federal Energy Administration. In 1981, he \nfounded AES Corporation, a publicly held global power company \ncharacterized by its innovative approaches to energy production. \nThroughout his career, culminating in his chairmanship of WWF, Mr. Sant \nhas been committed to conservation in all its aspects, inspired by the \nimperative of leaving a living planet to future generations.\n  As the involved and inspiring chairman of World Wildlife Fund, Mr. \nSant has encouraged the organization to think big, working to achieve \nconservation results at a new ecoregional, landscape scale. He has \napplied his business acumen as well as a range of skills and approaches \nhoned through his work in government, academia, and the nonprofit world \nto make a compelling case for conservation to decision makers around \nthe world, from heads of state to government leaders in the United \nStates. Encouraging partnerships, he has supported significant and \ninnovative cooperative arrangements between conservation organizations, \ngovernments and private entrepreneurs, and among governments, all with \nthe goal of advancing conservation priorities at a scale that can \nachieve lasting results. His personal support of conservation \ninitiatives has made a world of difference.\n  As Roger Sant steps down on September 19 after six years as WWF \nChairman, he continues his personal commitment to conserving the \nworld's endangered species and spaces. Based on his track record, we \nall can give thanks for his substantial conservation achievements as \nwell as for all we know he will achieve for conservation in the coming \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8496-3", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8496]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a treaty which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8496-4", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8496-S8497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 3:21 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nhaving proceeded to reconsider the bill (H.R. 4810) to provide for \nreconciliation pursuant to section 103(a)(1) of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001, returned by the \nPresident of the United States with his objections, to the House of \nRepresentatives, in which it originated, that the said bill do not \npass, two-thirds of the House of Representatives not agreeing to pass \nthe same.\n  The message also announced that the House has passed the following \nbill, without amendment:\n\n\n[[Page S8497]]\n\n\n       S. 1374.

A petition from the Republic of the Marshall \n     Islands relative to nuclear testing; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                                Petition\n\n       As provided by Congress in Article IX of the nuclear test \n     claims settlement enacted in law under Title II, Section \n     177(c) of the Compact of Free Association Act of 1985 [P.L. \n     99-239], the Republic of the Marshall Islands respectfully \n     submits this Changed Circumstances Petition to the Congress \n     of the United States. The Government of the Republic of \n     Marshall Islands hereby notifies the Congress of its \n     determination that the criteria have been satisfied under \n     applicable U.S. federal law for further measures to provide \n     adequately for injuries to persons and property in the \n     Marshall Islands that have arisen, been discovered, or \n     adjudicated since the Compact took effect on October 21, \n     1986.\n       Section 177 of the Compact of Free Association provides \n     that ``The Government of the United States accepts the \n     responsibility for compensation owing to citizens of the \n     Marshall Islands . . . for loss or damage to property and \n     person . . . resulting from the nuclear testing program which \n     the Government of the United States conducted in the Northern \n     Marshall Islands between June 30, 1946, and August 18, \n     1958.''\n       As detailed herein, injuries and damages resulting from the \n     United States Nuclear Testing Program have arisen, been \n     discovered, or have been adjudicated in the Marshall Islands \n     since the Compact took effect. These injuries and damages \n     could not reasonably have been discovered, or could not have \n     been determined, prior to the effective date of the Compact. \n     Such injuries, damages and adjudication render the terms of \n     the Section 177 Agreement manifestly inadequate to provide \n     just and adequate compensation for injuries to Marshallese \n     people and for damage to or loss of land resulting from the \n     U.S. Nuclear Testing Program.\n       The terms of Section 177 represent a politically determined \n     settlement (Attachment I, Hills testimony) rather than either \n     a good faith assessment of personal injury or property \n     claims, a legally adjudicated determination of actual \n     damages, or monetary award for such damages. As a political \n     settlement, Section 177 of the Compact requires that the U.S. \n     provide $150 million to the RMI to create a Fund that, over a \n     15-year period of the Compact, was intended to generate $270 \n     million in proceeds for disbursement ``as a means to address \n     past, present and future\n\n[[Page S8500]]\n\n     consequences of the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program, including \n     the resolution of resultant claims'' [Preamble of the 177 \n     Agreement].\n       In lieu of an assessment of damages by the Federal courts, \n     the government of the Marshall Islands accepted the U.S. \n     proposal that it espouse and settle the claims of the \n     Marshallese people arising from the nuclear testing program \n     conducted by the U.S. in conjunction with the establishment \n     of a Claims Tribunal. The U.S. expressly recognized that its \n     technical assessment of radiological damage to persons and \n     property in the RMI was limited to a ``best effort'' at the \n     time of the Compact (Attachment II, Scientific Analysis), and \n     was based on a limited disclosure of available information \n     and incomplete scientific knowledge. As a result, further \n     adjudication of claims by an internal RMI Nuclear Claims \n     Tribunal was agreed to by the United States.\n       In addition to creating the Tribunal, the U.S. agreed, in \n     exchange for the RMI espousing and settling its citizens \n     claims, to adopt a ``Changed Circumstances'' procedure, \n     through which Congress accepted the authority and \n     responsibility at a later date to determine the adequacy of \n     the measures adopted under the 177 Agreement to compensate \n     for the injuries and damages caused by the U.S. Nuclear \n     Testing Program. Accordingly, in approving the Section 177 \n     Agreement, Congress accepted the responsibility to determine \n     if further measures are required to provide just and adequate \n     compensation in light of the awards that have been made by \n     the Tribunal, as well as the injuries and damages that have \n     become known or been discovered since the settlement was \n     ratified.\n       For the RMI to seek and ask for the Congress to provide \n     additional funding is consistent with the commitment of the \n     United States to provide just and adequate compensation for \n     the nuclear claims. Indeed, such funding is contemplated by \n     the Agreement and is the political process intended by \n     Congress as a means to seek just and adequate compensation--\n     if possible without further litigation. Under relevant \n     federal court decisions, it is possible that claims could be \n     recommenced in U.S. courts based on failure of the agreement \n     to provide just and adequate compensation (Attachment III, \n     Legal Analysis).\n       The settlement specifically authorizes direct access to the \n     Congress of the United States by the RMI if ``Changed \n     Circumstances'' were discovered or developed after the \n     Agreement took effect, and render the provisions of the \n     Agreement manifestly inadequate. As more knowledge and \n     information emerges about the damages and injuries wrought by \n     the testing program, the manifest inadequacy of Section 177 \n     has become clear. As confirmed in Attachments IV, V, and VI, \n     the most immediate needs resulting from inadequacies of the \n     Agreement are funding to award personal injury claims through \n     the Tribunal, funding to satisfy the Tribunal awards for \n     property damage claims, and funding to address the gross \n     inability of the 177 medical program to effectively address \n     the health consequences of the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program.\n\n\n     payment of personal injury awards made by the claims tribunal\n\n       As of August 15, 2000, the Nuclear Claims Tribunal \n     established pursuant to the 177 Agreement had awarded \n     $72,634,750 for personal injuries, an amount $26.9 million \n     more than the $45.75 million total available under Article \n     II, Section 6(c) for payment of all awards, including \n     property damage, over the Compact period. To date, at least \n     712 of these awardees (42%) have died without receiving their \n     full award (Attachment IV, Decisions of the Nuclear Claims \n     Tribunal).\n\n\n     payment of property damage awards made by the claims tribunal\n\n       The Claims Tribunal awarded the Enewetak people \n     compensation for damages they suffered as a result of the \n     U.S. nuclear testing at Enewetak. The compensation included \n     awards for loss of use of their land, for restoration \n     (nuclear cleanup, soil rehabilitation and revegetation), and \n     for hardship (for suffering the Enewetak people endured while \n     being exiled to Ujelang Atoll for a 33 year period). The \n     Tribunal fully deducted the compensation the Enewetak people \n     received, or are to receive, under the Compact. The Tribunal \n     determined that the net amount of $386 million is required to \n     provide the Enewetak people with the just compensation to \n     which they are entitled. The Tribunal does not have the funds \n     to pay the $386 million award to the Enewetak people \n     (Attachment V, Enewetak Land Claim).\n\n\n   gross inability of the 177 medical program to effectively address \n                          health consequences\n\n       One of the measures adopted under the Section 177 Agreement \n     to compensate the people and government of the Marshall \n     Islands was a health care program for four of the atoll \n     populations impacted by the testing program, including those \n     who were downwind of one or more tests, and the awardees of \n     personal injury claims from the Tribunal. The medical \n     surveillance and health care program established under the \n     Section 177 Agreement has proven to be manifestly inadequate \n     given the health care needs of the affected communities. The \n     177 Health Care Program was asked to deliver appropriate \n     health care services within an RMI health infrastructure that \n     was not prepared or equipped to deliver the necessary level \n     of health care. Funding provided under Article II, Section \n     1(a) of the 177 Agreement has remained at a constant $2 \n     million per year. As a result of this underfunding, the 177 \n     Health Care Program has only $14 per person per month as \n     compared to an average U.S. expenditure of $230 per person \n     per month for similar services (Attachment VI, Medical \n     Analysis).\n       It is imperative that a new medical program be implemented, \n     with adequate funding that empowers the affected downwind and \n     other exposed communities to provide primary, secondary, and \n     tertiary healthcare for their citizens in a manner compatible \n     and coordinated with RMI and U.S. health care programs and \n     policies.\n       Based on the inadequacy of funds for personal injury \n     claims, property damage claims, and health consequences from \n     the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program, the RMI Government \n     respectfully requests Congress to:\n       1. Authorize and appropriate $26.9 million so the Claims \n     Tribunal can complete full payment of the personal injury \n     awards made as of August 15, 2000. Of this amount, \n     approximately $21 million is needed to pay off the estates of \n     the 712 individuals known to have died. An additional $5.9 \n     million is needed to make full payments of awards to \n     individuals who are still alive; approximately half of that \n     amount is needed to pay 80 or more individuals who presently \n     suffer from a compensable condition which is likely to result \n     in their death and the remaining half is owed to other living \n     awardees (Attachment IV, Decisions of the Nuclear Claims \n     Tribunal).\n       2. Authorize and appropriate $386 million to satisfy the \n     Claims Tribunal award to the Enewetak people (Attachment V. \n     Enewetak Land Claim).\n       3. Authorize and appropriate $50 million in initial capitol \n     costs to build and supply the infrastructure necessary to \n     provide adequate primary and secondary medical care to the \n     populations exposed to radiation from the U.S. Weapons \n     Testing Program (Attachment VI, Medical Analysis).\n       4. Authorize and appropriate $45 million each year for 50 \n     years for a 177 Health Care Program to provide a health care \n     program for those individuals recognized by the U.S. \n     Government as having been exposed to high levels of radiation \n     during or after the testing program, including those who were \n     downwind for one or more test, and the awardees of personal \n     injury claims from the Tribunal (Attachment VI, Medical \n     Analysis).\n       5. Extend the U.S. Department of Energy medical monitoring \n     program for exposed populations to any groups that can \n     demonstrate high levels of radiation exposure to the U.S. \n     Congress (Attachment II, Scientific Analysis, issue #6).\n       Beyond the five immediate changed circumstances, the RMI \n     Government will present information to the U.S. Congress in \n     the future regarding several other areas of changed \n     circumstances. Some of these areas include:\n\n\n     payment of property damage awards made by the claims tribunal\n\n       In April 2000, the Claims Tribunal issued its first award \n     for property damage to the people of Enewetak Atoll. The full \n     award of $386 million addresses the claims of the Enewetak \n     people for loss of use of their land, for costs of \n     restoration, and for hardship suffered while in exile for a \n     33 year period. Additionally, the Claims Tribunal is expected \n     to make an award for property damage to the people of Bikini. \n     Two other property damage claims in the process of being \n     developed include one by Rongelap, Alinginae, and Rongerik \n     and, one by Utrik, Taka, Tongai/Bokaak. These claims will be \n     presented to the Tribunal in the near future. The pending \n     cases will better define the level of compensation that \n     will ultimately be required to fully repair damage to all \n     islands, including those not currently being rehabilitated \n     for resettlement, and to provide for adjudication of all \n     other claims.\n\n\n        Funding of environmental rehabilitation and resettlement\n\n       The U.S. Congress has recognized the need for environmental \n     restoration to reduce radioactive contamination to acceptable \n     levels at Bikini, Enewetak, and Rongelap atolls by \n     establishing resettlement trust funds for those atolls. The \n     Enewetak trust fund for the rehabilitation and resettlement \n     of Enjebi Island is only $10 million while evidence present \n     before the Claims Tribunal demonstrated that over $148 \n     million is required for environmental restoration of the \n     atoll and resettlement of a portion of its population, the \n     Enjebi people. Similarly, preliminary estimates for cleanup \n     costs at Bikini and Rongelap atolls (approximately $205-505 \n     million for Bikini Atoll and $100 million for just one island \n     on Rongelap, Rongelap Island) exceed the funding levels \n     currently provided. No rehabilitation and resettlement trust \n     fund presently exists for Utrik.\n\n\n Support for further medical surveillance and radiological monitoring \n       activities, including tracer chemicals and toxic materials\n\n       Under Article II, Section 1 (a) of the 177 Agreement, $3 \n     million was provided to the RMI for medical surveillance and \n     radiological monitoring activities. Those funds were used to \n     conduct a nationwide radiological survey, a medical \n     examination program in the outer islands, and a thyroid study \n     on Ebeye Island. While valuable information was obtained from \n     these activities, such as identification and treatment for \n     radiogenic illnesses, the surveys indicate that thyroid and \n     other radiation related illnesses are evident in populations \n     that are\n\n[[Page S8501]]\n\n     presently unmonitored, yet the funds for medical surveillance \n     are exhausted.\n       The health consequences of the U.S. Nuclear Testing Program \n     are greater than originally suspected. Additionally, \n     radiation from the testing program reached every corner of \n     the Marshall Islands. Medical surveillance should have been, \n     and should be targeted at monitoring frequencies of all real \n     and potential health consequences of the testing program in a \n     longitudinal fashion. It is only in this manner that a \n     complete understanding of health trends and associations of \n     specific illness and radiation can be appreciated. An onsite \n     national health surveillance system needs to be developed, \n     implemented, and sustained to monitor all health consequences \n     of the nuclear weapons testing program for the next fifty \n     years.\n\n\n                      Occupational safety program\n\n       Section 177 does not include an occupational safety program \n     for Marshallese and other workers involved in environmental \n     remediation or cleanup programs. As a result, Marshallese and \n     other workers are exposed to occupational sources of \n     radiation. Medical screening of past and present radiation \n     workers is greatly needed to reduce the risk of further \n     illness and claims.\n\n\n              community education and development programs\n\n       Section 177 provides no means to educate Marshallese \n     citizens in radiation related fields or to build local \n     capacity to undertake research, archive relevant information, \n     or educate the public about the consequences of the U.S. \n     Nuclear Testing Program in the Marshall Islands.\n\n\n                      nuclear stewardship program\n\n       Section 177 does not provide programs for communities to \n     develop strategies for safely containing radiation and living \n     near radioactive waste storage areas.\n       The inadequacies presented in this petition ``could not \n     reasonably have been identified'' in the 177 Agreement \n     [Article IX] both because the full extent of the damages \n     caused by the testing program had never been assessed and \n     because scientific and medical developments since the \n     settlement was consummated would have rendered any prior \n     assessment not just manifestly inadequate, but null and void. \n     What might have been acknowledged by the Government of the \n     United States in 1983 as ``damages resulting from the Nuclear \n     Testing Program'' is only a small portion of what such \n     injuries and damages are now known to be.\n       The 67 atomic and thermonuclear weapons detonated in the \n     Marshall Islands allowed the United States Government to \n     achieve its aim of world peace through a deterrence policy. \n     The Marshallese people subsidized this nuclear detente with \n     their lands, health, lives, and future. ``As an ally and \n     strategic partner, the Republic of the Marshall Islands has \n     paid a uniquely high price to define its national interest in \n     a manner that also has been compatible with vital U.S. \n     national interests'' (H. Con. Res. 92--Sponsored by the \n     Honorable Benjamin Gilman and the Honorable Don Young). As a \n     strategic partner and friend of the United States, the RMI \n     remains hopeful that Congress will take action to address the \n     inadequacies of the 177 Agreement. The Government of the \n     Republic of the Marshall Islands looks forward to working \n     closely with the Congress of the United States to respond to \n     changed circumstances in the Marshall Islands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8501-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted on September 12, \n2000:\n\n       By Mr. LUGAR, from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry, with an amendment in the nature of a \n     substitute:\n       S. 1066: A bill to amend the National Agricultural \n     Research, Extension, and Teaching Policy Act of 1977 to \n     encourage the use of and research into agricultural best \n     practices to improve the environment, and for other purposes \n     (Rept.

A bill to establish the Commission for the Comprehensive \nStudy of Privacy Protection, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                         privacy commission act\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Privacy \nCommission Act.'' This legislation would establish a 17-member \ncommission to examine the complex issue of personal privacy and to make \nrecommendations to Congress as we consider how to map out privacy \nprotections for the future. The Commission for the Comprehensive Study \nof Privacy Protection, whose members would include experts with a \ndiversity of experiences, would look at the spectrum of privacy, from \nprotecting citizens' health and financial information to ensuring their \nsecurity on web sites.\n  As we all know, Americans are increasingly concerned that their \npersonal information is not as secure as they once believed. A recent \nNBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that\n\n[[Page S8502]]\n\nloss of privacy was the greatest concern that Americans have as we \nenter this new century. In these times of rapidly changing technology, \npeople are uncertain and fearful about who has access to their personal \ninformation and how that information is being used. It seems that as \nfast as new communications technologies appear, so do new capabilities \nfor diverting information in unintended ways.\n  The increasing popularity of the Internet and e-mail as a primary \nmeans of communicating and disseminating information is one of the \nmajor reasons for the rising concerns about personal privacy. Consumer \ninformation such as drivers' license numbers, educational records and \npurchase records has always been available in some capacity. Before the \nadvent of the Internet, however, the time and effort required to \naccumulate such information often was prohibitive. Now, the use of \ninformation-gathering devices on the Internet makes building consumer \ninformation databases relatively cost-free, and using and sharing them \nextremely profitable.\n  Some data privacy experts have shown how combining information from \nseparate so-called ``anonymous'' public databases can not only identify \nthose people included in the database but can reveal private \ninformation as well, including detailed medical and financial records. \nThe increased sharing of information between medical practitioners, \npharmaceutical companies, insurance entities and employers has made \nconsumers more aware of the lack of confidentiality in the physician-\npatient relationship. Breakthroughs in genetic testing have made the \npotential consequences of such sharing even more serious.\n  The first federal privacy commission, which operated from 1975 to \n1977, faced the same basic question that is being posed today: ``What \nis the correct balance between protecting personal privacy and allowing \nappropriate uses of information?'' But in the past 25 years, there have \nbeen enormous leaps in technology. Today, a few keystrokes on a \ncomputer hooked up to the Internet can produce a quantity of \ninformation that was unimaginable in 1975. This freedom of information \ncan be beneficial, by helping people to get loans quickly or by \npersonalizing consumer services. But the same information in the hands \nof bad actors can cause harm, resulting in nightmarish situations such \nas identity theft. It is crucial that we act soon to protect the \nAmerican people from crimes like these, without overregulating so much \nthat we stunt the growth of our booming economy.\n  The Privacy Commission is the key to finding the balance between \nprotecting the privacy of individuals and permitting specific and \nappropriate uses of personal information for beneficial purposes. The \nCommission would be directed to study a wide variety of issues relating \nto personal privacy, including the monitoring, collection, distribution \nand use of personal information by government and private entities; \ncurrent legislative and self-regulatory efforts to respond to privacy \nproblems; and the practices and policies of employers with respect to \nthe personal financial and health information of their employees. In \nthe course of its examination of these issues, the Commission would \nalso be required to hold at least 3 field hearings around the country \nand to set up a website to facilitate public participation and public \ncomment. By December 31, 2001, the Commission would submit a report to \nCongress on its findings, including any recommendations for legislation \nto reform or augment current laws.\n  There is great deal of interest in legislating on privacy. Everyone \nis trying to establish the appropriate level of privacy protection that \nthe American people want and need. But there are many different answers \nbeing proposed. On the state level, approximately 7000 bills about \nprivacy were introduced just last year. Here in Congress, scores of \nproposals have been introduced on a wide range of privacy issues, and \nwe undoubtedly will consider many of these proposals in the next \nCongress. The Privacy Commission Act will help us to understand the \ncomplex issue of privacy and to map responsible protections, without \ndelaying action where consensus is reached. The final report of the \nPrivacy Commission would be available by the second session of the new \nCongress. In the meanwhile, if consensus can be reached on any \nsubstantive privacy legislation, nothing in the Privacy Commission Act \nwould impede movement on those bills. To the contrary, the bill \ncontains a provision specifying that it is not intended to delay any \nother privacy legislation.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues in the House, particularly \nCongressmen Asa Hutchinson and Jim Moran, who sponsored H.R. 4049. They \nand their staffs have worked diligently on the Privacy Commission Act. \nThey held three days of hearings on this legislation, and the House \nGovernment Reform Committee passed the Hutchinson-Moran bill by voice \nvote on June 29th. I also want to thank my cosponsors, particularly \nSenators Kohl and Torricelli, who have worked on a privacy commission \nbill for some time, as well as Senators Abraham, Lincoln, Voinovich, \nRoth, Gregg, Hutchinson, Collins, DeWine, Levin and Landrieu.\n  It is my hope that we can all work together to pass the Privacy \nCommission Act to help us make informed and thoughtful decisions to \nprotect the privacy of the American people. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this much-needed legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the \n``Privacy Commission Act'' be printed in the Record following my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3040\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Privacy Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans are increasingly concerned about their civil \n     liberties and the security and use of their personal \n     information, including medical records, educational records, \n     library records, magazine subscription records, records of \n     purchases of goods and other payments, and driver's license \n     numbers.\n       (2) The shift from an industry-focused economy to an \n     information-focused economy calls for a reassessment of the \n     most effective way to balance personal privacy and \n     information use, keeping in mind the potential for unintended \n     effects on technology development, innovation, the \n     marketplace, and privacy needs.\n       (3) This Act shall not be construed to prohibit the \n     enactment of legislation on privacy issues by Congress during \n     the existence of the Commission. It is the responsibility of \n     Congress to act to protect the privacy of individuals, \n     including individuals' medical and financial information. \n     Various committees of Congress are currently reviewing \n     legislation in the area of medical and financial privacy. \n     Further study by the Commission established by this Act \n     should not be considered a prerequisite for further \n     consideration or enactment of financial or medical privacy \n     legislation by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     ``Commission for the Comprehensive Study of Privacy \n     Protection'' (in this Act referred to as the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4. DUTIES OF COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Commission shall conduct a study of issues \n     relating to protection of individual privacy and the \n     appropriate balance to be achieved between protecting \n     individual privacy and allowing appropriate uses of \n     information, including the following:\n       (1) The monitoring, collection, and distribution of \n     personal information by Federal, State, and local \n     governments.\n       (2) Current efforts to address the monitoring, collection, \n     and distribution of personal information by Federal and State \n     governments, individuals, or entities, including--\n       (A) existing statutes and regulations relating to the \n     protection of individual privacy, such as section 552a of \n     title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the \n     Privacy Act of 1974) and section 552 of title 5, United \n     States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act);\n       (B) legislation pending before the Congress;\n       (C) privacy protection efforts undertaken by the Federal \n     Government, State governments, foreign governments, and \n     international governing bodies;\n       (D) privacy protection efforts undertaken by the private \n     sector;

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Privacy \nCommission Act'' with my colleagues Senator Thompson and Senator \nTorricelli. This legislation addresses privacy protection by creating \nan expert Commission charged with the duty to explore privacy concerns. \nWe cannot underestimate the importance of this issue. Privacy matters, \nand it will continue to matter more and more in this information age of \nhigh speed data, Internet transactions, and lightning-quick \ntechnological advances.\n  Last November, Senator Torricelli and I introduced the ``Privacy \nProtection Study Commission Act of 1999,'' the first major piece of \nprivacy legislation introduced in the 106th Congress. Our hope then, as \nnow, was to gain a better informed understanding of the numerous \nprivacy issues facing a high tech culture. Now, almost a year later, \nthe privacy issue has grown in importance and public concern. As a \nresult, I am pleased to renew my effort in this area with another \nprivacy commission proposal.\n  There exists a massive wealth of information in today's world, which \nis increasingly stored electronically. In fact, experts estimate that \nthe average American is ``profiled'' in up to 150 commercial electronic \ndatabases. That means that there is a great deal of data--in some \ncases, very detailed and personal--out there and easily accessible \ncourtesy of the Internet revolution. With the click of a button it is \npossible to examine all sorts of personal information, be it an \naddress, a criminal record, a credit history, a shopping preference, or \neven a medical file.\n  Generally, the uses of this data are benign, even beneficial. \nOccasionally, however, personal information is obtained \nsurreptitiously, and even peddled to third parties for profit or other \nuses. This is especially troubling when, in many cases, people do not \neven know that their own personal information is being ``shopped.''\n  Two schools of thought exist on how we should address these privacy \nconcerns. There are some who insist that we must do something and do it \nquickly. Others urge us to rely entirely on ``self-regulation''--\naccording to them most companies will act reasonably and, if not, \nconsumers will demand privacy protection as a condition for their \ncontinued business.\n  Both approaches have some merit, but also some problems. It is never \nbeneficial to legislate by anecdote or on the basis of a few bad \nactors. In deed, enacting ``knee-jerk,'' ``quick-fix'' legislation \ncould do more harm than good. By the same token, however, the longer \nCongress waits to enact legislation, the more frequent the anecdotes \nuntil they reach a point of critical mass. We are quickly reaching the \npoint when Congress must act with or without the benefits of a study.\n  A privacy commission still has merit. The streamlined time frame--it \ncould still be a bit shorter--helps ensure that the Commission will not \ninterrupt other legislative privacy efforts, and the breadth of experts \nthat it relies upon suggests that the commission's report will still be \ntimely and worthwhile.\n  I commend Senator Thompson for his efforts and hope our proposal \nbecomes law and Commission members are appointed before the end of this \nyear.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. ASHCROFT:\n  S. 3042. A bill to protect citizens against becoming victims of \nInternet fraud, to provide stiff penalties against those who target \nsenior citizens, and to educate senior citizens on how to avoid being \nvictimized by Internet or telemarketing fraud; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n     an act to prevent internet fraud and fraud against the elderly\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, E-commerce is growing at an \nunprecedented rate--$8 billion last year. With this increase in online \npurchases, we have made more products and services available to \nAmericans--regardless of where they live. We are working to bridge the \ndigital divide so all Americans, even low income and rural Americans \ncan benefit from the opportunities the Internet provides. However, one \nthing we don't want to make ubiquitous is Internet fraud. Along with \nconvenience, easy price comparisons, and limitless selection--this new \nmedium also has provided a new opportunity to those who make their \nliving defrauding the public. Fraud over the Internet, just as fraud \nover telephone lines and mail, is an increasing problem.\n  In 1998, Congress passed the Telemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I, \nlike the rest of my colleagues recognized this problem and supported \nthat effort. That law builds upon other federal laws that deal directly \nwith telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law stiffened penalties for \ntelemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing guidelines--especially \nfor crimes against the elderly. It requires criminal forfeiture to \nensure the fruits of telemarketing crime are not used to commit further \nfraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure victims are the first ones \ncompensated, adds conspiracy language to the list of telemarketing \nfraud penalties, and helps law enforcement zero in on quick-strike \nfraud operations by giving them the authority to move more quickly \nagainst suspected fraud.\n  While I supported that law, I believe we need to do more. According \nto the National Consumers League, consumers lost over $3.2 million to \nInternet fraud last year. This is a 38 percent increase from 1998. The \nactual figure probably is much higher, since this number reflects only \nthose who reported incidents to the National Consumer League's Fraud \nWatch. While it is true consumer protection laws under the jurisdiction \nof the Federal Trade Commission have been interpreted to cover Internet \nfraud--those laws are inadequate. Therefore, today, I am introducing a \nbill, An Act to Prevent Internet Fraud and Fraud Against the Elderly, \nto ensure that Internet fraud also is covered by federal criminal laws. \nIt is important to me that the stiffer penalties contained in the \nTelemarketing Fraud Prevention Act for those targeting the elderly also \ncover fraud perpetrated over the Internet.\n  Through work I have done over the last year, I have seen first hand \nthe tragic results of schemes targeting our elderly. I held a hearing \nin the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on\n\n[[Page S8505]]\n\nConsumer Affairs and heard heart breaking testimony about scam \nartists--targeting the elderly--who are maybe the worst criminals on \nthe planet. They target people, who in the twilight of their lives may \nlose their life savings, their independence and their dignity. I held \nevents in Missouri, with the regional director of the Federal Trade \nCommission, educating those most venerable to these schemes on how to \navoid becoming a victim. According the National Consumers League, \nseniors are the target for more than 20 percent of Internet fraud. \nAlthough this is lower than the 56 percent of seniors targeted by \nunscrupulous telemarketers, the number will only increase as more and \nmore of our seniors begin to use the Internet.\n  I strongly believe that education is crucial. That is why this bill \nalso containing provisions giving the FTC the charge of educating our \nelderly. They currently have the largest network of information on \nfraud schemes. Through their Sentinel website, they have connected law \nenforcement agencies all over the world--giving them the ability to act \nquickly. In addition, they currently have the network in place designed \nto educate consumers on all areas of consumer protection law.\n  The bill I am introducing today will expand current law to include \nthe same crimes committed over the Internet. As now, fraud cases would \nbe divided between the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Mr. President. We cannot allow the criminals to stay ahead of the \nlaw. Internet crimes are being quickly developed and identified. We \nmust make sure they are just as quickly stopped. We must provide the \nlegal framework to insist that these criminals do not slip through the \nsystem due to a loophole.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 3043. A bill to close loopholes in the firearms laws which allow \nthe unregulated manufacture, assembly, shipment, or transportation of \nfirearms or firearm parts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n\n\n                   gun parts trafficking act of 2000\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gun \nParts Trafficking Act of 2000.\n  For years, I have fought along with many of my colleagues against the \ngun violence that has plagued America. We have sought to keep firearms \nfrom the hands of children and those who would use them to do harm. \nAfter long debate, we succeeded in enacting a ban on assault weapons as \nwell as the Brady bill requiring a criminal background check at the \ntime of a firearms purchase--positive steps in the effort to protect \nour communities from gun violence.\n  Gun violence, however, continues to have a devastating impact on our \nnation. The statistics have been well documented, but bear repeating. \nIn 1997 alone, more than 32,000 Americans were shot and killed. \nFourteen children die from gunfire every day. The economic toll of \nfirearms deaths and injuries on our country--$33 billion each year--is \nastronomical.\n  In light of these staggering figures it seems obvious that we must do \nmore, including regulating guns like any other consumer product. But \nwhile we look forward, we must also be mindful of attempts by some to \nsubvert the progress we have made.\n  Gun dealers are exploiting a loophole in current law that allows them \nto sell, through the US mail, gun kits containing virtually every \nsingle item needed to build an automatic weapon. When we enacted a ban \non these deadly automatic weapons, we exempted automatic weapons \nlegally owned prior to the ban. We also allowed replacement parts to be \nlegally sold so that these grand-fathered weapons could be repaired by \ntheir owners, and we allowed these parts to be shipped through the \nnail.\n  These provisions, however, have been exploited and replacement part \nkits that can convert a legally owned firearm into an illegal automatic \nweapon are readily available and heavily advertised in numerous \npublications. Some of these kits even go so far as to provide a \ntemplate that shows how to make this conversion. This is a flagrant \neffort to evade the laws of the United States. This activity must be \nstopped in order to maintain the integrity of our ban on assault \nweapons and protect our communities from gun violence. Legislation is \nneeded that provides simple, common-sense measures to remedy the \nglaring loopholes in current law.\n  To that end, I am introducing the Gun Parts Trafficking Act of 2000, \nlegislation designed to close the loopholes in existing law and end the \nsale of kits designed to convert legally owned firearms into illegal \nautomatic weapons. The bill will expand the definition of ``firearm'' \nto include the main components of the weapon and will prohibit the \nmanufacture or assembly of guns by an individual who does not have a \nlicense to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of the Gun Parts \nTrafficking Act and ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3043\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Gun Parts Trafficking Act of \n     2000''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION AGAINST SHIPMENT OR TRANSPORTATION OF \n                   FIREARM PARTS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS.\n\n       Section 921(a)(3) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``or (D) any destructive device.'' and \n     inserting ``(D) any destructive device; or (E) any parts or \n     combination of parts that when assembled on a frame or \n     receiver would constitute a firearm, as defined in this \n     paragraph.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION AGAINST MANUFACTURE OR ASSEMBLY OF \n                   FIREARMS BY PERSONS OTHER THAN LICENSED \n                   MANUFACTURERS.\n\n       Section 922 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(z) It shall be unlawful for any person other than a \n     licensed manufacturer to manufacture or assemble a \n     firearm.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. INCREASE IN FEE FOR LICENSE TO MANUFACTURE FIREARMS.\n\n       Section 923(a)(1)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking ``$50'' and inserting ``$500''.\n\n     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION AGAINST POSSESSION OR TRANSFER OF CERTAIN \n                   COMBINATIONS OF MACHINEGUN REPLACEMENT PARTS.\n\n       Section 5845(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (National Firearms Act) is amended in the 2nd sentence by \n     striking ``designed and intended solely and exclusively, or \n     combination of parts designed and intended,'' and inserting \n     ``or combination of parts designed and intended''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Con. Res. 135\n\n       Whereas the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 (Public Law 94-\n\n[[Page S8507]]\n\n     142) was signed into law 25 years ago on November 29, 1975, \n     and amended the State grant program under part B of the \n     Education of the Handicapped Act;\n       Whereas the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 established the Federal policy of ensuring that all \n     children, regardless of the nature or severity of their \n     disability, have available to them a free appropriate public \n     education in the least restrictive environment;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act was further \n     amended by the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of \n     1986 (Public Law 99-457) to create a preschool grant program \n     for children with disabilities 3 to 5 years of age and an \n     early intervention program for infants and toddlers with \n     disabilities from birth through age 2;\n       Whereas the Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments of \n     1990 (Public Law 101-476) renamed the statute as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA);\n       Whereas IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants \n     and toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 \n     to 21 years of age;\n       Whereas IDEA has assisted in a dramatic reduction in the \n     number of children with developmental disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who \n     complete high school has grown significantly since the \n     enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas the number of children with disabilities who enroll \n     in college as freshmen has more than tripled since the \n     enactment of IDEA;\n       Whereas IDEA has raised the Nation's expectations about the \n     abilities of children with disabilities by requiring access \n     to the general education curriculum;\n       Whereas improvements to IDEA made in 1997 changed the focus \n     of a child's individualized education program from procedural \n     requirements placed upon teachers and related services \n     personnel to educational results for that child, thus \n     improving academic achievement;\n       Whereas changes made in 1997 also addressed the need to \n     implement behavioral assessments and intervention strategies \n     for children whose behavior impedes learning to ensure that \n     they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education;\n       Whereas IDEA ensures full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities;\n       Whereas IDEA has supported the classrooms of this Nation by \n     providing Federal resources to the States and local schools \n     to help meet their obligation to educate all children with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas, while the Federal Government has not yet met its \n     commitment to fund part B of IDEA at 40 percent of the \n     average per pupil expenditure, it has made significant \n     increases in part B funding by increasing the appropriation \n     by 115 percent since 1995, which is an increase of over \n     $2,600,000,000;\n       Whereas the 1997 amendments to IDEA increased the amount of \n     Federal funds that have a direct impact on students through \n     improvements such as capping allowable State administrative \n     expenses, which ensures that nearly 99 percent of funding \n     increases directly reach local schools, and requiring \n     mediation upon request by parents in order to reduce costly \n     litigation;\n       Whereas such amendments also ensured that students whose \n     schools cannot serve them appropriately and students who \n     choose to attend private, parochial, and charter schools have \n     greater access to free appropriate services outside of \n     traditional public schools;\n       Whereas IDEA has supported, through its discretionary \n     programs, more than two decades of research, demonstration, \n     and training in effective practices for educating children \n     with disabilities, enabling teachers, related services \n     personnel, and administrators effectively to meet the \n     instructional needs of children with disabilities of all \n     ages;\n       Whereas Federal and State governments can support effective \n     practices in the classroom to ensure appropriate and \n     effective services for children with disabilities; and\n       Whereas IDEA has succeeded in marshalling the resources of \n     this Nation to implement the promise of full participation in \n     society of children with disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 25th anniversary of the enactment of the \n     Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 (Public \n     Law 94-142);\n       (2) acknowledges the many and varied contributions of \n     children with disabilities, their parents, teachers, related \n     services personnel, and administrators; and\n       (3) reaffirms its support for the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act so that all children with \n     disabilities have access to a free appropriate public \n     education.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a resolution \ncommemorating the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act--known today as the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, or IDEA. I am joined in this effort by many \nof my colleagues in the Senate and by Chairman Goodling and others in \nthe House, who are proposing a companion resolution today.\n  On November 29, 1975, President Gerald Ford signed landmark \nlegislation which became Public Law 94-142. With the stroke of his pen, \nhe opened the doors of our public schools to millions of children with \ndisabilities. Public Law 94-142 serves as the foundation of our \nnational commitment to assuring that children with disabilities have \nthe same opportunity as all other American children to develop their \ntalents, share their gifts, and contribute to their communities. Over \nthe years, we have built upon this foundation by expanding its reach to \npre-school children through early intervention programs.\n  This anniversary holds a special meaning for me. I am one of the few \nmembers now in this body who were present at the time the Education for \nAll Handicapped Children Act was approved. It was one of the first \npieces of legislation I worked on as a freshman member of the House of \nRepresentatives. At that time, despite a clear Constitutional \nobligation to educate all children, regardless of disability, thousands \nof disabled students were denied access to a public education.\n  I was an original sponsor of Public Law 94-142 and had the \nopportunity to serve on the House-Senate conference committee which \ndeveloped the final bill. Since then, I have actively supported the \nimprovements made to the legislation over the past quarter century. I \ntake great satisfaction in the extraordinary record of success this Act \nhas built.\n  IDEA currently serves an estimated two hundred thousand infants and \ntoddlers; six hundred thousand pre-schoolers; and almost 5.5 million \nchildren aged 6 to 21. The drop-out rate for this population has \ndecreased, while the graduation rate has increased substantially. The \nnumber of young adults with disabilities enrolling in college has more \nthan tripled. The number of children with developmental disabilities \nwho live in state institutions, away from their families, has also been \ndramatically reduced.\n  Each one of these numbers represents a child whose life has been \nimproved because we recognized the value of educating all our children. \nThe contribution we made through legislation is an important one, but \nthe real credit belongs to the people on the front lines who have seen \nto it that our goals have become realities. Teachers, related services \npersonnel, administrators, professional and advocacy organizations, \nparents of children with disabilities, and the children themselves work \neach day to assure the promise of IDEA burns brightly.\n  Today we celebrate the progress that we have made in special \neducation since 1975. It is also an appropriate time to consider the \nchallenges and opportunities which lie ahead. I cannot talk about IDEA \nwithout mentioning yet again our unfulfilled promise. In 1975, Congress \npromised our 16,000 school districts that we would provide special \neducation funding at 40% of the national average per pupil expenditure. \nAs we all know, IDEA has never been funded at that level. We have \nimproved our record in recent years, with large increases in \nappropriations. Even with this infusion of funds, the federal \ngovernment provides less than 13% of the cost of special education \nservices. We need to do more, and now is the time to do it.\n  The knowledge base we have developed over the past 25 years, coupled \nwith continued advances in technology, hold the promise for astonishing \nprogress in the future for students with disabilities. These students \ncan now communicate, explore the world through the internet, and be \nmobile in ways we could not have imagined in 1975. If we are willing to \ncommit the necessary resources, there is virtually no limit to the \nadvances we could see over the next 25 years. I urge all my colleagues \nto join in supporting this resolution and in reaffirming the values and \nprinciples underlying IDEA.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the \nResolution Commemorating the 25th Anniversary of the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. This law has had a very positive impact on \nthe lives of millions of disabled Americans. In fact, since its \nenactment, the number of children with disabilities who complete high \nschool has grown significantly, and the number who enroll in college \nhas more than tripled. Academic achievement is increasing, along with\n\n[[Page S8508]]\n\nthe nation's expectations about the abilities of children with \ndisabilities. Our commitment to a quality education for everybody now \nextends to America's six million students with disabilities.\n  We know that special education is not a ``place'' or a ``label,'' but \na set of services that allow children to succeed in school, go on to \nlead productive lives, and enter the world of work. This is something \nthat matters to me because it means so much to the people in Maine who \nhave been able to lead productive lives because the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act afforded them the quality education they \ndeserved.\n  This is why we need to increase consistently the Federal financial \nsupport for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--so that \nthe Federal Government does, in fact, pay each school in America 40 \npercent of the national average per pupil expenditure for every special \neducation student enrolled. Washington made that promise to our local \ncommunities when it passed IDEA.\n  For example, this year in Maine, local schools will receive only $702 \nper special education student under IDEA--$1698 per student less than \nthe $2400 it would receive if the Federal Government paid its share. In \ntotal, Maine will receive $60 million less than it was promised. \nAccording to the U.S. Department of Education, the unmet amount stands \nat an astounding $11 billion nationally.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Forest System, which is managed by the \n     United States Forest Service, was established in 1907 and has \n     grown to include approximately 192,000,000 acres of Federal \n     lands.\n       (2) The public domain lands known as revested Oregon and \n     California Railroad grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay \n     Wagon Road grant lands, which are managed predominantly by \n     the Bureau of Land Management were returned to Federal \n     ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise approximately \n     2,600,000 acres of Federal lands.\n       (3) Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure \n     these lands in Federal ownership, the counties in which these \n     lands are situated would be deprived of revenues they would \n     otherwise receive if the lands were held in private \n     ownership.\n       (4) These same counties have expended public funds year \n     after year to provide services, such as education, road \n     construction and maintenance, search and rescue, law \n     enforcement, waste removal, and fire protection, that \n     directly benefit these Federal lands and people who use these \n     lands.\n       (5) To accord a measure of compensation to the affected \n     counties for the critical services they provide to both \n     county residents and visitors to these Federal lands, \n     Congress determined that the Federal Government should share \n     with these counties a portion of the revenues the United \n     States receives from these Federal lands.\n       (6) Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived from \n     National Forest System lands be paid to States for use by the \n     counties in which the lands are situated for the benefit of \n     public schools and roads.\n       (7) Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 75 percent of the revenues derived from \n     the revested and reconveyed grant lands be paid to the \n     counties in which those lands are situated to be used as are \n     other county funds, of which 50 percent is to be used as \n     other county funds.\n       (8) For several decades primarily due to the growth of the \n     federal timber sale program, counties dependent on and \n     supportive of these Federal lands received and relied on \n     increasing shares of these revenues to provide funding for \n     schools and road maintenance.\n       (9) In recent years, the principal source of these \n     revenues, Federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed \n     and, as the volume of timber sold annually from most of the \n     Federal lands has decreased precipitously, so too have the \n     revenues shared with the affected counties.\n       (10) This decline in shared revenues has affected \n     educational funding and road maintenance for many counties.\n       (11) In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \n     Congress recognized this trend and ameliorated its adverse \n     consequences by providing an alternative annual safety net \n     payment to 72 counties in Oregon, Washington, and northern \n     California in which Federal timber sales had been restricted \n     or prohibited by administrative and judicial decisions to \n     protect the northern spotted owl.\n       (12) The authority for these particular safety net payments \n     is expiring and no comparable authority has been granted for \n     alternative payments to counties elsewhere in the United \n     States that have suffered similar losses in shared revenues \n     from the Federal lands and in the funding for schools and \n     roads those revenues provide.\n       (13) There is a need to stabilize education and road \n     maintenance funding through predictable payments to the \n     affected counties, job creation in those counties, and other \n     opportunities associated with restoration, maintenance, and \n     stewardship of federal lands.\n       (14) Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \n     Management face significant backlogs in infrastructure \n     maintenance and ecosystem restoration that are difficult to \n     address through annual appropriations.\n       (15) There is a need to build new, and strengthen existing, \n     relationships and to improve management of public lands and \n     waters.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to stabilize and make permanent payments to counties to \n     provide funding for schools and roads;\n       (2) to make additional investments in, and create \n     additional employment opportunities through, projects that \n     improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement \n     stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and \n     restore and improve land health and water quality. Such \n     projects shall enjoy broad-based support with objectives that \n     may include, but are not limited to:\n       (A) Road, trail, and infrastructure maintenance or \n     obliteration;\n       (B) Soil productivity improvement;\n       (C) Improvements in forest ecosystem health;\n       (D) Watershed restoration and maintenance;\n       (E) Restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife \n     and fish habitat;\n       (F) Control of noxious and exotic weeds; and\n       (G) Reestablishment of native species;\n       (3) to improve cooperative relationships among the people \n     that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies that \n     manage these lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Sections 13982 and 13983 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66; 16 U.S.C. 500 \n     note; 43 U.S.C. 1181fnote) are repealed.\n\n    TITLE V--THE MINERAL REVENUE PAYMENTS CLARIFICATION ACT OF 2000\n\n     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``The Mineral Revenue Payments \n     Clarification Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Subtitle C of title X of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Public Law 103-66) changed the \n     sharing of onshore mineral revenues and revenues from \n     geothermal steam from a 50:50 split between the Federal \n     Government and the States to a complicated formula that \n     entailed deducting from the State share of leasing revenues \n     ``50 percent of the portion of the enacted appropriations of \n     the Department of the Interior and any other agency during \n     the preceding fiscal year allocable to the administration of \n     all laws providing for the leasing of any onshore lands or \n     interest in land owned by the United States for the \n     production of the same types of minerals leasable under this \n     Act or of geothermal steam, and to enforcement of such laws. \n     . . .''\n       (2) There is no legislative record to suggest a sound \n     public policy rationale for deducting prior-year \n     administrative expenses from the sharing of current-year \n     receipts, indicating that this change was made primarily for \n     budget scoring reasons.\n       (3) The system put in place by this change in law has \n     proved difficult to administer and has given rise to disputes \n     between the Federal Government and the States as to the \n     nature of allocable expenses. Federal accounting systems have \n     proven to be poorly suited to breaking down administrative \n     costs in the manner required by the law. Different Federal \n     agencies implementing this law have used varying \n     methodologies to identify allocable costs, resulting in an \n     inequitable distribution of costs during fiscal years 1994 \n     through 1996. In November, 1997, the Inspector General of the \n     Department of the Interior found that ``the congressionally \n     approved method for cost sharing deductions effective in \n     fiscal year 1997 may not accurately compute the \n     deductions.''.\n       (4) Given the lack of a substantive rationale for the 1993 \n     change in law and the complexity and administrative burden \n     involved, a return to the sharing formula prior to the \n     enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 is \n     justified.\n\n     SEC. 503. AMENDMENT OF THE MINERAL LEASING ACT.\n\n       Section 35(b) of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. sec. \n     191(b)) is amended to read as follows: ``(b) In determining \n     the amount of payments to the States under this section, the \n     amount of such payments shall not be reduced by any \n     administrative or other costs incurred by the United \n     States.''\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to provide \n     stability and predictability to the annual payments made to \n     States and counties containing National Forest System lands \n     and public domain lands managed by the Bureau of Land \n     Management for the benefit of public schools and roads and to \n     enhance the health, diversity and productivity of federal \n     lands.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8513-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8513-S8514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Forest System, which is managed by the \n     United States Forest Service, was established in 1907 and has \n     grown to include approximately 192,000,000 acres of Federal \n     lands.\n       (2) The public domain lands known as revested Oregon and \n     California Railroad grant lands and the reconveyed Coos Bay \n     Wagon Road grant lands, which are managed predominately by \n     the Bureau of Land Management were returned to Federal \n     ownership in 1916 and 1919 and now comprise approximately \n     2,600,000 acres of Federal lands.\n       (3) Congress recognized that, by its decision to secure \n     these lands in Federal ownership, the counties in which these \n     lands are situated would be deprived of revenues they would \n     otherwise receive if the lands were held in private \n     ownership.\n       (4) These same counties have expended public funds year \n     after year to provide services, such\n\n[[Page S8515]]\n\n     as education, road construction and maintenance, search and \n     rescue, law enforcement, waste removal, and fire protection, \n     that directly benefit these Federal lands and people who use \n     these lands.\n       (5) To accord a measure of compensation to the affected \n     counties for the critical services they provide to both \n     county residents and visitors to these Federal lands, \n     Congress determined that the Federal Government should share \n     with these counties a portion of the revenues the United \n     States receives from these Federal lands.\n       (6) Congress enacted in 1908 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 25 percent of the revenues derived from \n     National Forest System lands be paid to States for use by the \n     counties in which the lands are situated for the benefit of \n     public schools and roads.\n       (7) Congress enacted in 1937 and subsequently amended a law \n     that requires that 75 percent of the revenues derived from \n     the revested and reconveyed grant lands be paid to the \n     counties in which those lands are situated to be used as are \n     other county funds, of which 50 percent is to be used as \n     other county funds.\n       (8) For several decades primarily due to the growth of the \n     Federal timber sale program, counties dependent on and \n     supportive of these Federal lands received and relied on \n     increasing shares of these revenues to provide funding for \n     schools and road maintenance.\n       (9) In recent years, the principal source of these \n     revenues, Federal timber sales, has been sharply curtailed \n     and, as the volume of timber sold annually from most of the \n     Federal lands has decreased precipitously, so too have the \n     revenues shared with the affected counties.\n       (10) This decline in shared revenues has affected \n     educational funding and road maintenance for many counties.\n       (11) In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, \n     Congress recognized this trend and ameliorated its adverse \n     consequences by providing an alternative annual safety net \n     payment to 72 counties in Oregon, Washington, and northern \n     California in which Federal timber sales had been restricted \n     or prohibited by administrative and judicial decisions to \n     protect the northern spotted owl.\n       (12) The authority for these particular safety net payments \n     is expiring and no comparable authority has been granted for \n     alternative payments to counties elsewhere in the United \n     States that have suffered similar losses in shared revenues \n     from the Federal lands and in the funding for schools and \n     roads those revenues provide.\n       (13) There is a need to stabilize education and road \n     maintenance funding through predictable payments to the \n     affected counties, job creation in those counties, and other \n     opportunities associated with restoration, maintenance, and \n     stewardship of federal lands.\n       (14) Both the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land \n     Management face significant backlogs in infrastructure \n     maintenance and ecosystem restoration that are difficult to \n     address through annual appropriations.\n       (15) There is a need to build new, and strengthen existing, \n     relationships and to improve management of public lands and \n     waters.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to stabilize and make permanent payments to counties to \n     provide funding for schools and roads;\n       (2) to make additional investments in, and create \n     additional employment opportunities through, projects that \n     improve the maintenance of existing infrastructure, implement \n     stewardship objectives that enhance forest ecosystems, and \n     restore and improve land health and water quality. Such \n     projects shall enjoy broad-based support with objectives that \n     may include, but are not limited to:\n       (A) Road, trail, and infrastructure maintenance or \n     obliteration;\n       (B) Soil productivity improvement;\n       (C) Improvements in forest ecosystem health;\n       (D) Watershed restoration and maintenance;\n       (E) Restoration, maintenance and improvement of wildlife \n     and fish habitat;\n       (F) Control of noxious and exotic weeds;\n       (G) Reestablishment of native species; and\n       (H) General resource stewardship.\n       (3) to improve cooperative relationships among the people \n     that use and care for Federal lands and the agencies that \n     manage these lands.\n\n     SEC. 3.

CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.\n\n       Section 13982 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1993 (116 U.S.C. 500 note) is repealed. Sections 13982 and \n     13983 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \n     (Public Law 103-66; 16 U.S.C. 500 note; 43 U.S.C. 1181f note) \n     is repealed.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-Determination Act of 1999, solves a severe crisis in \nAmerica's rural, forest counties driven by the precipitous decline in \nfederal timber receipts over the last decade. The bill provides vital \npayments to schools and counties, while providing option to direct a \nportion of the payments to the development of local projects to address \nthe needs of our families and forests.\n  S. 1608 provides equity and increased educational opportunities for \nrural school children. States that are dominated by federally owned \nlands are facing a dual economic and educational crisis.\n  Our nation contains almost 800 forest counties; 2,000 forest school \ndistricts; 600,000 rural families, and more than 4 million school \nchildren who depend upon rural public schools for their education. \nThese children deserve the same educational opportunities as their \ncounterparts in urban areas.\n  Mosr urban areas across America witnessed unprecedented prosperity \nthroughout the 1990s. However, in our rural forest counties, the decade \nhas been a one-way slide toward poverty, unemployment, and a lower \nstandard of living for communities, families and children.\n  And it is our children who have borne the brunt of the harm. Rural \nchildren have been faced with:\n  School closings; school days and weeks shortened; class sizes \nincreased due to teacher layoffs; classroom aides eliminated; \ncounseling, nursing, and psychological services cut or eliminated; \nmusic, art, athletic, and academic enrichment programs eliminated; and \nstudent transportation services and winter road maintenance scaled back \nor eliminated.\n  The bill's guaranteed payments will provide critical resources for \nour children. It will allow our teachers to once again provide them \nwith a quality education.\n  In crafting S. 1608, Senator Wyden and I were assisted by local \ncommunity representatives who work, live, and represent thousands of \nrural citizens. The bill is supported by a unique coalition of more \nthan 1000 organizations across 50 states including county officials, \neducators, teachers unions, labor unions, and local businesses. This \nbill is truly a community-based solution to a national crisis. It is \nvery, very rare indeed, to bring a bill to the Senate floor that enjoys \nthe breadth of support represented by the groups in favor of S. 1608.\n  S. 1608 also provides funds to invest in collaborative improvement \nprojects to address high priority forest management needs such as: \ninfrastructure improvement, fuel and fire reduction, ecosystem \nrestoration, stewardship projects and watershed protection and \nrestoration. In addition, these cooperative county projects will \ncontribute to local community economic self-sufficiency and family \nsocial stability. As reported, S. 1608 is a win-win solution for all of \nrural America; our school children, our educators, our working \nfamilies, our counties, and our forestlands.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, many folks in rural Oregon and other parts \nof rural America believe the Federal Government has abandoned them. \nThey think Washington, D.C. has reneged on a decades-long commitment to \nsupport their schools and roads with revenue from timber harvested on \nFederal lands. People in timber-dependent rural America think they are \nbeing left behind to live in economic sacrifice zones.\n  Policy changes in Washington, DC., affecting logging on national \nforest across this country have caused timber receipts to fall an \naverage of 70 percent over the last 15 years, and by as much as 90 \npercent in some areas. As timber receipts disappeared, roads fell \ndeeper into disrepair, school programs were cut to the bone, and some \nschools even had to close their doors at least 1 day a week. Our fellow \ncitizens who live in rural America should not be just an afterthought \nin our warp-speed world. The legislation before us, the Secure Rural \nSchools and Community Self-Determination Act, will renew the compact \nwith timber-dependent communities without compromising our commitment \nto environmentally sound stewardship of our forests. It will give \npeople in rural counties the financial predictability they need to step \ninto the 21st century.\n  Since 1908, people in rural counties across this country have lived \nby a compact with the Federal Government. As compensation for paying no \nproperty taxes, the Federal Government would give the counties a \nquarter of the timber revenue. For decades, this arrangement provide \nadequate funds to sustain schools, roads and other basic county \nservices, like emergency rescue. But when timber harvests began to drop \noff and timber jobs were lost, little effort was made to help offset \nthe shortfall, and citizens in rural counties felt betrayed by the \ngovernment in Washington, DC. We are not talking\n\n[[Page S8519]]\n\nabout a few isolated communities in remote areas of America. Timber-\ndependent communities are found in 709 counties in 42 states. Some \n800,000 school children and millions of people live in these counties. \nThirty-one of 36 counties in my State of Oregon receive timber \npayments. Counties in the western part of Oregon have been able to \nsurvive because of Spotted Owl safety net payments, but no such safety \nnet exists for those in eastern Oregon. There, Grant County, has lost \n90 percent of its timber receipts, from more than $12 million down to \n$1 million, and the county has turned to such cost-cutting measures as \na 4-day school week.\n  Under this legislation, Oregon counties will get a total of $261 \nmillion a year--an increase of $115 million, or 79 percent. Of the $261 \nmillion, $222 million would be available for schools and roads and $39 \nmillion will remain for the counties either to invest in their backyard \nnational forests or in forest-related county services.\n  The purpose of S. 1608 is to help rural communities adapt to changing \nnational forest management policies by creating a funding formula \nalternative to timber receipts. The legislation will ensure that the \nfuture relationship between the people living in the 709 affected rural \ncounties and the Federal Government does not depend on how many trees \nare cut. Rural communities will be connected to Federal lands through \nstewardship projects, maintenance of existing forest infrastructure, \necosystem restoration and improvement of land and water quality. \nCounties will choose how to spend the Federal payment, and projects \nwill be developed by broad-based groups of local citizens. \nCollaboration with Federal land managers will help ensure projects \ncomply with all existing environmental laws and regulations. The \nlegislation would restore stability to the 25 percent payments compact \nby ensuring a predictable payment level to forest communities for six \nyears. The amount going toward schools and roads would represent 80-85 \npercent of the three-year average of the highest payment years from \n1985 to the present. Unlike today's system, a county will receive its \npayment from the general Treasury, regardless of whether a single tree \nis cut from national forests.\n  Counties will decide for themselves how to invest the remaining 15-\nto-20 percent of the average amount described above for projects \nrecommended by local community advisory committees if those projects \nare approved by the appropriate Federal land management agency. \nAlthough locally-conceived, every project must comply with all \nenvironmental laws and regulations, as well as all applicable forest \nplans. Counties might also opt to pursue projects related to the \nforest--rather than in the forest--through Title III. These projects \nmight include fire prevention, the purchase of easements or forest-\nrelated after-school programs. In addition, each project must--and I \nquote from the bill here--``improve the maintenance of existing \ninfrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance forest \necosystems, and restore and improve land health and water quality'' on \nthe national forests.\n  County choice is critical to the bill. Counties that opt not to join \nthe program--such as those anticipating higher timber receipts in the \nimmediate future--will continue to receive payments based on the \nexisting formula, and they also have the option of joining the program \ntwo years down the road. Counties that opt to join the program will get \nstable payments based on a new formula.\n  There is no doubt about it. This legislation will change the \ntraditional dynamic between logging and Federal payments to schools and \ncounties. But altering the link between timber harvest and county \npayments does not mean we seek to sever the ties between people and \nland. S. 1608 will strengthen the bond between communities and \nneighboring Federal forests. The projects that would be authorized by \nS. 1608 are a way for the Federal government to recognize--without \nrelaxing or compromising our environmental commitments--that timber \ntowns grow not just trees, but people, too.\n  When this debate began, the issues were highly polarized. On the one \nside were those who would punish the Forest Service for not cutting \nenough trees; on the other were those who, unintentionally, would \npunish our rural communities and school children by not providing them \nthe funding they so desperately need. After listening to both sides and \nafter many long discussions, Senator Craig and I rejected the extremes \nand sought out a middle path that would break the gridlock. The \nlegislation we bring to the Senate will establish a foundation to move \nrural communities beyond this time of crisis, and, with the forest \necosystem restoration projects, put them on a path toward \nsustainability in this new century.\n  One of my goals for this legislation was to assure the counties have \nas much choice as possible, and I believe this goal has been met. As I \nsaid earlier, first, counties can choose whether they would like to be \npart of this program and receive a stable payment. If they choose not \nto be part of the program, they may revisit this decision every 2 \nyears. Second, a county that chooses to be part of the program and \nreceive stable payments must decide the type of projects they want to \ninvest in: projects in the forest, like stream and watershed \nrestoration; or projects related to the forests, such as wildfire \nprevention or afterschool programs for their children. Also, a county \ncan opt simply to have the money sent back to the U.S. Treasury without \npursuing projects. Finally, these choices may be revisited every year.\n  The ecological health of the forests is a key to survival for many of \nthese communities, making forest restoration a cornerstone of the bill. \nCounties have choices as to how and how much they receive so they are \nable to determine the best allocation of funds: whether to support \nforest health, job creation, ecosystem restoration or a combination of \nthese. Whatever the choice, it is an investment in both the future of \nthe forest and the community. This legislation is the product of many \nmonths of painstaking work. Since the beginning, it has been a \nbipartisan effort. The Energy and Natural Resources Committee reported \nthe legislation by voice vote last April, and through negotiations with \nmany other interested Senators, we have a managers' amendment that \nrepresents a further refinement of the bill.\n  I particularly want to thank Senators Craig  and Bingaman,  the Chair \nand ranking member of the Energy Committee. Without their dedication \nand willingness to put long hours into this effort, we would not have \nsuch a solid piece of legislation. I would also like to make special \nnote of the help of Senator Baucus in crafting Title III and bringing a \nstrong focus on wildfire prevention. I would also like to acknowledge \nthe work of the staff on S. 1608. In particular, Jose Kardon, my chief \nof staff, and Sarah Bittleman, my Natural Resources counsel, have done \nyeoman's work on this legislation. Carole Grunberg, my legislative \ndirector, and Jeff Gagne, my Education advisor, also contributed to the \neffort. Special thanks also goes to Mark Rey of the Energy Committee \nstaff, whose steady hand and creativity helped resolve so many problems \nsuccessfully; to Bob Simon and Kira Finkler, of the Energy Committee \nDemocratic staff; and to Brian Kuehl with Senator Baucus and Sara Barth \nwith Senator Boxer.\n  S. 1608 is supported by thousands of groups, hundreds of counties, \nlabor organizations and school groups including the National Education \nAssociation, National Association of Counties, the American Federation \nof State, County and Municipal Employees, as well as the AFL-CIO.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4139\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, there is a substitute amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 4139.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Amendments \nSubmitted.'')\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, in conjunction with the administration, and\n\n[[Page S8520]]\n\nthe members of the Budget Committee, we have made a series of technical \nchanges to S. 1608 as it was reported by the committee. These changes \nare designed to: (1) respond to the concerns of some members with the \nbill as reported; (2) address some additional issues raised by the \nAdministration; (3) rectify technical problems with the bill; as well \nas (4) bring the bill's costs in line with the amount provided in \nfiscal year 2001 budget resolution. Let me briefly describe the most \nimportant changes for the benefit of the Senate. We have modified the \nformula used to calculate the ``full payment amount'' to which states \nare entitled from the Forest Service under this bill. Rather than \nhaving this payment calculated on the average of the three highest 25 \npercent payments for each eligible county within each state, the \ncalculations will be based upon the average of the three highest 25 \npercent payments for each state during the fiscal years of the eligible \nyears period. We also reduced the annual adjustment for inflation. \nThese changes will reduce the cost of the bill as estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office from $1.46 billion over a 5-year period to \naround $1.1 billion over the same period.\n  In section 102(a) and section 103(a), we clarify that the duration of \nthe bill will be fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2006. It is the \nmanager's intent that this bill be sunsetted after six years. This \nlanguage, and new language in section 209 and section 303 added by the \nmanager's amendment emphasizes this for the purpose of clarity. We made \na minor change to clarify that eligible counties that receive less than \n$100,000 in payments for fiscal year 2001 may elect to expend all of \nthis money for schools and roads, whether or not the payment increases \nslightly in out-years as a result of the inflation adjustment. This \nchange will assist counties with small revenue distributions.\n  In section 202, we clarify that projects funded under this bill can \nbe conducted on public or private lands as long as there is a benefit \nto federally managed resources. The committee bill was not sufficiently \nprecise in this regard. In section 203(b)(6), we added language to more \nfully describe the kind of monitoring plans that we would like to see \nassociated with projects approved under the bill. In section 204(e)(3), \nwe elected to put some quantitative targets on the pilot projects that \nthe bill authorizes for merchantable materials, with an out-year \nadjustment based upon the results of a GAO audit. We are hopeful that \nthe administration will move aggressively to implement this pilot \nproject, and report on its progress promptly and thoroughly to \nCongress. In section 401, we clarified that the bill authorizes \nappropriations for fiscal year 2001 through 2006. This is to emphasize \nthat this is a six-year bill.\n  In section 402(b), we specify that any revenues generated by \nprojected funded by monies authorized under this bill should be \nreturned to the Treasury, except in the single case where a project is \njointly funded by both project and non-federal revenues. The portion of \nrevenues associated with funds provided by this bill would be retained \nby the appropriate Secretary. The proportion of revenues associated \nwith funds provided by non-federal sources would be shared with those \nsources. This change is designed to address the concern that allowing \nrevenues generated by projects to be retained by federal agencies would \ncreate an unwelcome incentive to focus exclusively on revenue-\ngenerating projects. Our amendment addresses this concern in an \nequitable fashion.\n  With regard to the projects funded under this bill, we added language \nin section 204 to assure that projects will improve the maintenance of \nexisting infrastructure, implement stewardship objectives that enhance \nforest ecosystems, or restore and improve land health and water \nquality. We also specify that fifty percent of the project money shall \nbe used for projects that involve road maintenance or obliteration, or \nthe restoration of streams and watersheds. These changes are designed \nto encourage the development of projects that foster resource \nstewardship. To provide the counties that elect to participate in \nprojects a wider range of choices, we have added a title III to the \nbill. Under the provisions of title III, counties may choose to invest \ntheir project money in a list of authorized uses including: (1) search, \nrescue, and emergency services; (2) community service work camps; (3) \neasement purchases from willing sellers to provide access to public \nlands; 94) forest related educational programs; (5) local fire \nprevention and fire risk reduction planning activities; and (6) \ncommunity forestry projects. These projects would still be developed \nand recommended through the local resource advisory committees \nestablished in title II of the bill. They will function much as they do \nin title II, except that the projects will not require the approval of \nthe Secretary, as would title II projects. Also, under the specific \nterms of section 102(d)(1)(B) and section 102(c)(1)(B) counties could \nsplit their project funds between titles II and III as they choose.\n  We have also added a new title V to the bill to remedy a serious \nproblem caused by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 \ninvolving the sharing with the states of onshore mineral revenues and \nrevenues from geothermal steam. Prior to the 1993 act the federal \ngovernment and the states split these revenues on a fifty-fifty basis. \nThe 1993 act requires that the federal government deduct its previous \nyears expenses for administering these programs from the receipts \nbefore the fifty-fifty split is made. This requirement has proven very \ndifficult to implement due to general sloppiness of federal accounting \nsystems. The federal agencies and the states have become involved in \nnumerous disputes over the federal government's calculation of its \nadministrative expenses. In light of these problems, with the advice \nand the assistance of Senators Domenici and Bingaman, we propose to \nreturn to the pre-1993 system of calculating shared receipts.\n  Finally, we have added a conforming amendment in section 4 of the \nbill. This amendment specifies that payments required by this bill \nwould be included in the calculation of the payment in lieu of taxes \n(PILT) payments that each state receives. This change will result in \npayments under this act being treated in the same fashion as other \nnatural resource payments to the states.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of several of my colleagues in \ndeveloping the changes that went into the manager's amendment. I \nparticularly want to thank Senator Domenici and Senator Bingaman and \ntheir staffs for their assistance in putting together the manager's \namendment. The bill is a much better product because of their \ncontribution.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support passage of S. \n1608, the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of \n2000.\n  This bill will restore the financial and resource management links \nbetween the rural communities of America and our natural resource \nagencies.\n  The precipitous drop in financial support for education and \ninfrastructure needs of our rural counties will be restored by S. 1608.\n  These payments will now be steady and reliable. This bill also \nreverses the inward turning, and belt-way centered, thinking of \nresource managers by creating collaborative processes for natural \nresources management in our rural communities.\n  S. 1608 will provide rural communities and their public lands \nmanagers the opportunity to work together to improve the ecosystems by \ninvesting in the public lands.\n  I would like to express my appreciation for the months of work that \nhave been put in on this bill by my fellow members of the Energy \nCommittee: Senator Craig and Senator Wyden.\n  Bringing this bill to the floor today is the result of countless \nhours of briefings, dialog and negotiation with Senator Craig, Senator \nWyden, their staff, the National Forest County & Schools Coalition, and \nall the other groups that have expended time and effort to assure that \nthe educational needs of the kids in rural communities would not be \nneglected.\n  I would also like to express my appreciation to the Forest Service, \nDepartment of Agriculture, and others in the Administration who have \nbeen helpful in coming to the final product we see here today.\n  In closing I thank all those who have contributed to crafting S. 1608 \nfor their hard work.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill.\n\n[[Page S8521]]\n\n  And finally I look forward to the federal government reestablishing \nits support to the rural communities of this country so that they can \nmaintain their school systems and provide other needed county services.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I am pleased to speak to the \nSenate today in strong support of S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and \nCommunity Self-determination Act of 2000. As an original co-sponsor of \nthis legislation, I commend Senator Craig and Senator Wyden for their \nleadership in crafting a bill which brings all sides of the issue \ntogether. I want to take a minute to salute Oregon's county \ncommissioners, who kept this issue on top of their priority list, and \nwho made frequent trips to meetings in Oregon and here in Washington, \nD.C. to make sure this legislation moved forward. Oregon is a \nremarkably diverse state, but as I have traveled throughout Oregon, I \nhear the same thing in each of our 36 counties--and that's the fact \nthat passage of S. 1608 is their number one priority. I also want to \nthank President Clinton for his statement that he will sign this \nlegislation when it reaches his desk.\n  S. 1608 re-establishes the federal government's compact with rural \ncommunities--one that dates back to the early days of settlement in the \nWest--while providing much needed funding for environmentally sound, \nlocally developed projects to restore the health of federal watersheds \nand forests. Perhaps more importantly, this bill will ensure that the \nfederal government provides fair compensation to local governments so \nthat they in turn will be able to meet their communities' needs for \nschools and roads. I want to make sure my colleagues understand why \nthis legislation is needed, and how the counties in my State, as well \nas nearly 800 other rural counties in 41 other States, will suffer if \nwe do not pass S. 1608 today.\n  Nearly a century ago, the ``forest reserves'', precursors of our \nnational forests, were transferred from the Department of the Interior \nto the Department of Agriculture. At that time, the Congress understood \nthat placing these forest reserves in the federal government's trust \nwould have very negative effects on the property taxes local \ngovernments and local school systems could collect. To remedy this, \nCongress passed a law in 1908 to share 25 percent of the Forest \nService's gross receipts with the counties to partially compensate the \ncounties for the lost taxes. In addition, Congress designated these \nfunds to be spent on schools and county roads. Having directed the \nForest Service to pay very close attention to the needs of the local \ncitizens and industries in the ``1905 Transfer Act,'' coupled with the \npassage of the ``1908 25 Percent Payment Act,'' Congress had developed \na fair and workable compact with rural communities and counties. It was \na compact that worked very well for nearly 90 years.\n  Over the last ten years, however, as federal timber sales have \ndeclined by nearly 70 percent across the nation, rural counties in many \nstates began to see serious short-falls in their annual 25 percent \npayments. In Oregon, where federal timber sales have declined by an \neven greater margin, these shortfalls have been truly devastating for \nlocal governments.\n  As Federal lands have increasingly been declared ``off limits'' in \nrecent years, rural communities have worked hard to diversify their \neconomies. While tourism has flourished in certain pockets, to this \npoint it has not been a substitute for the family wage jobs the timber \nindustry once offered. Ultimately, there is only so much that local \ngovernments can do when 70 percent, 80 percent, or even more, of the \nland is tied up in federal holdings. The fact that local governments \nare no longer being adequately compensated for federal land ownership \nonly adds to the burdens of rural communities trying to bring in new \nindustries, provide education and health services, and bridge the \ndigital divide. This is what we are trying to address with S. 1608.\n\n  Lane County, Oregon, for example, has seen receipts from federal \nlands shrink by 65 percent over the last ten years. This has created a \ngaping $7 million hole in the resources the County uses to provide \nfamilies with basic needs, including public health and safety services, \nstrong education systems, and safe roads and highways. If S. 1608 is \nnot passed, Lane County faces the prospect of slashing its public works \nengineering staff by 50 percent, leaving roads and bridges threatened \nwith disrepair.\n  Perhaps Grant County in eastern Oregon makes an even more compelling \ncase for the passage of S. 1608. There, the local government has been \nforced to cut back to four day school weeks to make up for the \nshortfall in 25 percent payments. It is outrageous that the educational \nopportunities for children in rural areas of this country are being put \nin jeopardy by the decline of federal timber receipts.\n  Throughout my state and in communities in many other states with \nforest counties, sports and extra curricular activities have been \ndropped, and special programs for gifted and talented students have \nbeen sharply cut back. These communities have been forced to make \nheart-breaking decisions over whether to cut back social service \nprograms or school funding, or to sharply reduce sheriffs' patrols and \nclose jails, or to cut out all extra curricular activities at their \nschools. We have an opportunity today to answer the call of rural \nAmerica by passing this legislation and show our support for education \nand rural communities. The vote we cast today is not just a vote for or \nagainst legislation, it is a vote for or against the future of rural \nschools, roads, and children.\n  Now let me turn briefly to the objections raised by some in the \nenvironmental community regarding the resource projects authorized by \nthis bill. Apparently, the special interest groups that oppose S. 1608 \nover this issue would prefer that the historic relationship between the \nlocal community and the management of their neighboring federal lands \nbe severed completely. Of course, if we were to sever the longstanding \nrelationship between federal lands and the communities that host them, \nthese same special interest groups would merely have to hold sway over \nthe land management bureaucracy in Washington or the federal courts, \nnever having to face the people most affected by their policies.\n  Some of these groups have gone so far as to run slick attack ads \nagainst my colleague from Oregon, Senator Wyden, implying that the \nresource projects authorized by S. 1608 would open the door to \nclearcutting on our national forests. Colleagues, please don't be \nfooled by the Washington tactics being employed by the national \nenvironmental interest groups in opposition to S. 1608. This bill makes \nclear that these projects must be in compliance with federal \nenvironmental protection laws and that they must be formulated by a \nResource Advisory Committee made up of interested stakeholders, \nincluding environmentalists.\n  S. 1608 is supported by the National Forest Counties and Schools \nCoalition, a coalition of educators, county governmental officials, \nprivate companies, and many of the unions who represent people who \nlive, work, and teach in or near our federal forests. It is a Coalition \nof over 1,000 organizations that represents over 25 million people. In \nsupporting S. 1608, I am choosing to stand with those 25 million \npeople, to stand with thousands of rural communities in States \nstretching across America.\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to put themselves in \nthe position of a local government official from a small town in a \ncounty dominated by federal forest lands. We have many of them in my \nstate. Towns like John Day, Oakridge, and Riddle. Perhaps you have \ncounties with towns like these in your state. Imagine that your major \nresource-based industries have largely been shut down by various \nfederal actions over the last decade. Too many of the young people are \nhaving to move away to find jobs. As a local government leader you try \nand build up your community and yet you find--because your community is \nsurrounded by federal lands--that you often can't expand the land under \ndevelopment to bring in new industry, you often can't build roads or \nrecreation sites to bring in more tourism, nor can you tax federal \nforest lands to help pay for the kind of infrastructure or human \nresources you need to attract high tech companies to your area. What \nwould you do? How would you try and turn around the local economy with \nthe federal government turning a blind eye to the economic consequences \nof its actions? That is what we are trying to remedy today.\n\n[[Page S8522]]\n\n  Shutting down our public lands in the name of the public good comes \nwith a price--and it should not be rural America alone that has to pay \nit. It is long past time the federal government lived up to its \nfinancial obligation to these rural communities. A vote for S. 1608 is \na step toward that end. I thank my colleagues for joining us in this \neffort today.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate bill 1608, the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. I \nwould like to begin my comments today by drawing attention to the \ndetermined efforts of my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron \nWyden, on behalf of rural counties. Senator Wyden has worked tirelessly \nto ensure that counties with federal lands get a fair deal. He has not \nbeen alone in his efforts. Senator Craig from Idaho has been a vocal \nchampion of this legislation. And many other senators, notably Senator \nBoxer of California, have offered constructive input that has greatly \nimproved the legislation now before us.\n  As we all know, counties containing large amounts of public lands are \nnot able to raise sufficient revenues from taxes since the federal \ngovernment is not required to pay state or local taxes. Montana has one \nof the highest percentages of federally owned land of any state. This \nhas a very significant impact on the tax base of our counties, and they \nhave suffered because of it. As revenues from our national forests have \ndecreased, so too have the payments to counties. Fortunately, Senator \nWyden stepped in with a creative solution that ensures that counties \nhave the option to receive much more steady funding. S. 1608 recognizes \nboth the value of these public lands and the needs of the affected \ncounties. It is a wise compromise which allows counties the freedom to \nchoose the plan that best serves their needs.\n  Mr. President, I would like to say just a few comments about title \nIII of S. 1608. I felt that it was very important that counties have \nflexibility, not only in how their funding is determined but also in \nhow it is spent. This is why I proposed title III of this bill, and I \nam very pleased that the sponsors of the bill have accepted it.\n  Under this bill, each year counties may spend 15-20 percent of their \nfunding on either title II projects or on title III projects. As \noriginally drafted, S. 1608 focused primarily on activities occurring \non federal lands. Title III was an effort to give counties the option \nto focus on activities that are not necessarily ``on'' federal lands, \nbut that clearly relate to federal lands.\n  First, under title III, counties may use the funds as reimbursement \nfor search, rescue and emergency services, including fire fighting \nperformed on federal lands and paid for by the county. Mr. President, \nafter the ravages of the recent fires in Montana, many of which are \nstill burning, it is abundantly clear that counties desperately need \nthis funding for both fire prevention and fire fighting. Counties that \nare stretching to make ends meet for basic services, such as road \nbuilding and funding schools, simply can't afford to suddenly incur the \nmassive costs associated with fighting wildfires.\n  I can't impress upon you enough the catastrophic impact that this \nsummer's fires have had upon my state. The fires have raged out of \ncontrol on our federal lands, such as the fire picture here (in the \nBeaverhead-Deerlodge National Forest which covered nearly 85,000 acres \nand has not yet been contained. Cities have spent weeks under a cloud \nof smoke, as you can see in this photo of Helena. People, houses, and \nwildlife have all been threatened, and it is thanks only to the heroic \nefforts of our firefighters that so few lives and structures have been \nlost. I was honored to spend some time with these courageous \nindividuals, and I can tell you, you have never met a more hard-\nworking, determined crowd of folks. We owe them a heartfelt thank you, \nand I would like to express my personal gratitude for everything they \nhave done.\n\n  The process of rehabilitation and clean-up has only begun, and the \nwork we do now will be critical to ensuring the full recovery of our \nlands and our communities. For all of these reasons, I am very pleased \nthat we were able to change this bill to make sure that counties in \nMontana and across the West could get much-needed funds for \nfirefighting and related efforts this year and in future years.\n  It has also become clear that we need to do more to prevent danger \nfrom fires before they start. I've heard from many counties in Montana \nwho have said that they could prevent loss of life and property if they \nhad funding available to educate new homebuilders about where to build \nor not build their houses to reduce their exposure to wildfires and to \nmake sure that emergency equipment can get to their homes. Homeowners \nneed to know that a house built in the woods, especially if trees are \nnot cleared away from the building, as shown, will be very difficult to \nsave from fires. If the right materials are used in construction, \nhowever, homes can be made much less vulnerable. Under title III, \ncounties will have the funding to do this kind of education. They will \nalso be able to fund county planning efforts to increase the protection \nof people and property from wildfires.\n  Some of you may be under the mistaken impression that the entire \nstate of Montana was on fire this summer, but let me assure you--the \nfires have not destroyed the beauty and value of our public lands. \nUnder title III, counties can use funds to acquire easements to provide \nfor nonmotorized access to public lands for hunting, fishing and other \nrecreational purposes and to acquire conservation easements. These \noptions are very important in states like Montana where growth is \ngradually shutting off access to public lands and eliminating important \nfish and wildlife habitat. These provisions will give counties the \ntools to make sure that we are able to pass the West's outdoor heritage \non to our children and grandchildren.\n  This photo here is of Eric and Brittany Sharpe, children of Terry and \nCraig Sharpe of Helena. Eric and Brittany's dad is the head of the \nMontana Wildlife Federation, an organization that works non-stop to try \nto make sure that our children will be able to enjoy Montana's great \nfish and wildlife resource just as we do today.\n  Mr. President, let us never lose sight of the real reason we do the \nwork we do. Let us never lose sight of the children or ever forget for \neven a moment that we have a moral obligation to pass this place on to \nthem in as good a shape or better than we found it.\n  Finally, counties may also use funds to establish and conduct forest-\nrelated after school programs. Mr. President, the Washington Post \nrecently reported that 20 percent of all children in America are left \nunattended after school. In Montana, which has one of the highest \nincidents of parents having to work multiple jobs just to make ends \nmeet, this number may be even higher. What is clear is that children \nare less likely to get into trouble, less likely to commit acts of \nviolence, if they are involved in after school programs. In my mind, \nthis provision gives us a tremendous opportunity to work with our most \nprecious asset--the youth--and to give them opportunities to learn \nabout our forests and to gain hands-on experience in working on matters \nrelating to our forests.\n  I was very pleased to be able to add these important options to a \nbill that is critically needed to ensure the fair treatment of our \nrural counties. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to acknowledge the \nvital importance of these efforts and to give this bill, and the rural \ncounties of America, their full support.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I want to take a moment to elaborate \non two issues that were addressed in a colloquy between myself, Senator \nWyden and Senator Boxer.\n  First is the question of whether a county can choose to allocate \nfunds to both title II and title III in the same year. As should be \nclear from that colloquy, the bill has been drafted so that counties \nmay choose to send their funds to either title II or title III in any \ngiven year, but not to both.\n   Mr. President, I submit for the Record a legal memorandum from Janet \nA. Poling, Associate General Counsel for the U.S. Forest Service, which \nreaches the same conclusion about the effect of the language in S. 1608 \nas modified by the managers amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this legal memorandum be printed in the Record following this \nstatement.\n\n[[Page S8523]]\n\n  Second is the question of the role of the Resource Advisory \nCommittees in administering funds that a county wishes to expend under \ntitle III. As should be abundantly clear from the language of S. 1608 \nas amended and from the colloquy between myself, Senator Wyden and \nSenator Boxer, the Resource Advisory Committees are intended to have \nonly an advisory role on projects under title III. In short, counties \nare to have full discretion to spend title III funds for the purposes \nenumerated under title III without any restrictions or limitations \nplaced upon them by the Resource Advisory Committees.\n  Mr. President, a second legal memorandum from the Associate General \nCounsel for the U.S. Forest Service reaches this conclusion based on \nthe plain reading of S. 1608 as modified by the managers amendment. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this legal memorandum \nbe printed in the Record following the first legal memorandum that I \nsubmitted for the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                Office of the General Counsel,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 2000.\n     Informational Memorandum for Anne Keys, Deputy Under \n       Secretary for NRE\n     From: Janet A. Poling, Associate General Counsel, Natural \n         Resources.\n     Subject: Request for Legal Interpretation of Section \n         102(d)(1)(B) in the Manager's Amendment dated September \n         8, 2000, for S. 1608, the ``Secure Rural Schools and \n         Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.''\n       Issue: This memorandum responds to your request for our \n     legal interpretation of section 102(d)(1)(B) in the manager's \n     amendment dated September 8, 2000, for S. 1608. You have \n     asked whether an eligible county can elect to use the balance \n     of its funds for a combination of the listed purposes or \n     whether an eligible county can use the funds for only one of \n     the listed purposes.\n       Discussion: Section 102(d)(1)(B) of the subject manager's \n     amendment provides:\n       ``(d) Expenditure Rules for Eligible Counties.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the funds to be distributed to an \n     eligible county pursuant to subsection (c)--\n       (A) not less than 80 percent but not more than 85 percent \n     of the funds shall be expended in the same manner in which \n     the 25-percent payments are required to be expended; and\n       (B) at the election of an eligible county, the balance of \n     the funds not expended pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall--\n       (i) be reserved for projects in accordance with title II;\n       (ii) be spent in accordance with title III; or\n       (iii) be returned to the General Treasury in accordance \n     with section 302(b).''\n       We interpret subparagraph (B) as allowing an eligible \n     county to choose to use the balance of its funds for only one \n     of the three listed purposes. The provision would not allow \n     counties to use the funds for a combination of the purposes. \n     For example, an eligible county could elect to reserve the \n     funds for projects in accordance with title II or to spend \n     the funds in accordance with title III, but could not \n     allocate funds for both purposes.\n       Summary: Section 102(d)(1)(B) would allow an eligible \n     county to choose to use the balance of its funds for only one \n     of the three listed purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                Office of the General Counsel,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 13, 2000.\n     Informational Memorandum for Anne Keys, Deputy Under \n       Secretary for NRE,\n     From: Janet A. Poling, Associate General Counsel, Natural \n         Resources.\n     Subject: Request for Legal Interpretation of Section 302(a) \n         in the Manager's Amendment dated September 8, 2000, for \n         S. 1608, the ``Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-\n         Determination Act of 2000.''\n       Issue: This memorandum responds to your request for our \n     legal interpretation of section 302(a) in the manager's \n     amendment dated September 8, 2000, for S. 1608. You have \n     asked whether a participating county may use county funds \n     under the Title III on projects that have not been \n     recommended by a resource advisory committee.\n       Discussion: Section 302(a) provides:\n       ``(a) Limitation of County Fund Use.--County funds shall be \n     expended solely on projects that meet the requirements of \n     this title and section 205 of this Act except that: the \n     projects shall be approved by the participating county rather \n     than the Secretary concerned.''\n       Section 302(b) provides for the authorized uses of ``county \n     funds'' as that term is defined in section 301(2). Section \n     303 terminates the authority to initiate projects using \n     county funds at the end of fiscal year 2006.\n       Section 302(a) also limits the use of county funds to \n     projects that meet the requirements of section 205. Although \n     the reference to section 205 is ambiguous, section 302(a) is \n     most reasonably interpreted as requiring participating \n     counties to submit their proposals for the use of county \n     funds to the appropriate resource advisory committee for \n     review in accordance with section 205(b)(1). We see nothing \n     in the bill that requires approval of a proposed project by a \n     resource advisory committee as a prerequisite for the use of \n     county funds by a participating county. Our interpretation is \n     based in part on the proviso in section 302(a) that places \n     the final decision making authority for the use of county \n     funds with the participating county. Additionally, Title III \n     does not contain procedures similar to those in Title II \n     regarding projects recommended by resource advisory \n     committees.\n       Summary: We see nothing in the bill that requires approval \n     of a proposed project by a resource advisory committee as a \n     prerequisite for the use of county funds by a participating \n     county.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in closing, let me thank the bill's \nsponsors and all of the Senators who have exerted so much effort on the \nbehalf of our rural counties. Especially, let me thank Senators Wyden \nand Craig who have worked so hard to answer concerns that were raised \nby me and by other Senators, and who should receive full credit for the \npassage of this fine legislation.\n  Mr. President, I would like to draw attention to the determined \nefforts of my friend and colleague from Oregon, Senator Ron Wyden, on \nbehalf of rural counties. Senator Wyden has worked tirelessly to ensure \nthat counties with federal lands get a fair deal. As we all know, \ncounties containing large amounts of public lands are not able to raise \nsufficient revenues from taxes since the federal government is not \nrequired to pay state or local taxes. Recognizing that this is \nfundamentally unfair to these counties, Congress has tried for some \ntime to rectify this situation by providing funding from revenue \ngenerated on our public lands from payments in lieu of taxes in an \neffort to make the counties financially whole.\n  Unfortunately, as revenue from our national forests has decreased, so \ntoo have the payments to counties. This has been seriously disruptive \nto counties across the West. Fortunately, Senator Wyden stepped in with \na creative solution that insures that counties have the option to \nreceive much more steady funding. The bill now before us, S. 1608, \nrecognizes both the value of these public lands and the needs of the \naffected counties. It is a wise compromise which allows counties the \nfreedom to choose the plan that best serves their needs.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you for your very kind words, Senator Baucus. The \ncompromise legislation before us would not have been achieved without \nthe wise counsel and experience of the senior Senator from Montana, my \ngood friend, Senator Baucus. He has made substantial contributions to \nthis bill, particularly in developing title III and in championing the \nneed for adequate funding for the prevention and fighting of wildfires, \nlike those that have ravaged the West and his own State of Montana this \nsummer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my distinguished colleague from Oregon. Mr. \nPresident, I would like to say just a few comments about title III of \nS. 1608. Senators Wyden and Craig agreed to include title III in this \nbill at my request. I felt that it was very important that counties \nhave flexibility, not only in how their funding is determined but also \nin how it is spent. This is why I proposed title III of this bill, and \nI am very pleased that the sponsors of the bill have accepted it.\n  As explained by my colleague Senator Wyden, under this bill, each \nyear, counties may spend 15-20 percent of their funding either on title \nII projects or on title III projects. There has been some debate about \nwhether counties should be able to ``mix'' funds in a given year \nbetween title II and title III. Regardless of whether it would be a \nbetter policy to allow such mixing to occur or to maintain the current \nseparation between titles II and III, it is clear that, as drafted, S. \n1608 will not allow such mixing to occur. And while this may not be a \nperfect solution, rarely is any legislation passed by Congress that \ncould be characterized as ``perfect.''\n  Mr. WYDEN. Again, let me thank the senior Senator from Montana for \nhis work on title III, and add that I agree with his interpretation of \nthe separation between titles II and III. I would also express my \nwillingness to continue to work with him to assure the effective \nimplementation of this legislation, particularly of titles II and III.\n\n[[Page S8524]]\n\n  This is just one of countless issues that we have grappled with as we \nhave strived to make this bill as fair and responsive as possible to \nthe needs of our rural counties. We have made giant strides in \nimproving this legislation, and I thank all the Members who have been \nwilling to put aside their differences and work in a bipartisan effort \nto make this possible.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, let me talk for a moment about the \npurposes of title III. As originally drafted, S. 1608 focused primarily \non activities occurring on federal lands. Title III was an effort to \ngive counties the option to focus on activities that are not \nnecessarily ``on'' federal lands, but that clearly relate to federal \nlands.\n  First, under title III, counties may use the funds as reimbursement \nfor search, rescue and emergency services, including firefighting \nperformed on federal lands and paid for by the county. Mr. President, \nafter the ravages of the recent fires in Montana, some of which are \nstill burning, it is abundantly clear that counties desperately need \nthis funding for both fire prevention and fire fighting. Counties that \nare stretching to make ends meet for basic services, such as road \nbuilding and funding schools, simply can't afford to suddenly incur the \nmassive costs associated with fighting wildfires. I am pleased that we \nwere able to change this bill to make sure that counties in Montana and \nacross the West could get much-needed funds for firefighting this year \nand in future years.\n  For similar reasons, I drafted title III to allow counties to use the \nfunds to reimburse their expenses for search and rescue operations \nperformed on federal lands and for the salaries and benefits of county \nemployees who supervise adults or juveniles performing mandatory \ncommunity service on public lands.\n  Second, under title III, counties may use the funds to acquire \neasements to provide for nonmotorized access to public lands for \nhunting, fishing and other recreational purposes and to acquire \nconservation easements. These options are very important in states like \nMontana where growth is gradually shutting off access to public lands \nand eliminating important fish and wildlife habitat. These provisions \nwill give counties the tools to make sure that we are able to pass the \nWest's outdoor heritage on to our children and grandchildren.\n  Third, counties may use funds to establish and conduct forest-related \nafter school programs. Mr. President, the Washington Post recently \nreported that 20 percent of all children in America are left unattended \nafter school. In Montana, which has one of the highest incidents of \nparents having to work multiple jobs just to make ends meet, this \nnumber may be even higher. What is clear is that children are less \nlikely to get into trouble, less likely to commit acts of violence, if \nthey are involved in after school programs. In my mind, this provision \ngives us a tremendous opportunity to work with our most precious \nasset--the youth--and to give them opportunities to learn about our \nforests and to gain hands-on experience in working on matters relating \nto our forests.\n  Finally, under title III, counties can use the funds for fire \nprevention and county planning.\n  These activities are vitally important. I've heard from many counties \nin Montana who have said that they could prevent loss of life and \nproperty if they had funding available to educate new homebuilders \nabout where to build or not build their houses to reduce their exposure \nto wildfires and to make sure that emergency equipment can get to their \nhomes. And the same thing is true with respect to the materials that \nhomes are built out of and the manner in which homes are landscaped. \nHomeowners need to know that a house built in the woods should have a \nroof made out of tin or some other material that won't burn. Seemingly \naesthetic decisions can make the difference between a home and ashes \nduring a year like this one, and counties need funding to expand this \ntype of awareness.\n  The same basic reasoning applies to county planning. Counties should \nhave the funds available if they want to pass an ordinance requiring \nhomeowners to clear brush away from their homes. this can help protect \nlives not only of homeowners, but also of the firefighters who will be \ncalled in to extinguish burning structure fires. This can allow \ncounties to focus their emergency crews on problems that could not have \nbeen prevented. As written, this provision will also allow counties to \nfund other planning and zoning efforts to minimize the impact that \nunfettered development can have on our forests and streams. By \nproviding local communities with the tools to address these types of \nproblems, it is my sincere hope that this title will diminish the \nconflicts that occur around our public lands and will help ensure that \nour children and grandchildren can continue to enjoy these lands and \nthe fish and wildlife that they support well in to the future.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the senior Senator from Montana for his thorough \nexplanation of the provisions he helped craft, which became title III \nof the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, before I conclude, I just want to say a \nbrief comment about the relationship between title III and the Resource \nAdvisory Committees formed under title II. Unlike the projects in title \nII, the projects in title III are essentially local concerns. While \nthey relate to the lands that are held in trust for the American \npeople, the title III projects are not in any sense ``federal'' \nprojects. Items such as county planning and zoning have always been \nseen as local matters and it is not the intent of this legislation to \nchange that framework.\n  For that reason we have not given the Resource Advisory Committees \nthe same role in title III as they have in title II. Under Section \n204(a) of the bill, the Secretary may make a decision to approve a \nproject only if it is submitted to the Secretary by the Resource \nAdvisory Committee. By contrast, under title III, the counties approve \nthe projects and the Resource Advisory Committee serves in an advisory \ncapacity.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Senator Wyden, it is my understanding, along with our \ncolleague from Montana, that under section 302(a), counties must meet \nthe purposes of title III and section 205. You will note that section \n205 explicitly does not give the Resource Advisory Committees the power \nto either ``approve'' or ``disapprove'' projects. Rather, under section \n205, the Resource Advisory Committees are given the power to ``review'' \nand ``propose'' projects. This is critical distinction. Because, while \nwe want the Resource Advisory Committees to be involved--as indeed we \nwant all members of the interested public involved--we do not wish for \nthe Resource Advisory Committees to in any sense ``drive'' or \n``control'' or ``limit'' the use of title III funds. These funds are \nset aside for the counties and the counties should use them in their \nbest discretion.\n  Mr. Wyden, would you agree that this is the intent of the bill?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, that is the correct interpretation of the bill's \nlanguage and intent. The purpose of S. 1608 is to increase both county \nfunding and county choice. Unlike projects under title II, the role of \nthe Resource Advisory Committees is much more limited under title III \nand is limited to an advisory role.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Because the legislation does not specify the timing for \nResource Advisory Committee review of projects, is it the intent of the \nSenator from Oregon that the Resource Advisory Committee review \nprojects in a timely manner?\n  Mr. WYDEN. That is correct. It is my intent that a Resource Advisory \nCommittee would review projects in as expeditious a manner as possible, \nbut that in any event, the failure of a Resource Advisory Committee to \nreview a project in a timely manner would not under this bill be \ngrounds for denying a county the ability to move forward with it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. And is it also your intent, Senator Wyden, that projects \nunder title III may be submitted by the Resource Advisory Committees, \nthe public or the county itself?\n  Mr. WYDEN. Yes, that is correct. No one is excluded from submitting \nprojects under this bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you, Senator Wyden, for those responses to the \nquestions from the Senator from California.\n  In closing I would like to reiterate my admiration for the valiant \nefforts of the senior Senator from Oregon on behalf of this bill and \nrural counties. He has spent countless hours working to create this \nlegislation and to ensure\n\n[[Page S8525]]\n\nthat it passes through the Senate, and should be recognized as a true \nhero to rural America. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to \nacknowledge the critical importance of this work and to give this bill, \nand the rural counties of America, their full support.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to begin my comments by \ncommending the determined efforts of my friends from Oregon, Senator \nRon Wyden, and my friend from Idaho, Senator Larry Craig, on Behalf of \nrural counties. I would like to ask my colleague from Idaho a few \nquestions about S. 1608. First, I am concerned about the composition of \nthe resource advisory committees in section 205(d) of the bill. The \nbill identifies 3 groups of community interests that must be \nrepresented, and provides examples in each group. Is it the mangers' \nintent that the Secretary concerned will pick a representative from \neach example interest if that interest resides in the local area served \nby the advisory committee?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Yes it is our intent that the Secretary would select an \nindividual from each example group in each of the three categories of \ncommunity interests listed in section 205(d) when representatives of \nthat group are interested in the management of the public lands \noverseen by a particular advisory committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me ask a second question. Is it your view that the \nlanguage of section 102(d)(1)(B) and section 102(c)(1)(B) allows the \ncounties to divide their project funds between title II and title III \nprojects as they choose?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The plain language of these sections provides such \nflexibility. I agree with some who have stated that would be the best \npolicy, and the language would provide such an opportunity. I will \nleave it to the implementing agencies to decide how to best express the \nflexibility provided by these sections of statute.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you. Now I have a final question. Do the advisory \ncommittees function in much the same way in reviewing title II and \ntitle III projects?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The bill language in titles II and III provides that they \nwill function in much the same way, with a few differences. First, they \nare advisory to the Secretary in title II and to the relevant county in \ntitle III. In neither case do they actually approve projects, but their \nrecommendation is required. If there is no recommendation under title \nII the money will ultimately be returned to Treasury under the terms of \nsection 209. If there is no recommendation under title III, the \ncounties can ultimately spend the money on title III projects under the \nterms of section 303. It is my expectation that the authority of \nneither of these sections will be required. I believe that the resource \nadvisory committees will find consensus in developing and recommending \ntitle II and title III projects with the respective Secretaries or \ncounties as the case may be.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for these clarifications, and hope that \nthe affected agencies will implement this law accordingly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today the Senate is passing S. 1608, the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000. This \nlegislation will provide counties dependent upon the federal timber \nprogram with critically-needed funding to support education, road-\nbuilding and other county programs.\n  I want to commend Senator Wyden in particular for his leadership and \nhard work on this legislation. He tirelessly engaged in months of \ndiscussions with our Republican counterparts, the administration and \nfellow Democrats to develop a bipartisan, compromise piece of \nlegislation that will provide stability to timber-dependent counties \nfor years to come.\n  Since early in the last century, counties with significant federal \nland-holdings have received 25 percent of the revenue earned from \ntimber sales on those lands. Since federal lands cannot be taxed, these \nfunds provide counties with a critical source of revenue to maintain \nschools and roads.\n  Over the past decade, it has become clear that counties can no longer \ndepend upon these funds. In many areas, the timber program has declined \nor ceased altogether, reducing revenue that counties depend up to make \nends meet. As a result, many counties have had to cut educational \nprograms for children significantly. While counties in the Black Hills \nof South Dakota continue to receive adequate funding under existing \nlaws, recent challenges to the timber program in South Dakota and \nelsewhere have made it clear that we must have a safety net for all \ntimber-dependent counties.\n  No child's education should be dependent upon the federal timber \nprogram. S. 1608 severs that link by providing counties with the option \nof choosing a set payment based upon timber revenues they received in \nthe past or continuing with the current formula. This choice will \nprovide counties with the continuity and funding they need to provide a \nquality education for children in their schools.\n  I'd like to take a few minutes to highlight some important provisions \nof this bill. Like any product of compromise, it is not perfect, and \nthere are sections that I would like to see changed. Nonetheless, we \ncannot continue to sacrifice the education of schoolchildren while we \ndebate this bill. We need to move forward.\n  First, 85 percent of the funds made available by this bill go \ndirectly to counties to fund roads and schools. These funds are \ngenerally equivalent, or greater to, the amount of funding that \ncounties receive today. Additionally, it gives counties a choice of how \nto spend the remaining 15 percent. Remaining funds can either be used \nby counties to fund projects on federal lands, as described in Title \nII, or to fund county projects described in Title III such as search \nand rescue programs. If neither of these two options is chosen, the \nfund are returned to the Treasury.\n  While I am pleased that counties will have a choice of how to use the \nremaining 15 percent of funds, I have some reservations about the \nrequirements on the use of Title III funds. Given the fact that these \nfunds are used for programs normally carried out by counties, such as \neducation and search and rescue operations, it would be preferable to \nleave these responsibilities in the hands of county commissioners who \nare elected to make these decisions. Therefore, if this issue is \nconsidered in the future, I hope that we can take another look at the \nprocess for approving Title III projects.\n  Once again, I'd like to commend Senator Wyden, Senator Craig, Senator \nBaucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Boxer and Senator Torricelli for \ntheir thoughtful consideration of this legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today marks the passage of S. 1608, the \nSecure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000.\n  This bill is a promising example of bipartisanship and what can be \naccomplished when members of this body work together. Senator Wyden and \nSenator Craig have worked furiously over the past year to put together \na bill that gives relief to communities in economic stress due to \nchanges in management on our Federal lands. Our national forests need \nthe involvement of Federal, State, and local interests to restore \necosystems, provide stewardship opportunities and maintain forest \ninfrastructure. This bill attempts to bring people together to solve \nland management issues, working to create healthy forests and healthy \ncommunities.\n  S. 1608 will create resource advisory committees with representatives \nfrom across the spectrum, to develop stewardship projects on their \nsurrounding Federal lands. These projects, after approval from the \nSecretary, will create jobs for local people, and healthy forests for \nall.\n  As we watch our forests go up in smoke all over the west, and parts \nof the south, we are reminded how important healthy forests are to all \nof us. S. 1608 provides resources for healthy communities and forests.\n  By providing the mechanism, and the stable payments for counties to \nfund their local infrastructure, roads will be maintained, fire \ndepartments will be staffed and prepared, and rural communities will \nonce again feel secure in knowing their families will be protected, \nbecause their community infrastructure is in place and has a stable \nsource of funding.\n  S. 1608, the Secure Rural Schools and community Self Determination \nAct is a critical step toward guaranteeing\n\n[[Page S8526]]\n\nadequate educational funding for forest communities, while ensuring a \nstable, consistent source of general treasury funding for ecosystem \nrestoration, forest infrastructure maintenance and stewardship projects \non our national forest land. Parents will see a substantial increase in \nthe amount of money directed toward education in public schools. We \nhave counties in this country who have been forced to reduce the school \nweek to 4 days, eliminate after-school activities like band and \nathletics, because of a lack of money to fund the schools. S. 1608 \nworks to remedy this problem by sending more money to these counties \nfor the education of their children. In my home state of Mississippi, \nthe timber industry is the lifeblood of many of these small counties.\n  We hear people say everyday that our children are our future. I will \nsay it again today--our children are our future, and S. 1608 secures \nthe education of our children in many of the communities in desperate \nneed of help.\n  I care deeply about the health of this country's communities, \nschools, and forests, and therefore, I commend the valiant efforts of \nSenator Craig and Senator Wyden for their work on S. 1608. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be \nagreed to, the committee substitute amendment be agreed to, the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, the amendment to the title be agreed to, and that any \nstatements related to the bill be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4139) was agreed to.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1608), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The bill will be printed in a future edition of the Record.)\n  The title was amended so as to read:\n  ``A bill to provide stability and predictability to the annual \npayments made to States and counties containing National Forest System \nlands and public domain lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management \nfor the benefit of public schools and roads and to enhance the health, \ndiversity and productivity of federal lands.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I thank my \ncolleagues, particularly Chairman Craig, Senator Gordon Smith, who was \nso extraordinarily helpful, Senator Bingaman, Senator Baucus, Senator \nBoxer, and many of our colleagues who put in a great many hours on this \nlegislation.\n  Frankly, 18 months ago, they said it could not be done. This \nlegislation 18 months ago was an ideological magnet for those who \nwanted to debate natural resources policy. Senator Craig and I said \nthis legislation, which funds basic services in rural America for \nschools, roads, and other essential services, was beyond that kind of \ndiscussion. It was too important to try to settle all of the divisive \nissues about natural resources on this legislation.\n  I am very pleased this bipartisan legislation has been passed because \nthis legislation sends a strong message that it is not right for \nFederal policies to turn rural communities into economic sacrifice \nzones. I believe this reinvents the relationship between local \ncommunities and the Federal lands that are so important to them. It \nwill ensure that we can provide for the economic livelihood of folks in \nrural communities, but also it ensures that in the future we are going \nto focus on watershed restoration and conservation easements and a wide \nvariety of measures that are going to protect ecosystems.\n  I thank my colleague who is on the floor, Chairman Craig. As I said, \n18 months ago no one would have thought that we could be here tonight \nwith this extraordinarily important legislation for rural America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for no \nmore than 1 minute. I want to respond to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I will briefly respond to my colleague from \nOregon in relation to the legislation about which he has just spoken. I \ncertainly agree with him. He and I, working together--I as chairman of \nthe Forestry Subcommittee, he as the ranking member--saw and recognized \na crisis in the rural communities of America that were once named \ntimber dependent because they had derived a share of their revenue to \nfund their schools, roads, and bridge funds from the revenue of timber \nreceipts which have faded dramatically. We began to work together on a \nresolution of the problem, and tonight we have brought that to the \nfloor.\n  I certainly agree with Senator Wyden. It was contentious at times, \nbut we saw the need to respond to what literally had become a national \ncrisis in rural resource-dependent communities across our country.\n  Well over 4,000 school districts and nearly 50,000 children were \nvictimized by actions or policies that failed to recognize that we had \nto adjust law and/or change policy or we were simply going to find \nthese school districts beyond their capacities not only to fund but to \neducate. It was also true with counties' roads and bridge funds.\n  The legislation that has just passed the Senate tonight sets us in a \ndirection of resolving that problem and bringing about a resolution \nthrough a collaborative process at the local level between so many \nstakeholders who have legitimate concerns and interests as to how the \nnatural resources of our public lands be managed.\n  I am so pleased that we could work toward an end that we have arrived \nat tonight that is embodied in S. 1608. We still have work to do in \nadjusting our public policies to bring about the kind of balance we \nneed.\n  As the Presiding Officer well understands, rural America, be it \nagricultural policy or resource policy, finds itself with very real \nproblems today. It is going to be incumbent upon some of us in this \nbody to try to address those problems, both in the adjustment of policy \nand certainly in the recognition of the necessary resources to help \nthese communities. Tonight, in part, we will have responded to that \nneed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "13"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/09/13/senate-section/article/S8526-1", "month": "09", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8526-S8527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  AUTHORIZATION OF DOCUMENT PRODUCTION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following \nconvention transmitted to the Senate on September 13, 2000, by the \nPresident of the United States: Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent \nFuel and Radioactive Waste Management (Treaty Document No. 106-48); I \nfurther ask that the convention be considered as having been read the \nfirst time; that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed; and that the \nPresident's message be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\n\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for Senate advice and consent to ratification, \nthe Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the \nSafety of Radioactive Waste Management, done at Vienna on September 5, \n1997. Also transmitted for the information of the Senate is the report \nof the Department of State concerning the Convention.\n  This Convention was adopted by a Diplomatic Conference convened by \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in September 1997 and was \nopened for signature in Vienna on September 5, 1997, during the IAEA \nGeneral Conference, on which date Secretary of Energy Federico Pena \nsigned the Convention for the United States.\n  The Convention is an important part of the effort to raise the level \nof nuclear safety around the world. It is companion to and structured \nsimilarly to the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS), to which the \nSenate gave its advice and consent on March 25, 1999, and which entered \ninto force for the United States on July 10, 1999. The Convention \nestablishes a series of broad commitments with respect to the safe \nmanagement of spent fuel and radioactive waste. The Convention does not \ndelineate detailed mandatory standards the Parties must meet, but \ninstead Parties are to take appropriate steps to bring their activities \ninto compliance with the general obligations of the Convention.\n  The Convention includes safety requirements for spent fuel management \nwhen the spent fuel results from the operation of civilian nuclear \nreactors and radioactive waste management for wastes resulting from \ncivilian applications.\n  The Convention does not apply to a Party's military radioactive waste \nor spent nuclear fuel unless the Party declares it as spent nuclear \nfuel or radioactive waste for the purposes of the Convention, or if and \nwhen such waste material is permanently transferred to\n\n[[Page S8528]]\n\nand managed within exclusively civilian programs. The Convention \ncontains provisions to ensure that national security is not compromised \nand that Parties have absolute discretion as to what information is \nreported on material from military sources.\n  The United States has initiated many steps to improve nuclear safety \nworldwide in accordance with its long-standing policy to make safety an \nabsolute priority in the use of nuclear energy, and has supported the \neffort to develop both the CNS and this Convention. The Convention \nshould encourage countries to improve the management of spent fuel and \nradioactive waste domestically and thus result in an increase in \nnuclear safety worldwide.\n  Consultations were held with representatives from States and the \nnuclear industry. There are no significant new burdens or unfunded \nmandates for the State or industry that should result from the \nConvention. Costs for implementation of the proposed Convention will be \nabsorbed within the existing budgets of affected agencies.\n  I urge the Senate to act expeditiously in giving its advice and \nconsent to ratification.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, today the Commerce Committee had an \noversight hearing on violence marketed to children by the entertainment \nindustry. This oversight is long overdue. I congratulate Senator McCain \nfor holding such a hearing.\n  The purpose of the hearing was to look at the FTC study that just \ncame out that charged the entertainment industry with marketing of \nviolent films and videos to children.\n  The bottom line is that as we have heard President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore respond to the FTC rulings, there is an inconsistency in \ntheir responses and how they have generally interacted with Hollywood \nover the last 8 years.\n  I establish as a basis for my remarks some quotes from the various \nnewspapers of the recent month and a half. For instance, on September \n12, the Washington Post, commenting on this, said:\n\n       In separate time zones, but with one message, President \n     Clinton and Vice President Gore delivered a joint threat to \n     the entertainment industry today that harsh regulation could \n     come if the makers of explicit and violent movies, recordings \n     and video games do not stop advertisement at children.\n\n  I continue to read from the same story in the Washington Post. Later \non it says:\n\n       But Gore has not always appeared consistent on this issue. \n     In 1987, as he was gearing up for his first presidential \n     campaign, Gore and his wife held a meeting with rock music \n     executives in which Gore apologized for his role in a 1985 \n     Senate Commerce Committee hearing on rock music lyrics. A \n     tape of the meeting was obtained by Daily Variety. Tipper \n     Gore, who had testified at the hearing on behalf of the \n     Parents Music Resource Center, called the hearing ``a \n     mistake. . .that sent the wrong message.''\n       Last year, the Los Angeles Times reported that Gore met \n     privately with potential donors in the entertainment industry \n     in July 1999 and told them the idea for the FTC study--\n\n  Which I just referred to--\n\n       was Clinton's and not his, and that he was not consulted.\n\n  Then on August 18, the Chicago Tribune shows an inconsistency in how \nthey react and work with Hollywood at different times. It says:\n\n       In southern California, records show, Gore and the \n     Democratic National Committee so far have raised $10.3 \n     million--a 13 percent increase--at a time when the DNC's \n     nationwide fundraising pace is lagging behind 1996, when \n     Clinton ran for re-election.\n\n  Quoting further in the article:\n\n       Gore generated $443,050 in hard money from the \n     entertainment industry, 86 percent more than Clinton in 1996. \n     He also took in $340,375 from lawyers and lobbyists, a 66 \n     percent increase, and $124,350 from real estate interests, an \n     82 percent jump.\n\n  Now I will quote from the August 18 Los Angeles Times. The reference \nin the headline reads: ``. . .The Vice President is building upon that \nlegacy'' to follow Clinton's close relationship with Hollywood. ``He \nhas already raised more than the President did in '96.''\n\n  Later on in that article, referring to a person whom I do not know--\nhis name is Reiner:\n\n       But Reiner . . . has expressed greater support for Gore \n     than he had for Clinton. He has\n\n[[Page S8529]]\n\n     hosted fund-raisers for Gore at his home, stumped for him on \n     television and even flew to Ohio to join him at a campaign \n     event last week.\n\n  A reference to the fact there were Hollywood types campaigning \nstrongly for the Vice President because there was some chagrin in \nHollywood, at least for a short period of time, about whether he is a \nlegitimate crusader against Hollywood violence, which Senator Lieberman \nis, that he was being selected as Vice President.\n  The Los Angeles Times reports on August 17, 2000--and this was Vice \nPresident Gore doing this.\n\n       The effort to blunt any dissent over Lieberman's selection \n     started as word leaked out of his ascension to the ticket. \n     Gore, according to an associate, made a round of soothing \n     calls to Hollywood figures, including moguls Jeffrey \n     Katzenberg and David Geffen.\n\n  I have already congratulated Senator McCain for holding this hearing. \nWe need to do what we can to stop violence being peddled by Hollywood \nso our young people do not think it is right to kill anybody. I do \nthink it is wrong for the very people who are carrying on this \ncrusade--the Vice President and the President--schmoozing at the same \ntime they are carrying on this campaign with Hollywood.\n  I want to comment on Vice President Gore's curious interest in \ncriticizing the entertainment industry for producing violent movies, \ntelevision shows, and video games that promote immorality and attack \ntraditional family values.\n  I do not doubt for 1 minute, as I have already indicated, that \nSenator Lieberman is very sincere in his views on this matter, but the \nfact is that the Vice President is at the top of the Democratic ticket, \nand everyone knows that he will set the real tone should he be elected \nin November.\n  The fact is that the Vice President has taken a record amount of \nmoney from the entertainment industry. I refer, again, to the Chicago \nTribune. The Vice President and the Democratic National Committee have \nraised $10.3 million from southern California as of August this year, a \n13 percent increase over 1996, and the Vice President has gotten \n$443,050 in hard money from the entertainment industry, 86 percent more \nthan President Clinton received in 1996.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration has been a real friend to the \nHollywood liberals over the years. I guess all of those campaign \ncontributions have had some effect. I think that when Hollywood \nproducers hear one of their best friends in Washington criticize the \nentertainment industry, they just look to their ``cozy relationship'' \nwith Clinton-Gore. The Hollywood moguls know Gore does not really mean \nwhat he says; at least that is a clear signal. Hollywood knows Gore \ndoes not really want to ``rock the boat.''\n  For instance, how many times at these fundraisers that they had was \nthe opportunity taken to protest the violence coming from Hollywood \nthrough their films and their videos?\n  According to the L.A. Times, the Vice President privately told a \ngroup of Hollywood donors that he had nothing to do with President \nClinton's effort to study whether Hollywood markets violence to \nchildren and that he was not consulted on the issue. That was in 1999.\n  But now that the study is out--this study came out this week--Vice \nPresident Gore is talking it up and taking credit. The Vice President \nis acting as if he has not made private promises to his big campaign \ndonors and to Hollywood notables that they should not worry about a \ncrackdown on Hollywood excesses. But we have heard all of this before.\n  In 1988, then-Senator Gore made similar promises after holding \nhearings into offensive music lyrics. It appears the Vice President \nwill say what he wants to say, what he needs to say, to anybody he \nneeds to say it to, just to get elected. I think the American people \nwill not be fooled by these kinds of bait-and-switch tactics. They know \na phony act when they see one.\n  In fact, Hollywood liberals are actively campaigning for the Vice \nPresident. For example, according to press reports, stars and movie \nproducers have hosted Gore fundraisers, and some have even stumped for \nGore around the country. So much then for standing up to Hollywood as \nopposed to schmoozing with them.\n  The American people need their leaders to take a genuine interest in \nbuilding a civil society of which we can all be proud. We need leaders \nwho will make sure children are protected from violence and immorality \npeddled under the guise of entertainment.\n  What we do not need is the Vice President telling the American people \none thing while--with a wink and nod towards Hollywood, towards the big \nshots of the movie industry--assuring the Hollywood elite he does not \nmean what he says as he pockets their cold cash.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have, for many days, been debating the \nmomentous decision of extending permanent normal trade relations with \nChina.\n  At the essence of our debate is a very simple question: Will we \ncontinue a policy of economic engagement with China or will we turn \naway? I believe we have to continue this policy of engagement. We have \npursued this policy for almost 30 years. It has contributed to profound \nchange in China. But it has not transformed China into a classical \nliberal democracy. It has not led to the establishment of a multiparty \ndemocracy, with an independent judiciary protecting the rights of \nChina's people, particularly the rights of expression. It has not \ncramped China's policy which supports the proliferation of weapons of \nmass destruction. But it has placed China on a very different \nhistorical trajectory than could have taken place.\n  This notion of the change brought in China came to me with great \nforce last August when I was traveling through China. I was at Dandong \non the Yalu River. We were looking across into North Korea. One of our \nguides pointed out that in the 1950s and early 1960s, North Korea had a \nhigher per capita income. North Korea was seen as the model of \nsocialist development in Asia. North Korea had had a heavy industrial \nsector that was competitive with many parts of the world.\n  Yet today--at that time last year--we were peering into a country \nthat was starving, that had an economic system in collapse, that we \nwere concerned could be so unstable they could threaten the peace of \nthe region.\n  They did not choose the trajectory of international trade. They did \nnot choose the path of engagement with the West. One can ask: Had China \ngone that route, had we not tried to engage China, would we be facing \ntoday a country with over 1 billion people hermetically sealed in an \neconomically failing and ideologically driven country, armed with \nnuclear weapons? If we were confronting such a country, I think we \nwould be much worse off than we are today, even with the frustrating \nand uneven relationship that we have--and we must admit we have--with \nChina. So I believe that we must continue this policy of engagement, \nwhich is at the heart of the extension of permanent normal trade \nrelations.\n  China is now a part of the world and the world economy, but it is \nalso still China. It is a mixture of modernity and also a mixture of \nthe old, indeed, the ancient.\n  One of the examples that I have seen in China--this one occurred just \na few weeks ago when I was traveling there again--is the contrast in \nWuhan. Wuhan is a city on the Yangtze Sea in China. It is an old city, \nnot like the new cities on the coast such as Shanghai and other cities. \nIt is in some respects the Pittsburgh of China. It is a highly intense, \nheavily industrial city. You can tell that from the extraordinarily bad \nair pollution.\n  There are two companies we saw. One was the Wuhan Iron and Steel \nCompany. It is right out of the industrial age. Andrew Carnegie would \nhave been right at home, except for the 386 computers that were running \nthe facility.\n  Then we saw another factory, the Yangtze Fiber Optic Company. Modern; \nit could have been in Silicon Valley in California, producing fiber \noptic cable, producing it to world standards, initially a product of \ninvestment by the Dutch company Phillips, now a wholly owned enterprise \nby Chinese owners. These are the examples of the economy--the old and \nthe very modern.\n\n[[Page S8530]]\n\n  In addition to that, when you go out into the villages, you see \nperhaps the truly ancient. As you drive through China, you \nsee individuals hammering away, as they have for thousands of years, \nrepairing bicycles with hammers and not much else. You see farming \nactivities that could go back thousands of years. It is a diverse \ncountry. But it is a country that has been profoundly affected by \nchange in its contact with the West over the last several decades.\n\n  The other factor that is being seen as a result of this contact is \nthe pressures within China generated by this change. We sometimes, and \nquite rightly, look to the effects on the United States by this trade \ndeal. We presume that the only effects that are felt in China are \npositive, are beneficial, that in fact they are not going to make \ndifficult choices and decisions. In fact, the reality is they are \nalready seeing the effects of this change, of this contact with the \nWest.\n  In the New York Times recently, there was an article about a factory \nin China where the workers, who were being let go because of the \nconsolidation of this factory by their Western owners, were seizing the \nmanagement, were blockading the facility, were effectively revolting \nfrom the effects of international trade.\n  There are examples of violence where inefficient state-owned mines \nand enterprises are threatened with closure and workers are literally \nrising up to demand that these facilities remain open.\n  So this change has also affected China. This change is recognized by \nthe leadership. I had the opportunity to meet with Zhu Rongji, the \nPremier, while I was there just a few weeks ago. They understand very \nwell that economic change will lead to political change. They might not \nwelcome it. They might indeed try to avoid it. But they know that \npolitical forces, as well as economic forces, are unleashed when \nmarkets are open. That is one of the effects we will see through this \nextension of permanent normal trade relations.\n  For many reasons, I believe to step away would be a mistake. It would \nimmediately embolden those who are our most bitter antagonists within \nChina. It would, in many ways, take away the legitimacy of those forces \nin China, not liberals, but pragmatists who have sought a relationship \nwith the West, and the United States in particular, that emphasizes \ntrade over hostility, that emphasizes engagement over conflict.\n  To step away would also allow industrial nations around the world to \ntake the benefits of our deal, the benefits of our bilateral \nrelationship, the benefits of open trade with China, while we \nineffectively try to use our abstention, our veto of China's entry into \nWTO, as very ineffectual political leverage to move them.\n  To step away would also represent a serious rupture in our relations \nwith China that could not be explained away as merely a dispute about \ntrade, the technicalities of trade. It would harden attitudes and \nopinions within China and, indeed, here in the United States at a time \nwhen we need a constructive and candid dialogue about our differences. \nAnd our differences are real. In order to discuss these differences, in \norder to maintain this dialogue, the extension of PNTR is essential.\n  It is quite evident at this juncture that a majority of my colleagues \nin the Senate find these reasons compelling, and PNTR will pass. But \nlooking ahead, we should, at this point, be very cognizant of the \npossible consequences of PNTR. It will not be a panacea. It will not \nchange China overnight. It will not lead to a huge increase in American \nexports to China. It will, in fact, create consequences that we may \nfind very difficult. In fact, one of the points I tried to raise with \nPremier Zhu Rongji is that our expectations of China after PNTR will \ncollide with the reality of China and may, indeed, usher in a period of \nmore tension rather than less.\n  Now China wants desperately to be part of this commercial system that \nis made up of the United States and our major trading partners--for \nwant of a better term, ``first world'' countries--all in precise terms, \nall carrying a sense of who the players are. But this system has some \nembedded values with which the Chinese will have to come to grips.\n  Our system emphasizes the protection of property rights. It also \nemphasizes the expectation of the regularity of governmental \naction. That is a polite term for ``no corruption.'' That is at the \nheart of our trading system. China has to come to grips with that.\n\n  Moreover, I do not believe China can divorce itself from even more \nfundamental values that are part and parcel of the world outside of \ndeveloping countries. They start with respect for human rights, which \nis at the core of our democratic values, and they include protections \nfor workers and the environment. We may have been unsuccessful in \ngetting into these agreements, with force and with effect, language \nregarding human rights and worker rights and environmental rights, but \nno country or economy in the world can operate indefinitely today \nwithout recognizing these rights. In a world of increasingly \ntransparent borders, the lessons of the economic, social and, indeed, \none would say, moral success which has steadily improved the life of \nthose who live in market economies in the West, do not escape the \npeople in China and the people around the world. To the extent that \nthey open themselves up to trade, they open themselves up to exposing \nthese values to their own people.\n  China has a monumental task as they embrace this notion of free \ntrade. It is not a one-way street. It is a two-way street. They face \nthe task of transforming a system that is seriously undermined by \npersistent corruption, that pays scant respect to individual rights, \nthat chooses order over law, and is obsessed with the need to keep \nmillions of people working in an economy dominated by inefficient \nstate-owned enterprises. Add to those domestic problems that are real \nand palpable the fear that internal disorder will lead to the \nexploitation of China by outside forces, a situation that dominated \nChinese history in the last century and up until the 1940s.\n  In one respect that is one of the major reasons why they are \nmilitarily provocative in many ways to us, because to us they look as \nif they want to, perhaps figuratively, take over the world. In China, \nthey recognize that recently their country was divided by Americans, by \nBritish, by Germans, and that their country was ruled by others rather \nthan themselves. All these forces are at play.\n  The tremendous challenge to transform this country, the fear of their \nown security as a nation, because of these realities, we should not be \nsurprised if China promises today more than it intends or even can \ndeliver tomorrow with respect to these agreements.\n  In an article in the American Prospect, James Mann, who is a very \nastute observer of China, pointed out that we frequently develop \nperceptions about China that are different than the reality of China. \nMany perceive China today as this modern country that is an economic \nmonolith of force, of incredible production, a force of endless and \ncooperative labor. They also see it as a monolithic political system, \nwith the Communist party dominating, that is capable of turning on a \ndime, turning the switch left or right. The reality is more \ncomplicated.\n  The Chinese Communist Party plays the central role in the country, \nbut it is an institution with internal factions. Some favor engagement \nwith the West. Some disfavor it. Some harken back to the Maoist \nCultural Revolution as the zenith of China. Others, quite properly--I \nhope the majority--reject that as a fantasy. But it is also a central \nauthority that is constantly challenged by its provinces, constantly \nchallenged by local political leaders. And the modernity of China, if \nyou go to Shanghai, if you go to Hong Kong, certainly since it has not \nbeen absolved back into mainland China, that rapidly diminishes as you \ngo away from the coast, as you go to the older cities, Wuhan and \nShenyang, which years ago was known as Mukden, and as you travel to the \nsmall villages. Even with the wholehearted support of the leadership \nand the commitment of the party, it is hard to make things change.\n  Mann relates a meeting between President Nixon and Mao Zedong in \n1973. President Nixon opened with a bit of flattery by saying: \n\n       The Chairman's writings have moved the nation and have \n     changed the world.\n\n  Mao, without missing a beat, retorted:\n\n\n[[Page S8531]]\n\n\n       I haven't been able to change it. I have only been able to \n     change a few places in the vicinity of Beijing.\n\n  The power, the capability, the willingness of China to change is \nquestionable. But we know with the advent of WTO, even without WTO, \nwith the continued pressure of interaction internationally, China will \nhave to change. It has to reform inefficient industries while it still \ntries to maintain current employment and create 18 million jobs a year \nfor new entrants into the labor force. This task alone has led to angry \nand sometimes violent conflict. It has to overhaul its justice system. \nIt has to root out corruption. It also has to convince a very cynical \npopulation, particularly cynical about the Communist Party, that their \nfuture is going to be better rather than worse.\n  This is not an apology of China. This is, I hope, a statement of the \nreality of the challenges they face and the challenges that we have to \nunderstand as not only trading partners but as major powers in this \nworld together.\n  In this collision between faithful implementation of WTO rules and \nthe prospect of profound change that faces China, the Chinese \nleadership will be more than tempted to delay or undermine or \nmisconstrue WTO rules. That, I would posit, is a very high probability. \nWhen this happens, ironically the business community that is descending \nupon us today to open up China, to get China into WTO, will descend \nupon us with equal force and say: Get tougher. And even without \nscrupulous adherence to the WTO, change is going to come to China. If \nthis change further exacerbates the plight of millions of workers, the \nleadership could embark on a strongly nationalistic and assertive \nforeign policy as a means to galvanize support, to distract a \ndisenchanted public from economic shortfalls. This could lead to more \nproliferation, more bellicose threats to Taiwan, the kind of military \nrumors that we all find disconcerting when it comes to China.\n  Having said all this, having painted a picture of what, in my view, \nare some of the realities of China, and having very little confidence \nthat this arrangement will be adhered to scrupulously and fairly and \nroutinely and quickly, one might ask: Then why do it?\n  We might not be getting a lot out of PNTR. Indeed, by voting for \nPNTR, we may only be trading the certainty of hostility for the chance \nto continue a relationship that is frustrating at best. But this \nrelationship is critical to stability in the region and around the \nglobe. For this reason, national security reason, if you would so \ndescribe it, this opportunity for stability, opportunity for time to \nwork out some of these very fundamental problems is worth the effort.\n  We should also understand, as I have described the rigorous change \nthat might come to China, that this agreement will not be painless for \nthe United States. There will be economic sectors, communities, \nfamilies who will see their lives changed. We hope for the better, but \nwe know that change works both ways. Industries are less competitive in \ncertain cases. Products can be produced more efficiently, more \neffectively, more cheaply overseas, displacing American workers. So we \nhave to recognize, too, that our response to this issue is not simply \npassing this legislation this week. It is continuing our efforts, \nindeed, redoubling our efforts to ensure that we have an education \nsystem in the United States that can prepare people for this world of \nintense competition, that we have a health care system that will allow \nfamilies, particularly children, to have access to the best care in the \nworld, that we will have a disciplined fiscal policy in this country \nthat will provide the foundation, along with sensible monetary policy, \nfor the continued expansion of our economy so that those economic \nbenefits can flow not only to the very few but to all Americans.\n  Our task is not to reject PNTR. Our task, if we accept PNTR, which I \nsuspect we will, is to ensure that our efforts are directed to improve \nthe quality, the competitiveness, the abilities of our workers. When we \ndo that, we will have much less to fear about the disruptive change \nthat will come through PNTR.\n  Now, I have spent some moments speaking about the major themes I see \nemerging with respect to PNTR in relationship to China. Let me take a \nfew more moments to talk about the tangible aspects of this legislation \nbefore us. This legislation is unlike other trade arrangements that I \nhave debated and voted upon, specifically regarding NAFTA, where we \nwere lowering our tariff barriers and opening our markets, and we were \nlooking at a comparable lowering of barriers in Mexico.\n  This is a situation where our markets are already open to China. Our \nmarkets have been open for years. This is the first time, though, we \nhave had meaningful tariff reduction by the Chinese, meaningful \nelimination of nontariff barriers by the Chinese, opening up of a broad \nrange of American industry--industrial, service industries, all of \nthem--so that they can enter into China, allowing our companies to \noperate without necessarily having Chinese partners, allowing our \ncompanies to have their own distribution systems within China. This is \na deal, economically, that represents concessions by the Chinese in \nterms of tariff barriers, nontariff barriers, entry of American \nbusiness, and investment with very little, if any, concessions on our \npart because the reality is we have already, in effect, made those \nconcessions years and years ago.\n  The agreement binds tariff rates that China will charge on our goods \nbecause of the WTO framework, so that it can't unilaterally raise the \ntariffs. As I mentioned before, it covers a broad array of American \nproducts, banking, insurance, telecommunications, business, and \ncomputer services--all of which have had a difficult time getting into \nChina. It also attempts to protect in a very meaningful way potential \nsurges in goods of China coming in to the U.S. It allows us to use some \ndomestic dumping tools that we already have in our legal inventory. It \nhas gone a long way to try to counteract a surge of Chinese products \ncoming in.\n  But opponents, and indeed proponents, of this legislation point out \nan inescapable fact: We are running huge trade deficits to the world \nand, in particular, China. These trade deficits are something we have \nto deal with. Coincidentally, today, it was just announced that the \ntrade deficit has hit an all-time high. It continued to break records \nthis spring as foreigners kept pouring investment into the American \neconomy and Americans stepped up their buying of foreign goods. We have \na huge problem with our trade deficit. It is a ticking time bomb. China \nis a big part of it, but China is not the only part of it.\n  Interestingly enough, a rapidly increasing percentage of American \nimports now comes from nations where wages are actually higher than in \nthe United States--including Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, and \nAustria. They all enjoy booming exports from the United States. The \ncurrent stereotypical thinking is that cheap wages in China is why they \nproliferate all their goods, and that is our problem; we are competing \nthe heck out of the old European countries. But it turns out that is \nnot the case either. In this world, company productivity, efficiency, \nquality in the workforce, and to be productive are just as determining.\n  My point in all of this is that we have a trade deficit, but it is \nnot solely, exclusively a function of China. I believe the response to \nthat is not rejecting PNTR. It is first recognizing consciously the \ndifficulty and beginning consciously and deliberately with respect to \nall of our trading partners to get more American products into their \nmarkets, to properly look at the techniques they are using to get their \ngoods into our market, and to, in effect, look at this problem not as a \nChinese problem but as an American problem. And it will be an American \nproblem if we do not pay sufficient attention. It will be manifested in \na sudden and rapid deterioration of our currency if enough forces come \ninto play.\n  At present, we are living in a world in which the security of the \nAmerican market, the attractiveness of our investments, rules and \nregulations of the SEC, and a host of other things, make America a safe \nhaven, a place where you want to put your money. But there may come a \nday when investors--and not principally Chinese investors, but others--\ndecide they are going to start selling American currency short because \nthey can put the money elsewhere.\n\n[[Page S8532]]\n\n  Now, we have all seen the benefits of trade with China. I have seen \nit in Rhode Island. It has been growing from a very small base to a \nmoderately larger base, and it continues to grow. In fact, years ago, \none of the first glimpses I had of the global economy was going to an \nItalian parade on Federal Hill in Providence, RI, meeting a gentleman \nwith whom I chatted. I took him to be a jewelry worker or somebody who \nworked in the plant. It turns out he owned that business in Rhode \nIsland. We were chatting and he asked me, ``Have you ever been to \nChina?'' That was 5 or 6 years ago. Then, he casually said he owned an \naerosol factory in Beijing. So I knew when you go to an Italian \nfestival in Providence and chat with a businessman and he owns an \naerosol factory in China, the world is getting much smaller. It is \nhappening all across the country.\n  What we have tried to do in this agreement--we, the negotiators--is \nto recognize that some of our products that are very dear to the hearts \nof our economy will get some benefits. For example, on precious metals \nand jewelry--a huge part of our economy and still an important part--\nChina will reduce its tariffs from 40 percent to 11 percent. That, we \nhope, will help. In terms of information technology products, that is \nsomething we would like to be a bigger part of our economy, but it is a \ngrowing part. China will eliminate all duties on computers, \nelectronics, fiber optic cable, as well as on scientific and measuring \nequipment. We have some of the oldest industrial measuring companies in \nthe world, such as Browne and Sharpe; they, too, will benefit. And \nthere are several more products where we can see advantages that will \naccrue directly to my home State of Rhode Island.\n  Also, there is just a general benefit to the businesses and workers \nof America. It is very much manifested in small- and medium-size \nbusinesses because they are doing more and more trade with China. It \nhas doubled in the last 5 years from about 3,100 small- and medium-size \nbusinesses trading with China to about 7,600 trading today. That should \nincrease even more. Part of this arrangement in the President's \nproposal in terms of making PNTR work is making the Department of \nCommerce more active in promulgating trade with China--going out and \neducating small- and medium-size businesses about the advantages of \ntrade with China, and show them through web sites and informational \nbrochures how to get into the Chinese market. Once again, I believe--\nand maybe this is the essence of our mutual faith in this country--that \nonce our business-\npeople and our workers have the idea and the knowledge to go out and do \nsomething, they are going to do it and do it very well.\n  As I mentioned previously, we have already built in some protections \nagainst inevitable, or at least possible, surges of Chinese imports \ninto our country. We have special provisions that will last 12 years, \nwhich deal with market disruptions and will not be limited to any one \nproduct but to all the products the Chinese may export to this country. \nWe also will still have access to sections 301 and 201, and anti-\ndumping mechanisms that are American laws, but the Chinese have agreed \nto allow them to be used in this transition and in this implementation \nof PNTR and WTO.\n  Congressman Levin of Michigan, as part of the bill we are considering \ntoday, has also created an executive-legislative commission that will \noversee not only the trade impact but also the human rights issues that \nhave been raised time and time again on this floor. This commission \nwill be another vantage point from which we can assess and evaluate our \nrelationship with China and their fidelity to the agreements they have \nsigned.\n  The long and the short of it is that this is an agreement in its \ndetails which gives advantages to the United States which will help us \nand which I believe should be supported.\n  We are at a point where this measure I believe will pass. We are at a \npoint at which we are embarking on a continuation of our relationship \nwith China, but again a relationship that is still troubling to many.\n  PNTR will not cure all the defects we see in China, nor eliminate all \nthe defects they see in the United States. But it will continue to give \nus a framework to be engaged. It will continue to give us the \nopportunity and the time to work at some of these very fundamental \nproblems. It will challenge the Chinese in many respects to do as much \nas we will be challenged --some would argue, even more.\n  We, fortunately, have a system of government that is not dominated by \na bureaucratic--and one would say anachronistic--single party. We have \na citizenry that is educated. We have social networks. We have Social \nSecurity. We have Medicare.\n  China--which is one of the ironies of that great socialist bastion--\nhas no system of national health care, has no system of pensions, has \nno system of Social Security. It is all tied into the terribly \ninefficient state-owned enterprises. And if they try to change these \nstate-owned enterprises, they are going to have to create, in effect, a \nsocial welfare system, which we already have in place.\n  But I also don't want to minimize the fact that in the lives of many \nAmerican families, this legislation could force change. But the \nopportunity to continue this engagement, the opportunity to insist that \nthe Chinese not only participate in a world order but be responsible \nfor values of that order, is an opportunity I don't think we can pass \nup at this time.\n  I will support this measure. I also look forward to the opportunity \nto come back here again when, in implementation, we see that they fall \nshort; when, in implementation, they see us as falling short; but just \nthe opportunity, and I think to be able to have a forum to carefully \ndiscuss these issues. It is better than turning away from China. It is \nbetter than inducing hostilities.
