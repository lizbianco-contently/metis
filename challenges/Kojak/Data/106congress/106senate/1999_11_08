Mr. President, let me first thank my friend from New \nHampshire for coming down. We have morning business now for 2 hours, \nand we intend to talk about some of the issues before us during this \nfirst hour. I am going to at some point--and I hope the Senator will \nalso--talk a little bit about some of the things we have accomplished \nthis year. I understand the media is always interested in the conflicts \nand where we have controversy. And that is fine. But they do not always \ntalk about the things we have accomplished, the things we have done \nwith the budget, the fact we have spent less in growth this year than \nwe have for a number of years, the fact that we are setting aside \nSocial Security and have proposals out there to strengthen Social \nSecurity. We have done a lot for education; indeed, authorized more \nmoney to be spent than the administration asked for and allowed for it \nto be spent on the local level. These are things that are terribly \nimportant.\n  Defense is probably the singular most important thing the Federal \nGovernment has to assume. The expenditures of defense have gone down \never since the gulf war. This year we have raised them because in order \nto fill out the mission the military has, there must be more resources \nto be able to encourage people to come into the military and to stay \nthere.\n  We have talked about tax relief, and, indeed, sent to the President a \nbill which would have given tax relief to all citizens of this country \nin various ways rather than spending it. Unfortunately, it was vetoed. \nWe will be back with tax relief. When we have an excess amount of \nmoney, that is where it ought to go, back to the people who have paid \nit.\n  In health care, we have done some things and intend to do more before \nthe week is over; and bankruptcy.\n  I wish to say I hope before we finish we can put some emphasis on the \npositive things that we have done for the good of this country.\n  I yield to my good friend from New Hampshire, who has done a superb \njob on the appropriations bills, and continues to do so, whatever time \nhe may consume.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his courtesy in \nyielding me some time. I especially thank him for his commitment to \nmaking the American people aware through floor statements of how much \nwe have accomplished and how many positive things have occurred in this \nCongress.\n  As he mentioned, the most positive is that we have a balanced budget \nfor the first time in generations; that for the first time in years, 20 \nyears or so, the Social Security trust fund money is going to be used \nfor Social Security, which is one of the most important things we could \ndo and thus preserve it for the benefit of senior citizens and the next \ngeneration of senior citizens. Something that is really an incredibly \npositive stride in the way we have dealt with ourselves in this Nation \nand has led in large part to the economic prosperity that we now \nexperience is the fact that the Government has finally decided to live \nwithin its means. That is a result, in my opinion, of a Congress which \nhas aggressively disciplined spending of the Federal Government.\n  In fact, I recall when this Congress was first elected, a Republican \nCongress, the President had sent up his budget for the year, and it \nprojected $200 billion deficits for as far as the eye could see. I \nthink the year was 1996, and for the next 10 years it was $200 billion \nof deficits every year for as far as we could see.\n  Well, we in the Republican Congress, the first Republican Congress in \n40 years, said that was not acceptable; we were going to have to live \nwithin our means. Others said it was not doable. We proved it was \ndoable.\n  That is a positive event. We now have multiple billions of dollars of \nsurplus, a big enough surplus so we will have no impact on Social \nSecurity in this budgeting cycle.\n  What I wanted to speak about, however, beyond the good news, is the \nissue that has caused us to sort of grind through the process of \nwrapping up the appropriations bills, specifically the demand by the \nPresident in a number of areas of appropriations accounts. The first \none I wish to talk about is the demand by the President that we expand \nhis classroom teacher proposal.\n  Now, the Congress has fully funded to the tune of $1.2 billion. The \namount of money that the President initially requested for class size \nin his original request was for $1.2 billion, the purpose of which was \nto add teachers to the classroom. Teachers to the classroom may be a \ngood idea in the $1.2 billion that has been put on the table to \naccomplish that, but the difference between the two sides is not in the \ndollars; it is in the way those dollars should be spent.\n  The President's proposal and the proposal coming from the other side \nof the aisle is that $1.2 billion shall be spent as the people in \nWashington tell the local people to spend it; it will be spent under a \ncommand-and-control process where the administration, the people of the \nDepartment of Education, the people of the national labor unions, and \nthe legislators on the other side of the aisle tell the local school \ndistricts, tell the States, tell the local principals, tell the local \nschool boards: You must use this money for the purposes of hiring \nteachers. You must use it for the purposes of hiring teachers. It is a \ncommand-and-control, top-down directive\n\n[[Page S14233]]\n\nfrom Washington telling local school districts how to operate their \nschools. We, on the other hand, on our side of the aisle, have proposed \nthis $1.2 billion be used for schoolteachers, if that is what the local \nschool district wants. But we have also said--and I will read the \nlanguage to you--``If the local educational agency determines that it \nwishes to use the funds for purposes other than class size reduction as \npart of a local strategy for improving academic achievement, funds may \nbe used for promotional development activities, teacher training, and \nany other local need that is designated to improve student \nperformance.''\n\n  What we are saying on our side of the aisle is that we do not think \nthat a one-shoe-fits-all approach; we don't think that a command-and-\ncontrol, top-down approach is the right way to manage local education \nor to manage any education for that matter.\n  What we believe very strongly is that we should put the dollars on \nthe table. We should make those dollars available to the local schools. \nAnd we should say to the local schools: If you need more teachers, here \nare the dollars to hire those teachers. But if you have determined, \nunder a procedure for obtaining higher academic achievement, you don't \nneed more teachers but what you need are better teachers, and therefore \nyou want to train your teachers, or what you need is to keep a teacher \nwho is about to leave, and therefore you need to pay that teacher a \nlittle bit more money, or what you need is a class that has some sort \nof teacher's aide capability in it, such an individual, but also \ncomputer technologies, you should be able to do that.\n  So we are saying in the context of improving the education, most \nimportantly ``improving the students' performance,'' which is the exact \nwords we use, you can use this money for other areas of teacher \nenhancement and of assisting teachers to be better teachers.\n  Why are we saying that? Why aren't we saying what the White House and \nPresident Clinton say and what the Senators on the other side of the \naisle say, which is you must do it our way; you must hire teachers, and \nthat is what will make for better education? Why aren't we doing that? \nBecause that doesn't work. That doesn't work.\n  Study after study has concluded that it is not necessarily the class \nsize ratio that is critical to education. It happens to be more than \nthat. I think anybody who has ever been involved in any level of \neducation knows this. It is intuitively obvious through inspection--\nwhich was what one of my professors used to say in college, and we used \nto make fun of him for saying that--that there is a lot more to a \nclassroom than the ratio of teacher to students.\n  If you have a terrible teacher--I have said this on the floor \nbefore--who can't teach you a subject matter, if you put 10 kids with \nthat teacher, or 20 kids with that teacher, they are still not going to \nlearn. If you have an excellent teacher who knows how to handle the \nsubject matter, the odds are that the size of the class, if it varies \nwithin five or so children, is not going to affect the quality of that \neducation a whole lot. In fact, this is what studies have shown.\n  In fact, Eric Hanushek at the University of Rochester, an economist, \nstudied 300 other studies that have been done on this issue and \nconcluded as follows: Looking at 300 different studies, class size \nreduction has not worked. Furthermore, the quality of the teacher is \nthe most important factor in education, and it is much more important \nto the class than class size.\n\n  A National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found the \nfollowing: The thing that has the least impact on increasing student \nachievement, the least impact, is class size. The thing that has the \ngreatest impact is teacher education and the capability of the teacher.\n  In the State of Washington, which happens to be the home of the \nsponsor of this original proposal of the top-down control approach, \nSenator Murray's State, a Joint Legislative Audit and Review Committee \nfound: ``High quality teachers and family environment have a far \ngreater effect on student performance than marginally reducing the \nclass size.''\n  It is not our job in Washington to tell the local school districts \nthat they must hire a teacher so that they can get their class size to \nsome arbitrary number. The President has picked 18 to 1. I note that by \npicking that number he has managed to qualify 42 of the States already \nbecause 42 States already have a class size ratio that is 18 to 1 or \nbetter.\n  There are only nine States and the District of Columbia that do not \nhave the ratio higher than 18 to 1. Arbitrarily, people on that side of \nthe aisle are all knowledgeable and are saying to every school board in \nAmerica, 18 to 1, and that is it. If you don't have 18 to 1, we are not \ngoing to give you the money. You have to hire new teachers, and that is \nit. That is what it is going to be.\n  We are saying: Here is the money, American school system. You take \nthat money and you choose whether you need it for a new teacher or \nwhether you need it to make that teacher you already have a better \nteacher, and you tie it to standards. You tie it to professional \ndevelopment standards and you tie it to student performance standards.\n  That is a much better way to do it than to try to manage every \nclassroom in America from right here in Washington.\n  As I said earlier, it is as if those on the other side of the aisle \nwant to take the leader's desk and run a string out to every classroom \nin America, and that string tells that school what they are going to \nhave to do. If they don't like what it is going to do, they are going \nto pull that string in running from that desk on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle.\n  I do not know how many classrooms there are in America. It would \nprobably have to be what? I will take a guess. A million--a million \nstrings running off that desk all over America, intertwined. It is \ngoing to get awfully messy and confusing--a big jumbled mess--and \nnothing is going to happen. We are not going to improve education at \nall.\n  I think it is a much brighter idea, it is a much more appropriate \nidea, and it is a much fairer idea to say to the school systems that \nhappen to know what they are doing because they are involved in it--at \nleast every school district in America that I have ever dealt with is \nvery concerned, first, about education: Here are the dollars. You use \nit to improve your teachers. You use it to improve your classrooms. You \nuse it, most importantly, to improve student performance.\n  This is what this debate on the budget has come down to. There really \naren't too many other big issues out there today. This is what the \nwhole budget debate has come down to--whether or not we are going to \nrun the classrooms from Washington, whether or not we are going to \ndemand that classrooms across America do exactly what we tell them to \ndo by hiring a new teacher in order to get these funds, or whether we \nare going to allow the schools across America--the teachers, the \nprincipals, the parents, and the school boards--to decide how best to \nuse that money in order to improve teaching in the classroom.\n\n  The President has made his stand on this ground. To say the least, I \nthink it is bad ground, a bad idea, and a bad stance.\n  Ironically, at the same time the teacher and class size issue became \na cause celebre for holding up the budget process, the other item \nholding up the budget process involves the President's demand for \n30,000 to 50,000 additional police officers. This is a little bit \ndifferent. This was before the committee that I chair, the Commerce, \nState, Justice Committee.\n  The President put forward a program about 3 years ago. He said we \nwant 100,000 new officers. The Congress agreed with him: Let's try to \nput 100,000 new officers on the street in America. The Congress funded \n100,000 new officers. We put on the table and in the budget the money \nnecessary to pay for 100,000 new officers. The program has run out. The \nauthorization has ended.\n  The President came forward and said, I want another 30,000 to 50,000 \nofficers on top of the initial 100,000 officers.\n  First off, there was no program. The Congress didn't agree to that. \nWe agreed to 100,000. We didn't agree to another 30,000 to 50,000. It \nwas a political statement. He held a poll and had some focus group \nrushing into his office in the morning saying, ``Mr. President,\n\n[[Page S14234]]\n\nMr. President, putting police officers on the street really pumps well. \nLet's do another 30,000 to 50,000.'' That is how they came to the \nconclusion. They did not have any hearings or even look at the program \nthey have in place because if they had looked at the program they had \nin place, they would have realized that of the 100,000 officers we put \nthe money on the table for--the Congress did our work to pay for them--\nthe administration has only been able to hire 60,000. They are still \n40,000 short of the initial 100,000. But they want to go out and hire \nanother 30,000. They can't do it physically because they haven't been \nable to hire these offerers. It takes 12 months to do the program. They \nare not going to get the 100,000 in next year. So they can't possibly \ndo another 30,000 to 50,000.\n  Equally ironic, where did they find the money in their budget to fund \nthe additional 30,000 to 50,000 officers? Remember, these are local \npolice officers in towns that you and I live in across America. These \naren't Federal police officers; these aren't FBI agents or even police \nofficers in this Capitol. These are local police officers. Where did \nthey find the money? They took the money out of the funds we were going \nto use to fund 1,000 extra Border Patrol agents.\n  What is the responsibility of the Federal Government? What is our \nresponsibility? It is to protect our borders. Those are Federal agents. \nThose aren't local agents. Instead of funding the 3,000 new agents who \nwere supposed to be funded and on whom we agreed, for whom we had \nauthorized and appropriated, we were going to appropriate the last \n1,000 this year. The administration said: No, we are not going to hire \nthe extra 1,000 Border Patrol agents; we will take the money from that \nprogram and put it into hiring an additional 30,000 to 50,000 local \npolice officers for a program that cannot even fulfill its first \ntranche of police officers, which was supposed to be 100,000.\n  That is an interesting priority. Think about it. What this \nadministration is saying is, we don't care about the borders as much as \nwe care about putting out a political statement which happens to poll \nwell, which we know has no substantive effect because we know we can't \nhire the officers. Maybe they didn't know it; they should have. All \nthey had to do was ask the people at the Justice Department. Assume \nthey knew it--putting out a political statement on which we know they \ncannot fulfill the specifics. They knew, going into this proposal, they \ncould not hire an additional 30,000 to 50,000 officers because they had \nnot even hired the first 100,000 officers. They were 40,000 short, and \nit takes 12 months to put the officers on the books and bring them on \nboard.\n  This instead of hiring the Border Patrol personnel to improve our \nsouthern borders from being the sieve they are where tens of thousands \nof illegal aliens come across on a weekly basis. I think it was in the \nDouglas area of Arizona they arrested nearly 40,000 people in a week. \nUnbelievable numbers of illegal aliens are coming across the border, \nplacing huge demands on our society in the area of health care, in the \narea of law enforcement, in the area of schooling. These are huge cost \ndemands on our society, policing those borders so legal immigrants can \ncome across, legal workers can come across. Instead, illegal people are \nbreaking the law to get into this country.\n  Instead of doing that which happens to be a primary function of the \nFederal Government, they took the money and used it to set up this \nspecious statement that they were going to add another 30,000 to 50,000 \npolice officers. Now they insist on it. The irony is, they insist on it \nas part of the budget process wrap-up. They are insisting on adding the \nextra police officers when they cannot even hire them. Why? PR. It is \nthat simple. It polls well.\n  The class size statement polls well. On the polling statement, the \nsubstance is so fundamentally flawed. They are taking control of local \nschool districts and saying local school districts don't know whether \nthey need a new teacher; we will tell them they need a new \nschoolteacher. Although they may know they don't need a new teacher, \nthey need to train the teachers better. That philosophy is \nfundamentally flawed.\n  The statement to reduce class size is great polling. We will \nadminister cops on the street. Great polling. They are holding up the \nentire budget of the Government of the United States, which happens to \ninclude a lot of other important things.\n  For example, in my bill, which involves the police officers, we have \nthe funding for the FBI, the funding for the DEA, funding for the INS, \nfunding for the FTC, which is very involved in trying to keep seniors \nfrom being fraudulently attacked on the Internet with scams. We have \nthe funding for the FEC, obviously very involved in the different \nissues of how we manage this e-commerce marketplace in which we are \nfunctioning today. We have the funding for the State Department; We \nhave funding for the whole Justice Department, funding for the whole \njudicial system. All of that is being held up because this \nadministration wants to put out a political statement--not a \nsubstantive statement, because they can't do it, as I just pointed out. \nThey cannot accomplish what they claim they will do. They know it. They \nwant a political statement. Then they want to put forward a horrendous \npolicy on class size because it polls well. They are holding up the \nbudget to do that. It is another example of the superficiality of the \nway this administration approaches issues.\n\n  Time and time again for 7 years, we have seen issues put forward not \nfor the purposes of resolving a plan but for the purposes of scoring a \npolitical point by this White House. Now they are willing to put at \nrisk the functioning of the entire law enforcement structure of the \nFederal Government for all intents and purposes over what is basically \na political issue, a political statement. It has no substance at all. \nIt has no purpose and can accomplish nothing because it can't be \naccomplished in this next year. Maybe 2 years from now, when they catch \nup to doing the full 40,000 officers they still have to do, they can \ncome forward and reasonably say we need another 30,000 officers. That \nmay be true.\n  Once again, we see the shallowness of this administration is only \nexceeded by their brazenness. Unfortunately, a number of Federal \nagencies and the American people will suffer as a result of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I have to imagine how different the needs of the school district in \nWyoming are compared to Philadelphia. I certainly subscribe to the idea \nwe ought to help with the resources, but let the local school districts \ndecide for themselves what it is they need. The basic class size in \nWyoming happens to be less than 18.\n  I am very pleased to have on the floor of the Senate the Senator from \nIdaho, another western Senator, who is also chairman of our policy \ncommittee.\n  I yield as much time as he desires.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nallowing me time this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14234-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14234-S14236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               MICROSOFT\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have listened to the Senator from New \nHampshire speak in what I call the common sense of New Hampshire. I \nthink all Members have been frustrated by this administration running a \nflag up the pole every morning at the White House to see which way the \nwind is blowing and then not only attempting to shift Government policy \nbut oftentimes bringing Government to an entire halt until they can \ndetermine if the direction in which they are heading is the right \ndirection.\n  Another example of a misdirected effort by this administration was \nannounced on Friday. I think all Members were paying attention to some \ndegree and were anxious to hear how a Federal judge could decide to run \nthe technological world in which we are living better than the \nmarketplace itself. Sure enough, on Friday, Thomas Penfield Jackson, \nthe judge down at the Justice Department who examined the ins and outs \nof Microsoft and the marketplace, has determined that Microsoft is a \npredatory monopoly.\n  I am no expert in this field, and I am not going to hold myself out \non the floor this morning to be so. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record two editorials.\n\n[[Page S14235]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     U.S. Department of Microsoft?\n\n       At its highest levels, the educational system is still \n     capable of giving its money's worth, and taxpayers certainly \n     spent enough to educate Thomas Penfield Jackson on \n     Microsoft's struggle to manage what it pleased the judge \n     Friday to call the company's ``monopoly'' in computer \n     operating systems. We guess now the government is going to \n     have to run Microsoft.\n       We also see the failure of Microsoft's strategy, which was \n     to deny the meaning of its own actions, lest those actions \n     retroactively be found illegal because the court pins the \n     label ``monopoly'' on it. That was unfortunate. Microsoft had \n     a strong case to make that it had behaved in the only way any \n     rational competitor could have.\n       Microsoft should have argued that we have a monopoly \n     because our customers want us to have one. There is a great \n     deal more software in the world than there would otherwise \n     be, because software designers can invest in creating \n     products knowing there is an installed base of compatible \n     operating systems that won't soon be displaced. And consumers \n     know that they can lay out a thousand bucks or more for a PC \n     without taking a Betamax-vs.-VHS gamble that their investment \n     will be rendered obsolete.\n       What benefits our consumers is a barrier to our \n     competitors, but as Judge Jackson points out, our real \n     competitor is not ``another product within the same software \n     category, but rather a technological advance that renders the \n     boundaries defining the category obsolete.'' What the judge \n     calls our attempts to maintain our ``applications barrier is \n     entry'' is simply our way of making sure our investment in \n     Windows--and our customers' investment--remains viable in the \n     face of these technological advances. Take our behavior \n     toward Netscape. Browsing the web has become the central \n     purpose of the PC for millions of users. If we had not \n     aggressively promoted our browser, it would have been \n     tantamount to helping Netscape cannibalize our business, \n     using our own platform to render us obsolete while we stood \n     by watching.\n       If Microsoft cannot act rationally in its own interest, the \n     alternative is a government administrator to take over the \n     business and run it for the benefit of Microsoft's \n     competitors. Outside a Nader thought-bubble, there can't be \n     many people who don't see this cure as worse than the \n     disease. Northwest University Law Professor Larry Downes, \n     writing in USA Today, notes a ``precedent for a remedy of \n     doing nothing; that is, for finding Microsoft guilty but \n     recognizing that there was no court-administered \n     solution that could solve the problem any better than \n     letting the market try to work it out on its own.''\n       What makes this less than academic is that, even without \n     the government turning Microsoft into a public utility, the \n     paradigm shift is happening and everybody in the business \n     knows it. A host of new developments has already shrunk \n     Microsoft's control over cyberspace, and events are on the \n     way to delivering new forms of web computing that won't even \n     require Windows.\n       Judge Jackson has deferred the question of whether \n     Microsoft violated the law for a later ruling, but he hasn't \n     left much to the imagination. If he takes his arguments and \n     the incoherent assumptions of antitrust seriously, the only \n     remedy is to turn Windows into a regulated utility, possibly \n     breaking the company up.\n       No wonder he has repeatedly hinted he would be relieved if \n     the parties would settle. An appeals court would likely \n     overturn any draconian verdict against Microsoft--if a post-\n     Clinton Justice Department hadn't already settled the case. \n     Microsoft has mounted such a lame effort partly because it's \n     relying on the federal circuit court of appeals. On Friday, \n     in a significant ruling related to a private antitrust \n     lawsuit against Intel, that court noted the ``Sherman act \n     does not convert all harsh commercial actions into antitrust \n     violations.''\n       By the time Microsoft reaches the appellate level, the \n     computing world will have moved on and historians will have \n     to be summoned to remind us what the argument was all about. \n     Judge Jackson will have sat through the antitrust ``case of \n     the century'' only to see it waddle off and expire with a \n     whimper behind some shrub. He can't have that, so he's \n     banging the pots and pans and trying to scare Bill Gates into \n     settling. How much more splendid to be this generation's \n     Judge Greene, tinkering with future releases of Windows the \n     way Judge Green spent 10 years tinkering with AT and the \n     baby bells.\n       But let's get to the real bottom line. Washington's crusade \n     against Microsoft has fulfilled its purpose, serving as a \n     great lever to pry open the wallets of Silicon Valley. Where \n     three years ago the technology plutocrats spent their surplus \n     income on racing yachts and Ferraris and charity, now they \n     patriotically send donations to Washington to support the \n     fixer class and its retinue in the style to which it would \n     like to become accustomed. Steve Case of AOL likes to say the \n     future of technology will be decided in the political arena \n     rather than the marketplace. Be careful what you wish for.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                          Punsihing Microsoft\n\n                          (By Robert A. Levy)\n\n       Here's the lesson that high-tech companies can glean from \n     Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings in the Microsoft \n     case: If you're sufficiently ambitious, competent, and hard-\n     working; if you're willing to risk your time and fortune; if \n     you succeed at rising above your competition by serving \n     customers with better products; then watch out, because our \n     government will come down on your neck with the force and \n     effect of a guillotine. Judge Jackson's knee-jerk recitation \n     of the Justice Department's line is a mockery of objectivity, \n     scornful of the facts, and congenial only to those who prefer \n     a sterile marketplace in which vigorous competition becomes \n     legally actionable.\n       Let's start with the judge's big picture: an industry \n     crippled because Microsoft's competitors are unable to \n     innovate. Yet how to explain Netscape's 410 billion price \n     tag, or continued market leadership by Microsoft arch-rivals \n     Oracle, Intuit, AOL, Sun Microsystems, and Real-Networks? How \n     to explain Apple's growth in both sales and profits? Indeed, \n     if Microsoft's ``prodigious market power'' and ``immense \n     profits'' have been used to stifle innovation, then how to \n     explain the incredible success of Linux, which now runs more \n     Web sites than any other server operating system?\n       In an unguarded moment, Sun's CEO, Scott McNealy, recently \n     crowed that ``Windows is dead'' when it comes to new software \n     applications, Mr. McNealy may be right. Despite Judge \n     Jackson's snapshot view of the software market, the Internet \n     has profoundly and permanently altered the dynamics. Will \n     Microsoft lose out to consumer electronics products? Mr. \n     McNealy doesn't know, and neither does Judge Jackson. But \n     those products are out there, they're selling well, and they \n     are competition.\n       What about Web-based software--probably the most formidable \n     threat to Microsoft's dominance? Instead of buying and \n     selling applications like word processors and speadsheets, \n     users can rent the same functions from Internet services--or \n     get them free if they sit through advertising.\n       The only essential user program is a Web browser. As the \n     Wall Street Journal put it: ``If users don't need PCs with \n     Microsoft's Windows operating system or Intel chips--the \n     vaunted market power of the duo called Wintel doesn't seem so \n     unshakable.''\n       The important points is this: Many desktop machines that \n     access Web-based servers are ``Windows-less'' products, and \n     Microsoft's major OEM customers are climbing on the band \n     wagon. Gateway is building a line with no Microsoft software \n     at all, and may jointly market it with AOL, which is a major \n     Gateway investor. Dell also plans to bring out a line of \n     Internet computers, some without Microsoft software. \n     Compaq's chief executive observes that its new generation \n     of products will ``redefine Internet access.''\n       Another industry executive stated that ``the Internet gives \n     people a platform to do most of the things they need to do on \n     a PC without a cumbersome and expensive operating system.''\n       Judge Jackson, infinitely wiser about such matters now that \n     he knows how to use his computer, has an astonishing two fold \n     response to the emergence of Web-based servers. First, he \n     contends that ``Windows has retarded, and perhaps altogether \n     extinguished'' the server threat. That contention has a \n     surreal quality: Judge Jackson describes an event that never \n     actually happened but, if it had happened, it would have \n     crippled competition. The same dialetic creeps into his \n     anecdotal chronicle of Microsoft's persecution of Intel, \n     Apple, and Compaq, as well as Microsoft's supposed market-\n     splitting with Netscape. ``OK, so this thing Microsoft tried \n     to do never did materialize. The other guy never agreed to it \n     and ultimately he did what he wanted. But what a hobbling \n     impact on innovation if things had gone otherwise.'' Judge \n     Jackson's second justification for discounting Web-based \n     servers is even stranger. He claims that viable competition \n     from server-based applications ``is not imminent for at least \n     the next few years.'' His projection is surely too \n     conservative.\n       Venture capitalists report that they haven't seen a \n     business plan for conventional packaged software in more than \n     six months. Mr. McNealy predicts that fewer than 50 percent \n     of the devices accessing the Internet will be Windows-\n     equipped PCs by the year 2002, just a little over two years \n     from now. Mr. McNealy has put Sun Micro systems' money where \n     his mouth is--acquiring Star Division so he can convert its \n     Star Office product into a free, Internet-based service that \n     can be run directly by any user with any Web browser.\n       But more important, Judge Jackson's ``not imminent for a \n     few years'' forecast has to be placed in context. He plans on \n     issuing his conclusions of law in this case early next year. \n     Then a hearing on remedies in the spring, with a possible \n     summer decision. Then we can expect a year or so before the \n     United States Court of Appeals finishes its review. Then \n     another year for the Supreme Court's deliberations. Finally, \n     even if Microsoft loses at each stage and remedies are \n     imposed, they will not be effective overnight. In other \n     words, the market will certainly have obviated any remedies \n     before they can have an impact.\n       Meanwhile, Microsoft behaves not like a monopolist but like \n     a company whose every survival is at stake. Its prices are \n     down and its technology is struggling to keep pace with an \n     explosion of fresh software products. Facing competition from \n     new operating systems, consumer electronics, and Web-based\n\n[[Page S14236]]\n\n     servers, Microsoft now operates in a world where anyone \n     running a browser will soon have the same capabilities as \n     today's Window users. That is why the government should keep \n     it's hands off.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, one editorial is by Robert Levy, a senior \nfellow of constitutional studies at the CATO Institute. He starts his \nop-ed piece:\n\n       Here's the lesson that high-tech companies can glean from \n     Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings in the Microsoft \n     case: If you're sufficiently ambitious, competent, and hard-\n     working; if you're willing to risk your time and fortune; if \n     you succeed at rising above your competition by serving \n     customers with better products; then watch out, because our \n     government will come down on your neck with the force and \n     effect of a guillotine.\n\n  The editorial in the Wall Street Journal probably sums it up best of \nall. There is no question my colleagues from the other side of the \naisle--or should I say their political machinery as expressed by--I \ndon't want to call them outbursts, but certainly the expressions of our \nAttorney General, Janet Reno, are best summed up when they discussed \nthe Microsoft case this morning in the Wall Street Journal. Here is \ntheir concluding paragraph:\n\n       But let's get to the real bottom line. Washington's crusade \n     against Microsoft has fulfilled its purpose, serving as a \n     great lever to pry open the wallets of the Silicon Valley. \n     Where three years ago the technological plutocrats spent \n     their surplus income on racing yachts and Ferraris and \n     charity, now they patriotically send donations to Washington \n     to support the fixer class and its retinue in the style to \n     which it would like to become accustomed.\n  Steve Case of AOL, who happens to be on the other side of this issue, \nrecognizes the problem, though. He says the future of technology will \nbe decided in the political arena rather than the marketplace. My guess \nis, if that is true, your computers will not be working as well \ntomorrow as they are working today.\n  I came to the floor this morning to join with my colleague from \nWyoming, not to discuss the Microsoft case; that is going to get played \nout over time, and I think we are going to have a Federal judge who \nwill try to run the technology business of this country. Maybe we need \nto decide to start a new agency of our Federal Government called U.S. \nDepartment of Microsoft. If it is as profitable as Microsoft, maybe we \ncan make a lot more money without taxing the American public to allow \nour Democrat colleagues on the other side of the aisle to spend it.\n  Certainly Microsoft is now making as much as $1 billion a month in \ncash to spend. It is obvious somebody else wants their hands on that or \nwants to break up that very profitable business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14236-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14236-S14237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VIOLENCE IN AMERICA\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, what I came to the floor to talk about is a \ncombination of issues that come together in the issue of violence. We \nwatched the great tragedy as a fellow entered a workplace in Hawaii the \nweek before last and killed some of his coworkers. Last week in \nSeattle, another man went into a business and shot and killed \nindividuals. All of us, as Americans, are tremendously frustrated by \nthis expression of violence or people seeming to want to solve their \npersonal problems by acting in a very violent fashion. The Washington \nPost poll on Sunday showed that the No. 2 issue among Republicans was \nviolence in the schools; the No. 4 issue among Democrats, violence in \nthe schools; the No. 2 issue among Independents in America was \nviolence, violence in the schools.\n  Our President last week suggested we live in a very violent society, \nwhen in fact violence is down substantially in our country. It is true \nthat it is. We have come off a very violent year, but over the last 7 \nyears the average rate of acts of violence is dropping, in the broad \nsense. Yet we have had some of these tremendously public-attention-\ngathering events that caused the American public to be concerned, as \nthey are.\n  Of course, the issue I want to speak briefly about this morning is \nthe question of how we fix this violent expression in our society. Last \nweek, the President, Janet Reno, and Al Gore said there is a quick and \neasy way to fix it: We just need to pass a few more laws; gun laws, \nthat is. We need to add to the 25,000 to 30,000 gun laws that are \nalready on the books. If we do that, we will make America a safer place \nin which to live. Or at least we will say, politically, to meet the \npolls the Washington Post presented to us on Sunday, that if we pass \nthe laws, the public at least will think America is a safer place in \nwhich to live. By that, we will be able to curry their political favor \nin the next election.\n\n  If gun laws make America a safer place, then what happened in Hawaii \nshould not have happened; what happened in Seattle should not have \nhappened; what happened in Littleton, CO, at Columbine High School, \nshould not have happened--because there are laws to stop that. Mr. \nPresident, 13 laws were violated, tragically, by those two young men \nwho later took their lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, \nafter they had killed so many of their classmates. But there was a law \nto stop them. Then why did it happen?\n  I do not know the answer to why it happened. I do know they broke a \nlot of laws to cause it to happen. Yet our President last week, and the \nVice President, and the Attorney General said give us more laws and the \nworld will be a safer place. We have all been on this floor discussing, \nfor well over a year, our frustrations with problems with our culture, \nproblems with our public schools. People are acting out their \nfrustrations in violent ways by taking other people's lives. My guess \nis, you cannot legislate a fix on that one.\n  There are other problems within our society that have to be \naddressed. So let me focus for just a moment on Hawaii. There, we all \nknow what happened. The fellow has been caught. We all know now he \nprobably, during that act, was mentally incompetent, mentally in \ntrouble, mentally deranged. But his actions cost lives.\n  His actions happened in a unique environment, though. Hawaii has more \ngun laws, to control gun ownership and gun usage, than any other State \nin the United States. So would logic not follow, at least the logic of \nthe President and the Vice President and the Attorney General, if that \nwere so, Hawaii should have been a terribly safe place? Hawaii is the \nonly State in the Nation where you not only register every gun you have \nwith the local and State authorities, you also register the bullets--\nyou register the ammunition. Somehow, politicians in the State \nlegislature in Hawaii thought that would make Hawaii a safe place--the \nonly State in the Nation.\n  It just so happens, Janet Reno and Al Gore and the President want us \nto do the same in this country. But it did not stop the individual who \nkilled his colleagues in Hawaii.\n  How about a permit to purchase? Of course, that is exactly what some \nof our colleagues would want here. Hawaii requires a permit to purchase \nany kind of gun--not just one permit for multiple purchases but a \npermit for every purchase--and a full background check, and the \nrequirement that you must be at least 21 years of age to own a gun.\n  What about assault pistols and Saturday night specials and all those \nkinds of buzzwords about guns that have become villains here on the \nfloor for political purposes? All of those are outlawed in Hawaii. It \nis against the law to own them. It is against the law to have them. All \nof that is the law in Hawaii. The man who did the killings in Hawaii \nhad met all of the requirements of the law. Yet the law did not protect \nthe citizens whose families now mourn their death.\n  How about high-capacity magazines? That was a fully debated issue \nhere on the floor of the Senate this past year. I was on the floor with \nSenator Hatch and Senator Lautenberg on that issue after Littleton. It \nis against the law in Hawaii.\n  Then there are the restrictions on places of possession, where you \nsimply cannot have a gun: A business; you can't travel with one, only \nin the owner's home and in very restricted places; or if you are \ntraveling from the home to the firing range or the pistol range for \ntarget practice, you may have a gun on your person. Those are tough \nlaws in Hawaii. Yet people are dead. Of course, I mentioned \ntransportation and the restriction on transportation. All of those are \nparts of the laws that guard citizens against the violent acts of \nothers with the use of a firearm in the State of Hawaii.\n  The President, the Vice President, and the Attorney General seem not \nto understand that or, if they do, they are\n\n[[Page S14237]]\n\nfinding another reason to express a need for greater gun control in \nthis country. I am not sure what that need is. We all know our citizens \nare concerned about violence.\n  We all know we have citizens in our country who act out their \nfrustrations in violent ways. It is tragic that we believe we can \nsimply turn to Congress that will pass a law and, therefore, the \nviolence will go away.\n  Are the President and the Vice President and the Attorney General \ntrying to hide something? Are they trying to hide the fact that during \nthe Clinton administration arrests and prosecutions of citizens who \nviolate Federal firearms laws has dropped by over 70 percent?\n  Is the President trying to mask the fact that the Puerto Rican \nterrorists to whom he offered clemency were violators of Federal \nfirearms laws and they killed American citizens?\n  Is this President, once again, trying to throw up a political \nsmokescreen by simply saying we need more laws against the use of guns \nor the ownership of guns or the second amendment rights when he, the \nPresident, in my opinion, has violated the intent of the laws as they \nnow stand? If you do not use the law, if you do not prosecute under the \nlaw, if you do not enforce the law, then the laws are no good.\n  That is the message I send to Bill Clinton today: Mr. Clinton, look \nat your own record. Your own Attorney General has let it be known to \nU.S. attorneys around the country that it is not worth their time to go \nafter violators of Federal firearms laws.\n  There is a great program down in Richmond, VA, where a Federal \nprosecutor said to the local police: You arrest them and I will throw \nthem away, I will put them behind bars if they use a gun in the \ncommission of a crime. Crime dropped precipitously but, more important, \ncrimes with a gun involved dropped dramatically. One fellow was \narrested at a 7-Eleven with a stick, and after he was arrested, the \nlocal police said: Why are you robbing a 7-Eleven with a stick?\n  He said: Because if I used a firearm, they will lock me up down here.\n  Mr. President, Bill Clinton, don't you get the message now? We have \nplenty of laws on the books if we had an Attorney General who was a \nreal cop, a supercop, a tough person who was saying to her U.S. \nattorneys: Let's put them behind bars if they use guns; let's throw \nthose kids out of school who take a gun to school. They do not have the \nright to be in our schools if they are putting the rest of our kids in \njeopardy.\n  Last year that happened over 3,000 times and only 13 were prosecuted. \nSorry, Mr. President, sorry, Mr. Vice President, sorry, Ms. Attorney \nGeneral, passing laws does not a safer world make. Enforcing the ones \nwe have, being concerned about the culture, being concerned about the \nkids, their parents, and their educators in a way that not only makes a \nsafe school but makes a concerned citizen is going to drop violence in \nAmerica. Do not give the American public a political placebo by simply \npassing another law.\n  I thank my colleague from Wyoming, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Idaho. Certainly, \nthis is one of the issues that is contentious and will, I suppose, be \ndebated some more. I agree with the notion we need to do something more \nthan passing more laws. It has no evidence of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14237-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14237-S14238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, one of the bills currently being \nconsidered, and is very important to the West particularly, is the \nInterior funding bill, the bill that funds the Interior Department, \nnational parks, the Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife \nService, and others. It is relatively small compared to others. It is \naround $13 billion, $14 billion. I never thought I would suggest that \nis small, but compared to $360 billion it is relatively small.\n  It has been tied up for a number of reasons. It has to do with the \nso-called land legacy the administration has been pushing recently, the \nidea of purchasing a great amount of land that has something to do with \nS. 25 that will bring in dollars from the Outer Continental Shelf \nroyalties to be used in this area.\n  The controversy is over the purchase of additional lands. There are \nsome good things about S. 25--taking some more money from oil royalties \nand using them for parks. I am chairman of the Parks Subcommittee, and \nI met this morning with the new advisory committee that will be \nfocusing on concessions. The parks are more and more in demand, more \nand more people are coming to them, and more and more people are taking \nadvantage of the parks, one of the legacies of this country. We are \nhaving problems with the upkeep of the infrastructure that must be done \nto preserve historic and natural values. I support that.\n  The park system, of course, has to be part of another section of \nparks, and that is local and State parks. National parks are not \ndesigned to provide all the services that people need. In communities, \nthese are local responsibilities. Ball parks, for example, are put in \nby State and local parks. So they, too, need additional funding.\n  One of the interesting areas, particularly those in the West where \nthey do a great deal of wild game hunting, is a thing called teaming \nfor wildlife. In our State, for example, the funds that go to the game \nand fish department come from the purchase of licenses for game \nanimals. They spend a great deal of their time dealing with animals \nthat are not game animals that are threatened, endangered.\n  The problem, however, is the administration insists on having $1 \nbillion a year to spend as they choose to buy land. This week, we had a \nhearing on the Forest Service setting aside 40 million acres by fiat, \nby administrative decree, to be used for de facto wilderness, if they \nchoose, when under the law clearly to set aside land of that kind is \nthe responsibility of the Congress.\n  We are having increasing difficulty with that. I do not know whether \nit is driven by the President's desire to have a legacy, to be a latter \ncentury Theodore Roosevelt, or whether it is the environmental aspect \nof the Gore campaign. The fact is, the White House is not a monarchy; \nit does not decide to do these things individually. There has to be a \ncooperative arrangement with the Congress, whether it is purchasing or \nwhether it is assigning different designations to land. That is the way \nit is, and it needs to be preserved in that fashion, in my judgment.\n  We need to move forward with the Interior bill. It is one of about \nthree bills that remains out of the 13, which is kind of surprising \nbecause it is one upon which most people here agree. There are a couple \nof things in it that are being used which I think are not realistic. \nOne has to do with permits for grazing on Forest Service lands. \nRanchers in the West--they have their base lands, of course--use \ngrazing so we can have multiple use of public lands and forests, have \ngrazing leases. In order to renew those leases, there needs to be a \nstudy. No one argues with the idea there needs to be a study. \nUnfortunately, they have not been able to keep up with the number of \nstudies that need to be made, and so the study is not made before the \npermit expires and the Federal Government says: That's too bad, you're \nout of luck; take your cows and go home--when it has nothing to do with \nthe permittee having not gotten the job done.\n\n  What this amendment to the Interior bill says is the permit will be \nrenewed for a period of time until this study can be made. If the study \nis made and there have to be changes, then there can be changes. That \nis held up somehow by the White House, and they are making a big thing \nand separating that out.\n  The other is on oil royalties. We worked a long time trying to get \nfairness in oil royalties, taking out some of the charges and costs \nbefore the Government takes over, and percentage of royalties. We have \nnot come to an agreement. This simply says, let's set it aside until \nthe Congress and the executive department can come together. Again, not \na willingness to work in a team fashion.\n  I am hopeful we can get by those kinds of things this week. We are \naiming to get out of here in 3 days, in fact. The fact is, it is \npossible.\n  There are really only about three bills that need to be determined. \nEveryone knows what changes need to be\n\n[[Page S14238]]\n\nfocused on, what kind of concessions need to be made on both sides to \nmake this happen. Usually, as we come down to the end, it is amazing \nhow quickly some things can be done as opposed to when they just \nstretch out in the future.\n  So our goals are to have no Government shutdown--certainly that is \nthe Republican position for the rest of this year--we are settled on \nnot having any new taxes to finance this year's new programs--we \ncertainly have an adequate amount of money--and we are committed to \npaying down the publicly held debt and to protecting the Social \nSecurity surplus. These are the kinds of things I think everyone can \nagree upon if we can get to it this time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14238-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14238-S14240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TERRORISM AND ABORTION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Thursday, I was reading the morning \nnewspaper in Washington when I came across an article describing for, \nlack of a better description, the emotional stress of a doctor, Steven \nDixon. Dr. Dixon, after a lifetime of study and sacrifice, indicated he \nwas going to give up the practice of medicine. Why? Because terrorists \nhad broken his 40-year-old spirit. This 40-year-old doctor decided he \nwasn't going to practice medicine anymore. His will to work had been \nbroken.\n\n  Dr. Dixon maintained a medical practice in the downtown DC area. Dr. \nDixon, by training, was certified to be an obstetrician/gynecologist. \nIn his practice, he helped women with a multitude of medical problems--\nbasic checkups, physicals, and problems unique to women. On occasion, \nhe terminated pregnancies. What did these people do to run Dr. Dixon \nout of the practice of medicine? They distributed wanted posters with \nhis name and photograph like those you see in the post office. He \nreceived numerous threatening phone calls to his home and his office. \nVarious threatening mail was sent to his home and office. These are \nsome of the things that happened to Dr. Dixon.\n  In the United States, the highest court in the land, the U.S. Supreme \nCourt, the same court that established the way commerce is conducted \nbetween the 50 States, the same court that decreed education cannot be \nseparate and be equal, the same court that set precedence for the \ncleansing of Government by its overview of Watergate--this same U.S. \nSupreme Court has set forth a standard as to how abortion in the United \nStates is legal. That is the final word, what the Supreme Court says in \nour country. Whether one agrees or disagrees, it is the law of this \nRepublic.\n  But some are unwilling to follow the law of the land. They think they \nknow better. This has led to violence, vandalism, brutal protests at \nlegal clinics established to deal with a multitude of female-related \nhealth problems. In the last 20 years, there has been an average of 40 \nof these acts each week--bombings, arsons, death threats, kidnappings, \nmurders, tires slashed, oil drained from cars, sugar put in gas tanks, \nblood splattered on people's homes and sidewalks and places of \nbusiness. There have been 38,000 acts during less than two decades--\n38,000 acts of terrorism.\n  I am going to talk now about some examples of these terrorist acts. \nFor example, people who work in entities, such as Planned Parenthood \nclinics, face acts of violence, threats, intimidation. In 1998, at just \nsuch clinics, there were multiple murders, bombings, and arsons, a \nscore of butyric acid attacks. That is a chemical compound that burns \nand leaves an awful smell. Anti-choice violence and terrorism is \nworsening. It should be stopped. Dr. Dixon, who I have never met, who \nmany read about last Thursday, which caused me to begin thinking about \nthis issue, stated in a letter:\n\n       It is ironic that I am a target, because my entire career \n     has been about educating and empowering women to help prevent \n     unintended pregnancies. While I have always supported a \n     woman's right to have this legal procedure, I actually \n     performed few abortions for my patients. In fact, I stopped \n     performing them because of the stress associated with this \n     terrorism. Sadly, the ongoing threat to my life and my \n     concern for the safety of my loved ones has exacted a heavy \n     toll on me, making it necessary that I discontinue \n     practicing.\n\n  I don't know Dr. Dixon, never met him, never talked to him. But those \nwho threaten Dr. Dixon are cowards, terrorists, no different than the \npeople who blew up the New York City Trade Center. They are murderers. \nThese killers and would-be killers and terrorists call each other \npatriots. The true patriots of this Nation are those who have given \ntheir all in the fields of battle, places called the Bulge and the \nbeaches of Guadalcanal, Pork Chop Hill in Korea, and in Vietnam. And \nmany people who haven't given their lives have sacrificed a great deal. \nMany serve in this Chamber. Under our system of government, which has \nbeen in existence for more than 200 years, the law of the land can only \nbe changed by peaceful political means, through persuasion, debate, \ndemonstrations that are peaceful in nature, grassroots political \nactivity, the assertion of one's feelings at the ballot box, but never, \nnever, through violence and intimidation. What is now taking place in \nour country by these zealots is despicable.\n\n  Why do I say what I have said? Why do I conclude this? Let me travel \na little bit. Remember, we have 38,000 of these terrorist acts, and I \nam going to talk about a few of these demonstrations of viciousness. A \nmanual has been produced by a group called the Army of God. It is a \nmanual directing there to be no trial, no jury, no appeal, no stay of \nexecution. Their clear declaration is to kill abortion doctors and \npeople associated with abortion clinics--kill whoever they decide \nshould be murdered.\n  Doctor Barnett Slepian. I didn't realize this until after the murder \nhad taken place, but Dr. Slepian's niece worked for me here in \nWashington. She is now a writer of some acclaim. She had an article \npublished in the last issue of George magazine. She is from Reno, NV, \nand is a wonderful young lady. Dr. Barnett Slepian was shot and killed \nby a bullet that came through his kitchen window at the same time the \ndoctor was having dinner with his family in his kitchen. After this \nbrutal murder, this cowardly act, his death was mocked publicly. His \nmurder was commended by some groups. The killer, even though \nidentified, has not been apprehended.\n  In Birmingham, AL, at a health clinic, there was a bomb blast which \nkilled the security guard who was there, a man by the name of Robert \nSanderson. He was a police officer trying to make some money on the \nside. Emily Lyons, a nurse, was severely injured and left nearly blind \nand with medical bills of almost $1 million. Eric Robert Rudolph has \nbeen charged with this attack. He is the man who is being chased \nthrough the hills in the south, someplace in North Carolina. He is one \nof the FBI's Ten Most Wanted. He is yet to be found.\n  In December of 1996, Dr. Calvin Jackson was stabbed many, many times. \nHe lost at least four pints of blood, and one ear was severed. His \nassailant was apprehended a few hours later, after entering another \nclinic carrying a filleting knife.\n  John Salvi--at about the same time this Jackson matter took place--\nwas tried for two murders of clinic receptionists, people who were \nsecretaries--Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols. He attempted to kill \nfive others. He fired bullets into these clinics in Brookline, MA, and \nNorfolk, VA.\n  It is hard for me to say this, but a Reverend, Rev. Paul Hill, a \nwell-known protester and director of the anti-choice group called \nDefensive Action, was convicted in the fall of 1994 for the murders of \nDr. John Britton and a 74-year-old man who happened to be with him \noutside a health clinic in Pensacola, FL.\n  The two victims were shot with a 12-gauge shotgun. Before the \nshootings, Reverend Hill had been previously arrested for his \nactivities where he advocated continual use of force.\n  Dr. David Gunn, a physician, was murdered during a protest at a \nPensacola clinic. Wanted posters featuring Dr. Gunn's photograph, \ntelephone number, and schedule were distributed at an Operation Rescue \nrally in Montgomery, AL, and other places.\n\n[[Page S14239]]\n\n  Dr. George Tiller, who was a target of violence and blockades for \nmany years, was shot in both arms.\n  Finally, in Wichita, KS, a person charged with a shooting who had \nbeen arrested on previous occasions for trespassing and blockading \nclinic entrances praised the man who murdered Dr. Gunn.\n  I was the first person to come here and speak out on the Senate floor \nabout Dr. Gunn's murder, which I thought was sickening.\n  Neal Horsley, a militant and founder of a group called the Creator's \nRights Party, has developed a web site entitled ``The Nuremberg \nFiles.'' The site was designed to ``collect evidence.'' This so-called \n``evidence'' lists clinic staff members, law enforcement officers, \njudges, and politicians for use in future trials ``for their crimes.'' \nRemember that they work in legal clinics. The site seeks and lists \npersonal information such as photos of them and their families, their \nhouses, their cars, their driving records, license plate numbers, names \nand birth dates of individuals, and even the birth dates of their \nfamily.\n  A legend accompanies this list of names under a banner where there is \na simulation of dripping blood. The legend indicates the degree that \nthis so-called Creator's Rights Party wants to place these people. \nThere is a black font for people who just work there. Then it becomes \ngray when somebody has been wounded. Their name isn't completely \nstricken but partially stricken when they have been wounded by one of \nthese terrorists. But if someone is killed, like Dr. Slepian, there is \nan immediate strike through. They are stricken off the list.\n  Last year, about a year ago, at a Planned Parenthood clinic in \nMilwaukee there was an envelope received in the mail. Inside the \nenvelope was a bomb constructed of two batteries with wire wrapped in \nmodeling clay. These bombs didn't work. But the message written on \nwhite paper stated that the next one might be real. The next day, \nMilwaukee's Affiliated Medical Services received a similar mailing.\n  A week after the murder of Dr. Slepian, four clinics in three States \nreceived letters purporting to contain anthrax, which we know is the \nmost deadly strain of bacteria. A few days later, six more anthrax \nthreats were sent to clinics. Although some clinics were closed and \nstaff decontaminated, all of these threats turned out to be hoaxes.\n  Bombs were discovered at two clinics in North Carolina about a year \nago, less than a month after these clinics had been damaged by arson.\n  Between May and July of last year, 19 clinics in Louisiana, Florida, \nand Texas were vandalized with butyric acid, that I have already talked \nabout, which is a noxious industrial chemical which sent people who \nhappened to be in the area to hospitals, including patients and staff \nmembers. They went there with respiratory problems, nausea, and \nsickness. Clinics were closed for days while they tried to get the \nsmell out of their facilities.\n  Shortly after the clinic bombings in Atlanta and Oklahoma, an Oregon \nphysician, Peter Bours, received a letter which demanded $50,000 in \ncash and threatened, ``The bombings in Atlanta and Oklahoma are a \nwarning,'' and indicated that those who do not comply to our demands \nwill be destroyed.\n  The FBI arrested a man by the name of William Kitchens. When they \narrested him, they discovered a book in his kitchen on extortion and \nkidnapping.\n  Within 2 weeks of Dr. Britton's murder in Pensacola, FL, the last \nremaining doctor then providing advice in Mississippi, Dr. Joseph \nBooker became the target of a ``No Place to Hide'' campaign. The \ncampaign's leader, Roy McMillan, signed a petition advocating the \nmurder of Dr. Britton and others.\n\n       According to physician Pablo Rodriguez, ``[i]n the \n     beginning, the harassment consisted of just nasty letters and \n     graphic pictures. Then I began receiving strange packages \n     with dolls inside, as well as subscriptions to gun magazines. \n     . . . Then the ``Wanted'' posters with my picture on them \n     began to appear. . . . Then the doors and locks to our clinic \n     were glued several times, and protesters blockaded the clinic \n     three times. . . . Just after Dr. Gunn's death, . . . I \n     realized that my car was steering poorly. I checked my tires \n     and found 45 nails embedded in them. . . . That evening, my \n     wife painfully discovered with her foot that our driveway had \n     been booby-trapped with roofing nails cleverly buried beneath \n     the snow. . . . My home, my haven of safety--violated.''\n\n  Shortly after Operation Rescue targeted physician Frank Snydle as \npart of its ``No Place to Hide'' campaign, his 80-year-old mother \nreceived a telephone call that was false and misleading and a prank at \n3 a.m. in the morning telling her that her son had been killed in a car \naccident.\n  A Dallas physician by the name of Norman Tompkins and his wife \nreceived hundreds of phone calls and pieces of hate mail. The message, \nfor example, left on Dr. Tompkins' answering machine stated, ``I'm \ngoing to cut your wife's liver out and make you eat it. Then I'm going \nto cut your head off.'' Protesters with bullhorns repeatedly \ndemonstrated at Dr. Tompkins' home early on Saturday mornings. On \nseveral occasions, he has had to have a police escort to go to church.\n  A 14-page ``joke'' booklet--it certainly is anything but a joke--was \ndistributed by an anti-choice group called ``Life Dynamics'' to more \nthan 33,000 medical students. These so-called ``jokes'' recommended \nphysicians who perform abortions should be shot, attacked by dogs, and \nburied in concrete. One medical student who received the booklet the \nsame day Dr. Gunn was murdered stated, ``To say the least, it was \nupsetting''--that all OB/GYNs should be killed.\n  The extraordinary measures that people must take for their protection \ndoesn't seem right in a country such as ours. But physicians and other \nclinic workers face the daily possibility of terrorism and violence in \norder to provide women with legal reproductive health services.\n  In the wake of the recent killings and harassment of people at their \nhomes, providers are resorting to extraordinary new measures to protect \nthemselves. Clinics are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in \nbulletproof glass, armed guards, security cameras, metal detectors and \nother security devices. Doctors are wearing bullet-proof vests and some \nhave even purchased armored vehicles to go to work.\n  Clinic workers have been instructed by Federal marshals to vary their \nroutes to go to work--clinic workers, secretaries, nurses, phone \noperators, janitors--to drive to a safe haven if followed, and to call \npolice if they receive a suspicious package, as it would likely contain \na bomb.\n  In Boston, MA, Dr. Maureen Paul no longer sits on the third floor \natrium she built for herself as a so-called ``dream spot.'' In light of \nDr. Slepian's murder in his home, she feels too vulnerable there, \nwhich, according to Dr. Paul ``really makes me angry because, wow, this \nis the space I created for me. I don't get to be home very often, and \nso it really disturbs me that I have to think about getting shot in a \nplace I love.''\n  Many other clinic directors, including Director Warren Hern, \ninstalled bullet-proof glass in his office and hired private armed \nsecurity guards. He wears a bullet-proof vest at his public \nappearances. Stated Dr. Hern:\n\n       I walk out of my office and the first thing I do is look at \n     the parking garage the hospital built two doors away to see \n     if there is a sniper on the roof. I expect to be shot any \n     day, any minute. I'm in a war zone. It is frightening and it \n     has ruined my life.\n\n  These are only a few of the 38,000 acts of intimidation that have \ntaken place in America.\n  For example, Dr. Slepian was murdered. Keep in mind, his murder \noccurred while he was having dinner with his family in his kitchen. \nSomebody with a high-powered rifle shot him through his kitchen window \nwith one bullet through the head in front of his entire family. After \nthe killing took place, a poem appeared on the Internet, ``Ode to \nSlepian.'' They say the most vicious things. They have the audacity to \nquote Holy Scripture to condone their act of violence and their attempt \nto ``coronate'' this act of violence as something good and positive.\n\n       ``The sound of window glass shattering, a hollow thud, and \n     a woman's scream coming from within the house, pierced the \n     frigid air. He smiled. Hallelujah to the Lord.''\n\n  This has got to stop.\n  Six years ago, I was first to speak out against clinic violence. On \nthe day Dr. Gunn was brutally murdered in Florida, I said I thought \nthat was wrong. I still think it is wrong. Regardless of a person's \nfeeling on the issue of abortion, we can't allow this to take\n\n[[Page S14240]]\n\nplace. After the speeches on clinic violence and the public's disgust, \na law was passed - Federal Access to Clinic Entrance Act. It was \ndirected toward this terrorism at clinics. It has helped. Not a great \ndeal, but it has helped. It is a step in the right direction.\n  Today, I am directing a letter to the Attorney General of the United \nStates, Janet Reno. I say to Janet Reno, I know there is a task force \ndealing with these issues, but we in Congress need to be told what is \nbeing done. We need to see some results and we need to know what more \ncan be done. We need a report.\n  We not only have to go after those people who have committed these \natrocious deadly acts, but we need to figure out a program to stop them \nfrom happening in the first place. We can't have the Internet, the U.S. \nmail, people's homes and businesses violated by these terrorists.\n  I am asking Janet Reno to give us in Congress some direction, some \nguidance as the chief law enforcement officer in this country. We want \nto know what you are doing to stop these acts of intimidation and \nviolence. It is time these 38,000 acts are stopped. We must do \nsomething to stop this senseless violence in the land of our liberty.\n  We must understand that what separates any pluralistic society from \nanarchy is a recognition that no one has a monopoly on the truth. When \nthis basic precept fails, so does the community. It was thus in Kosovo, \nBosnia, and Rwanda, in the Germany of the 1930s and America of 1861.\n  There have always been people who knew the wishes of their Supreme \nBeing more clearly than others. Some became St. Francis; others burned \nSt. Joan. Some raised cathedrals; others sacked Jerusalem. Some wrote \nhymns of praise to the Lord; others wrote his name in blood. There have \nalways been people who knew their law was of a higher moral value than \nthe laws of society in which they live.\n  Some became Gandhi and led marches to the sea; others became Theodore \nKaczynski and mailed bombs to people they never met. Some became Henry \nDavid Thoreau and refused to make war; others became Timothy McVeigh \nand made war on innocent men, women, and children. Some became Martin \nLuther King and marched to Selma; others became James Earl Ray, the \nlone fanatic with a gun.\n  As long as any man or woman combines that mistaken belief in a higher \nlaw with a conviction that they are empowered to enforce it against \ntheir fellow man, so long will the fringe fanatics of the pro-life \nmovement, murder and maim and intimidate in violation of the rights and \nbeliefs of every person dedicated to a just and civil society in \nAmerica.\n  All Americans must speak out against this new American terror; to do \notherwise is un-American.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Craig from Idaho and I, following \nthe Senator from Montana speaking, intend to have perhaps 15 minutes \nsplit between the two of us. I ask unanimous consent we be recognized \nfollowing the presentation by the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Montana needs 10 minutes?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will need 10 to 12 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent following the presentation of the \nSenator from Montana I be recognized for 15 minutes with the intention \nof yielding some of that time to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada controls the time.\n  Mr. REID. I have no objection to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14240-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14240-S14241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JAPAN'S MARKET OPERATIONS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, a long list of issues must be addressed in \nthe next round of the multilateral trade negotiations that kick off in \nSeattle in 4 weeks. Agricultural trade is at the very top. Other issues \ninclude further reducing tariffs, repairing the WTO dispute settlement \nprocess, removing restrictions on trade and services, increasing \nopportunities to sell to governments, avoiding measures that restrict \nthe growth of electronic commerce and figuring out how to put a human \nface on trade law consideration of the relationship between trade and \nlabor and between trade and the environment.\n  There is another issue that has received virtually no attention at \nall. Yet it is of critical importance to the United States, to most \nother nations, and to the world trading system itself. I refer to the \nproblem of Japan, the second largest economy in the world. A country \nwhere the markets for our goods and services remain far more closed \nthan they should be.\n\n  The sense-of-the-Senate resolution I am introducing today, along with \nSenator Grassley, urges the administration to pay much more attention \nto Japan in the next trade round than was the case in the past.\n  I want the administration to work overtime to ensure that Japan makes \ncommitments that will genuinely open its markets. And the \nadministration must then ensure that Japan meets those commitments. \nPaper agreements will not suffice. Agreeing to broad principles is \nunacceptable. Negotiations in the next trade round must lead to clear \nresults in Japan. There must be meaningful, measurable change in the \nway Japan's markets operate.\n  Historically, the relationship between multilateral and bilateral \ntrade commitments made by Japan, and then whether there is actual \nchange in Japan's markets, has been tenuous, at best. The American \nChamber of Commerce in Japan, in its report ``Making Trade Talks \nWork'', documented this problem of implementation and results.\n  In the Uruguay round, Japan did not have to make the kind of \nsignificant changes that were required of many other major trading \ncountries. Including the United States. Even where Japan agreed to open \nits market, such as the rice market, the out-of-quota tariff rate is \nstill in the range of 500 percent. That is not a misquote. It is Five \nZero Zero, 500 percent tariff on rice coming into Japan from the United \nStates. I am worried that in the next round, the Japanese Government \nwill be able to minimize the commitments they make. And then, in a \nuniquely Japanese way, they will be able to minimize the implementation \nof those commitments and obligations. In earlier trade rounds, Japan \nagreed to the GATT Government Procurement Code. But the United States \nfound that we had to negotiate special bilateral agreements with Japan \nin order to get genuine access to their government market. We \nnegotiated multiple arrangements on computers, supercomputers, \ntelecommunications equipment, medical equipment, and satellites. Even \nwith these arrangements, access to Japan's market has still been a \nmajor problem in many of these areas. The GATT system has not worked \nwell here. In the Uruguay round, we were so focused on other problems, \nespecially in Europe, that we missed a lot of opportunities with Japan. \nI am concerned that the same thing may happen again. I certainly do not \nwant to take away from the focus on agriculture and other priorities we \nhave for the next round. But I want to be sure that we do not let Japan \noff again.\n  Japan seems now to be working overtime to protect its trade-\ndistorting policies in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. The Advanced \nTariff Liberalization efforts would have been further along but for \nJapanese opposition at APEC. Now, Japan is trying to hide its \nprotectionist policies behind the banner of the ``multifunctionality'' \nof agriculture. That is, they claim that farming plays an important \nrole in a country's social and cultural fabric, trade liberalization \ncannot interfere. Of course, farming is integral to the social fabric \nof many nations, including our own. But that is not an excuse for trade \nprotection and making other countries pay those domestic social costs.\n  At the same time, Japan is playing a leading role in criticizing \nUnited States trade laws and in working with other countries to \nchallenge our anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws in the next \nround. Some speculate that this is just another attempt to undercut \nAmerican initiatives in the new round. Japan could, and more important \nJapan should, take a leadership role in a number of areas. After all, \nfew countries in the world have benefited more than Japan over the past \nhalf century from an open world trading system.\n\n[[Page S14241]]\n\n  Japan could take significant steps to make its regulatory system more \ntransparent and less burdensome. They could table a broad based \nservices liberalization proposal that would encourage others to follow. \nJapan could lead the effort to put more transparency into the \ngovernment procurement agreement. It could lead on electronic commerce. \nAnd, of course, it could deal with those agriculture policies that are \nat the top of the agenda.\n  This resolution calls on the administration to focus on Japan in the \nnext round, to set out specific expectations for the changes desired in \nJapan, to ensure that Japanese commitments made in the round will truly \nlead to change in the Japanese market, to work with other major nations \nto ensure that these changes occur, and to consult closely with \nCongress and the private sector, including manufacturers, agriculture, \nservice providers, and NGOs, throughout the negotiations.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping ensure full \nparticipation by Japan in the round and in ensuring that we will \nbenefit from Japan's commitments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nalong with my colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig, to discuss \nobjectives we have for the upcoming WTO trade summit in Seattle, WA. We \nwant that trade summit, the initiation of a new round of trade talks, \nto be as productive as possible for this country and especially for \nthis country's family farmers and ranchers.\n  In recent years, we have seen the results of our trade negotiators \nnegotiating trade agreements in secret around the globe and developing \nthe conditions under which we trade goods and services. Family farmers \nand ranchers largely have discovered they have been given short shrift \nand not treated very well. In fact, their remedies to attempt to \nconfront unfair trade arrangements were taken away. They discovered \nthat in many cases the competition they face in the marketplace for \nagricultural goods was unfair competition. They discovered foreign \nmarkets were still closed to them, with little promise of them being \nopened.\n  We decide this time that the round of trade talks that will begin \nwith the WTO in Seattle would be different. So Senator Craig and I \nconvened a caucus, the WTO Trade Caucus for Farmers and Ranchers. We \ncalled our colleagues in the House, Congressman Simpson and Congressman \nPomeroy, and, with the four of us as cochairs, created an organization \nin Congress that has nearly 50 Senators and Congressmen, to try to \nestablish, a set of objectives that will be helpful to family farm \ninterests in this country for our trade ambassador and our trade \nnegotiators to follow.\n  Mind you, we are not simply focusing on the issue of family farmers. \nWe want our trade talks to be fruitful to our country and our economy \nas a whole. But we believe very strongly, representing rural States, \nthat family farmers have been hurt by recent trade agreements and that \nought not be the case. Trade arrangements and trade negotiations ought \nto help our producers, not hurt them. So our caucus--again, nearly 50 \nSenators and Congressmen strong--Republicans and Democrats working \ntogether, established a set of objectives. Those objectives we have \nused in meetings with the trade ambassador and with the Secretary of \nAgriculture and others, and many of us will in fact go to Seattle the \nfirst week of December and be present at the initiation of these trade \ntalks, trying to press the case that this time family farmers and \nranchers across this country must not be given short shrift in the \ntrade talks.\n  I would like to go through a couple of charts that describe the \nseriousness of the situation we want to confront with this trade \nagenda. Here is a chart that shows what has happened to our trade \ndeficit. We are beginning a new round of trade talks at a time our \ntrade deficit is going through the roof, $25 billion in a month in \ntrade deficits. That is very serious. That is the highest trade deficit \nanywhere in history, by any country, any place, any time.\n  What is happening with imports and exports? This chart shows that \nimports keep going up, up, and up, while exports are basically a flat \nline. That is, of course, what is causing our trade imbalance.\n  Just on agricultural trade alone, in the last couple of years, we \nhave had a very healthy surplus in agricultural trade that has shrunk, \nand shrunk, and shrunk some more. This is a chart that spells out the \ndifficulties family farmers now face--the rather anemic ability to \nexport to other countries. We are not exporting as much as we used to, \nand there is a substantial amount of increased imports in food products \nfrom abroad.\n  Finally, let me take it from the general to the specific, to say one \nof the burrs under my saddle has always been the trade with Canada. It \nis fundamentally unfair. This chart shows what has happened with our \nagricultural trade balance with Canada. The United States-Canadian \ntrade agreement and NAFTA turned a healthy trade surplus with Canada in \nagricultural commodities alone into a very sizable deficit. That is the \nwrong direction. In durum wheat, in the first 7 months of this year \ncompared with the first 7 months of previous years, which themselves \nare an all-time record, you will see once again we continue a massive \nquantity of unfair trade coming in from Canada.\n  I simply tell my colleagues this to explain that we have serious \nchallenges in this trade round. The caucus that we have established \ncreated some objectives on behalf of farmers and ranchers, under the \nheading of Fair trade for agriculture at the WTO conference:\n  Expand market access. Too many markets around the world are closed to \nAmerican farmers and ranchers who want to compete. Expand access, \neliminate export subsidies. Those are trade-distorting.\n  The fact is, we are barraged with export subsidies in multiples of \nwhat we are able to do. We ought to eliminate export subsidies--the \nEuropeans, especially, are guilty of massive quantities of export \nsubsidies.\n  Discipline state trading enterprises. These are sanctioned monopolies \nthat would not be legal in our country. The Canadian Wheat Board, \nespecially, engages in unfair trade.\n  Improve market access for products of new biotechnology.\n  Deny unilateral disarmament; that is, do not give up the tools to \ncombat unfair trade; and do not give up the domestic tools to support \nfamily farmers.\n  We have a substantial list on our agenda. Rather than go through all \nof this, I want to yield to the Senator from Idaho in a moment, but let \nme also say the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Wyoming, is also \ninvolved in this caucus, as are many others, Republicans and Democrats, \nworking together for a common purpose, and that common purpose is to \nsay: Farmers and ranchers around this country work hard, and they do \ntheir level best. They raise livestock and grain and they do a good \njob. They can compete anywhere, any time, under any condition, but they \ncannot compete successfully when the rules of trade are unfair.\n  That, sadly, too often has been the case, and we intend this time in \nthis WTO round to see that is no longer the case. We want these \nnegotiations to bear fruit--bear grain, actually, now that I think \nabout it, from my part of the country, but fruit for others. We want \nthese negotiations to work for our family farmers and ranchers.\n  Bipartisan work in Congress does not get very much attention because \nthere is not much controversy attached to it, but there are many \ninstances in which we work together across the aisle. This is one. A \nbipartisan group of 50 Members of the House and Senate are working \ntogether for a common objective: to improve conditions in rural America \nas a result of the upcoming WTO round of trade talks. I am very pleased \nto have been working with my colleague, Senator Craig, from the State \nof Idaho. I yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank Senator Dorgan for outlining the \nintent of the effort underway by the Senator, myself, and 49 other \ncolleagues. It was Senator Byron Dorgan who approached me on the idea \nof creating a\n\n[[Page S14242]]\n\nWTO caucus to elevate the interests of agriculture in this up-and-\ncoming round of the WTO planning session in Seattle in December.\n  I thank him for that vision. It has been fun working with him as we \nhave created what I think is--sometimes unique in the Congress--a \nbipartisan, bicameral effort where we are all standing together on a \nlist of items and issues we know are key for American agriculture. The \nSenator has outlined those on which we came together in a consensus \nformat that we think are critical, that we presented to our Trade \nambassador and to our Secretary of Agriculture.\n  Market access--we know how critically important that is; export \nsubsidies and how they are used or used against us; State trading \nenterprises and their ability to mask the reality of subsidies from \nproducts that enter the marketplace in a nontransparent way; nontariff \nbarriers that are used to block the movement we want to see in certain \ntrade efforts.\n  All of these are the issues we have presented and because of our \neffort collectively, we have caused the Secretary of Agriculture and \nthe Trade ambassador to suggest that No. 1 on the agenda of America's \nnegotiators at the WTO will be agricultural issues.\n  Why are we concerned about it? Here is an example. Even after the \nUruguay agreement which required tariff reductions of some 36 percent, \nthe average bound agricultural tariff of WTO members is still 50 \npercent. In contrast the average U.S. tariff on agricultural imports is \nless than 10 percent--50 percent versus 10 percent on the average. \nThose are the kinds of relationships we have to see brought into \nbalance and corrected.\n  The United States spends less than 2 percent, $122 million a year, of \nwhat the European Union spends on export subsidies. They spend $7 \nbillion a year, buying down the cost of their product to present it \ninto a world market. In fact, the European Union accounts for 84 \npercent of the total agricultural export subsidy worldwide. Subsidized \nforeign competition has contributed to the nearly 20-percent decline in \nU.S. agricultural exports, as Senator Dorgan so clearly pointed out on \nhis charts a few moments ago. That dramatic reduction in the \nagricultural trade surplus from a $27 billion surplus for us in 1996 to \njust $11.5 billion this year says it very clearly. We have to do \nsomething on behalf of American agriculture to allow them a much fairer \naccess to world markets.\n  Those are the issues we think are so critical as we deal with our \nworld traders in Seattle. Nontariff barriers have become the \nprotectionist weapon of choice particularly for the products derived \nfrom new technologies, as Customs tariffs are lowered. U.S. negotiators \nshould prevent our trading partners from making crops and other foods \nproduced with genetically modified organisms into second-class food \nproducts. Yes, we have to do a better job of convincing the world of \nour tremendous scientific capability. At the same time, they cannot \narbitrarily be used as a target for nontariff barriers, as will be \nargued or debated in Seattle.\n  That is a collection of many of the issues with which we are going to \nbe dealing. It is so important America recognizes the abundance of its \nagriculture and the unique situation we find ourselves in a world \nmarket today where we have had the privilege, through the productivity \nof America's farmers, to lead the world. We now do not lead when it \ncomes to agricultural exports but we will search to cause it to happen, \nthrough the openness of the marketplace, through the fairness of \ncompetition we know American agriculture, given that opportunity, can \noffer.\n  Again, I thank Senator Dorgan for his cooperativeness and the ability \nto work together with our colleagues Mike Simpson and Earl Pomeroy from \nthe House and, as Senator Dorgan mentioned, the Senator from Wyoming \nwho is presiding at this moment. All of these are tremendously \nimportant and critical issues for our home States and for America at \nlarge. The abundance, the productivity of American agriculture hangs in \nthe balance. To the consumer who walks in front of a supermarket shelf \nevery day to see such phenomenal abundance, that in itself could \ndecline if we are not allowed the world marketplace in which to sell \nthe goods and services of American agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record \nagricultural trade priorities for the WTO Conference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     WTO Trade Caucus for Farmers and Ranchers--Agricultural Trade \n Priorities for the WTO Ministerial Conference and New Round of Global \n                           Trade Negotiations\n\n\n                             market access\n\n       Expand market access through tariff reduction or \n     elimination.\n       Negotiate zero-for-zero for appropriate sectors.\n       Strive for reciprocal market access.\n       Even after the Uruguay Round Agreement, which required \n     tariff reductions of 36 percent, the average bound \n     agriculture tariff of WTO members is still 50 percent. In \n     contrast, the average U.S. tariff on agriculture imports is \n     less than 10 percent.\n\n\n                            export subsidies\n\n       Eliminate all export subsidies.\n       Reduce European Union (EU) subsidies to the level provided \n     by the United States before applying any formula reduction. \n     Negotiations must not leave the EU with an absolute subsidy \n     advantage.\n       The United States spends less than 2 percent ($122 million) \n     of what the EU spends on export subsidies ($7 billion). In \n     fact, the EU accounts for 84 percent of total agriculture \n     export subsidies worldwide. Subsidized foreign competition \n     has contributed to the nearly 20 percent decline in U.S. \n     agriculture exports over the last three years, and the \n     dramatic reduction in the agriculture trade surplus, from $27 \n     billion in 1996 to just $11.5 billion this year.\n\n\n                       no unilateral disarmament\n\n       Combat Unfair Trade.\n       Restore and strengthen enforcement tools against unfair \n     trade practices.\n       Improve enforcement of WTO dispute panel decisions, \n     accelerate the process, and make it more transparent.\n       Support Family Farmers.\n       Preserve the flexibility to assist family farmers through \n     income assistance, crop insurance and other programs that do \n     not distort trade.\n       Retain the full complement of non-trade distorting export \n     tools including export credit guarantees, international food \n     assistance, and market development programs.\n\n\n                       state trading enterprises\n\n       Establish disciplines on STEs to make them as transparent \n     as the U.S. marketing system.\n       Expose STEs to greater competition from in-country \n     importers and exporters.\n       Eliminate the discriminatory pricing practices of STE \n     monopolies that amount to de facto export subsidies.\n       Export STEs like the Canadian Wheat Board and the \n     Australian Wheat Board Ltd. control more than \\1/3\\ of world \n     wheat and wheat flour trade. Import STEs keep U.S. farmers \n     and exporters out of lucrative foreign markets.\n\n\n                       non-tariff trade barriers\n\n       Ensure that science and risk assessment principles \n     established by the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Accord during \n     the Uruguay Round are the basis of measures applied to \n     products of new technology and that this process be \n     transparent.\n       Assume that regulatory measures applied to products of new \n     technologies do not constitute ``unnecessary regulatory \n     burdens.''\n       Negotiate improved market access for products of new \n     technology, including bioengineered products.\n       Non-tariff barriers have become the protectionist weapon of \n     choice, particularly for the products derived from new \n     technologies, as customs tariffs are lowered. U.S. \n     negotiators should prevent our trading partners from making \n     crops and other goods produced with genetically-modified \n     organisms into second-class food products that are the \n     subject of discrimination in foreign markets.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add 10 minutes \nto the discussion. I want to ask the Senator from Idaho a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Idaho, and \none of the points he made is important. A lot of people do not \nunderstand that following the conclusion of the latest round of trade \ntalks, there remains a 50-percent tariff on average in other countries. \nTo the extent we can get our agricultural commodities into those \ncountries, there is a 50-percent tariff on those goods.\n  In previous speeches I talked about eating American T-bone steaks in \nJapan and that there is a 40.5-percent tariff on every pound of beef \ngoing into Japan. That is actually a bit lower than the average tariff \nthat is confronting our products going elsewhere in the world.\n  I think anyone would conclude it is a failure if we had a 50-percent \ntariff on\n\n[[Page S14243]]\n\nan agricultural commodity coming into this country, and yet our \nproducers confront it all across the world. In fact, those are the \ncases when we can get products in. There are many circumstances where \nwe will not get products into a market at all or, if we get some \nproducts in, we cannot get sufficient quantity; is that not correct?\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely correct. When we came out of the \nUruguay Round, when the round was heralded to have significant \nimprovements in overall tariff levels, the problem was that most \ntariffs in the world were very high and ours were very low.\n  So we negotiated everybody down equally. We took a reduction in \ntariff. They, the European community, and others, took a reduction in \ntariff, which brought the average, other than the tariffs of the United \nStates, down to 50 percent; and ours were down in the 10-percent-or-\nless range. So it was this kind of gradual slide.\n  I do not call that fair or balanced. It would have been different if \nthe rest of the world had come down to a 20-percent-or-less range or \nproperly on parity with the United States at 10 percent or less. That \nreally is the way we should negotiate.\n  Thank goodness our Trade Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, agrees \nwith us now and has agreed they will not negotiate from that position \nin Seattle, that clearly the European community and others have to \nbring that down to a near level area.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, further inquiring, is it not the case that \nexactly the same thing happened on export subsidies? The Senator from \nIdaho described tariffs that exist in our country versus other \ncountries and trade talks attempting to reduce those tariffs, except \nthey left the tariffs much higher in other countries than in our \ncountry. If you go down 10 percent, and one country has a 50-percent \ntariff, that means you have taken their tariff down from 50 to 45 \npercent. If we have a 10-percent tariff, we go from 10 to 9. That does \nnot make any sense to me.\n  Exactly the same thing was true with respect to export subsidies. So \nthe European countries were left with export subsidies many times in \nexcess of anything we could possibly use. That was probably fine in the \nfirst 25 years after the Second World War because then our trade policy \nwas really foreign policy. We were trying to help other countries out \nof the trouble they were in. We could beat anybody else around the \nworld in trade with one hand tied behind our back. It didn't matter \nvery much. We could do a lot of concessional things.\n  That is not the case anymore. The European Union is a tough, shrewd \neconomic competitor. Japan is a tough, shrewd economic competitor. The \nsame is true of many of our trading partners. We must begin to insist \nthat trade policy be hard-nosed economic policy, not foreign policy.\n  I inquire of the Senator from Idaho, is it not the case that the \npoint we are making in these trade objectives is to say, on both market \naccess--on tariffs, on export subsidies--and other items, that we do \nnot want to be in a circumstance anymore when, at the end of the \nnegotiation, we have made concessions to other countries that put our \nproducers at a significant and distinct disadvantage?\n  Is it not the case that our producers, at the end of the previous \nrounds, were at a distinct and dramatic disadvantage, and our objective \nis to make sure that does not happen again.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely correct. In fact, let me give an \nexample of the disadvantage we were in that caused great frustration.\n  The Senator's State and my State produce a variety of grains. And we \nproduce them at high rates of yield. They are high-quality grains. Yet \nwe found shiploads of grains, barley in some instances, from foreign \ncountries sitting at our docks, being sold into our markets at below \nour production costs.\n  How did that come about? That came about because the government of \nthe producing country that sent the boatload of grain to the Port of \nPortland subsidized it down to a level that they could actually enter \nour market and compete against our producers who were getting 1950 \nprices for their 1998 barley crop.\n  How do you pay for a brand new tractor or a brand new combine with \n1950 dollars in 1998? You do not. You run the old combine, you fix it \nup, or you go bankrupt. But that is exactly what was happening because \nour negotiators did not do the effective job of bringing down export \nsubsidies in a way that would disallow the greatest grain-producing \ncountry in the world to accept grain at its ports from foreign nations \nat below our cost of production. That is the best example I can give.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator would yield, I think the Senator is \ndescribing, at least in one case, a barley shipment coming from the \nEuropean Union to Stockton, CA. It pulled up to the dock in Stockton, \nCA, and was able to offload barley shipped over here from Europe at a \nprice that was dramatically below the price that was received in this \ncountry by barley growers, at a time, incidentally, when our barley \nprice was in the tank.\n  How could that be the case? The reason they could do it is they \ndeeply subsidized it. In fact, they dumped it into our marketplace. \nWhen that ship showed up at the California dock, it represented legal \ntrade. Think of that: A deeply subsidized load of grain coming into a \ncountry that is awash in its own barley, with prices in the tank, and \nthat ship shows up, and it is perfectly legal. They can just dump it \ninto our marketplace. They can hurt our farmers. It doesn't matter \nbecause it is legal under the previous trade agreement.\n  That describes why our farmers and ranchers in this country are so \nupset. They have reason to be upset. They ought to be able to expect, \nwhen our negotiator negotiates with other countries, that we get a fair \ndeal. It is not a fair deal to say to other countries: We will compete \nwith you, but you go ahead and subsidize; drive down the price. Dump \nit, if you like, and there will be no remedy for family farmers to call \nit unfair trade because we in our trade agreement will say it is OK.\n  It is not OK with me. It is not OK with the Senator from Idaho. It is \nnot OK with many Republicans and Democrats who serve in Congress who \ninsist it is time to ask that trade be fair so our producers, when they \nconfront competition from around the world, can meet that competition \nin a fair and honest way. That is not what is happening today.\n  If I might make one additional point, the Senator represents a State \nthat borders with Canada, a good neighbor of ours to the north. My \nState borders with Canada. I like the Canadians. I think they are great \npeople.\n  But following the trade agreement with Canada, and then NAFTA, we \nbegan to see this flood of Canadian durum coming into this country. It \nwent from 0 to 20 million bushels a year. Why? Do we need durum in this \ncountry? No. We produce more than we need. Why are we flooded with \ndurum? Because Canada has the state trading enterprise called the \nCanadian Wheat Board, which would be illegal in this country but legal \nthere.\n  They sell into this country at secret prices. It is perfectly legal. \nYou can sell at secret prices. You dump and hide behind your secrecy, \nand no one can penetrate it. That is why our farmers are angry. It has \ntotally collapsed the price of durum wheat. It is unfair trade. All the \nremedies that farmers and ranchers would use to fight this unfair trade \nare gone.\n  Ranchers have just gotten together in something called R-CALF. They \nhave spent a lot of money and legal fees and so on and taken action \nagainst the Canadians. Guess what. The first couple steps now they have \nwon. But that should not be that way. You should not have to force \nproducers to spend a great deal of money to go hire Washington law \nfirms to pursue these cases.\n  Trade agreements ought to be negotiated aggressively on behalf of our \nproducers in order to require and demand fair trade. But I wanted to \nmake the point about State trading enterprises, which must be addressed \nin this new WTO round, because the STEs have dramatically injured \nAmerican farmers and ranchers.\n  My expectation is that Senator Craig has discovered exactly the same \ncircumstance in Idaho in terms of his ranchers and farmers trying to \ncompete against sanctioned monopolies from other countries.\n  Mr. CRAIG. The Senator is absolutely right. When he speaks of State\n\n[[Page S14244]]\n\ntrading enterprises, the Canadian Wheat Board and the Australian Wheat \nBoard control over one third of the world's wheat and wheat flour \ntrade. As the Senator just explained, those negotiations are kept \nsecret. Those trading enterprises buy the grain from farmers at the \ngoing market price. Then when they sell it, they do not report it. If \nthey are to sell it well below the cost of the market, to get it into \nanother country for purposes of sale, they sell it, and they are \nsubsidized accordingly. If they can make money, they make money. But \nthe point is, those kinds of transactions are not transparent. They are \nnot reported.\n  In my State of Idaho, you can get a truckload of barley out of Canada \nto an elevator in Idaho cheaper than the farmer can bring it from \nacross the street out of his field to that elevator. Why? Because that \nwas a sale conducted by that particular trading enterprise, and it was \nsold well below the market, and, of course, that was not reported. You \ndo not have marketplace competition. You cannot even understand it and \ncompare figures, if you have no transparency in the marketplace. State \ntrading enterprises are known for that, and we have asked our Secretary \nof Agriculture and our trade ambassador to go directly at this issue. \nEven the farmer of Canada now recognizes that this is also \ndisadvantaging the producer in Canada, to have this kind of a \nmonopolistic power controlling the grain trade of the world.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have been pleased to work with Senator \nCraig and others in establishing this caucus. I will be in Seattle at \nthe trade talks, as are many of my colleagues. We are determined this \ntime to make sure that, at the end of these trade talks, we do better \nthan we have done before on behalf of family farmers and ranchers.\n  Will Rogers said, I guess 60 years ago, the United States of America \nhas never lost a war and never won a conference. He surely would have \nobserved that if he had observed the trade negotiations that have \noccurred with Republican and Democratic administrations over recent \ndecades. We are determined to try to change that. That is the purpose \nof this caucus.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14244-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich).

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I remember, the consent request was \nthat this hour was to be used for debate on bankruptcy prior to 3. Is \nthe time evenly divided, or how is the time designated?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no division of time until 3.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing be granted the privilege of the floor for the bankruptcy \nbill: Kathy Curran, Jennifer Liebman, Lisa Bornstein.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for over 100 years, Congress has \nsupported a bankruptcy system that balances the needs of debtors in \ndesperate financial straits and creditors who deserve repayment. Today, \nhowever, the tide is changing. Too often the complexity of the problems \nfacing debtors is ignored. Critics, using the unfair rhetoric supplied \nby the credit industry, call bankruptcy an undeserved refuge for those \nwho can't or won't manage their finances. Honest, hard-working, middle \nclass families are unfairly characterized as dead-beats who abuse the \nbankruptcy system to avoid paying their debts. The result is the \nexcessively harsh bankruptcy reform bill presented to the Senate.\n  During this debate, every Senator must ask one essential question--\nwho are the winners and who are the losers if this bill becomes law. A \nfair analysis of the bill will lead members of the Senate to the same \nconclusion reached by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, \nwho counted dozens of provisions that favor creditors. But, decency and \ndignity need not be victims of reform. Balanced bankruptcy legislation \nis our goal. Though we must address the needs of creditors, we must \nalso consider the specific circumstances and market forces that push \nmiddle class Americans into bankruptcy.\n  Let's take the basic facts one by one.\n  Fact No. 1: The rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. \nDespite low unemployment, a booming stock market, and budget surpluses, \nWall Street cheers when companies--eager to improve profits by down-\nsizing--lay off workers in large numbers. In 1998, layoffs were \nreported around the country in almost every industry--9,000 jobs were \nlost after the Exxon-Mobil merger; 5,500 jobs were lost after Deutsche \nBank acquired Bankers Trust; Boeing laid off 9,000 workers; Johnson & \nJohnson laid off 4,100. Kodak has cut 30,000 jobs since the 1980s and \n6,300 since 1997.\n  Often, when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a \nstudy of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics reported that only about one-quarter of these workers were \nworking at full-time jobs paying as much as or more than they had \nearned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are forced to \naccept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, and jobs with fewer benefits or \nno benefits at all.\n  Fact No. 2: Divorce rates have soared over the past 40 years. For \nbetter or for worse, more couples are separating, and the financial \nconsequences are particularly devastating for women. Divorced women are \nfour times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or \nsingle men. In 1999, 540,000 women who head their own households will \nfile for bankruptcy to try to stabilize their economic lives. 200,000 \nof them will also be creditors trying to collect child support or \nalimony. The rest will be debtors struggling to make ends meet.\n  Fact No. 3: Over 43 million Americans have no health insurance, and \nmany millions more are underinsured. Each year, millions of families \nspend more than 20 percent of their income on medical care, and older \nAmericans are hit particularly hard. A June 1998 CRS Report states that \neven though Medicare provides near-universal health coverage for older \nAmericans, half of this age group spend 14 percent or more of their \nafter-tax income on health costs, including insurance premiums, co-\npayments and prescription drugs.\n  Fact No. 4: The credit card industry has engaged in a massive and \nunseemly nation-wide campaign to hook unsuspecting citizens on credit \ncard debt. Credit card issuers logged 24 million telemarketing hours in \n1996 and sent out 3.45 billion--billion--credit card solicitations in \n1998. In an average month, 75 percent of all households in the country \nreceive a credit card solicitation. In recent years, the credit card \nindustry has also begun to offer new lines of credit targeted at people \nwith low incomes--people they know can not afford to pile up credit \ncard debt.\n\n[[Page S14245]]\n\n  Facts such as these have reduced the economic stability of millions \nof American families, and have led to the sharp increase in the number \nof bankruptcy filings. Two out of every three bankruptcy filers have an \nemployment problem. One out of every five bankruptcy filers has a \nhealth-care problem. Divorced or separated people are three times more \nlikely than married couples to file for bankruptcy. Working men and \nwomen in economic free fall often have no choice except bankruptcy.\n  The bankruptcy system provides a second chance for these large \nnumbers of Americans who would otherwise hit financial bottom. It \noffers an indispensable opportunity to stabilize their households after \nan economic crisis.\n  Clearly, we must deal with those who take advantage of the system and \nabuse it. Reform is necessary to stop repeat filers, eliminate the \nloophole provided by the homestead exemptions in several states, and \nprevent wealthy Americans from abusing the system to avoid paying their \ndebts. But the credit card industry is abusing the system, too. \nCongress needs to deal with their abuses realistically and fairly, in a \nway that protects millions of struggling middle class and low-income \nfamilies. It would be irresponsible for Congress to act only in ways \nthat reward the credit card industry for its cynical manipulation of \nthese families.\n  The drop in filings this year is ample indication that a harsh \nbankruptcy bill is not needed. Without any action by Congress, the \nnumber of bankruptcy filings is decreasing. It is estimated that there \nwill be 100,000 fewer filings this year than in 1998--filings have \ndropped in 42 states. Leading economists believe that the bankruptcy \ncrisis is self-correcting. As economics professor Lawrence Ausubel \nstates,\n\n       Lenders respond to an unexpected increase in personal \n     bankruptcies by curtailing new lending to consumers teetering \n     closest to bankruptcy, with or without new legislation. The \n     high rates of default at the peak of the bankruptcy crisis \n     began to impinge on the profitability of lending and--as a \n     result--lenders tightened their underwriting standards. This \n     is the non-legislative, free-market response which made the \n     crisis abate.\n\n  Despite these facts, the Senate is pursuing legislation that is a \ntaxpayer-funded administrative nightmare for struggling debtors.\n  Mr. President, I will include in the Record a list of the States that \nhave seen a significant--and some not so significant--drop in the \nbankruptcy filings, comparing the second quarter of 1999 to the second \nquarter of 1998. It dropped more than 62 percent in the State of \nOklahoma. It was down 1.19 percent in Arizona. Eight States have had \nsome increase. It was two-tenths of 1 percent in Indiana, three-tenths \nof 1 percent in Utah, six-tenths of 1 percent in Wyoming. It was up \nnine-tenths of 1 percent in Montana, 3.3 percent in Oregon, 6 percent \nin South Dakota, 12 percent in Alaska, and 144 percent in Delaware.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Changes in Bankruptcy Filings, 2d Quarter 99, v 2d Quarter 98\n\n       Oklahoma, -62.1%; N. Hampshire, -23.9%; Nebraska, -15.85%; \n     Connecticut, -14.67%; Minnesota, -14.19%; Colorado, -13.87%; \n     California, -13.76%; Massachusetts, -13.62%; North Dakota; \n     -13.33%; Kansas, -13.25%; Tennessee, -11.64%; Kentucky, \n     -10.59%; Idaho, -10.27%; New York, -9.82%; Texas, -9.69%.\n       Michigan, -9.63%; Georgia, -8.28%; New Jersey, -7.95%; W. \n     Virginia, -7.3%; Maryland, -7.23%; Vermont, -7.18%; Maine, \n     -7.09%; Alabama, -6.49%; Nevada, -6.02%; Mississippi, -4.98%; \n     Washington, -4.76%; Pennsylvania, -4.21%; Arkansas, -4.2%; \n     Rhode Island, -3.97%; Florida, -3.89%.\n       Wisconsin, -3.76%; Missouri, -3.22%; Illinois, -3.19%; So. \n     Carolina, -3.19%; Ohio, -2.67%; No. Carolina, -2.35%; \n     Virginia, -2.24%; Louisiana, -2.21%; Arizona, -1.19%; \n     Indiana, +.28%; Utah, +.38%; Wyoming, +.66%; Montana, +.9%; \n     Oregon, +3.3%; So. Dakota, +6%; Alaska, +12.63%; Delaware, \n     +144.29%.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, coming back to the basic and fundamental \nissue about who is supporting the legislation, who the winners are and \nwho the losers are, I will include in the Record at this point the \nvarious organizations that are opposed to the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this list of organizations be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Organizations Opposed to S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act\n\n\n  among the organizations that have voiced their opposition to S. 625 \n                                  are:\n\n       AFL-CIO, Alliance for Justice, American Association of \n     University Women, American Federation of Government Employees \n     (AFGE), American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees (AFSCME), American Medical Women's Association, \n     Association for Children for Enforcement of Support, Inc. \n     (ACES), Business and Professional Women/USA, Center for Law \n     and Social Policy, Center for the Advancement of Public \n     Policy, Center for the Child Care Workforce, Church Women \n     United, Coalition of Labor Union Women, Communications \n     Workers of America, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers \n     Union, Equal Rights Advocates, Feminist Majority, Hadassh, \n     International Assocication of Machinists & Aerospace Workers \n     (IAM), International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, Iron Ship \n     Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers & Helpers, International \n     Brotherhood of Teamsters, International Women's Insolvency & \n     Restructuring Confederation, Ralph Nader, National \n     Association of Commissions for Women.\n       National Black Women's Health Project, National Center for \n     Youth Law, National Consumer Law Center, National Council for \n     Jewish Women, National Council of Negro Women, National \n     Council of Senior Citizens, National Organization for Women, \n     National Partnership for Women and Families, National Women's \n     Conference, National Women's Law Center, Northwest Women's \n     Law Center, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund, Public \n     Citizen, Union of Needletrades, Industrial & Textile \n     Employees (UNITE), United Automobiles, Aerospace and \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America/UAW, United Food & \n     Commercial Workers International Union, United Steelworkers \n     of America, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Wider \n     Opportunities for Women, The Woman Activist Fund, Women \n     Employed, Women Work!, Women's Institute for Freedom of the \n     Press, Women's Law Center of Maryland, Inc., YWCA of the \n     U.S.A.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this list represents virtually all of the \nchildren's protection groups--those groups that have been most \nidentified with protecting women's economic and political rights, those \ngroups that have been looking after workers' interests, and small \nbusiness groups as well. Virtually every one of them are opposed to the \nunderlying legislation.\n  As I mentioned in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would like to \nhear those who are in favor of it point out one single group \nrepresenting children, workers, women, or consumers who are for this \nbill. Just bring those names to us. Let's debate it. But we have none, \nzero.\n  It comes back to what we ought to be asking ourselves when we have \nthis kind of a situation. Isn't it worthwhile that we find out who the \nwinners are and who the losers are? If common sense is any indication, \nwe will try to make a case that in justifies these comments. Virtually \nevery one of the groups representing hard-working Americans--the men \nand women who work hard and play by the rules; and, in many instances, \nwomen who have been discriminated against for a wide variety of reasons \nand issues; children's groups who understand the importance of making \nsure that children's interests and their financial security will be \nprotected--are universally opposed and say ``no'' to the bill. But we \nhave others. The credit card companies say yes.\n  So it is interesting, as we are coming into the final hours of this \nsession, we have another one of those situations where the Republican \nleadership is putting out on the floor of the U.S. Senate a bill the \nspecial interests--in this case, the credit card companies--are \nstrongly in favor of, but threatens the economic interests of women and \nworking people and children.\n  We have little time this afternoon to debate a minimum wage, which we \nhave been virtually prohibited from doing before the Senate over the \nperiod of the last year. We are not even going to have an opportunity \nto debate something that could protect consumers, women, children, and \nworkers on a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is being put off. But we \nhave time to debate this issue. Why? Because the credit card companies \nhave a very important and direct interest in the outcome of this \nparticular legislation.\n  Mr. President, I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to \nrun through some of these charts that show, I think, very effectively, \nwhat this case is all about.\n\n[[Page S14246]]\n\n  This chart shows that the U.S. median family income is $42,769 this \nyear. Now these are constant dollars. If we look over at what the \nincome was for those who went into bankruptcy, in 1981, 1991, 1995, and \n1997, you find out there has been a gradual decline--$23,000, $18,000, \n$17,000, and in 1997 it was somewhat below what it was in 1995.\n  We have the greatest economic boom in the history of this country, \nwith the lowest unemployment and rates of inflation. We saw an increase \nin the numbers of bankruptcies. But who are these people who are filing \nfor bankruptcy? It is actually those in the lower incomes. That is who \nwe are affecting with legislation that is dealing with bankruptcy. Who \nare these people down here in 1997? Let's look back in 1981. The red \nindicates joint filings. The yellow indicates men filing. The blue is \nfor women filing.\n  Going back to 1981, we find the greatest number of filings for \nbankruptcy were joint filings, with some single men and some single \nwomen. Look what happens in 1991. Joint still goes up, and there are \nincreasing numbers of women and of men. In 1999, those at the top are \nwomen. They are at the bottom in 1981 and at the top in 1999. Do you \nsee the very dramatic increase in the number of women. Why is that so?\n\n  The reason that is so is women are being denied alimony and child \nsupport. That is why it is so. That is why it is so, Mr. President. \nEvery indicator demonstrates that is why it is so. We are passing a \nmajor piece of legislation to protect not those who are being adversely \nimpacted by these economic forces, but to protect the credit card \nindustry. It is women who are facing challenges because of alimony and \nin terms of child support.\n  If you wanted to do something about this line here, you would do more \nto make sure the deadbeat dads are going to pay up as they should in \nterms of alimony and child support. You would see this number go down \ndramatically. Nonetheless, no, no, we are not going to deal with that \nissue. We have this other kind of formula that is going to hurt these \npeople--not protect them so they might have a second opportunity. The \nfact is, the number of people who are working who go into bankruptcy is \nvirtually identical to those who are working generally anyway.\n  Isn't that interesting? The fact is, these are not men and women who \nare dogging it, these are men and women who are out trying to make it. \nNonetheless, are we considering a piece of legislation that is going to \nhelp them get back on their feet a second time and perhaps pay off \ntheir debt? No, no; we are thinking about the credit card companies and \nlooking out after their interests.\n  So we see that the great expansion and explosion in the number of \npeople who are going into bankruptcy are primarily women. Now it is \ninteresting that bankrupt debtors are reporting job problems. Sixty-\nseven percent of those who are going into bankruptcy are reporting job \nproblems, a direct result of downsizing, direct result of merging, the \ndirect result of being able to go down to Wall Street and cut back in \nthe total number of employees and see a bang in that stock going right \nup. Extraordinary economic growth and expansion--all of which are very \nfine and good--doesn't mean that you have to come down with a hammer on \nworkers who, through no fault of their own, are being merged out and \nare having difficulty in finding jobs to try to meet their \nresponsibilities, especially women.\n  This indicates what has been happening with regard to people who have \nbeen going into bankruptcy. More than 67 percent of them are showing \nthat it is basically and fundamentally an issue in terms of their \nemployment. These other colors indicate what those particular matters \nmight be in terms of downsizing and the rest. We have some idea now.\n  We have the numbers I mentioned earlier. We have the growth in the \nnumber of men and women who are separated, become divorced, and the \neconomic implications and burdens women are faced with in terms of \ncredit. We find that.\n  Now let's look to see if there are other indicators. Yes, there is \nanother very important indicator. That is the fact that we are seeing \nthe total number of uninsured in our society growing at a rate of over \na million a year. Make no mistake about it, that is going to increase \nand escalate. We are not doing anything about it. That is going to \nincrease and escalate.\n  Isn't it interesting that health care-related problems driving \nindividuals into bankruptcy are the No. 1 reason besides job related \nreasons. Individuals being dropped from the health care system are \nindividuals at the lower end of the economic ladder who don't have the \nprotections and don't have the health insurance in the first place.\n  We all know what is happening out in the job market with the \nincreasing number of temps. So you do not have pensions and you do not \nhave health insurance. Here we have the individuals who are losing out \nand falling further behind--women on credit, women on alimony, and \nwomen with challenges they have in terms of payments. Then you have the \nproblems with downsizing.\n  Now we have one of the other major issues reflected in the \nbankruptcies that are taking place all across this country.\n  We know what is happening across the country in terms of many of the \nmajor companies and corporations that had good health care protection \nfor retirees. Those numbers are going down in terms of coverage. We \nknow the costs and what is happening in terms of prescription drugs. \nThey are going up and escalating dramatically.\n  When we passed Medicare in 1964, the private sector didn't have \nprescription drugs, so Medicare didn't have it. Now 90 percent of those \npolicies have it, but we can't even get that issue up before the Senate \nto debate it. We haven't got the chance to debate whether we ought to \nhave prescription drugs. We don't get a chance to debate whether we \nought to try to accept the House bill that provides protection for \nconsumers from the arbitrary rulings of accountants in health \nmaintenance organizations. No, we can't deal with any of that. Let's \njust look out after the credit card industry. They are the ones who \nneed protection--not the men and women who have lost their health care. \nNo, sir; we don't have to worry about them--not the men and women who \nhave been downsized. No, sir; we don't have to worry about them; and \nnot women. Alimony and child care support--let's not worry about them. \nLet's worry about the good old credit card industry.\n  Let's see what we have to worry about with them. What do you know? \nHere is a facsimile of a letter, Mr. President, which I ask unanimous \nconsent be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  American Bankruptcy Service,\n\n                                  St. Paul, MN, December 18, 1998.\n     Re Fresh Start VISA' Distributorship.\n       Dear Counselor: We offer a unique opportunity that could be \n     of great benefit to your firm and your clients. By becoming a \n     distributor, you will have the ability to market an unsecured \n     VISA' credit card (the ``Fresh Start'' card) to \n     your clients who:\n       Have filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy;\n       Have completed the 341 meeting of creditors (with no \n     outstanding issues with the Trustee);\n       Have not yet received their discharge;\n       Have attached a copy of the bankruptcy notice to their VISA \n     application.\n       Several law firms specializing in representing consumer \n     debtors in bankruptcy have requested the ability to \n     distribute the ``Fresh Start'' VISA application to their \n     clients. In light of this, we thought perhaps your firm would \n     be interested also in a distributorship. For each credit card \n     issued, your firm will receive $10.\n       There is absolutely no deposit required. This is an \n     unsecured VISA card. The credit limit will be $500 or $1,000 \n     depending on income. The annual fee is $49.00. Many debtors \n     have immediate credit needs even during a bankruptcy. Some \n     are approached either by secured credit card companies but \n     cannot apply due to lack of the cash deposit required or by \n     current creditors offering a new card only with a \n     reaffirmation. This new card offer solves these problems. \n     (See sample application enclosed.) Furthermore, our \n     SuperSettlements program (brochure enclosed) provides an \n     additional method for avoiding reaffirmations with small \n     redemptions.\n       This program is intended to create a fresh start for your \n     clients and an opportunity for your firm. We realize that \n     many debtors may have to file a bankruptcy due to excessive \n     credit card debt. If you feel that this is not a program for \n     them or for your firm, please disregard this letter.\n       For more information, please fax or mail this form back to \n     us. Please call if you have questions.\n       Yes! Our firm is interested in distributing the ``Fresh \n     Start'' VISA card applications to\n\n[[Page S14247]]\n\n     our Chapter 7 clients. Please send us detailed information on \n     how we can become a distributor as soon as possible. The name \n     of the person at our firm to contract is:\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here is the letter that is being sent by \nthe ``American Bankruptcy Service,'' ``Re: Fresh Start VISA \ndistributorship'':\n\n       Dear counselor:\n\n  Do you know who the counselors are? Do you know who those counselors \nare? They are counselors for the people who have gone bankrupt--the \nlawyers for people who have gone bankrupt. Here is their friendly \n``American Bankruptcy Service.''\n\n       We offer a unique opportunity that could be of great \n     benefit to your firm and your clients. By becoming a \n     distributor, you will have the ability to market unsecured \n     VISA credit cards. We call it the ``Fresh Start'' card to \n     your clients who:\n       Have filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy;\n       Have completed the 341 meetings of creditors;\n       Have not yet received their discharge;\n       Have attached a copy of their bankruptcy notice.\n       No deposit required.\n\n  This industry is out soliciting from attorneys who have represented \nwomen and workers who have been downsized, those who have gone bankrupt \nand belly up because of health care bills they just can't afford to \npay.\n  Now you have the credit card industry writing to the attorneys and \nsaying: Look, you can get in on the goody trail, too, because if you \nrepresented one, you probably represented others, and you can get on \nand be part of our credit card distributorship as well.\n  That is what they are saying here. You can read this letter right \nthrough.\n\n       Our firm is interested in distributing the Fresh Start \n     VISA.\n\n  And we will just show you how to do it. You can also be a part of \nthis.\n  Here is their advertising.\n  If you have filed for bankruptcy, you can get a Fresh Start with \nFirst Consumers National Bank VISA card today. If you file bankruptcy, \nthat qualifies you. There is no need to wait for a bankruptcy \ndischarge. Rebuild a good credit card fast with monthly accounts \nreporting to all major credit card business.\n  They have got you once. They want to get you again, and again, and \nagain. How many times do they want to get these people? How many times?\n  We are out here debating this bill in the final couple of days. We \nare not debating a patients' bill of rights. We had a heck of a time \ntrying to get a debate on minimum wage for the whole session--trying to \nmake a difference for consumers. We haven't got time to do prescription \ndrugs--no way, too difficult, too complex. But we have all the time in \nthe world to debate this particular legislation that is looking out \nafter the credit card companies.\n  That gives you some idea about what the Republican leadership's \npriorities are here in the Senate.\n  We will have a chance later on to talk about the minimum wage. We \nhave gone ahead and voted ourselves a $4,600 pay increase this year and \nwe still won't vote a pay increase of 50 cents next year for men and \nwomen who are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder.\n  What is this, Mr. President? We have to ask ourselves, Why?\n  I can tell you, Mr. President. These issues ought to be addressed. A \nnumber of our colleagues have offered amendments to try to address some \nof these issues. It is going to take a lot of doing to try to make the \ndifference. We are talking about real people.\n  Take for example, Mr. and Mrs. M who live in the suburban community \nof East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. Although Mr. M. makes about $60,000 \nper year, the family suffered when Mrs. M lost her job, and the \nhousehold income dropped by $15,000. Since then, the family has \nstruggled to make ends meet. The $14,775 loan for their 1996 Toyota and \nthe $1,520 monthly mortgage payment that once seemed reasonable became \ndifficult to meet.\n  Even after cutting recreation expenses to zero, the family's expenses \nexceed their income by several hundred dollars a month. They fell \nbehind on their credit card payments, which they had hoped to resume \npaying when Mrs. M started working again. The balance they owed to \ntheir credit card company ballooned to $27,500. The balance increased \nby $600 to $800 each month in finance charges and penalties. Mr. and \nMrs. M saw no alternative to filing for relief under the bankruptcy \nlaws. Their discharge in bankruptcy gave them a fresh start. They will \ncontinue to struggle to make ends meet, but they have relief from the \npressures of harassing calls from collection agents and mounting debts \nthey had no hope of paying.\n  If this bill--S. 625--had been law, they would have had no such \nrelief. The means test--which uses IRS expense standards to calculate \nliving expenses and ability to repay debts--would probably force them \nout of the bankruptcy system, completely.\n  Longmeadow is in Hampden County, where the IRS housing and utility \nallowance for a family of four is $1,235 a month. Although the family's \nmortgage and monthly utility expenses exceed this amount, it would not \nmatter. Under this bill, they would face a statutory presumption that \ntheir case is abusive. The arbitrary means test--not the reality of \ntheir plight--dictates that Mr. and Mrs. M can afford to file a Chapter \n13 debt repayment plan, and it is highly unlikely that the family has \nany ``special circumstances'' that would allow a judge to find \ndifferently.\n  They will be selling their home, possibly all their assets.\n  This is unduly harsh. It should not pass in its current form. I will \nwork with a number of our colleagues to address many of these serious \nabuses, without which it should not become law.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we are on legislation we started \nThursday night. We had discussion this Friday, although we had no votes \non any amendments to the bankruptcy reform bill. I hope we can move \nforward with this legislation and get it passed before we adjourn.\n  This is the same piece of legislation that passed the Senate by a 97-\n1 vote in 1998. It was conferenced with the House. The conference \ncommittee report passed the House of Representatives by a very wide \nmargin. The bill came to the Senate in the last 3 or 4 days of the \nsession with a threat of long debates and filibusters against the \nconference report. Consequently, a bill that passed 97-1, probably \ncoming out of the conference more favorable to the point of view of \nthose who still had some questions about it. Yet a lot of those Members \ndid not want that bill to go to final passage. Therefore, the last \nCongress ended with the bankruptcy conference report not passing.\n  We started over again in the new Congress. Since the first of the \nyear, Senator Torricelli of New Jersey and I have been working on this \nlegislation to bring our colleagues a bipartisan approach to bankruptcy \nreform that we hope will end the situation of some people who have the \nability to repay some debt getting off scot-free. We think this \nlegislation is a big step in that direction.\n  In my earlier statements on the Senate floor on Thursday and Friday, \nI alluded to the role that overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers play in \nthe current crisis of our bankruptcy system. Although I cannot \nstatistically support it, when I refer to the role of overly aggressive \nbankruptcy lawyers I really think, in my heart, we are talking about a \nvery small minority of bankruptcy lawyers. Still, there are those who \nplay a role in people going into bankruptcy who I do not think the \nbankruptcy laws were ever intended to help, or, in any case, harming \npeople who have a debt owed to them which is not paid.\n  One of the major problems with the bankruptcy system is the mind-set \nof some of the lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy. Many lawyers today \nview bankruptcy simply as an opportunity to make money for themselves \nwith a minimal amount of effort. And this profit motive causes \nbankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy even when a financially \ntroubled client has the obvious ability to repay his or her debts. As \none of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the \nCommission's 1997 report, many who make their living off of the\n\n[[Page S14248]]\n\nbankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy has a moral \ndimension. Bankruptcy lawyers shouldn't counsel someone to walk away \nfrom his or her debts without pointing out the moral consequences of \nmaking a promise to pay and then breaking that promise. As I have said \nbefore, it cannot be good for the moral foundation of our nation if \npeople learn that it is okay just to walk away and not pay your bills \nbecause that's easier and more convenient, and obviously better for \nsomebody's pocketbook.\n  All across America some of the more unsavory bankruptcy lawyers have \ncreated high-volume law offices that herd people into bankruptcy as if \nthey were cattle instead of individual human beings in need of advice \nand counseling. These offices are known as bankruptcy mills. These \nbankruptcy mills are nothing more than large scale processing centers \nfor bankruptcy--there is little or no investigation done as to whether \nan individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a \nperson is able to at least partially repay their debts. For example, \none bankruptcy attorney from Texas was sanctioned by a bankruptcy court \nfor operating a bankruptcy mill. According to the court, this attorney \nhad very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively \nin the yellow pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising \nworked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases per month. Most \nof the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. \nThe court concluded that the attorney's services\n\n       Amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer \n     service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.\n\n  The practices of bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that \nthe Federal Trade Commission went so far as to issue a consumer alert \nwarning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation.\n  I refer you to this Federal Trade Commission Consumer News Bulletin, \nright here on this chart. It refers to a question,\n\n       Debt Got You Down? You are not alone. Consumer debt is at \n     an all-time high. What's more, record numbers of consumers--\n     more than 1 million in 1996--are filing for bankruptcy. \n     Whether your debt dilemma is the result of an illness, \n     unemployment, or simply overspending, it can seem \n     overwhelming. In your effort to get solvent, be on the alert \n     for advertisements that offer seemingly quick fixes. While \n     the ads pitch the promise of debt relief, they rarely say \n     relief may be spelled b-a-n-k-r-u-p-t-c-y. And, although \n     bankruptcy is one option to deal with financial problems, \n     it's generally considered the option of last resort. The \n     reason: Its long-term negative impact on your \n     creditworthiness. A bankruptcy stays on your credit report \n     for 10 years, and can hinder your ability to get credit, a \n     job, insurance, or even a place to live.\n\n  I think that there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy \nlawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling \nand help with setting up a budget, but who do not need to declare \nbankruptcy. It is not surprising, Mr. President, that bankruptcy \nlawyers are leading the charge against bankruptcy reform.\n  Now, we have heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about \nprotecting child support and alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. I \nwant to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that \nthey can help deadbeat dads get out of paying their child support and \nother marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a \nbook entitled ``Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy.'' Some \nthings about that book are displayed on this chart.\n  I think that it is outrageous that bankruptcy lawyers are helping \ndeadbeats to cheat divorced spouses out of alimony and to cheat \nchildren out of child support. This is a recipe for promoting poverty \nand human misery. Those who are concerned about protecting child \nsupport should join with me in condemning this sort of amoral conduct. \nBankruptcy was never designed for the purpose of helping deadbeat \nspouses escape their financial obligations. Not only are the current \npractices of bankruptcy lawyers a disservice to their clients, they \nalso cheat society as a whole.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent to have printed in the Congressional \nRecord an article from the Los Angeles Times dated August 12, 1998.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     2.5% Rise in Personal Filings Pushes Bankruptcies to New High\n\n                  [From Times Staff and Wire Reports]\n\n       Total bankruptcies nationwide hit a record high in the \n     second quarter, apparently boosted by a flurry of personal \n     filings by people who fear imminent changes in the bankruptcy \n     law.\n       Business bankruptcies continued to decline, but personal \n     bankruptcies, which account for 97% of the filings, edged up \n     2.5% from the second quarter a year earlier. That pushed the \n     total number of bankruptcy filings to 373,460 in April, May \n     and June, surpassing by nearly 2% the previous high posted in \n     the second quarter of 1997, federal court officials said this \n     week. California's figures mirrored the nationwide trend.\n       Although a 2% rise is not large, given the steady and \n     previously sharper increases in bankruptcies in recent years, \n     analysts were still surprised by the continuing uptick in \n     personal filings. The economy remains relatively strong and \n     consumer delinquencies in general have come down in recent \n     quarters while some lenders have tightened their credit \n     standards.\n       But bankruptcy attorneys and other experts said some \n     consumers were being prompted by pending bankruptcy reform \n     legislation, which could take effect as early as the fall and \n     is expected to make it tougher for consumers to extinguish \n     their debts.\n       Indeed, attorneys are advising their clients that they may \n     want to take advantage of the current law while it is still \n     available.\n       ``I'm telling clients that it might very well end up being \n     harder to file for bankruptcy,'' said Joseph Weber, a \n     bankruptcy lawyer in Costa Mesa. Weber added that he also \n     thinks a ``false optimism'' is adding to the number of \n     bankruptcy petitions. ``When they perceive the economy to be \n     better, some spend beyond their means,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. In this article, bankruptcy lawyers are advised to send \nout letters to anyone who has visited them recently asking about \nbankruptcy. This form letter encourages people to declare bankruptcy \nbecause, if Congress passes bankruptcy reform, ``Bankruptcy will be \nmuch more difficult, more expensive, and probably embarrassing.'' I \nhope this bill makes bankruptcy more embarrassing and more difficult. \nOpinion polls clearly show that the American people want those who \nvoluntarily incur debts to pay those debts as agreed. Bankruptcy should \nbe difficult, and the moral stigma that used to be associated with \nbankruptcy should be resurrected.\n  I have reviewed the conduct of bankruptcy mills and bankruptcy \nlawyers to illustrate the need for Congress to hold bankruptcy lawyers \naccountable for unethical and dishonest conduct. In the bill before us, \nwe have tried to do this by codifying rule 11 penalties for lawyers who \nneedlessly steer people into the bankruptcy system. It's my hope that \nthese penalties will cause lawyers to think twice before they willy-\nnilly cart off their clients to bankruptcy court without asking a few \nquestions first. I would have preferred tougher penalties, as we had in \nlast year's Senate Bill, But I understand that many on the other side \nof the aisle strongly object to tougher penalties. So, in an effort to \nwork with the other side, this year's penalties aren't as tough as they \nwere last year.\n  As I've said many times, the bankruptcy crisis is partly a moral \ncrisis. And bankruptcy lawyers who push bankruptcy play the role of \ncarnival barkers who promise an easy way out to anyone who will listen.\n  As it stands now, this bankruptcy reform bill, S. 625, merely \nrequires attorneys to investigate the financial resources of their \nclients before putting them into bankruptcy. That is not too much to \nask and, it seems to me, something basic when advising people according \nto the tenets of the legal profession.\n  Our bankruptcy system needs to be reformed in a balanced way. We need \nto address abuses by debtors who do not need bankruptcy. We need to \naddress abuses by creditors who use coercive and deceptive practices to \ncheat honest debtors. And we need to address abuses by bankruptcy \nlawyers who exploit bankruptcy laws for financial gain.\n  As I said before, I prefer tougher penalties against bankruptcy \nlawyers, but this bill is a step in the direction of addressing the \nproblems of fast-talking bankruptcy lawyers.\n  Does the Senator from Minnesota seek the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I know we are going to start on the \nminimum wage amendment. May I have 1 minute to call up two amendments \nand then lay them aside?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes. I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S14249]]\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2537 and 2538\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendments Nos. 2537 and \n2538.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The amendments are set aside. The Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, raising the minimum wage is critical to \npreventing the economic free fall that often leads to bankruptcy. Many \nof us have sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999 to begin to \nright that wrong.\n  Amending the bankruptcy bill to increase the minimum wage will help \nmany of the people this so-called bankruptcy ``reform'' is likely to \nhurt--low income families, minorities and women. For many low income \nworkers, the struggle to make ends meet is too difficult, and they find \nthemselves facing bankruptcy. Raising the minimum wage will help many \nof these hardworking individuals and families recover from the \nfinancial crises that drove them into bankruptcy.\n  For nearly two-thirds of the families that file for bankruptcy, a job \ncrisis led to their downfall. Many of those families faced a job loss. \nA Bureau of Labor Statistics study reported that only about a quarter \nof displaced workers had found a new job at the same or better pay as \nthe job they lost. A third of displaced workers were still looking for \nwork. Nearly half of the displaced workers had to settle for work at \nmuch lower salaries--an average 20% pay cut for those lucky enough to \nfind full time jobs, and a much steeper cut for those who took part-\ntime work.\n  Large numbers of women who will suffer under this bill will benefit \nfrom a minimum wage increase. Divorced women are four times more likely \nto file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. Often, they \nare forced into bankruptcy because they are owed child support or \nalimony. Divorced women trying to raise children face a daunting \nchallenge to provide for their families. This bill will make it harder \nto meet that challenge. But raising the minimum wage will help almost \nseven million women, many of them struggling to maintain their \nfamilies.\n  African American and Hispanic families disproportionately face the \nthreat of bankruptcy and the repercussions of a low minimum wage. They \nare six times more likely than other Americans to seek bankruptcy \nprotection, and they will be disproportionately harmed by this \nbankruptcy bill. But they also comprise one-third of those who will \nbenefit from an increase in the minimum wage. This amendment will help \nmore African American and Hispanic families meet their families' needs.\n  Low income families struggling to meet their obligations often find \nthemselves facing bankruptcy. Some argue that the rise in bankruptcy \nfilings is due to a lack of responsibility. But too often the problem \nis a matter of basic household economics. Families going into \nbankruptcy have less income than most Americans. A raise in the minimum \nwage will give them the economic boost they need to avoid bankruptcy.\n  Our proposal will give these low income wage earners the pay raise \nthey need and deserve to care more effectively for their families--to \nbuy the food and clothing, and health care they need, without going \ninto debt.\n  Recently, members of Congress voted to raise their own pay by \n$4,600--but not the pay of minimum wage workers. Republican Senators \ndon't blink about giving themselves an increase. How can they possibly \ndeny a fair increase for minimum wage workers?\n  In fact, the Republican leadership has gone to extraordinary lengths \nto block action by Congress on a pay raise for the hard-working \nAmericans who work at the minimum wage.\n  But it is time--long past time--to raise the minimum wage. Too many \nhard-working Americans struggling to keep their families afloat and \ntheir dignity intact can't make enough in a 40 hour week to lift their \nfamilies out of poverty--and that's wrong. The percentage of poor who \nare full-time year-round workers was 12.6% in 1998--higher than any \ntime in the last 20 years, according to a new report from the Census \nBureau.\n  Our minimum wage amendment is a modest proposal-- a one dollar \nincrease in two installments--50 cents next January, and 50 cents the \nfollowing year. Over 11 million American workers will benefit.\n  At $6.15 an hour, working full-time, a minimum wage worker would earn \n$12,800 a year under this amendment--an increase of over $2,000 a year.\n  That additional $2,000 will pay for seven months of groceries to feed \nthe average family. It will pay the rent for five months. It will pay \nfor almost ten months of utilities. It will cover a year and a half of \ntuition and fees at a two-year college, and provide greater \nopportunities for those struggling at the minimum wage to obtain the \nskills needed to obtain better jobs.\n  The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the \nlowest unemployment rate in three decades. Under the leadership of \nPresident Clinton, our economy is strong. Enterprise\n\n[[Page S14250]]\n\nand entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating unprecedented economic \ngrowth, with impressive efficiencies and significant job creation. The \nstock market has soared. Inflation is low, and interest rates are low. \nWe are witnessing the strongest peace-time growth in our history.\n  The country as a whole is enjoying an unprecedented period of growth \nand prosperity. But for millions of Americans it is someone else's \nprosperity. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a person earning \nthe minimum wage would earn only $10,700--almost $3,200 below the \npoverty guidelines for a family of three.\n  Each day we fail to raise the minimum wage, families across the \ncountry continue to fall farther behind. One fact says it all--the \nminimum wage would have to be $7.49 an hour today, instead of the \ncurrent level of $5.15, to have the same purchasing power it had in \n1968. That disparity shows how far we have fallen short in the past \ngeneration in guaranteeing that low income workers receive their fair \nshare of the nation's prosperity.\n  The Republican proposal to raise the minimum wage by one dollar over \nthree years beginning on March 1, 2000, is a cruel hoax on the lowest \npaid American workers. Our Democratic plan to increase the minimum wage \nby 50 cents on January 1, 2000 and another 50 cents on January 1, 2001, \nwould put almost $1,200 more than the Republican proposal into the \nhands of the hard-working women and men who work at the minimum wage.\n  The Republican proposal is an insult to low wage workers. In addition \nto robbing workers of over $1,200, it effectively repeals the overtime \npay law that has guaranteed time-and-a-half overtime pay for over 60 \nyears. The so-called ``bonus'' provision of the Republican proposal \njeopardizes the overtime pay of 73 million Americans by eliminating the \nrequirement that bonuses, commissions, and other similar forms of \ncompensation be included in a worker's regular pay for purposes of \ncalculating overtime pay. As the United States Supreme Court said in \ninterpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act, exclusion of bonuses from \novertime pay will ``nullify all the purposes for which the [Act] was \ncreated.''\n  The Republican proposal is just one more part of an ongoing assault \non low wage workers that includes balancing the budget on the backs of \nthe working poor; cutting workers' pay through the compensatory time \nbill; providing pensions for the wealthy but not for working families; \nblocking workers' right to organize; and undermining worker safety and \nhealth.\n  Shame on those who want to lavish over $75 billion in tax breaks on \nbusiness, while cutting this modest pay raise for low income workers. \nRepublicans are more interested in providing tax breaks for the rich \nthan in fairly compensating minimum wage workers. When Congress has \njust voted to raise its own pay, it is hypocritical and irresponsible \nto deny fair pay for the country's lowest paid workers.\n  As the Washington Post said last week: ``The minimum wage should be \nincreased, and the increase should not become a political football. . . \n. The price of a bill to help the working poor ought not be an \nindiscriminate tax cut for those at the very top of the economic \nmountain.''\n  Our legislation does contain a fiscally responsible package of small \nbusiness tax provisions which would cost approximately $11.5 billion \nover the next five years. Those provisions have been designed to \nprovide financial assistance to the small businesses which will be \npaying the higher minimum wage to their employees. The cost of these \ntax benefits is fully paid for.\n  Unlike the Republican proposals, this bill will not draw down the \nsurplus. It will not jeopardize our ability to use the surplus to \nstrengthen Medicare and Social Security for the future. Our tax \nproposal contains provisions which will benefit both employers and \nemployees. It provides a tax credit for worksite child care facilities, \na tax credit to encourage small businesses to offer employee pensions, \nand a tax credit for companies that provide high tech training to their \nemployees. It also encourages the creation of new jobs for those who \nare currently outside the workforce by extending the work opportunity \ntax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit, and by establishing tax \nincentives for ``new market'' community development.\n\n  In addition, our package accelerates the deductibility of health \ninsurance premiums for self-employed workers. It excludes educational \nbenefits provided for employees' children from taxation, and it helps \nworkers save for their retirement.\n  These are the types of tax provisions that Congress should be \nenacting. They are tax cuts which will benefit a broad spectrum of \nbusinesses and workers and strengthen the economy. They are not tax \nbreaks which only further enrich an already privileged few.\n  This debate should be about the real financial needs of low income \nworkers and small businesses. A modest increase in the minimum wage \nshould not be held hostage to the desire for extravagant new tax breaks \nfor those who are already the most economically privileged. It makes \nsense to provide fiscally responsible tax assistance to small \nbusinesses and their employees. All the tax cuts we are proposing are \nfully paid for and carefully targeted to meet genuine needs. It is \nappropriate to enact them as part of our legislation to raise the \nminimum wage.\n  Finally, raising the minimum wage is far more than a labor issue. \nRaising the minimum wage is a women's issue. Almost 60 percent of \nminimum wage workers are women. 7 million women across the nation--\n12.6% of all working women--would benefit from this increase.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a children's issue. Over two million \nmarried couples and almost a million mothers would receive a pay raise \nas a result of our increase. Eighty-five percent of these single \nmothers have total household incomes below $25,000 a year.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a civil rights issue. Over two million \nHispanic workers and almost as many African American workers will \nreceive a raise. Together, they make up one-third of those who will \nbenefit from the increase.\n  Raising the minimum wage is a family issue. The average minimum wage \nworker brings home half the family earnings. Half the benefits of our \none dollar increase will go to households earning less than $25,000 a \nyear. Parents need this raise so they can provide their children with \nfood, clothes, and a decent place to live.\n  Some of our colleagues who oppose the minimum wage still believe the \ndire ``sky is falling'' predictions of economic disaster that were \nraised before we voted to raise the minimum wage in 1996. None of those \npredictions came true. Since the last increase enacted by Congress, the \neconomy has created new jobs at a rate of over 235,000 a month. Job \ncreation in the sectors most affected by the minimum wage is up too--\nwith almost 1.2 million new jobs in the retail sector, and 400,000 new \njobs in restaurants. Employment is up--and the unemployment rate is \ndown--among teenagers, African Americans, Hispanics, and women.\n  As Business Week magazine has stated,\n\n       [H]igher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. \n     Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, minimum \n     wages raise income, not unemployment. . . . A higher minimum \n     wage can be an engine for upward mobility. When employees \n     become more valuable, employers tend to boost training and \n     install equipment to make them more productive. Higher wages \n     at the bottom often lead to better education for both workers \n     and their children. . . . It is it time to set aside old \n     assumptions about the minimum wage.\n\n  It is time to raise the federal minimum wage. No one who works for a \nliving should have to live in poverty. I urge my colleagues to join me \nin raising the minimum wage.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2751\n\n(Purpose: To amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to increase the \n                         Federal minimum wage)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2751.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2751.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield whatever time the leader desires. I understand \nwe have a time agreement; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are going to be 2 hours evenly divided.\n\n[[Page S14251]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. May I inquire again, what is the time agreement? I \nunderstand there are going to be two amendments--one offered by Senator \nDaschle and one offered by Senator Nickles or Senator Lott. We were \ngoing to debate both of those this afternoon and vote on them tomorrow. \nCan the Chair tell me how much time we are allocated this afternoon to \ndebate the two amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 2 hours of time evenly divided \non each of those two amendments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. For this afternoon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, for this afternoon.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield whatever time the leader wants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I appreciate the clarification. That \nwas the understanding. So there is no confusion, we now have 4 hours of \ndebate on the two amendments.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to come to the floor at this point to \ntalk about the amendment offered on behalf of our colleagues, but \nreally on behalf of the 11 million Americans who will benefit from this \nminimum wage once it is passed into law.\n  I thank especially Senator Kennedy for his extraordinary leadership \nand persistence in making sure this issue was addressed prior to the \nend of the first session of this Congress. Were it not for his \ndedication and extraordinary efforts, we would not be here this \nafternoon.\n  I also thank Senators Robb and Baucus for the leadership they have \nprovided, and I thank many of our colleagues for their strong support \nfor this legislation.\n  We fought all year long to bring this amendment to the floor because \nlow-income working families need and deserve a raise. The average \nAmerican family now works an additional 265 hours a year just to \nmaintain the same standard of living they had at the beginning of this \ndecade. That is an additional 6 weeks a year. We believe it is time \nparents could be spending attending parent-teacher conferences or \nplaying with their children or maybe just reading Harry Potter with \nthem. It is time husbands and wives could be talking with each other. \nIt is not enough just to talk about family values, we need to show by \nour actions that we value families. We need to raise the minimum wage, \nand we need to do it this year--now.\n  I recently met a young father in South Dakota who told me that he and \nhis wife eat only one meal a week together, and that is on Sundays \nafter church. The rest of the week, his work schedule keeps him away \nfrom his family because he has more than one job.\n  He is one of many workers in this Nation who are working three jobs, \ntwo of them at minimum wage, just to make ends meet. We can do better \nthan that. In this economy, we must do better than that. We are in the \nlongest, strongest period of economic recovery in our Nation's history. \nThe stock market and worker productivity are both at record highs.\n  It has been 3 years since the last time we increased the minimum \nwage, and if we do not pass another increase now, by the end of this \nmonth the purchasing power of the minimum wage will have fallen to the \nlowest point it has been in 40 years. The real value of the minimum \nwage is now at almost $2.50 below what it was in 1968--$2.50 an hour.\n  We are proposing we raise the minimum wage, not by the $2.50 required \nto get back to the parity level of 1968, but $1 an hour over 2 years. \nThat is as modest a proposal as anyone can propose. Under it, the \nminimum-wage worker who now works full time would earn only $12,792 a \nyear, but it would be $2,000 more than he or she now earns.\n  After doing all they could for as long as they could to block any \nincrease in the minimum wage, now our Republican colleagues have their \nown proposal. They will raise the minimum wage, but they are saying to \nworking families: ``We are not going to let you have it in 2 years. We \nknow now you will only be making $12,792, but we want you to wait 3 \nyears for your raise. But we are for family values, we are for helping \npeople get ahead.''\n  They want to believe there is not a dime's worth of difference \nbetween their plan and our plan. That is not so. There are at least \nthree major differences.\n  First, this 3-year delay is going to cost a typical working family \n$1,200 over 3 years. That is what that delay costs. I know around here \nthat does not sound like a lot of money, but to a family trying to \nscrape by on minimum wage, it is 10 percent of a year's income; $1,200 \na year is 3 months' worth of rent. It is 4 months' worth of groceries; \nit is 6 months' worth of utilities; and it is 1 year in tuition and \nfees at a 2-year college.\n\n  So there is a big difference. Do not let anybody say that simply \nwaiting another year for that full dollar benefit is a minor matter. We \nare talking rent; we are talking utilities; we are talking groceries. \nIt is whether or not in some cases families are going to have two or \nthree meals a week together or whether that one meal on Sunday will \nhave to do.\n  The second difference between our proposal and the Republican \nproposal has to do with the tax cuts. We offer tax cuts. I really do \nnot think there is any connection, frankly, between the minimum wage \nand the need for tax cuts. Each ought to be considered in their own \nright.\n  I am troubled a little bit about this tendency to want to marry tax \ncuts into something that is important to do in its own right. But I do \nunderstand the importance of providing meaningful tax relief targeted \nto small businesses. I am for that. And our caucus, and I hope the \nSenate, is for that.\n  We offer a tax cut package that will cost $28.5 billion over 10 \nyears. But the tax breaks the Republican plan entails would cost $75 \nbillion--over twice as much. It is not just the cost that worries me, \nit is the fact that the Republican tax cuts are not paid for.\n  We have heard all of this railing about Social Security trust funds. \nBut the Republicans do not seem to be too concerned about Social \nSecurity when it comes to this tax cut. While they pay for the first \nyear, there is absolutely no money for the tax cuts the second through \nthe 10th years. What that means is that it is going to have to come out \nof education, other priorities, or even Social Security.\n  The third difference between our tax cuts and the Republicans' is \nthis: Our tax cuts target small businesses and family farms. The \nRepublican tax breaks overwhelmingly benefit those in the top end of \nthe income strata.\n  A minimum wage increase ought to be able to pass, as I said a moment \nago, on its own merits. If we are going to include tax cuts, they ought \nto reduce the impact, as marginal as it is, of a minimum wage increase \non the businesses that will be most affected by it. The Republican \nproposal fails this basic test of fairness, relevance, and fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  How would the Democratic tax cuts help small businesses and family \nfarms?\n  First, we lower the cost to small businesses of making investments by \nraising to $25,000 the amount of an investment a business can write off \nimmediately. If you make a $25,000 investment, you can write it off in \nthe first year and you do not have to wait. That is one way to help \nsmall businesses.\n  They tell me time and again we have to encourage them to reinvest and \nto put more money back into their businesses. There is no better way to \ndo that than to say: make an investment and you can expense it \nimmediately. We do that.\n  Second, we provide a tax cut of up to $4,000 to cover startup costs \nof adopting a pension plan so more small businesses can offer their \nworkers pensions. This not only helps businesses, it helps the workers, \nand it helps businesses attract good workers and increases workers' \nretirement security. It is a win-win.\n  In this day and age, what business people tell me all through South \nDakota, as they are attempting to compete for a very limited workforce, \nis that there has to be an incentive to be able to recruit and then \nultimately to retain good people. There is nothing more important in \nretaining good people than ensuring that in the long term they are not \nonly going to have a good income but they are going to have a good \nretirement. This package does it.\n  Third, we accelerate the full deductibility of health insurance for \nthe self-employed. We have already provided full deductibility, and now \nwe move it up. We more rapidly incorporate full\n\n[[Page S14252]]\n\ndeductibility, so that every small business can benefit in providing \nhealth insurance in those cases when they are self-employed.\n\n  Fourth, our proposal raises the special estate tax exemption for \nfamily-owned small businesses and farms by $450,000.\n  Fifth, we make it easier for farm cooperatives to raise capital.\n  Finally, and very importantly, we provide tax relief to farmers who \nare experiencing losses during the current crisis.\n  That is how our tax cuts help small businesses and family farms.\n  But our proposal also contains tax cuts to help low-income workers. \nWe extend the successful work opportunity and the welfare-to-work tax \ncredits for 5 years. We increase tax incentives for entrepreneurs to \ninvest in empowerment zones. First-round empowerment zones have shown \nthat wage tax credits are a valuable economic development tool.\n  Currently, there are no wage tax credits available for round 2 zones. \nBy making these tax credits available, by building on what we know \nworks, we can bring new jobs and opportunities to places such as the \nPine Ridge Reservation empowerment zone in South Dakota and other \ncommunities that desperately need opportunities like it.\n  We also include in our plan the President's new markets tax credit to \nhelp people in communities that have so far not shared in the country's \nrecord economic prosperity. The new markets tax credit will encourage \nprivate capital to flow into equity investments in businesses in these \nareas. Bipartisan support for this proposal is growing, and it is \nextremely fitting to include it in a proposal to raise the minimum \nwage.\n  Our tax cut is smart; it is strategic; and I emphasize, it is paid \nfor. I especially commend Senators Robb and Baucus for their efforts in \nhelping to develop it. As members of the Senate Finance Committee, they \nhave done an outstanding job of ensuring that as we look at the array \nof tax tools that would be helpful to workers and small businesses, we \nput the tightest, most targeted, most focused package together. And \nthey have done it in this amendment.\n  The third difference between our minimum wage plan and the one our \ncolleagues are offering is simply this: The President will sign our \nplan. The Republican proposal is absolutely dead on arrival.\n  Now, we know we will hear dire warnings from some of our colleagues \non the other side. They will say raising the minimum wage will actually \nhurt low-income workers because employers will be forced to cut \nminimum-wage jobs.\n  We now know that is nonsense. We have study after study that proves \nraising the minimum wage does not kill jobs at all. In fact, since the \nlast time we raised the minimum wage--in 1996--American employers have \ncreated nearly 9 million new jobs. In my State, 17,000 new jobs have \nbeen created. The national unemployment rate has fallen from 5.2 \npercent to just over 4 percent--the lowest jobless rate in 30 years. \nEven the Wall Street Journal and Business Week now say the 1996 \npredictions about job losses were wrong.\n  Another argument we will surely hear from our friends in the other \nparty is that increasing the minimum wage has nothing to do with \nincreasing family incomes. They will argue that most minimum-wage \nworkers are teenagers who are working part time to pay for cars and CD \nplayers.\n  Again, the facts show otherwise. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, 70 percent of all minimum-wage workers are 20 years old or \nolder; nearly 60 percent are women; and 40 percent are sole \nbreadwinners in their families.\n  Our economy is the strongest it has been in my lifetime. But behind \nthe prosperity, there are still far too many families who are working \ntoo hard, too long, for too little pay.\n\n  In South Dakota, while many families are moving ahead, too many \nothers are being left behind, creating, in effect, two South Dakotas. \nOn the surface, South Dakota is fortunate. Our unemployment rate is 2.6 \npercent, one of the lowest in the Nation. But in some of our counties, \nunemployment is as high as 7 percent. South Dakota is also the home to \nthe poorest community in America, the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.\n  There are good people--hard-working people--all across this country, \nwho are struggling to make ends meet on minimum-wage jobs. They need a \nraise. And they are not alone. That is why religious leaders around the \ncountry today are urging us to raise the minimum wage.\n  It is critical that we not miss this opportunity. A job isn't just a \nsource of income; it ought to be a source of pride. The U.S. Catholic \nConference tells us the minimum wage should reflect principles of human \ndignity and economic justice. Unfortunately, today's minimum wage does \nnot do that.\n  I want to read something that I think probably puts it in perspective \nquite well. This is a quote that is not one of mine, and not one of \nSenator Kennedy's. It is a quote made by former majority leader Bob \nDole the last time the Congress voted to raise the minimum wage in \n1996. Bob Dole said at the time: ``I never thought the Republican Party \nwould stand for squeezing every nickel out of the minimum wage.''\n  He was right then. If he were on the floor today, he would be right \nnow. If we don't pass a minimum wage increase by the end of next month, \nmore inflation will have wiped out the entire increase he was referring \nto in 1996. We cannot allow that to happen. It is time we stopped \nsqueezing every last nickel out of the minimum wage. It is time to \nraise the minimum wage the right way, $1 an hour over 2 years, with \nresponsible targeted tax cuts to help small business owners and family \nfarmers, not an unpaid-for tax windfall for all those who need it the \nleast.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I \nhave just consumed be taken from my leader time for today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it has taken us a long time during this \nCongress to have the opportunity to present a legislative proposal to \nthe Senate that would provide an increase in the minimum wage for \nAmerica's workers who are working on the lower rung of the economic \nladder: 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year.\n  We have tried to bring this before the Senate over the year in a \nnumber of different forms and shapes. We were unable to do so. Now we \nhave the opportunity to debate it this afternoon and to vote on it \ntomorrow. Hopefully, we will have success in passing it.\n  It is very clear that its outcome is uncertain because of the fact \nthat, rather than having a chance to vote on a freestanding piece of \nlegislation that would be considered freely and then considered by the \nHouse, passed on to the Senate, this will be wrapped into other \nextremely controversial legislation. But we are doing the best that we \ncan. We want to give assurances to those Americans who are working at \nthe minimum wage that we are going to continue this battle, as we have \nover these past years. We are going to continue the battle next year at \neach and every opportunity, until we have the chance to pass meaningful \nminimum wage legislation. So there should be no doubt in anyone's mind \nthat this somehow is going to conclude the debate.\n  American workers are entitled to an increase in the minimum wage. We \nare prepared to make their cases. I am absolutely convinced we will be \nsuccessful.\n  It is unfortunate we have to try and convince our colleagues on the \nother side on the basis of the merits of this case, but I think it is \nimportant that we, in a preliminary way, address some of the reasons \nthat have been raised\n\n[[Page S14253]]\n\nhistorically against the minimum wage.\n  First of all, let's look at where we are on the issue of the minimum \nwage. This chart reflects where the minimum wage has been since 1967-\n1968. These are real dollars. We see that if the minimum wage today was \ngoing to have the purchasing power it had in 1968, it would be $7.49, \nnot $5.15 an hour. It would be about $2.30 higher than where it is \ntoday. What we have seen is a gradual decline of the purchasing power \nof the minimum wage. This is so despite the fact that we now have the \ngreatest economic prosperity in the history of the country--more \nAmericans employed, the greatest stock market, lowest interest rates, \nlowest rates of inflation, lowest unemployment, highest rate of \nemployment in the history of the country. Nonetheless, for those \nindividuals who are at the lower end of the economic ladder, they are \nslipping further and further and further behind.\n  If our amendment does not pass, the purchasing power of the minimum \nwage will continue to decline--to the lowest minimum wage almost in the \nhistory of the country. Every day that we delay, minimum-wage workers \nfall further behind. If we don't raise the minimum wage by the end of \nthis year, it will lose all of the value of the last increase in 1996. \nThis is where we are.\n  Now, what are we talking about in scope in terms of the minimum wage? \nHow large an increase are we talking about? And what will be its impact \nin terms of our total economy? Increasing the minimum wage by a dollar \nis vital to workers, but it is a drop in the bucket of the national \npayroll.\n  If you combine their wages and salaries, all Americans earn $4.2 \ntrillion a year. An increase of $1 in the minimum wage would amount to \none-fifth of 1 percent in terms of total wages over the country. We \nshould not even hear the argument--and I hope we won't--that this \neffort to raise the minimum wage is somehow going to be inflationary. \nWe are talking about one-fifth of 1 percent of total wages for those \nwho are working 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year. In a moment, I will \ncome to that. More of them are working 50 hours a week, trying to play \nby the rules, trying to bring up a family and they are still coming up \nshort.\n  This is what is happening. We are finding out that those who are on \nthe bottom rung of the economic ladder are working hard but still in \npoverty. The annual minimum wage is not even keeping up with the \npoverty line. We are finding more and more workers who are affected by \nthis.\n\n  Then, finally, on this phase of the debate, I want to point out the \nemployment figures. We find that we have seen, since the increase in \nthe minimum wage that we passed in 1996 and 1997, there has still been \nan increase in job growth. This chart shows the increase in 1996, up to \n$4.75, and then to $5.15. Even with these increases we see new jobs \nbeing created and strong economic growth.\n  All of those on the other side of the aisle who made the predictions \nthat we are going to lose 300,000 to 400,000 jobs if we pass an \nincrease in the minimum wage were wrong. To the contrary, we have seen \nan expansion of job opportunities. Since the last increase was enacted \nby Congress, the economy has created new jobs at a rate of 235,000 a \nmonth. That addresses, I hope, the economic reasons for not having an \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  Let's take a moment and think about who these people are--who are the \nminimum-wage workers? This has to be enormously distressing to all \nAmericans because there is no group of Americans that is working harder \nand slipping further behind than women in our society. Almost 60 \npercent of minimum wage workers are women. 7 million women across the \nnation--12.6 percent of all working women--would benefit from this \nincrease.\n  And working fathers are being affected too. We know now that employed \nfathers with children under 18 work longer hours, averaging 50 hours a \nweek. That is well over the average work time for those tens of \nmillions of Americans who go to work at 40 hours a week, and they get \novertime. The average for fathers with children under 18 is 50 hours a \nweek. Fathers' total work time has increased by 3 hours in the past 20 \nyears, and mothers' total work time has increased by 5 hours.\n  Almost one-half, 45 percent of the workers, report having to work \novertime with little or no notice. One in five is asked to work \novertime 4 or more days a week, with little or no notice. What does \nthat mean to the families? Here they are working at minimum wage, they \nmay have one job, but they probably two jobs, trying to make ends meet, \nalready working 50 hours a week. Then they are told, without warning, \nthey have to work overtime, which may disrupt their other employment. \nWith the number of hours at each job, especially with the addition of \novertime, we are seeing increasing numbers of mothers and fathers \nforced to spend more and more time away from their children.\n  According to a 1999 Council of Economic Advisors study, families are \nsuffering. The study says that parents have, on average, experienced a \ndecrease of 22 hours per week available to spend time with their \nchildren. That is what this minimum wage is all about--parents having \nless time to spend with their children. I hope we are not going to hear \na lot of speeches out here about the importance of family values by \nthose who vote against this increase. Twenty-two hours per week less--\nthat is what is available for parents to spend time with their \nchildren. A decrease has happened and if we really care about families \nwe need to change that.\n  Another factor, in addition to parents having less time to spend with \ntheir children, is the increasing shift work. Shift work is growing \nfastest in the service sector, which is heavily reliant on women \nworkers. According to the study by Harriet Presser at the University of \nMaryland, 70 percent of the fastest growing occupations in the United \nStates have a disproportionate number of female employees and require \nmore than 40 percent of their workers to put in nonstandard hours.\n  Here we are finding out about who is being targeted. It is women. And \nfor what? Nonstandard hours and overtime. At a crucial point in their \nlives when they are trying to bring up children and be there for them, \nwe find out they are working harder, working longer, and they are \nmaking less. Two-thirds of the workers would like to work fewer hours--\nalmost 20 percent more than 5 years ago. But most of those workers \nbelieve they can't cut back on hours because they need the money--46 \npercent. These 20 percent of workers, might be able to work fewer hours \nif the minimum wage were increased.\n  Another recent study, ``Working Hard, But Staying Poor,'' notes that \nworking poor are predominantly hourly employees, and 71 percent have \nlittle paid vacation; 48 percent have no paid vacation at all--none, \nnone. And 18 percent have a week or less. Madam President, 70 percent \nof those making the minimum wage have virtually no vacation, or less \nthan a week of paid vacation.\n  We can't give them an increase of 50 cents an hour? No. Even though \nwe have just voted ourselves $4,600 a year, we are not going to vote \nfor them 50 cents more an hour next year. No. This is what is happening \nto these families. This is what is happening to these fathers and \nmothers. This is what is happening to these children. And we say, oh, \nwe can afford $4,600 a year for Members of Congress and the Senate, but \nwe can't do something about mothers and fathers who are increasingly \ntaken away from their children in order to make ends meet.\n  That is what this issue is about when you come right down to it. We \nsay: Wait a minute here. Where is productivity in all of this? In the \nlast 10 years we have seen a 12-percent increase in productivity for \nworkers in the United States, but only a 1.9 percent pay increase to \nmatch. That includes the highest increases by workers in the country, \nnot the minimum wage. That is what has happened, a 1.9-percent \nincrease. We have seen a 29-percent increase in productivity since \n1973, and the minimum wage hasn't even kept up with it. What is going \non here? No unemployment, no inflation, productivity going up through \nthe roof, and we give ourselves $4,600, and Republicans oppose 50 cents \nmore an hour increase in the minimum wage.\n\n  And are Americans really working? There are no workers in the world--\nnone in the world--who are working longer and harder than American\n\n[[Page S14254]]\n\nworkers today. Japan works 54 hours less a year; the Canadians, 215; \nthe British, 221; the French, 314; the Germans, 389. Every other \nindustrial nation in the world is working less.\n  The Americans, at the lowest end, are working longer and harder \ntrying to make ends meet, with no kinds of health insurance programs, \nno paid vacations, and they are being jammed with increases in overtime \nwithout notification, and they are trying to provide for their \nchildren. What happens?\n  I will tell you what happens. Today, we have the new census figures \nthat are just out, and they are very interesting. The latest census \nfigures show that the percentage of working poor--12.6 percent--is at \nits highest point in 20 years. That's right, at a time when our country \nis so strong economically we have the highest number of working poor in \n20 years--the highest number of working poor. You can look at those \nfigures and say, well, the median income for lower income families has \ngone up. OK. I am talking about those individuals who are getting the \nminimum wage. More of them are working in poverty than at any other \ntime. More of them are working, and working for less, than at any other \ntime. More of them are falling further behind than at any other time.\n  What do we have to prove? What is there to prove? I can tell you \nthis. If you look back on the movement from welfare to work, you will \nfind that every economist virtually agrees that one of the principal \nreasons for movement from welfare to work was the increase in the \nminimum wage. About 700,000 of those moved from welfare to work because \nof the minimum wage. With this additional increase of a dollar, from \nevery estimate, from 200,000 to 300,000 more will move from welfare to \nwork. They value work. People want to work. They did when we increased \nit last time and I think they'll do it again.\n  What does it mean for the taxpayer? It is beneficial to the taxpayer. \nWhy? You will find if you pay more in the minimum wage, you have fewer \npeople who qualify for support programs. That makes sense. Fewer will \nbe qualified for food stamps, fuel assistance programs, and other kinds \nof support programs. And it will save taxpayers billions of dollars. So \nit is difficult for me to understand the opposition we are receiving.\n  In the Democratic proposal, we added a small program, but an \nimportant one, that primarily helps working families in the tax program \nin terms of pensions and some other matters. But we have, on the \nopposition--and I will come to this later when we will have some time \nto talk about our Republican friends on the other side--they say don't \ngive them a dollar in the next 2 years; they are not worth it. They are \nworth a dollar over 3 years, but we are worth $4,600 more a year. We \nare not going to spread our pay increase out, but we are going to \nspread out the increase for those at the lowest end of the economic \nladder. That is the Republican leadership position.\n  Now, the American people must wonder what in the world is going on \nwhen the Senate and House are trying to get together with the President \non this budget, and we are talking about spending Social Security, and \nwe have before us in the Senate a tax break for $75 billion over the \nnext 10 years. Where are we getting all that money? I hope they have \ngiven up this argument that, ``Well, look out for the Democrats because \nthey are going to spend Social Security.'' There is $75 billion in the \nRepublican program that is unpaid for.\n  As I mentioned, I think the compelling reason is the fact that these \nare men and women who are hard-working. They are child care and health \ncare workers who we entrust with the care of our loved ones every \nday. They clean out the buildings of American industry and factories \nevery single night.\n\n  This is a women's issue because the great majority of the minimum-\nwage workers are women. It is a children's issue because whether those \nmothers and fathers are going to make a decent wage is going to affect \nthose children. They worry that they are not going to have warm homes \nin the winter and enough to eat, which we know they don't have. We know \nwhat the Second Harvest reports are about--the number of families \nworking and not making a livable wage are going out to the food \npantries all across this country. That is why the mayors--Republican \nand Democrat alike --support our increase. It is a women's issue, a \nchildren's issue, and a civil rights issue because many of these men \nand women are people of color. And most of all, it is a fairness issue.\n  How in the world does the Republican leadership go home to their \ncommunities and say we voted for a $4,600 pay increase and against your \nminimum wage?\n  I hope every citizen will ask their Members of the Senate when we \nadjourn--whenever that may be, that particular issue is still in \nquestion--why a Member's salary is more important than theirs.\n  Others desire to speak. I see my friend from Minnesota. How much time \ndoes he require?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I think I will speak for 10 minutes. \nBut I think it will be less because I want the Senator to have a chance \nto respond to the Republican arguments.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator can have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, first of all, let me say in a very \npersonal way that when I was teaching and hoping to become a Senator, \nthis is what I imagined it would be. I could come to the floor of the \nSenate and support an amendment introduced by Senator Kennedy, that I \nwould be lucky enough to have Dale Bumpers' desk and be able to sit \nnext to Senator Kennedy and come out here and fight for what I think is \njust elementary economic justice. I am very proud to rise to speak in \nbehalf of this amendment.\n  On behalf of 176,000 Minnesotans who would be helped by this, much \nless the workers and their children--there would be many more \ncitizens--I thank him. On behalf of another 11 million-plus workers in \nthe country who would benefit from this $1 raise over 2 years, I thank \nhim.\n  I say to all of my colleagues--Democrats but especially Republicans \non the other side of the aisle--wherever I have traveled in our \ncountry--I start with my State of Minnesota--no matter where it is in \nMinnesota, in the city, or in rural areas, or in the suburbs, or \nwhether it is the Deep South, whether it is L.A., East L.A. or Watts, \nor whether it is, inner-city Baltimore, or whether it is rural \nMinnesota--the one thing that people come up and say over and over \nagain more than anything else is: We want to be able to have a job at a \ndecent wage so we can support our families, so our children can have \nthe care we know they need and deserve.\n  When I went to visit the part of the country where my wife Sheila and \nher family come from, Appalachia, Harlan County, it was the same thing. \nThat is what people want to be able to have --a living-wage job, to be \nable to earn enough of an income so they can support their children, so \nthey can do right by their children. That is what this amendment is all \nabout. To talk about raising the minimum wage from $5.15 an hour to \n$6.15 an hour over 2 years so we don't lose what we gained in 1997 is a \nmatter of elementary justice.\n  I heard Senator Kennedy say this. I guess I need to emphasize this \none or two times myself. I don't know how Senators or Representatives \ncan vote for a $4,600 increase for ourselves when we are already making \n$130,000-plus a year and say we need this because we have children who \nare in college and because we need to make sure we have enough money to \ncover expenses and then turn around and vote against a $1 increase over \n2 years from $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour.\n  Our economy is booming. In many ways we are doing well. But the fact \nis that I still think, using Michael Harrington's term--the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts will remember that book--we still have ``two \nAmerica's.'' We have one America with greater access for all the things \nthat make life richer in possibilities and we have another America that \nstill struggles to make ends meet. Rising tides lift all boats. But in \nsome ways, we haven't been growing together. We have been growing \napart.\n  A minimum-wage worker now makes $5.15 an hour. The average CEO in our \ncountry makes $5,100 an hour.\n\n[[Page S14255]]\n\n  Let me say to every Senator that this is matter of elementary \njustice. This is, as Senator Kennedy said, a family value issue. It \nmakes a huge difference, if you are able to make an additional $3,000-\nplus a year because of this increase in the minimum wage. That means \nyou will be able to pay your utility bills, and you do not have to \nworry about being shut off. It means your children will be warm as \nopposed to cold in a cold winter in Minnesota or in Maine, Madam \nPresident. It means you will be able to buy clothing for your children. \nIt means you can afford your rent.\n\n  I hope and I pray it will mean we will not have so many women and so \nmany children in our homeless shelters with 40 percent of these \nfamilies having the head of the household working full time--people who \nwork 52 weeks a year, 40 hours a week, and they are still poor in \nAmerica because they don't make enough of a wage to support themselves \nand their families.\n  This is a family value issue. I don't know of any issue before the \nSenate and I don't know of any debate that we have had in the Senate \nthat speaks more loudly and clearly to family values.\n  Colleagues, Republicans included, vote for this Kennedy amendment if \nyou want to support your children. Vote for this Kennedy amendment if \nyou want to support families. Vote for this Kennedy amendment if you \nwant to support hard-working people who shouldn't be poor in America. \nVote for this amendment if you want to support women. Too many women \nare the ones who are working full time and still don't make a living \nwage. This is a matter of justice. There is a matter of family values. \nThis is a matter of doing the right thing. I hope we will have a \nmajority vote for this amendment.\n  Finally, I will admit it. I will make a blatant political point.\n  I don't know how in the world anybody in this Chamber can vote a \n$4,600 salary increase for himself or herself saying we have to have \nthis to make ends meet--and that is from the $130,000 salary at the \nbeginning--and say no, no; we can't vote for people to have the chance \nto make enough of a wage so they can do a little better for themselves \nand, more importantly, a little better for their children.\n  Mr. President, $5.15 an hour to $6.15 an hour, a $1 increase, 50 \ncents a year over 2 years ought to pass with 100 votes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Is the Senator familiar with this study by the Family Work Institute? \nThey had an interview with the children of minimum-wage workers. Here \nare three of the top four things children would like to change about \nthe working parents and the concern about being with their parents. \nThey wish their parents were less stressed out by work, less tired \nbecause of work, and could spend more time with them.\n  The kids are right. The parents have less chance to spend time with \nthem. They are working longer. They are working harder. They have less \ntime to spend with their children. The children are crying out for \nhelp, assistance, and for understanding.\n  This isn't going to solve all of their problems. But this minimum \nwill put $2,000 into the family income, and it would give those parents \ntime to spend with their children, perhaps buy a Christmas present or a \nbirthday present, and permit them to share some additional quality \ntime.\n  I was wondering if that kind of response from the children of \nminimum-wage workers surprised the Senator from Minnesota. He has spent \na great deal of time traveling this country and talking to needy \nfamilies.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his question. \nI wish I had emphasized that more, I say to the Senator. I can think of \nso many poignant conversations with people in which they were saying: \nGiven the wages we make, every last hour we can work, we work. We have \nno other choice because that is the only way we can put food on the \ntable. However, it means we have very little time to spend with our \nchildren. It is not what we want. It is not the way we want it to be.\n  I think this is so important for families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized for 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to raise \nthe minimum wage.\n  My colleagues, the case for an increase in the minimum wage is clear. \nAmerica has enjoyed eight and one-half years of economic expansion. The \neconomic boom that began in March 1999 is now the longest peacetime \nexpansion in American history.\n  However, the rising tide of economic development has not lifted the \nboats of millions of American workers. Millions of Americans earning \nthe minimum wage are rapidly becoming a permanent underclass in our \nsociety. This amendment is a big step forward for millions who are \nstruggling to feed and raise a family, and rent decent housing, while \nearning the minimum wage.\n  At the same time that our economy is expanding, the distribution of \nincome is becoming more and more unequal. As the charts prepared by the \nSenator from Massachusetts make clear, the earnings of average \nAmericans have grown little, and the overall distribution of income has \nbecome increasingly unequal. Whether you examine the trend of U.S. \nincome distribution or compare the wages of U.S. workers to those in \nother industrialized countries, the result is clear: the wages of the \naverage American worker are stagnating.\n  While I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for championing this \namendment, I am also grateful that his amendment extends the minimum \nwage to the only U.S. territory where minimum wage is not governed by \nFederal law. I am speaking of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \nIslands.\n  For my colleagues who are not familiar with this territory, the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is located 4,000 miles \nwest of Hawaii. In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for political \nunion with the United States. Today, the CNMI flies the flag of the \nUnited States as a U.S. territory.\n  In 1976, Congress gave U.S. citizenship to residents of the CNMI. At \nthe same time, however, Congress exempted the Commonwealth from the \nminimum wage provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. As we now \nknow, that omission was a grave error. Today's amendment will correct \nthat longstanding mistake.\n  The CNMI section of this amendment stands for the simple proposition \nthat America is one country and that the U.S. minimum wage--whatever \namount it may be--should be uniform. Common sense dictates that our \ncountry must have a single, national law on minimum wage.\n  Throughout the United States, Federal law requires that minimum wage \nworkers be paid $5.15 per hour--everywhere, that is, except the \nCommonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. In the CNMI, the minimum \nwage is $3.15 per hour, 40 percent less than the U.S. minimum wage.\n  You would have to go back twenty years, to January 1980, to find a \ntime when the statutory minimum wage was that low in the United States. \nToday, workers in the CNMI are being paid wages that are 20 years \nbehind the times. And the numbers I have cited do not account for the \neffect of inflation.\n  Once you adjust the CNMI minimum wage for inflation, you would have \nto go back to the 1930s--the Depression years--to find a time when the \nwages of American workers had the same buying power as minimum wage \nworkers in the CNMI today. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage in \nthe CNMI--which I remind my colleagues is U.S. soil--is the equivalent \nof less than ten cents an hour. Ten cents an hour! You can't even buy a \npencil for 10 cents. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage in this \nterritory is 60 years out of date.\n  This situation is a disgrace. In Guam, ninety miles from the CNMI, \nthey have been paying the minimum wage since 1950. It's time to end \nthis embarrassment and reform the minimum wage in the Commonwealth of \nthe Northern Mariana Islands. That's one of the important things that \nthis amendment would do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise as a strong and proud supporter of \nSenator Kennedy's amendment to raise the\n\n[[Page S14256]]\n\nminimum wage one dollar over 2 years. I commend Senator Kennedy not \nonly for his leadership today but for his attention to the needs of \nworking Americans throughout his career in the Senate.\n  Today we are debating, and I hope soon adopting, legislation to \naddress an issue vital to America's working families. The amendment \nbefore us calls for a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage in January \nof 2000, with another 50-cent increase in January of 2001. So in a 2-\nyear period we would increase the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15.\n  This minimum wage increase is a necessity for many individuals \nparticipating in today's workforce, particularly those moving from \nwelfare to work. Among the rationales behind welfare reform was that \neveryone who is able to work should work and that a job should offer a \nsustainable income. Unless we have a living minimum wage, a minimum \nwage that can support a family, a minimum wage that can allow a family \nto meet its basic needs, then it is something of a cruel hoax to force \npeople into the workforce, knowing that they will not be able to \nsupport themselves on their income alone.\n  Our economy has been performing remarkably well since the last \nincrease in the minimum wage in 1996. A record 8.7 million jobs have \nbeen created. We all recall when we were debating the minimum wage that \nyear, one of the most persistent objections was that the increase would \nkill job growth; it would prevent our economy from continuing to grow. \nThe reality is that we are in the midst of a period of record economic \nexpansion during which a large number of new jobs have been created.\n  Increasing the minimum wage is not something that is going to hamper \nour economy. It will enable working families to provide for their \nfamilies. Moreover, economic factors dictate that if we don't increase \nthe minimum wage now, the modest growth in inflation will wipe out the \ngains of the 1996 increase. Indeed, the minimum wage is in danger of \ndropping below its pre-1996 level in real dollars if we do not pass \nthis amendment.\n  I believe other economic factors dictate that we increase the minimum \nwage. As we look at this economy, we are discovering fantastic growth \nin many quarters, but we also see that the incomes of the poorest \nAmericans are not growing as fast as they have grown in the past.\n  Between 1950 and 1978, income growth for the lowest earners grew \nproportionally more than any other income level. What has happened \nrecently, because of our new information society, because of new \ntechnology, because of a booming stock market, the wealthiest Americans \nare increasing their incomes substantially. In fact, the wealthiest one \npercent of Americans, doubled their incomes between 1977 and 1999. In \nsharp contrast, the poorest 20 percent of Americans actually saw their \nincomes fall by 9 percent between 1977 to 1999.\n  There are some things that we can do to begin to reverse this trend, \nto ensure that every part of our American family participates in our \ncountry's economic success. The first step is to increase the minimum \nwage.\n  The reality is that today, workers making the minimum wage--heads of \nhouseholds, single heads of households with a full-time job--earn about \n$10,700. That is about $2,500 below the poverty level for a family of \nthree. So essentially, what we are telling workers who are going into \nthe workforce with minimum-wage jobs, is that they will not be able to \nget out of poverty. That I believe is wrong. If someone is going to go \ninto the workforce, work 40 hours a week, and try to raise a family, \nthey should at least be able to make enough money to live above the \npoverty line.\n  The other issue that has often been raised with respect to the \nminimum wage is that, really, this is just a benefit for kids, that \nkids are the only group of people who have minimum-wage jobs. They are \nthe people working at the fast food restaurants and performing other \nminimum wage jobs. This is not the truth. Statistics show that 70 \npercent of minimum-wage earners are adults over 20 years of age. They \nalso show that 46 percent of these minimum-wage workers have full-time \njobs and that 59 percent are women.\n  This correlates closely with the startling statistics we have seen \nwith respect to children and poverty. Frankly, one of the most \ndisturbing statistics is the growth in the number of children living in \npoverty. Typically, these children are in single-parent households led \nby women. Since 59 percent of minimum-wage earners are women and 40 \npercent of minimum-wage earners are the sole breadwinners of their \nfamily, these problems seem to be directly connected.\n  One of the great shames of this Nation, at a time when we are \nrecording robust growth in the stock markets, at a time when we are \nseeing extraordinary development in our economy, is that one in five \nchildren still live in poverty in the United States; that 12 percent of \nAmerican households cannot meet their basic nutritional needs some part \nof the year; that 39 percent of the families who turn to food banks for \nassistance have one adult member who holds a job. These are working \nAmericans, but their wages are so low they cannot feed their families \nand their children live in poverty. We can do better than this in our \ngreat country. The first way to do better is to support this increase \nin the minimum wage proposed by Senator Kennedy.\n  The reality is that having a job today does not mean you are going to \nbe above the poverty level. Having a minimum-wage job frequently \nguarantees you are below the poverty level. At this time in our \nhistory, with such economic progress, with the vista of a new century \nbefore us, with the information age bursting upon us, we should be able \nto guarantee if a person works 40 hours a week, that person should be \nable to raise a family above the poverty level.\n  This proposal for a minimum wage seems only to be controversial here \nin the Senate. If you go back to Rhode Island and ask people what they \nthink, they think the minimum wage should go up. They recognize and \nunderstand how hard it is to support their own families. They know if \nthey had a minimum-wage job, it would be close to impossible to do \nthat.\n  Indeed, there was a survey done by the Jerome Levy Economic Institute \nwhich showed that 87 percent of small businesses that were contacted \nand asked about increasing the minimum wage thought that they could \nabsorb this modest cost. That is up from 79 percent just a year ago. So \neven small business believes raising the minimum wage is appropriate. \nThat might be a direct reflection of the fact that many states have \nalready raised the minimum wage above the federal level. Indeed, in \nmany parts of the country with the highest minimum wages, there is a \npersistent shortage of labor. In fact, businesses are bidding for \nworkers at levels above the minimum wage.\n\n  We are really talking about protecting the most vulnerable workers in \nour economy, those without the power to negotiate higher wages, those \nin areas of economic activity that do not require high skill levels, \nand therefore can be easily replaced. These are the people for whom we \nshould have a special concern, these are the people we should help move \nup out of poverty, not by a handout but by simply rewarding the value \nof each hour they work.\n  Business Week, a magazine that is not traditionally a strong \nproponent of prolabor sentiments, had this to say:\n\n       It is time to set aside the old assumptions about the \n     minimum wage. . . . We don't know how high the minimum wage \n     can rise until it hurts the demand for labor. But with the \n     real minimum wage no higher than it was under President \n     Reagan, we can afford to take prudent risks.\n\n  Frankly, this is not a risk, it is a prudent investment in the \nworkers of America. My own paper, the Providence Journal, adds:\n\n       An increase to $6.15 would help take a nick out of poverty \n     and provide a more solid base for . . . economic expansion. \n     Congress ought to do it.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this Providence Journal editorial \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REED. I agree with the Providence Journal. It is about time \nCongress acted. It is about time we took a nick out of poverty. It is \nabout time we invested in working families and gave them, through their \nown efforts, the\n\n[[Page S14257]]\n\nresources to raise their families, to raise them up out of poverty. We \nmust give new hope to families who are working very hard in this \neconomy to raise children, to move forward and seize the opportunity at \nthe heart of the American dream.\n  I again commend Senator Kennedy for his great efforts, not just \ntoday, but for so many days on the floor, fighting for working \nfamilies, fighting for economic justice for all our citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                         Raise the Minimum wage\n\n       A proposal in Congress to raise the minimum wage, now $5.15 \n     an hour, by two increments of 50 cents each over the next two \n     years seems reasonable. This would still leave those \n     subsisting on these wages well below the federal poverty \n     level, but it would at least bring them some modest relief. \n     (The debate comes, by the way, as Congress voted itself an \n     average $4,600 raise.)\n       The argument is sometimes made that to raise the minimum \n     wage would reduce employment by raising employers' costs. We \n     see little indication over the past few years that the move \n     would shrink employment. For that matter, increasing the \n     minimum wage, by widening purchasing power, could \n     substantially help the economy and boost employment over the \n     long run.\n       It should also be noted that higher wages often mean \n     greater loyalty and effort on the part of employees. Thus, \n     whatever the increment of a higher minimum wage, that costs \n     could be more than offset by higher revenue and profits from \n     increased productivity and reduced turnover, hiring and \n     training costs.\n       It is interesting that in my states with the highest state \n     minimum wages, such as Massachusetts (now at $5.25 and to be \n     raised to $6.75 in two 75-cent increments over the next two \n     years), there are serious labor shortages. Recent increases \n     in those states' minimum wages have not brought about price \n     rises or layoffs, so far as such things can be measured.\n       But then, consider that the purchasing power of the current \n     minimum wage is about $2 less that of the minimum wage in \n     1968 (when the jobless rate was also very low). Further, it \n     should be noted that more than 70 percent of American workers \n     receiving the minimum wage are over age 25 or not longer in \n     school.\n       An increase to $6.15 would help take a nick out of poverty \n     and provide a more solid base for the economic expansion. \n     Congress ought to do it.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I see the Senator from North Dakota on \nthe floor. I yield him 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, we are here debating the question of the \nminimum wage: Should the minimum wage be increased? We are talking \nabout people at the bottom of the economic ladder in this country, \npeople who work hard, who do not ask for much. They do not have stock \nin the stock market. They have not, by and large, been blessed with \nsubstantial increases in income by a growing economy. In many cases, \nthey have been losing ground.\n  I know when we talk about the minimum wage, we tend to talk about it \nin terms of statistics, tables and charts. I have met repeatedly over \nthe years with people who have had difficulty, who are trying to get \nback into the labor market, who are working at minimum-wage jobs. I \nrecall one such meeting in my office in Fargo, ND, with probably a half \ndozen young women who were struggling to get off the welfare roll and \nget on a payroll and earn a living, to get some training and move into \nthe job force again.\n  All of them told me the same story of the difficulty of making ends \nmeet on a minimum wage paycheck. They shared with me how hard it was to \nbalance a checkbook on minimum wage--meeting the monthly bills like \nchild care, rent, a car payment, let alone trying to find a few dollars \nto buy a Christmas present for the kids.\n  The story is always the same. Those stories come to you from people \nwho are trying very hard. Most of them tell those stories with tears in \ntheir eyes. It is the case here in Congress that the halls are not full \ntoday of interest groups who are well organized, who have hired some \nvery skilled people to lobby on their behalf for this kind of \nlegislative change. For people at the lower end of the economic ladder, \nthere are not halls full of well-paid lobbyists and others pushing for \nthis change. They are largely the voiceless in our society who do not \nhave the capability to influence legislative events quite as easily as \nsome other very important interests in this country do. But that should \nnot persuade anybody that this interest is not important.\n  It is very important for our country, especially in a circumstance \nwhere the economy is growing. All the signs are that our country is \ndoing well. The stock market is doing very well. Unemployment is at a \n30 year low.\n  It is important for us also to understand there are families \nstruggling on minimum wage trying to make ends meet. The fact is, the \npurchasing power value of that minimum wage has diminished \ndramatically. It is about $2.50 below the purchasing power value in \n1968.\n  None of us in this room are working for minimum wage. No one. So none \nof us have experienced what it is like to put in 40 or 45 hours this \nweek and be paid minimum wage and then try to make a car payment, pay \nrent, buy food for the kids, and make ends meet. We cannot do that. No \none in this Chamber would volunteer to do that, I expect. But there are \na lot of people trying to do that because they want to pay their way. \nThey want a decent job; they want an opportunity. They want to work.\n  That is why it is important in this circumstance for us to increase \nthe minimum wage. Its purchasing power diminishes over time because of \ninflation. The value of the minimum wage has decreased for a lot of \nthese families. Many of us know that poverty in this country is \nincreasingly poverty of a single woman trying to raise a family. Many \nof us have met with those folks in our offices and elsewhere telling us \nthe difficulties they are having.\n  In many ways, it is hopeful that both sides of the political aisle in \nthis Chamber are talking about increasing the minimum wage. This is an \nimportant subject. We are both talking about this subject now in a \nserious way, and that is good. It ought to give hope to those at the \nbottom of the economic ladder who are trying very hard to make ends \nmeet and have difficulty doing it on today's minimum wage.\n  There is a difference between the proposals. The minimum wage we are \nproposing will provide a minimum wage increase on January 1, 2000. The \nalternative plan will not.\n  We provide a $1 increase in the minimum wage over 2 years. The GOP \nplan does not.\n  We protect overtime compensation for 73 million working Americans who \nare entitled to it. The GOP does not.\n  We offset the full cost of the tax cuts, and there are some tax \nincentives and cuts in this proposal to help businesses that will \nconfront some additional costs. We fully offset ours. The competing \nplan is mostly unpaid for.\n  We can go on down the list. We extend the welfare-to-work credit. The \nother plan does not.\n  We provide a work-site child care tax credit. The GOP plan does not.\n  We provide wage tax credits for small businesses located in the \nempowerment zone which, incidentally, is very important in our part of \nthe country. These are zones, especially the empowerment zone in my \nState, which have as a criteria the outmigration of people. People who \nhave left. This is not unemployment and poverty. That is one sign of \neconomic distress. The other sign is a rural county that has lost half \nits population. People cannot find work, so they leave, and the county \nshrinks like a prune.\n  Empowerment zones create jobs and restore economic vitality and \nhealth in those areas. We include that in our proposal, but the GOP \nplan does not.\n  These are interesting and important differences between the two \nplans. I say this: At least we are on the right subject.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has worked tirelessly on behalf of \nthose at the bottom of the economic ladder who are struggling hard and \nvaliantly trying to make ends meet. By proposing this minimum wage \nincrease which, in my judgment, is long overdue, the Senator from \nMassachusetts does a real service. I hope at the end of this debate we \nwill be able to adopt the Senator's amendment, and I hope those who are \nworking on minimum wage struggling to care for their families and \ncreate a future for themselves, on January 1 will be able to say: Yes, \nCongress did something that will help me and my family as well.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S14258]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I understand I have 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator from Virginia asked for 10 minutes. I ask \nunanimous consent that I have 2 additional minutes and yield 10 minutes \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBB. Madam President, on Friday, November 5, Senator Baucus and \nI introduced the Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999. We drafted \nthis legislation to complement Senator Kennedy's minimum wage \namendment, and under the unanimous consent agreement, it was \nincorporated into that amendment which is now pending.\n  The Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999 is targeted to provide \ntax relief for those employers who will be most affected by the minimum \nwage increase, even more than the proposal to be offered by the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Our package adheres to two principles that had to be reconciled: \nFirst, that tax relief should be provided to those who need it most; \nand, second, that any tax relief package be fiscally responsible.\n  To make sure that our package benefited those who need it most, we \nfocused primarily on small businesses, those most likely to experience \nhigher costs as a result of an increased minimum wage.\n  To make sure the package was fiscally responsible, we used true \noffsets, not the surplus, to pay for it. In this way, we have remained \ntrue to both principles: This is a good tax package; it is a \nresponsible tax package.\n  Admittedly, deciding what provisions to include in such a bill \nrequired some compromises. In almost all cases, I have sponsored, or \ncosponsored, legislation that would go beyond the tax relief in many of \nthe areas addressed by our bill. I will continue my efforts to move on \nthese broader provisions.\n  However, our commitment to paying for the tax bill and not either \nborrowing from our parents by using the Social Security trust fund or \nborrowing from our children by increasing our debt burden, precluded us \nfrom doing more at this time.\n  In some respects, our tax package is similar to the Republican \nproposal. For example, both packages accelerate the 100-percent \ndeduction for self-employed health insurance; both packages increase \nsection 179 expensing for small businesses; both packages extend the \nwork opportunity tax credit; and both packages raise the business meals \ndeduction from 50 percent to 60 percent.\n  But in other ways, our packages are quite different. For instance, we \nhave included in our amendment some estate tax relief for small family-\nowned farms and businesses. Inflation has left the current exemption \nsimply insufficient to give adequate relief to farmers and small \nbusiness owners. This is one of the areas where we clearly need to do \nmore, but some relief is better than none.\n  We have included provisions targeted to geographic areas with the \ngreatest need for economic assistance. The new markets proposal, for \nexample, would reward employers who operate in economically distressed \nareas where the minimum wage is the most prevalent.\n  There is also a credit that encourages employers to give lower income \nemployees information technology training so we can begin to close the \nso-called digital divide. I was at an announcement this morning that \nwill also make a major step in that direction.\n  We also expand current empowerment zone credits so more communities \nand more people are able to take advantage of these credits. The \nempowerment zone credit provides a dual benefit. It helps those who may \nnot yet be reaping the benefits of our expanding economy, and it helps \nrevitalize our cities which, over the long term, may be our best tool \nfor reducing the pressures that lead to suburban sprawl.\n  Another area we devoted our attention to is retirement security. \nIncreasingly, people are apprehensive about their retirement. Many \nsmall businesses are struggling to provide retirement security for \ntheir employees.\n  The pension provisions in our bill are designed to address the needs \nof these small employers who are trying to develop effective retirement \nplans for their employees.\n  For example, we would allow small businesses to borrow from their \nplans, just as large businesses can, and we have included Senator \nBaucus' proposal to provide a credit for new small business pension \nplans. Everyone benefits when small businesses are better able to offer \ntheir employees retirement plans.\n  Finally, we need to help our communities meet their increasing demand \nfor new and upgraded schools. Across the Nation, there are pent-up \nneeds for new schools to make room for smaller classes, for schools \nthat have access to the latest technology, for schools that have decent \nheating and plumbing and leak-proof roofs.\n  To help meet those needs, we have included a provision to help \ncommunities modernize their public schools. In this bill, we propose \nextending the Qualified Zone Academy Bond Program, or QZABs, for an \nadditional year. This program helps with school modernization efforts \nand deserves to be extended.\n  Again, this effort is important, but we need to do much more. While \nwe could not squeeze more on school construction into this vehicle, I \nam determined to find one that is large enough to accommodate our \nNation's schoolchildren, who, frankly, deserve better than what they \nhave gotten from Congress this year.\n  Let me close by reiterating why we decided to pay for this bill and \nnot just take the money from the surplus.\n  First of all, I believe both sides understand we made a bipartisan \ncommitment to stop dipping into the Social Security surplus to pay for \ncurrent spending outside Social Security. Honoring this commitment is \nimportant both to maintain pressure for fiscal discipline and to \nprevent further cynicism about the way the Federal Government operates.\n  As for the non-Social Security surplus, we believe our first priority \nshould be paying down the over $5 trillion debt we have accumulated by \nfailing to exercise fiscal discipline in the past. The need to keep up \nthe pressure for fiscal responsibility is clear.\n  Congress has been breaking the spending caps at breakneck speed. CBO \nrecently advised us, not only had we already spent the small surplus \nexpected for fiscal year 2000, we are already $17 billion in the red \nfor the next fiscal year. Until we can agree on a comprehensive package \nthat balances our spending, tax relief, and debt reduction priorities, \nwe should pay for the spending and the tax cutting we propose and not \ntake the easy route of spending the surpluses that may or may not \nactually materialize.\n  If we do not put the brakes on piecemeal tax cuts now, we could \neasily face a runaway train of politically popular proposals that are \nnot likely to be in the best long-term interests of the Nation. When we \nare ready to put everything on the table and consider the various \npriorities--such as using the surplus to pay down the debt--we can \nengage in that discussion. Until then, we should focus on achieving the \ncurrent objective, which is to assist employers, particularly small \nemployers, who may be adversely affected by the minimum wage increase.\n  In short, this tax package accomplishes its purpose of providing \nrelief to those employers who are most likely to have higher costs when \nthe minimum wage increases. It is responsible. It does not squander the \nsurplus we have fought so hard to achieve but maintains it for debt \nreduction. At the same time, it protects Social Security trust funds \nfrom being misallocated to other programs and expenditures. This is a \ngood tax package, and I urge our colleagues to support it.\n  With that, Madam President, I reserve any time remaining and yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that it not be charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S14259]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, parliamentary inquiry. Could the Chair \ntell me, is it now appropriate for me to call up the amendment that is \npending that has been filed with reference to an alternative minimum \nwage and tax plan?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator yields back the remaining time \non the Kennedy amendment, the answer is yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. How much time do we have on the \nKennedy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 60 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In the event I do not yield that back, what is the \nremaining time arrangement for the day and for tomorrow on the two \nrespective amendments, the Kennedy amendment and the Domenici \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. After the 60 minutes of remaining debate on \nthe Kennedy amendment is used, there would be a period of 2 hours for \ndebating the amendment which the Senator would be proposing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then what is the agreed-upon schedule for tomorrow with \nreference to the amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour of debate beginning at 9:30, \nwith a vote scheduled to occur at 10:30.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, might I ask Senator Kennedy a \nquestion?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask Senator Kennedy, I understand you have no \nadditional speakers now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If I could answer the Senator, I think we do actually \nhave some additional speakers. They can either do it now or at some \nother appropriate time after all the time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand that as far as today's debate is \nconcerned, you are out of time.\n  Is that what the Parliamentarian told me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct, that the time \ncontrolled by Senator Kennedy on the Kennedy amendment has expired. \nSixty minutes remain for those opposing the Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. But, I say to the Senator, as I understand it, when you \noffer your amendment, you will have 60 minutes and we will have 60 \nminutes. I think we could accommodate the other Senators. Senator \nFeinstein is here. We have probably two other Senators. We can let them \nspeak at that particular time. So it is just a question of working out \nthe remaining time this evening.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time we have in opposition to the----\n  Mr. NICKLES. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Excuse me.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, we have 2 hours equally divided: One on the Kennedy \namendment, and the other 2 hours on an amendment that will be offered \nby Senator Domenici.\n  I wish to speak very briefly in opposition to the Kennedy amendment. \nThen I will yield back the time, and that will eliminate at least that \nround. Then there will be 2 hours equally divided on the Domenici \namendment. People can speak on either proposal, as they wish.\n  For the information of our colleagues, we will have one hour of \ndebate tomorrow morning and a vote at 10:30 on both proposals.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on the so-called Kennedy minimum wage \nproposal that is now before the Senate. I compliment my colleague from \nMassachusetts. He has offered this time and time again. I am sure he \nwill be back next year and the following year to increase the minimum \nwage. If you ask the question: should there be an increase in the \nminimum wage, I am sure a lot of people would say yes because they want \neverybody who is making a low wage to make more.\n  I happen to agree with that very strongly. It is very important for \npeople to be able to climb the economic ladder. What people many times \ndon't recognize is that if you have a very significant increase in the \nminimum wage--such as Senator Kennedy's proposal of approximately a 20-\npercent increase, increasing it from $5.15 to $6.15, a $1 over the next \n13\\1/2\\ months. That is OK, I suppose, if everybody can just pass it \nalong without any repercussions. But there may be some businesses that \ncan't. If they can't, what are they going to do? They may hire less \npeople. They may let some people go.\n  I know it does not seem as if that would be the case, but frankly it \nis. It may not happen in every case, but it happens in many cases. \nThere are some employers that may not be able to pay $5.15 an hour or \n$6 an hour. Senator Kennedy's proposal says in 13\\1/2\\ months you have \nto be paid $6.15 an hour or it is against the law for you to have a \njob.\n  The Federal Government has determined that, in our infinite wisdom, \nin rural Montana or where ever, we don't care if pumping gas can only \npay $5.50 or the corner grocery store can only afford to pay that \namount, we don't care. We are deciding up here in Washington DC, that \nthe Federal Government does not want you to have a job. It is against \nthe law for you to have a job. The Federal Government has decided \nemployers must pay at lease $6.15 an hour or they cannot hire anyone. \nSorry, 15-year-old, 16-year-old, or 17-year-old trying to get a summer \njob, if there are no summer jobs available at that amount. It may be \nfine for the State of Massachusetts. That may be great in New York \nCity. I can't help but think there are some areas of the country where \nmaybe that does not apply and will not work.\n  This idea that raising the minimum wage can only have a positive \neconomic impact is grossly incorrect. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas stated it would mean a job loss of between 100,000 and 500,000 \njobs. That is a pretty significant hit. Maybe it is not a hit for \neverybody because we have millions of people working, but for between \n100,000, and 400,000 people who could lose their jobs, that is pretty \nsignificant. If they find themselves unemployed because they couldn't \nget a job as a result of the minimum wage increase we have created a \nreal injustice. Maybe they are looking for summer work, maybe they are \nlooking for part-time work, or maybe they are trying to supplement a \njob working evenings. Why should we price them out of the market?\n  Let me address a few other things that are in Senator Kennedy's \nproposal. There are some tax cuts. Senator Robb just spoke regarding \nthose. Many of those are similar to ones we have in our package that \nSenator Domenici will be talking about briefly. I compliment them on \nthose tax cuts. What I criticize them for are the tax increases. You \ndidn't know they had a lot of tax increases in the Democrat proposal? \nWell, they do. The fact is, there are more tax increases than there are \ntax cuts.\n\n  What tax increases do they have? They have two or three things. They \nhave a little provision in here that reauthorizes Superfund taxes. We \ndo not reauthorize Superfund because the program is flawed. Does it \nmake sense that they are going to extend Superfund taxes without fixing \nthe program? I am absolutely confident, 100 percent confident this \nCongress is not going to reauthorize and extend Superfund taxes unless \nwe reauthorize the program. The program is broken. We are raising \nbillions of dollars or have raised billions of dollars and we are \nwasting it.\n  The lawyers and trial attorneys reap great benefits, but we spend \nvery little money cleaning up the program. Many of us are in favor of \nfixing the program. Let's make sure 90 percent of the money that is \nraised for Superfund cleanup actually goes to cleanup, rather than the \ncurrent situation in which two-thirds of it goes to legal fees.\n  The Kennedy legislation also includes several other tax increases. \nThere is a proposal that goes by the name of the Doggett proposal. \nAccording to a lot of different groups--including the Cattlemen's \nAssociation, Taxpayers Union, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and National \nFederation of Independent Businesses--this is a really big, bad tax \nincrease. It is called the Abusive Tax Shelter Shutdown Act of 1998.\n  Most people think of it simply as an IRS enhancement act. Well, they \nare\n\n[[Page S14260]]\n\nquite mistaken. I mean, should we really give the IRS a blank check to \ngo after lots of people for a lot of things because we think maybe we \nwill disallow noneconomic tax attributes, whatever that means. It is \nessentially a $10 billion tax increase and we are going to turn the IRS \nloose.\n  We spent a lot of time and passed, in a bipartisan fashion--my \ncompliments to Senators Roth and Moynihan--last year a very significant \nIRS reform bill that curbed the appetite of the IRS. This legislation \nwould say, forget about those reforms. It would give the IRS more power \nto go after what they consider noneconomic attributes. It is truly a \nbad idea.\n  There are a lot of bad proposals within the Kennedy language. There \nare tax increases and the tax increases won't work. The tax increases \nwill extend taxes that shouldn't be extended until the programs are \nreauthorized.\n  It is a heavy hit, particularly on small business, too quick, too \nmuch, too early. A 20-percent increase in the next 13 and a half \nmonths, in my opinion, is too much. It would have economic \nramifications that would cause many people to lose their jobs. How \nmany? Hundreds of thousands. According to CBO, it says job loss would \nbe between 100,000 and 500,000.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this conclusion of the CBO be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Congressional Budget Office Private-Sector Mandate Statement\n\n     S. 1805--Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998\n       Summary: S. 1805 would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the minimum wage rate under the \n     Act from $5.15 per hour to $5.65 per hour on January 1, 1999, \n     and to $6.15 per hour on January 1, 2000.\n       Private-sector mandates contained in bill: S. 1805 contains \n     a mandate on private-sector employers covered by the FLSA. It \n     would require those employers to pay a higher minimum wage \n     rate than they are required to pay under current law.\n       Estimated direct cost to the private sector: CBO's estimate \n     of the direct cost of the private-sector mandate in S. 1805 \n     is displayed in the following table.\n\n                  DIRECT COST OF PRIVATE-SECTOR MANDATE\n                        [In billions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Fiscal years--\n              Provision               ----------------------------------\n                                        1999   2000   2001   2002   2003\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIncrease the minimum wage rate.......    2.7    7.4    7.9    7.0    6.2\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Basis of the estimate: S. 1805 specifies that the minimum \n     wage is to increase from $5.15 to $5.65 per hour on January \n     1, 1999, and to $6.15 on January 1, 2000. Other sections of \n     the FLSA providing different rules for certain workers and \n     employers, including the provision permitting employers to \n     pay teenagers $4.25 per hour during the first 90 consecutive \n     days of employment, would not change.\n       To estimate the direct cost to private employers, \n     information was used on the number of workers whose wages \n     would be affected in January 1999 and subsequent months, the \n     wage rates these workers would receive in the absence of the \n     enactment of the proposal, and the number of hours for which \n     they would be compensated.\n       The estimate was made in two steps. CBO used data from the \n     Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate how much it would \n     have cost employers to comply with the mandate had they been \n     required to do so in early 1998. Second, these estimates were \n     then used to project the costs to employers beginning in \n     January 1999, taking into account the expected decline in the \n     number of workers in the relevant wage range. The remainder \n     of this section discusses the way this estimate was \n     constructed and limitations of the data and methods.\n       The methods used for this estimate are similar to those \n     used for CBO's estimates of proposals made in 1996, the most \n     recent year in which bills to increase the federal minimum \n     wage rate were considered on the floor of the Senate and the \n     House. Unlike in 1996, CBO only has information about the \n     number of workers in the relevant wage range for a very short \n     time period since the current minimum wage rate became \n     effective. In preparing the estimates in 1996, CBO was able \n     to use data from several years when the minimum wage was at \n     the then-existing rate of $4.25 per hour. The current rate of \n     $5.15 per hour was implemented in September 1997. As more \n     information becomes available, this estimate might need to be \n     revised.\n     Estimates from the current population survey\n       Data on hourly wage rates contained in the January 1998 CPS \n     provide CBO's estimate of the number of private-sector \n     workers in that month who were paid in the relevant wage. At \n     that time, about 2.2 million workers in the private sector \n     were paid exactly $5.15 per hour and an additional 9.5 \n     million workers were paid between $5.16 and $6.14 per hour. \n     (About 1.5 million additional workers reported being paid \n     $5.00 per hour; as discussed below, it is assumed that these \n     workers were also covered by the $5.15 minimum wage and \n     were misreporting their wage rates.) Roughly one-quarter \n     of the workers in the relevant wage range were teenagers. \n     Based on information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, \n     it is assumed that about 30 percent of those teenagers \n     were in their first 90 days of employment with their \n     current employer and therefore not covered by the increase \n     in the minimum wage.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ Footnotes at end of statement.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       CBO estimates that if the workers in the private sector who \n     had been paid between $5.00 and $5.64 per hour in January \n     1998 had been paid $5.65 instead (with no change in the \n     number of hours worked), their employers would have paid them \n     approximately $300 million in additional wages in that month. \n     If the workers who had been paid between $5.00 and $6.14 had \n     been paid $6.15, their employers would have incurred an \n     additional wage bill of about $900 million in that month. \n     Moreover, employers would have had to pay the employers' \n     share of the payroll taxes on those additional wages; these \n     taxes are included in CBO's estimate of the total direct cost \n     of the mandate.\n     Applying the estimates from the CPS to the projection period\n       The monthly cost to employers of the proposed increases in \n     the minimum wage would be smaller in the future because the \n     number of workers in the affected range will decline. For \n     example, during the eight-year period starting in 1981 when \n     the minimum wage remained at $3.35 per hour, the number of \n     workers paid exactly that rate declined from 4.2 million to \n     1.8 million, as market forces and increases in state minimum \n     wage rates raised the level of wages paid. In 1996, CBO used \n     data from the March 1992 and March 1995 CPS to estimate that \n     the cost of complying with a minimum wage of $5.15 per hour \n     would have fallen by almost 40 percent over this three-year \n     period, or about one percent per month.\n       CBO assumes that the direct mandate cost would continue to \n     decrease at this rate throughout the projection period. Thus, \n     the monthly cost of raising the minimum wage to $5.65 in \n     January 1999 would be roughly 87 percent of the cost \n     estimated using the January 1998 data. The estimated cost of \n     raising the minimum wage to $6.15 in January 2000 would be \n     about 79 percent of the cost of doing so in January 1998.\n       Estimates for each fiscal year were then made by \n     aggregating the monthly costs. The estimate for fiscal year \n     1999 is the smallest because that period only includes an \n     increased minimum wage for nine months. The estimate for 2000 \n     includes the cost of a $5.65 minimum wage for three months \n     and a $6.15 minimum wage for nine months. The estimate of the \n     direct cost to the private sector is highest for 2001, when \n     all twelve months would be at $6.15 per hour.\n     Limitations\n       Estimates of the direct cost of this mandate are uncertain \n     for at least two reasons. First, the main source of data--the \n     January 1998 CPS--is subject to sampling error and other \n     problems when used for this purpose. For example, CBO assumed \n     that the workers who reported being paid $5.00 per hour after \n     the minimum wage had risen to $5.15 were actually earning \n     $5.15 because there is no evidence that compliance with the \n     Fair Labor Standards Act fell.\\2\\ The wage rates of other \n     low-wage workers--some of the workers who reported being paid \n     below $5.00 per hour and some of the workers not paid on an \n     hourly basis--would also be affected by an increase in the \n     statutory minimum.\\3\\ Second, there is no solid basis for \n     projecting the future number of workers who would have wage \n     rates in the relevant range, their precise wage rates, nor \n     the number of hours they would work under current law. The \n     annual decline estimated from the 1992-1995 period could turn \n     out to be too rapid or too slow.\n       Indirect effects of an increase in the minimum wage: An \n     increase in the minimum wage rate from $5.15 to $6.15 would \n     require employers to raise the wages paid to the lowest-paid \n     workers covered by the FLSA by 19 percent, and would require \n     employers to raise the wages of workers in the range between \n     the old and the new statutory rates by smaller amounts. As \n     under current law, employers could still pay teenage workers \n     $4.25 per hour during their first 90 calendar days.\n       Economists have devoted considerable energy to the task of \n     estimating how employers would respond to such a mandate. \n     Although most economists would agree that an increase in the \n     minimum wage rate would cause firms to employ fewer low-wage \n     workers (or employ them for fewer hours), there is \n     considerable disagreement about the magnitude of the \n     reduction. It has proven difficult to isolate the effects of \n     past changes in the minimum wage. Moreover, the estimates \n     from such analysts are hard to apply to future changes.\n       Based on CBO's review of a number of these studies, a \n     plausible range of estimates for illustrating the potential \n     losses is that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage \n     would resulting a 0.5 percent to 2 percent reduction in the \n     employment level of teenagers and a smaller percentage \n     reduction for young adults (ages 20 to 24).\\4\\ These \n     estimates would produce employment losses for an increase \n     in the minimum wage of the extent provided in this bill of \n     roughly 100,000 to\n\n[[Page S14261]]\n\n     500,000 jobs. The individuals whose employment \n     opportunities would be reduced are likely to include the \n     lest-skilled job-seekers who might benefit most from the \n     work experience.\n       This range of employment impacts is the same as CBO \n     estimated two years ago when Congress was considering a 21 \n     percent ($0.90 per hour) increase in the minimum wage.\\5\\ At \n     that time, the low end of the range seemed more realistic \n     because the number of workers in the relevant wage range and \n     the size of the minimum wage relative to the average wage \n     were relatively low. This time, however, those special \n     considerations do not apply because less time has elapsed \n     since the most recent increase in the minimum wage. About 50 \n     percent more workers are in the affected wage range now than \n     were in the relevant wage range when the 1996 legislation was \n     being considered. Likewise, the minimum wage is currently \n     about 41 percent of the average hourly earnings of production \n     or nonsupervisory workers in the private sector, compared \n     with about 36 percent just before the 1996 legislation was \n     enacted.\n       But two additional differences from the situation that \n     existed in 1996 could reduce employment impacts. First, the \n     labor market is exceptionally tight, with the total \n     unemployment rate at 4.6 percent and the teenage unemployment \n     rate at 14.7 percent (February 1998). In 1996, the total \n     unemployment rate was nearly one point higher and the teenage \n     unemployment rate was two points higher. Second, the most \n     recent increase in the minimum wage amended the FLSA to \n     permit employers to pay teenagers $4.25 per hour for the \n     first 90 days, and the current bill would not change this \n     provision. The literature on which the estimates reported \n     above are based did not reflect such a differential. \n     Presumably, the differential could result in fewer employment \n     losses for teenagers, more losses for adults, and fewer \n     losses overall. Although recent data indicate that few \n     employers are using the option, its availability could \n     cushion employment losses if labor markets weakened.\n       In addition to its effect on employment levels, an increase \n     in the minimum wage could have many other economic impacts. \n     For example, one consequence that has received considerable \n     attention is its potential effects on the earnings of low-\n     wage workers. CBO estimates that the direct effect of the \n     proposed increase would be to increase the aggregate earnings \n     of workers who would otherwise have received between $5.15 \n     and $6.14 per hour by over $7 billion in 2001. An indirect \n     effect of the increase in the minimum wage might be that \n     employers would also voluntarily raise the wage rates of \n     workers who were already being paid just above the new rate \n     in order to maintain differentials (the ``spillover \n     effect'').\n       Previous CBO estimate: On March 3, 1998, CBO issued an \n     estimate of S. 1573, which would increase the minimum wage \n     rate in three annual steps to $6.65 per hour and then would \n     adjust the minimum wage thereafter to reflect changes in the \n     Consumer Price Index. The current estimate of the direct cost \n     to the private sector is based on the same methodology.\n       Estimate prepared by: Ralph Smith.\n       Estimate approved by: Joseph Antos, Assistant Director for \n     Health and Human Resources.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ This estimate is derived from information on job tenure, \n     by age, provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, based on \n     supplemental questions included in the February 1996 Current \n     Population Survey.\n     \\2\\ Staff within the Department of Labor's Employment \n     Standards Administration, the agency responsible for \n     enforcing the FLSA, report no increase in the number of \n     complaints filed since the minimum wage increased to $5.15.\n     \\3\\ In January 1998, there were almost 2 million workers who \n     reported being paid an hourly wage rate of less than $5.00. \n     Some workers, such as employees in retail firms whose gross \n     volume of sales is less than $500,000 are not covered by the \n     minimum wage, while others, such as certain tipped workers, \n     are covered but can be paid a lower wage rate.\n     \\4\\ See, for example, Alison J. Wellington, ``Effects of the \n     Minimum Wage on the Employment Status of Youths; An Update,'' \n     Journal of Human Resources, Vol. XXVI, No. 1 (Winter 1991), \n     pp. 27-46, Charles Brown, ``Minimum Wage Laws; Are They \n     Overrated?''

That bill did not include the youth \n     differential and other special provisions that were contained \n     in the legislation enacted later that year.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I say that 100,000 to 500,000 lost jobs is too heavy a \npenalty. For that one person who might lose his or her job, it is a \nvery heavy penalty. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco, there would be from 145,000 to 436,000 lost jobs. These are \nindependent studies, not branches of a Don Nickles study group that \nsays this is a bad idea. The CBO and Federal Reserve state that this \nwill cost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n  If there is no job loss or negative economic consequence, why stop at \n$6.15 an hour? Why don't we make it $20 an hour? I want everybody in \nAmerica to make $20 an hour. I do. If they work 2,000 hours a year, \nthat is an average of 40 hours a week for 50 weeks. If everybody made \n$20 an hour, hey, that would be great. That would be $40,000. I would \nlove for everybody in America to make $40,000. But guess what. Some \njobs might not pay that.\n  Does it make good economic sense to pass a law to say it is against \nthe law for somebody to work for $40,000? I don't think so. Whether it \nwould mean the loss of 100,000 jobs or 500,000 jobs, I don't know. But, \nI don't want to put even 100,000 people out of work. I don't want to \ndiscourage any young person or any person at all from trying to climb \nthe economic ladder. We pulled it up. Sorry. We would rather have you \nunemployed than have you climbing the economic ladder.\n  I think that is a huge mistake. I think this proposal is too big of a \nhit, too quickly. I think the tax increase in the Democrat proposal is \ncompletely unworkable and it is certainly unfair.\n  The other side might claim that they paid for their tax cuts, and \nthat Senator Domenici will have a proposal to benefit small business, \nand he didn't pay for his because it comes out of the surplus.\n  I disagree, especially when we are looking at having significant \nsurpluses in the next 10 years. Basically what our Democrat colleagues \nare saying is: We want no tax cut whatsoever.\n  Less than 2 months ago, they voted for a $300 billion tax cut that \nwas not paid for. Now they are saying we have to pay for this; even if \nit is only $18 billion over 5 years, we have to pay for every dime of \nit so we have more money to spend.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the Kennedy proposal.\n  I understand Senator Kennedy and his side have used their hour. If \nthere is no objection, I will yield back the remainder of the time in \nopposition to the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments will be set aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2751\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I rise in support of the \namendment offered by the minority leader to raise the minimum wage from \n$5.15 to $6.15 in two steps by September 1 of the year 2000. Before \naddressing my remarks directly, I want to make two comments. The first \nis really to thank the senior Senator from Massachusetts for his \nprodigious, sustained, and enthusiastic work on a minimum wage \nincrease. I very much doubt that this would be on the calendar were it \nnot for his constant perseverance.\n  The second is to say that I do not believe there is any piece of \nlegislation that has been passed by this Congress or this Senate this \nyear that can have the possible positive impact on Americans an \nincrease in the minimum wage will at this particular point in time. I \nwant to make that argument.\n  This amendment is about families making ends meet. It is about people \nbeing able to pay for rent and put food on the table. The bottom line \nis that the current minimum wage is simply not enough to live on. An \nestimated\n\n[[Page S14263]]\n\n11.4 million workers will benefit from the passage of this amendment; \n1.5 million of them are in California alone. For a full-time worker, a \n$1 an hour increase in the minimum wage means a $2,000 a year raise. \nThat is an extra $2,000 to pay the rent, to buy groceries, to send \ntheir children to school. For these workers, an increase in the minimum \nwage will make a huge difference.\n  Although the number of people living in poverty in the United States \nsince 1992 has declined--and it has--by about 9 percent, from 38 \nmillion people to 34.5 million people, in California the number of \npeople living in poverty has actually remained relatively \nunchanged, 5.19 million people to 5.12 million people living in \npoverty.\n\n  As recently as 1997, California has actually seen a 5 percent \nincrease in the number of people living in poverty. Despite the \nincredible economic growth the United States has experienced throughout \nthe mid and late 1990s, in California more than 15 percent of the \npopulation of the seventh largest economic engine on Earth lives in \npoverty. That is incredible. This troubling statistic clearly shows \nthat not all segments of the workforce are benefiting from the economic \nexpansion.\n  On September 4, the Center on Budget and Policy Priority released \nwhat I am sure my colleagues know, and hopefully will agree, is a very \ndisturbing report on the widening gap between the rich and the poor \nover the last 20 years. California is an example of that gap.\n  Based on data collected by the Congressional Budget Office, the study \nfound that the average after-tax income of the top 20 percent of \nhouseholds increased from about $74,000 in 1977 to more than $102,000 \nin 1999. The average after-tax income of the top 1 percent of the \neconomic earners in this country will almost double, going from \n$234,000 to $515,000 in 1999. This indicates that those in the top \nincome levels are doing very well all across this great Nation.\n  The bad news is that the income of the bottom fifth of households is \nactually falling. It has fallen from $9,900 to $8,700 over the same \nperiod.\n  So while the top income earners are prospering, those at the lower \nend of the income scale are doing worse than a generation ago.\n  When you have a high-cost State, this chasm is actually exaggerated. \nSo what you have is a growing split between the very wealthy and the \nvery poor in this country.\n  In 1977, the top 1 percent of the U.S. households received 7.3 \npercent of the Nation's after-tax income, and 22 years later that has \ngone up; they received 12.9 percent. That is a 4.4 percent increase for \nupper income Americans. In fact, the top 1 percent will receive as much \nafter-tax income as the bottom 38 percent. This means the 2.7 million \nwealthiest Americans will be earning the same amount as the poorest 100 \nmillion Americans.\n  That is the case with 15 percent of the people in California.\n  Over the past several years, we have seen an explosion in the \ncreation of wealth that is unprecedented in U.S. history. The strong \neconomy has brought prosperity to large numbers of people. But that is \nnot the whole story. More individuals and families are earning less and \nhaving a difficult time making ends meet.\n  It is time, I think, that we recognize this and do something about \nit. Passing the Daschle amendment is the first step we can take--50-\ncent minimum wage increase the first year and 50-cent minimum wage the \nsecond year.\n  Perhaps the greatest testament to the inadequacy of the minimum wage \nis that many communities are now recognizing how inadequate it is. And \nthey are moving on their own to create a new concept that is called a \n``living wage.'' These jurisdictions are insisting that those who do \nbusiness with the local government pay their employees a living wage \nsalary.\n  San Jose, CA, has adopted a living wage of $10.75.\n  In San Antonio, TX, it is $10.13 an hour.\n  In Boston, it is $8.23 an hour.\n  In my hometown of San Francisco, there is consideration ongoing for a \nliving wage of $11.\n  More than 35 other localities and municipalities have adopted living \nwages. Clearly, it is a reaction to the inadequacy of the Federal \nminimum wage, which is generally too little too late to sustain people. \nSo it is time for the Federal Government to follow the lead of our \ncities and take the simple step that is so important to millions of \nworking families.\n  Many families in this country are just one paycheck away from \ndisaster, whether it is an illness, the need to move, or a car that \nbreaks down. People live paycheck to paycheck, and they live with the \nfear that they might not be able to make it this month or next month.\n  I think those figures and those statements are responsible for some \nof the things the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out on the floor a \nlittle bit earlier: The fear that families have, the stress that women \nwork under, and the additional hours for women in the workplace more \nthan men, the fact that so many children wish their family could have \nless stress, and could spend more time with them is all a part of this \npicture.\n  People can work 40 hours a week. In the most industrialized country \non Earth, those people still can't support their family, still can't \nrepair a broken car, still can't pay their rent, and still live from \npaycheck to paycheck.\n  In fact, a minimum-wage worker who works 40 hours a week 50 weeks a \nyear earns only $10,300 a year. The poverty line for a family of three \nis $13,880, and, for a family of four, it is $16,700.\n  So you have a worker who is working at a minimum-wage job and has a \nfamily, that worker is substantially below the poverty level and the \nfamily is below the poverty level. What happens? People are forced to \nhold two jobs. Families are forced to have both parents working. \nChildren are often left alone because child care, of course, is too \ncostly or nonexistent.\n  Let me give you one case, a resident of San Francisco. Her name is \nBernardine Emperado. She works more than 60 hours a week at a rental \ncar job, and she supplements this salary by selling hot dogs at 49ers \ngames on Sunday.\n  Nobody can tell me rental car agencies shouldn't pay a minimum wage \nof $6-plus. Nobody can ever convince me of that. Despite two incomes, \nshe can't afford her own apartment. She lives with her mother and \ncollege-age daughter. Something is seriously wrong with our wage scale \nif someone working 60 hours a week is unable to afford life's basic \nnecessities.\n  The traditional argument against raising the minimum wage is that \nwhen you increase wages, it costs jobs. And we just heard the majority \nwhip make that point eloquently. The facts don't bear that out. Since \nthe minimum wage was increased in October of 1996, we have gained 8.7 \nmillion new jobs in this country, most of them in the form of small \nbusinesses and new businesses. As a matter of fact, that has been the \nexplosion--new businesses, small businesses, just the businesses that \npay many of their people a minimum-wage salary.\n  In a strong economy, raising the minimum wage will not cost jobs. And \nit is time to do it. As a matter of fact, there is no better time to do \nit than when the economy is flush. And the economy has not been this \nflush in a long time.\n  I say to you that if we fail to raise the minimum wage, and to raise \nit on a regular basis, we will see virtually every city in this Nation, \nin addition to the 35 that are now doing it, enact their own living \nwage. This will vary. I think we will increasingly find this minimum \nwage is going to be $10 or more if it is left to the city.\n\n  I think it is prudent to raise the minimum wage. I think this is the \ntime to do it. I think it is unfair to ask someone to live on $10,000. \nI think for the millions of workers who, as a product of this action, \nwill have $2,000 more in their pocket to pay for rent, to pay for \nclothes, to fix a car, to make a move, this is the single most \nimportant piece of social economic legislation this body can pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I am very pleased to introduce a minimum wage amendment on behalf of \nmyself and many other Senators. With reference to the minimum wage, \nthis coming January under the amendment Senator Kennedy introduced, \nminimum wage goes up 50 cents; 12 months\n\n[[Page S14264]]\n\nlater it goes up 50 cents again. Under the proposal which I offer \ntoday, it will go up 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents each March 1. It \nis also a $1 increase in minimum wage. It takes 12 months longer, so \nthis will be completed in 2002. At that point, it will be $6.15.\n  I think Senator Nickles made a point. If the economy, or if training \npeople for jobs, or if employers being able to pay for the services \nemployees render, if none of that was relevant, then everyone would \nlike a minimum wage bill that might be higher than either of these two. \nThat is what we would wish for everyone.\n  Up front, I remind everyone the best economic advice we have is 50 \npercent of the minimum-wage jobs affected have to do with teenagers. \nHalf of the minimum-wage jobs we are talking about are the young men \nand women who are working while they are attending school--afterschool \nand in the summer months--at either the McDonald's drive-ins or various \nplaces across America.\n  It seems to this Senator, a minimum wage that applies to 50 percent \nof the minimum-wage earners in America, who are students, and that goes \nup 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents, respectively, over the next 26 \nmonths, since it far exceeds inflation, it is good for the teenagers of \nAmerica, good for those who hire them, and an excellent way to make \nsure that portion of the American population in their first entry jobs \nin our marketplace-oriented economy get a chance to earn that money, to \nlearn what it is to work, and at the same time make that large group of \nyoung American men and women a part of the marketplace.\n  If we make it too high, businesses won't be hiring them and they will \nbe looking to others to fill the jobs. We still need in America a place \nfor people to start.\n  If we had a minimum wage bill and that is all we did, knowing what we \nknow about welfare reform, we would not have a very good bill. The work \nopportunity credit, where employers give welfare men and women a job, \nis now a temporary work incentive credit; we make that permanent. That \nmeans as we have reduced the assistance for welfare in the United \nStates by 48 percent, down to 2.7 million people, we want the employees \nof America to make a living wage. We want them to have a chance, but we \nalso want to encourage them to be hired, even if there is some \nadditional training and some skills that have to be added along the \nway.\n  We are increasing opportunities for the young people, and we are \nincreasing many of the welfare-related jobs with this additional \nminimum wage we are adding. Many in this body worked hard on the work \nopportunity credit. I can recall back in the 1970s when I first came \nhere, we started that as a work incentive program for the \ndisadvantaged, disabled, and others by giving a tax credit. It was \nhighly abused later. People wanted to get rid of it, but the idea \nremained to give American small business an opportunity to hire people \nwho may need a little extra help, a little more guidance, a little more \nskill and training. We give them credit for that. We have done that.\n  We have two provisions in this amendment directed at health care. One \nof them is a very dramatic change from the way we have treated health \ncare in the past. It is not going to cost very much because we are not \nso sure how many people will understand it. We are going to say to \nAmerican men and women if they are not getting health insurance on \ntheir job, we give them an opportunity to buy their own health \ninsurance and they can deduct every single penny of their health \ninsurance from their pay before paying income tax.\n  Heretofore, we were letting them pool those expenses along with other \nhealth care costs and if that exceeded 7.5 percent of the income, they \ncould deduct it. There are many people who work for small businesses \nand others would don't furnish insurance, and perhaps they could buy \ntheir own insurance. But right now, they don't get to deduct the \npremiums. We add that to the basket of opportunities for health \ninsurance.\n\n  Then, there are the independent employees who work essentially for \nthemselves. Under this bill, we finally make the health care costs 100 \npercent deductible. I think health insurance deduction is very \nimportant for the self-employed.\n  We increase the small business expensing, which means there are \ncertain items they can deduct, up to $30,000 under this new law in the \nyear of the expanse rather than having to charge it off over time, \nwhich is desired by small business that will bear the brunt of this \nadded minimum wage.\n  We reduce the unemployment surtax, and we make permanent the work \nopportunity tax credit. A number of pension plans are reformed in this \nlegislation so that more of the small businesses in this country will \nbe able to take maximum advantage of their employees creating pension \nplans under the auspices of their employer as we currently have them in \nnumerable places in the Tax Code.\n  We can talk about how this affects our individual States. I will have \nfor the record how the Domenici plan will affect New Mexicans on the \ntax side once we have it figured out, as well as on the minimum wage \nside.\n  In summary, we will increase the minimum wage in the Domenici \namendment--which the occupant of the Chair is a cosponsor, and I thank \nhim for that--increase it $1, but it will take 12 additional months \nbefore we get to that. It will be 35 cents, 35 cents, and 30 cents. \nSenator Kennedy does it in two installments. Senators have to decide \nwhich best fits the needs of our country.\n  If we were wishing and hoping, we would pay everybody a lot more. I \nrepeat, half of the minimum wage earners in America are young people \nwho are in part-time jobs, such as afterschool and summer jobs. We \nbelieve the 3-year installment increase, which far exceeds inflation \nannually as it applies to the current minimum wage, is probably good \nfor the teenagers of our country, good to keep them employed, get them \nthat entrance job and not have so many owners looking around for other \nemployees who have more experience, which they will if we make the \nminimum wage too high.\n\n  In addition, many of those getting off welfare--and we know there are \nthousands--they need some training and some extra skills preparation \nand the like. We are hoping they will get jobs. We are increasing their \ntake-home pay so they can, indeed, have a better chance of succeeding \noff the rolls and move up the employment chain and get better and \nbetter jobs. The other things I mentioned in the health care field will \nbe welcomed by millions of Americans, and in particular millions, \nmillions of self-employed business men and women across America.\n  With that, I know there are others who would like to speak, if not \ntonight, we obviously will share time with them tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, will somebody yield time to me?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I yield 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 10 minutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2751\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I was very impressed with the statement of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts earlier when he showed us the charts of \nhow minimum wage has not kept up with inflation. As I recall the chart \nof the Senator, it was very dramatic, showing with the minimum wage \nincrease of $1 over 2 years, still we would not keep up with inflation \nin real terms.\n  He had a second chart. If you chart the poverty line, you will see \nthe minimum wage has constantly been below the poverty line. So for all \nthose who are worried about statistics and figures, rest assured this \nincrease in the minimum wage proposed by the Senator from Massachusetts \nis not above inflation. It may be true in 1 year's time it is above \nwhat inflation might be in that single year, but on the question \nwhether minimum wage has kept up with inflation or not, historically it \nhas not kept up with inflation.\n  Second, I want to relate a personal story which made a huge \ndifference to me.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator be good enough to yield on that point?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator talked about the poverty line and the \nminimum wage. There is a third element, and that is productivity. As we \npointed\n\n[[Page S14265]]\n\nout in the earlier presentation, the productivity in the last 10 years \nhas increased by 12 percent, and the total wages of all workers, 1.9 \npercent.\n  The Senator, as a member of the Finance Committee, knows one of the \nkey elements in an economic analysis is the issue of productivity. Here \nwe have fallen so far behind, not only in the poverty rate but also in \nproductivity growth.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is an excellent point. I regret telling the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts I was not able to see that chart, but I am glad the \nSenator has explained this point. It is absolutely true. If you \nincrease productivity, and everybody knows productivity means the \namount of output per worker hour--if productivity has increased \ndramatically, that is all the more reason why it is unfair the minimum \nwage has not kept up with inflation. The amendment offered by the \nSenator from Massachusetts will help accommodate that.\n  The point I was going to make is when I last ran for reelection, I \nwalked across our State. I will never forget talking to a woman, a \nsingle mom, who told me how hard she worked to try to stay off welfare. \nShe had a minimum-wage job in my home State.\n  She tried for a couple of years to stay off welfare. She was \ndetermined to stay off welfare. It was a matter of principle, a matter \nof pride. She slept on the sofa in her parents' home, she did all the \nthings she could do to cut corners so she could raise her young child \nand stay off welfare. But she finally realized with her minimum-wage \njob and the day-care costs--I have forgotten the exact percent, but it \nwas 30 or 40 percent of her take-home pay went to childcare--she could \nnot do it. She had to finally give up and go onto welfare because her \nminimum-wage job did not earn her enough money for her and her child to \nsurvive.\n  We can help get people off the welfare rolls by increasing minimum \nwage. It is not the total solution. There are lots of parts to that \nproblem, lots of parts to the solution. But certainly, raising the \nminimum wage makes a huge difference.\n  I might also add, in my home State of Montana there is a \nvery unfortunate economic trend. In 1946, Montana ranked 10th in per \ncapita income. In roughly 1992 or 1993, Montana ranked not 10th anymore \nbut about 35th or 36th. Where does Montana rank today in per capita \nincome? It depends on how you calculate it, but 48th, 49th, or 50th.\n\n  The State used to be a natural resources, commodity-based State with \nmining business and timber industries that had good-paying jobs; in \nagriculture income was up too. Today, those mining jobs, those timber \nindustry jobs, those commodity-based resource jobs are disappearing \nbecause of the greater importance of value added. We are now becoming a \ntourism State, a recreation State, a service industry State. And \nservice industries pay very low wages compared with commodity-based \nindustries.\n  I am sure this is true in lots of other States in the Nation. An \nincrease in the minimum wage is going to help increase the pay for \nservice jobs, which is going to help a lot. I might also add keeping \nworkers' pay up only makes sense; it is only fair because of all the \nprofits so many companies have received, particularly over the past \ncouple or 3 years, the best evidence of which is the skyrocketing \nincreases of the stock indexes on the various stock exchanges.\n  It was said earlier this is just a minimum wage for younger people. \nMr. President, I am sure you have experienced this. When you stop in \nMcDonald's, you go to a store, say a Penny's or some store downtown, \nyou are going to find a lot of medium-age people and older people \nworking there. I am astounded at the number of older women who work at \nMcDonald's. I am astounded. This is not only a younger person's issue. \nIn fact, if statistics were shown, my guess is it would be more of a \nwomen's issue and a medium-age issue--people having a hard time making \nends meet, not school kids working for pocket change.\n  Not only should there be an increase in the minimum wage--and I think \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is more than \nfair--the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts is paid \nfor. I ask consent to speak for 5 more minutes\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts is paid \nfor. What do I mean by that? By that I mean that the cost to the \nprivate sector of this increase, by CBO estimates, might be roughly $30 \nbillion over 10 years. The amendment by the Senator from Massachusetts \nhas several key tax cut provisions that would help offset whatever cost \nbusinesses might experience in paying the increased minimum wage. I \nwould like to highlight just a couple.\n  One of the main provisions is a small business pension startup tax \ncredit. We want to help small business. We want to help small business \nprovide pensions for their employees. We all know one of the big \nproblems today is that while big businesses usually provide good \npensions for their employees, small businesses do not, because of their \nnarrower profit margins. It is very difficult to begin a small \nbusiness. Startup costs in particular make the early years very \ndifficult, because you have to pay that payroll tax on the first day of \nbusiness whether or not you make a profit, and when you start out in \nsmall business you are not going to make a profit that first day. You \ndon't have to pay income taxes, but you have to pay that payroll tax. \nSmall businesses therefore have a very hard time doing what a lot of \nthose small businesses want to do: Set up a pension fund for their \nemployees.\n  If we are going to solve the retirement problem of this country, we \ncertainly have to reform Social Security, and we certainly have to \nincrease private savings. But we all know that a third leg of the \nretirement stool is pension benefits. We clearly need more incentives \nso small business can provide pension benefits to their employees. They \nwill be better employees. They will be more likely to stay there. They \nare going to be more committed to the business. And they are going to \nbe more committed to helping that company make a buck. Our package has \na tax credit for small businesses, about $4 billion, to help make that \nhappen.\n  What else do we do? We accelerate the 100-percent deduction of health \ninsurance for the self-employed. The Republican bill does that, and so \ndo we. It is very important that self-employed people get the health \ninsurance deduction quickly.\n  Other major highlights: Our bill has a tax credit for information \ntechnology training expenses. We have heard it many times that a lot of \nsmall firms cannot find enough good employees. There are not enough \naround. We provide a tax credit to those companies for technology \ntraining expenses. It makes a lot of sense.\n  We also provide $2 billion over 10 years for a low-income housing tax \ncredit, to help reduce housing costs of the buildings so many workers \nearning minimum wages live in.\n  We provide estate tax relief. Strangely, that is not in the bill \noffered by the other side. We offer estate tax relief targeted to \nfamily-owned businesses.\n  We increase the unified credit by $450,000 phased in to the year \n2003.\n  In addition, we increase the small business meals deduction up to 60 \npercent in the year 2002. These are all provisions targeted to small \nbusiness.\n  Rather than risking dipping into the Social Security Trust Fund, \nhowever, we pay for our provisions.\n  Why do I say all that? Because the alternative offered on the other \nside is much more expensive. It will lose about $75 billion in revenue \nand there are no offsets for the lost revenue. Our proposal provides \noffsets for the $28 billion tax cut. The major offsets are extending \nthe current Superfund tax and, second, closing corporate tax shelters. \nWe close down a lot of loopholes in current law of which many companies \nare taking advantage.\n  Let me say a couple of words about the ``pay for.'' Right now, the \nbalance in the Superfund trust fund is declining dramatically. In 1996, \nthe balance in the Superfund trust fund was about $4 billion. The \nestimate for this next year is about $1 billion.\n  Why is that important? That is important to continue cleanups under \nthe Superfund Program. If the trust fund is declining rapidly and gets \nclose to zero, we are not going to have the cleanups this country \nwants. That is, ground water is going to be polluted, drinking water \npolluted, hazardous waste in the\n\n[[Page S14266]]\n\nsoil. It is very important we extend the Superfund provisions so the \ntrust fund has the requisite dollars to continue cleanups, irrespective \nof whether we modify the Superfund law. I hope we do. But the trust \nfund is going to decline to zero pretty quickly whether or not Congress \nreauthorizes the trust fund.\n  Second, if we continue this Superfund tax, the Appropriations \nCommittee is more likely to fund Superfund. Technically, it does not \nhave to though it usually appropriates dollars anyway. If the amount of \nmoney in the trust fund continues to be level and does not taper off--\nand I note that it has been tapering off without the continuation of \nthe tax--it is more likely the Appropriations Committee is going to \nfind the dollars for Superfund cleanups. If we do not reinstate the \ntrust fund, what is going to happen? Instead of the polluter paying for \nthe cleanup, it will be the general revenue taxpayer who will pay to \nclean up. The polluters will not be paying for it; the general revenue \ntaxpayer will pay for the pollution caused by major companies. It is \nimperative we extend the Superfund tax.\n\n  The second major ``pay for'' provision we have in our bill is \ntargeted toward tax shelters. Every time Congress shuts down some \nabusive tax shelters, tax attorneys are so smart, they figure out \nanother loophole and a way to beat the system. What we are saying is \nfor $10 billion over 10 years, let's enact a provision which makes \ntransactions such as this much more difficult.\n  Many organizations testified there is a problem that needs to be \naddressed in this area. The American Bar Association, the New York \nState Bar Association, the American Association of CPAs, and many \nothers have testified there has to be a solution to this problem.\n  Even Congressman Archer has admitted we have been very successful in \nshutting down about $50 billion of specific shelters over the last 5 \nyears, and those are just the tip of the iceberg, according to a lot of \npractitioners.\n  So to summarize reasons to support our amendment: No. 1, we increase \nminimum wage because it makes sense, and lets people keep up with \ninflation. No. 2, we give tax breaks to small businesses that need it. \nThey are very directed and targeted to the tune of about $28 billion. \nNo. 3, we pay for our tax breaks in a very fair way. Contrast that with \nthe other side, which stretches out the minimum wage increase, which \nhurts people and, in addition, has a tax bill which is not targeted.\n  I ask for a few more minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 more minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have a chart. I noticed the Senator from \nNew Mexico was looking at it with a quizzical expression on his face. \nThe source is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Everybody has \na chart these days. Essentially, this chart shows the assumptions. This \nline shows the on-budget deficit.\n  The chart assumes we will continue 1999 discretionary spending levels \ninflated for present CPI and historical levels of emergency spending, \nwhich is an average of the last 8 years. It only addresses spending. \nWhat this chart does not show is how much the deficit is going to \nincrease if we pass the tax cut bill from the other side, about $75 \nbillion.\n  This chart shows that, even without the tax cut the other side wants \nto enact, we are not going to reach a surplus until the year 2005 under \ncurrent scorekeeping. If you add to that the $75 billion tax cut, it is \nclearly going to be a lot later before we even get a surplus. Do not \nforget, you have to add in the last interest and expenses that \notherwise would be available.\n  This is a no-brainer. Let's increase minimum wage fairly. Then let's \nenact tax provisions, tax cuts targeted to small business. Let's pay \nfor it in a responsible way. Otherwise, we have the other side which is \nnot paid for, a huge tax break which the President is going to veto \nanyway. So let's pass something the President will sign.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1730, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \nGrassley amendment No. 1730 be modified with the text I now send to the \ndesk and that the vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at 5:30 \nthis evening. That is right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, how much time does our side have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from \nMassachusetts controls 27 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nKennedy amendment and as a cosponsor of the minimum wage increase.\n\n[[Page S14268]]\n\n  In this debate, many people have the wrong idea about who this \nincrease would affect. Many people think the typical wage earner is a \nyoung man or woman flipping burgers or working at a convenience store \ntrying to make a few extra dollars to buy some CD's or to go to the \nmovies. That image is inaccurate. And until we really understand who \nthe people are who rely on the minimum wage, we won't approach this \ndebate with the urgency it requires.\n  To clear up that misconception, let me set the record straight. In \nreality, 70 percent of the people earning a minimum wage are over the \nage of 20. That means that 11.4 million adults this year will have to \ntry to live on a salary of $10,700.\n  Forty percent of these same adults are the sole source of income for \ntheir families. These are people who are working hard--just to get by \nand support their families. They deserve a fighting chance.\n  I am especially concerned that 59 percent of those struggling on the \nminimum wage are women. 6.8 million women--many of these single \nmothers--would benefit directly from this increase.\n  These single mothers are doing their best. They are trying to raise \ntwo kids--on average--on a below-poverty income. And how does this \nCongress support these struggling parents? By attacking programs like \nMedicaid, by cutting child care support, by taking away funding for \nnutrition programs, and by taking actions that hurt working families in \nneed.\n  These are the same group of people that Congress says it wants to \nkeep off of public support.\n  But how does this Congress support these struggling parents? By \ncutting vital programs and fighting efforts like this one--an effort \nthat will help them work themselves above the poverty line.\n  This amendment does not eliminate jobs. It keeps people working--\npeople who otherwise would be completely reliant on public support. \nJust a $1.00 raise would generate $2,000 in potential income for \nminimum wage workers. For an average family of four, that means 7 \nmonths of groceries, 5 months of rent, or 13 months of health care \nexpenses.\n  I reached my decision to support this increase after very careful \nconsideration. I have listened to the concerns of small business owners \nfrom across my state, who shared with me their thoughts about this \nincrease.\n  I am happy to say that most of the businesses in Washington state are \nexperiencing unprecedented growth.\n  In fact, since the federal minimum wage was last increased in 1996-\n97, employment in Washington has grown. Since September 1996, 231,900 \nnew jobs have been created in Washington state--an increase of 9.5%. \nWashington's economy is strong, and our low-wage workers should share \nin that success.\n  Because my constituents understand the value of the minimum wage, \nthey overwhelmingly passed their own minimum wage increase last year in \nWashington state. They raised the state minimum wage to $5.70 this \nyear. In the year 2000, it will move to $6.50, and after that it will \nbe indexed based on the Consumer Price Index. Mr. President, we should \nfollow the example of my state and increase the minimum wage for all \nAmericans.\n  The increase that we passed in the last Congress should be the first \nstep--not the last--on our road to help these hard-working citizens.\n  It should be the first step because the economy and our world have \nchanged--and we need to keep up with those changes. In 1979, a person \ncould work 40 hours a week at minimum wage and stay out of poverty. \nToday, it takes 52 hours. To just reach the poverty line for a family \nof four, the minimum wage would have to be $7.89. That's why our last \nincrease was a good start and why this proposed increase is the next \nvital step to helping these working families rise out of poverty.\n  Overall, a slight increase in the minimum wage provides those who \nwork hard and play-by-the-rules an increased opportunity to succeed. If \nany of my colleagues oppose this minimum wage increase, I would ask \nthem to consider trying to live on $10,700 this year--not just live on \nit--but try to raise a family on it. I think when you consider this \ndebate in those terms, the right thing to do becomes clear.\n  It would be embarrassing if this Congress voted to raise its own \nsalary but didn't vote to let hard-working American families work their \nway out of poverty.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to increase the minimum wage. Let's show \nthe American people that we have our priorities straight.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I ask, is the Senator speaking on \nhis time on the Domenici amendment?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That's correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, following \nthe distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nbe the next speaker on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when the Senate returns tomorrow morning, \nour very first vote will be an important one for literally millions of \nAmerican workers and families, and some 320,000 in Illinois, who are \nwatching carefully to see if this Senate is listening to America. It is \nthe question of the minimum wage and whether or not it is going to be \nincreased.\n  Senator Kennedy has a proposal that I support which calls for an \nincrease in the minimum wage from the current level of $5.15 an hour to \n50 cents more on January 1 of the year 2000, and then 50 cents again on \nthe following January 1.\n  So that those who are going to work every single day, trying to raise \ntheir families, trying to make a decent income, will, in fact, move \ncloser to a livable wage. This is still a long way away from it because \npeople who are earning $5.15 an hour or $6.15 an hour hardly live in \nthe lap of luxury.\n  There is a noteworthy difference between the approach being suggested \nby my friend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, on the \nRepublican side, and the suggestion of Senator Kennedy, my friend and \ncolleague on the Democratic side, when it comes to a minimum wage. The \ndifference may seem cosmetic to those who do not take a close look \nbecause the Republican side suggests that to raise the minimum wage by \n$1, we should take an extra year or 3 years instead of 2 to achieve \nthis.\n  What does that mean to the working person? If the Republican approach \nshould pass, it means $1,200. For someone making $50,000 a year or \n$100,000, or more, $1,200 hardly seems to be a grand amount of money to \nbe worried over when you stretch it over a period of time. But imagine \nif your income was only $10,000 a year on a minimum wage, and what is \nat stake here is $1,200. The Republican approach would shortchange \nthose who go to work every single day in America on a minimum wage by \n$1,200 as they stretch this out over a 3-year period of time.\n  Of course, the bill does much more than address the increase in the \nminimum wage. It also addresses some needed changes in tax law.\n  I support Senator Kennedy's approach. He does provide the kind of \nrelief which small businesses need in order to find the tax relief to \nprovide things for their employees. It is a proposal from Senator Chuck \nRobb of Virginia and Senator Max Baucus of Montana, a small business \ntax proposal which, among other things, finally puts a 100-percent \ndeduction for the health insurance costs of self-employed people. The \nSenate and Congress have been moving toward this goal. This bill will \nachieve it on the Democratic side, if it is passed.\n  It also provides assistance to small businesses that provide child \ncare. Think about families, particularly single mothers and single \nparents who have to worry every single day whether or not their kids \nare safe. This is an incentive for small businesses to provide child \ncare facilities, a tax credit, one that can assist them and their \nworkers.\n  In addition, there is a pension package which has been supported by \nSenator Graham, a Democrat of Florida, and Senator Grassley, a \nRepublican of Iowa. The Democratic package is not only a well-balanced \npackage providing child care health and retirement benefits for small \nbusinesses, but more important than anything, the Democratic\n\n[[Page S14269]]\n\npackage is paid for. It is paid for. The Republican package of tax \nchanges is not.\n  In other words, it is an extension of the possibility of debt. It is \na promise that can't be kept. The Democratic package is paid for. The \nRepublican one is not. The Democratic package increases the minimum \nwage over 2 years by $1 an hour, and the Republicans over 3 years \ncosting workers $1,200 by taking the Republican approach.\n  I say to those who are working across America that this is hardly \nwhat they need. It is curious to me that only a few weeks ago, the same \nRepublican Party that cannot produce $1,200 for people who get up and \ngo to work every day at minimum-wage jobs came before us with a $792 \nbillion tax cut primarily for wealthiest people in this country.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can we have order? The Senator deserves \nto be heard.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. President, consider that only a few weeks ago, this Chamber was \nseriously considering a $792 billion tax cut for some of the wealthiest \npeople in America, and many people on the other side of the aisle said \nthat is good, wise policy. Alan Greenspan of the Federal Reserve didn't \nthink so. Frankly, the people of America don't think so. They told the \nRepublican Party to keep this tax cut primarily for wealthy people.\n  Now comes a proposal from the Republican side when it comes to the \nworking families that would cut out $1,200 in income, $1,200 to a \nfamily making about $10,000 a year. That is an upside down priority. \nThat is a priority that forgets the real people who are working in this \ncountry to make America strong. Eleven point four million workers would \nget a pay increase with the Democratic Kennedy minimum wage increase \npackage, and with this proposed increase that Senator Kennedy has \nproposed and I am supporting, it means over $2,000 a year for people \nwho are scraping to get by, primarily women who are in the minimum wage \nworkforce, African-Americans, and Hispanics, people who go to work \nevery single day who understand the importance of work and deserve our \nrespect for doing so.\n  The vote tomorrow morning will be a measure of how much respect we \nhave for them. This $2,000 increase for these workers can mean 7 months \nof groceries, 5 months of rent, 10 months of utilities, tuition and \nfees at a community college so one of their kids has a chance to even \nhave a better and more successful life.\n  I say to the Senate this is a test. It is a test as we wrap up this \nsession about where our values will be. Will they be with these working \nfamilies? Will we make certain they get an increase in their basic wage \nor will we stand with those who want to delay it and delay and delay \nit? The argument is often made that if you increase the minimum wage, \nyou are going to lose jobs.\n  Take a look at my home State of Illinois. Since the 1996 increase in \nthe minimum wage, take a look at the real statistics: 268,100 new jobs \nsince we last increased the minimum wage; 33,100 new retail jobs, the \narea where most minimum-wage jobs are found; unemployment is down 10 \npercent; and the unemployment rate is 4.7 percent.\n  As we increase the minimum wage, we have not seen all of the things \nthat the Republicans tell us we should be afraid of--afraid of losing \njobs and creating chaos in the workplace. Exactly the opposite has \nhappened across America. Since we last raised the minimum wage, we have \nseen an economy moving forward.\n  Now the real test for this Senate is whether or not we are going to \nbring on board this ship as it moves forward the people who get up and \ngo to work every single day, the men and women who work in the \nconvenience stores, who make our beds in motels and hotels we stay in \novernight, the folks who serve our food and cook it in the kitchen. \nThese are the invisible people who keep America moving forward. But \nthese invisible people will be watching tomorrow to see if this Senate \nis going to give the minimum wage increase which is so essential.\n  I hope those on the Republican side who are preaching fiscal \nintegrity and fiscal soundness will think twice about voting for a bill \nthat not only stretches the minimum wage an extra year but provides tax \ncuts without compensating offsets. What does that mean in layman's \nterms? The Republican package doesn't pay for the tax cuts that they \nare trying to enact. They have some good ideas, I am sure. But it isn't \nhonest if you didn't pay for them.\n  What Senator Kennedy and the Democrats have done, what we have said \nis when it comes to small business and the tax proposal, we have the \nmeans of paying for them. And by and large, we are going to make sure \nthat when the small businesses that enact these increases in the \nminimum wage turn to us and say, are you listening to some of our other \nconcerns, the answer will be yes. We want to make sure you can deduct \nevery single penny of your health insurance premiums as every major \ncorporation can. Self-employed people, farmers, and small businesses \ndeserve the same benefit: Make sure that there is a facility available \nfor child care; make sure that a pension package can be offered--things \nthat will help small businesses extend opportunities for their \nworkforce and create better employee moral and productivity.\n  I close by saying that this vote tomorrow morning at 10:30 is a test \nof the Senate's will and the Senate's values. I hope that we will stand \nby people who go to work every single day.\n  It is one thing to preach on the floor about people looking for a \nhandout; these folks are looking for a hand up. They are working and \nneed assistance and an increase in their minimum wage. I rise in strong \nsupport of the proposal by Senator Kennedy. I hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2547\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to support the Domenici \nsubstitute for the Kennedy amendment because I think it strikes the \nbalance we need to have. We have a strong economy today. We want to \nmake sure it stays strong. We are talking about a minimum wage increase \nthat is $1 over a period of 3 years. This should not be a shock to the \nsmall businesses, the farmers, and the ranchers who are concerned about \nhaving base costs go up--not even people who don't pay minimum wage but \npeople who are concerned about paying at the higher levels and \nincreasing the potential for inflation. I think stretching it out over \n1 more year makes sense.\n  I also think we need to look at the small business tax cuts we tried \nto give to small businesses in the tax cut package the President \nvetoed. We have brought some of those back. It provides a balance of \nadding more to the working person, especially the part-time worker, but \nalso giving a little bit of tax help to the self-employed and small \nbusiness people who might get hit by having the whole wage scale \nincreased. What we are looking for is balance.\n  I will talk about a few of the tax cuts with which we are going to \ntry to help small business. First is an amendment from a bill I \nintroduced that is called the Bonus Incentive Act. Today, employers can \ngive a performance-based bonus to a person who is exempt, a salaried \nemployee, and that person will be able to take that bonus, pay their \nwithholding taxes, and go on their merry way; an employer can't do that \nfor an hourly employee. If they give a performance-based bonus to an \nhourly employee, the employer has to go back and figure the whole \nyear's wages and refigure any overtime pay that has been given to that \nemployee. Many employers say it is just not worth the trouble, or they \ntry to disguise the bonus as something else.\n  Employers have come to Congress and testified they want to be able to \nreward hourly employees for good service. At the House Education and \nWorkforce Committee, Pam Farr, the former senior vice president for \nMarriott Lodging, recently testified that Marriott used game-sharing \nplans for customer service personnel that rewarded employees for \nfriendly treatment of customers. Cordant Technologies, which makes \nsolid rocket boosters for the space shuttle, rewards their workers for \nreaching goals, for workplace safety, indirect cost reduction, and \ncustomer satisfaction. Many employers are concerned about all the \npaperwork\n\n[[Page S14270]]\n\nthat would have to be prepared if they gave this employment bonus. In \nother testimony from a human resources director, it took 4 people 160 \nhours to calculate the bonuses for 235 employees.\n  What has been incorporated into the Domenici amendment makes it easy \nfor employers to give performance-based bonuses to hourly employees. \nThere is no reason we should have a big, mumbo-jumbo set of regulations \nthat make it difficult. We want to make it easier for those employees \nto be rewarded for merit.\n  Other tax relief in this bill is an above-the-line real deduction for \nhealth insurance expenses for individuals who don't have health care \ncoverage. I know people who don't have insurance who have huge medical \nbills. Why shouldn't they be able to deduct all of their medical \nexpenses if they don't have employer-provided insurance coverage? It \nalso provides 100-percent deductibility for health care insurance for \nthe self-employed.\n  I think it should be the goal of everyone in this Chamber to \nencourage employers to be able to give health insurance to their \nemployees and for the self-employed or the individual to buy health \ninsurance. Why wouldn't we give incentives for people to buy health \ncare insurance? We have been talking about that for the last 5 years. \nWhy don't we put our incentives where they can make a difference?\n  It also accelerates an increase in small business expensing. This is \nparticularly helpful for farmers with direct expensing and accelerating \nthe expensing, especially for small businesses. It reduces the Federal \nunemployment tax that small businesses pay from 0.8 percent to 0.6 \npercent. It makes permanent the work opportunity tax credit. This is a \nvery important tax credit that is an incentive for people to hire \npeople off welfare. It gives a tax credit of up to $2,400 for wages \npaid to employees who are hired right off the welfare rolls. We think \nthis is a wonderful opportunity to give the people whom we want to give \na chance at contributing to their families, coming off welfare, to have \nthat incentive for the employer to hire the person off welfare and give \nthat person that first chance to be a contributing member of society.\n  These are some of the tax relief parts of the bill I think are so \nimportant.\n  There is one more area I want to talk about because it is my \namendment. This is an amendment I have introduced before. It was in the \nbill the President unfortunately vetoed. In fact, I introduced this \nbill 2 years ago. It allows women over 50 to have makeup payments to \ntheir pension plans. How many women do we know who have left the \nworkforce to have their children or to raise their children until they \ngo into elementary school, or perhaps they stay home and raise their \nchildren all the way through high school; then they come back into the \nworkforce. Perhaps they lose their spouse and they don't have a good \nsource of income. They go back to work, and they are penalized in their \npension systems and their stability in their retirement years because \nthey lost all those years that would allow them to start building that \npension plan.\n  Women who leave the workforce to raise their children and then come \nback are penalized in this society. These are the people who need \nretirement stability the most. These are the people who live the \nlongest and who don't have the same opportunity for a pension plan \nbecause they haven't been able to establish a pension over the years \nbecause they have stayed home and raised their children.\n  Senator Domenici's amendment allows women over 50 who are coming back \ninto the workplace to make up the payments they have lost when they \nleft the workplace. The Domenici amendment is a good amendment. It is a \nbalanced amendment. It provides a minimum wage increase over a 3-year \nperiod, and it gives help and relief to the small businesses of our \ncountry that are going to be hit by the minimum wage increase. This \nwill offset it.\n  These are good reliefs. It is relief for health insurance coverage. \nIt is relief for people who have medical expenses, who don't have \nhealth care coverage. It is relief for small business expensing, relief \nfor women who are discriminated against in the pension systems when \nthey leave the workplace to raise their children and then cannot \ncontinue to contribute to their retirement systems. It reduces the \nFederal unemployment tax that is a huge burden on small businesses, and \nit makes permanent the Work Opportunity Tax Credit, the credit that \ngives a $2,400 tax credit to people who hire people off welfare.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this balanced approach, giving help \nto the workers, giving help to the small business people who may be \naffected by this added expense in their business. It is a fair \napproach. It is a balanced approach. I think it will have the best \nchance to keep our economy strong by keeping the people in business who \nare creating the jobs that keep this economy going. We want more \nopportunity for more workers, and that is what this amendment will do.\n  I urge support for the Domenici amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 17 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I think it is probably appropriate the Senate take a \nmoment to look at what the majority leader has stated about increasing \nthe minimum wage. Over the course of the afternoon, we have had a \nnumber of speakers who have made a powerful case in favor of increasing \nthe minimum wage. Yet we have against this background what the majority \nleader, Senator Lott, said about our proposal:\n\n       It will not go to the President. I can guarantee you that.\n\n  So the American people ought to understand no matter how they might \nagree with us and are convinced of both the importance and the fairness \nof the issue, that is the position of the majority leader. That is part \nof the difficulty and the complexity we have been facing over this \nwhole year. There has been this unalterable opposition to any break for \nthe hardest working Americans, the ones at the lower rung of the \neconomic ladder. Even if we are able to somehow be successful in \nwinning this tomorrow morning, it is not going to go to the President. \nHe is going to use every effort he possibly can to defeat this.\n  Earlier this evening, the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, \npointed out CBO estimates of a loss of 100,000 to 500,000 jobs. Those \nare absolutely identical figures to what they said when we raised it in \n1996 and 1997. They were found to be completely inaccurate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the references \nto 27 different studies that have been done nationwide, looking at the \neconomic impact of the last increase in the minimum wage that will \nindicate positively that there has been an expansion of employment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStudies That Conclude a Moderate Increase in the Minimum Wage Does Not \n                               Cost Jobs\n\n       Belman, Dale, and Paul Wolfson. 1998. ``The Minimum Wage: \n     The Bark Is Worse Than The Bite.''

Ottawa: Privy \n     Council Office.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, perhaps tomorrow we will be able to take \nthe time to talk about what is happening to minimum-wage workers. As I \nmentioned earlier today, minimum-wage workers are teachers' aides, \nnursing home aides. Nursing home aides have a 94-percent turnover. The \nprincipal reason for the turnover is because they are paid so poorly. \nThey are the people working to try to provide some care and attention \nto the elderly. I see our good friend from Connecticut who has been a \nleader in establishing day care. The turnover that is taking place in \nthe day-care centers is very similar. It is not quite as high but very \ndramatic. These are our children. This is our future. This is as a \nresult of failing to provide an adequate increase in the minimum wage.\n  There are two final points I want to raise with regard to the \nRepublican proposal. As has been mentioned earlier, the effect of the \nRepublican proposal will mean that 3 years from now, the average \nminimum-wage worker will have made $1,200 less--$1,200 less--than they \nwould have if we had passed the Daschle proposal. That is a lot of \nmoney for working Americans. That is 5 months of rent, a year of \ntuition, 6 months of utilities. This is important to hard-working \nAmericans, make no mistake about it.\n  It might not mean a lot to Members of the Senate who have just voted \nthemselves a $4,600 pay increase. We are not deferring that pay \nincrease for Senators 2 years or 3 years. We are saying the minimum \nwage ought to be over a 2-year period. But our Republican friends say, \nno, let's spread it over 3 years. We are not doing that with regard to \nour pay increase.\n  I hope when Members go back and talk to their constituents, they are \nable to justify why we were worth $4,600 more this year while saying no \nto hard-working Americans--they are not worth 50 cents more next year \nand 50 cents more the year after.\n  Finally, I want to mention one very important aspect of the \nRepublican proposal that has not been addressed.\n  I yield myself 2 more minutes, Mr. President.\n  With this particular chart, we illustrate what we have been facing \nover this past year with regard to the Republican attack on working \nfamilies: Resisting a pay increase with the minimum wage; balancing the \nbudget on the backs of the working poor. Governor Bush pointed that \nout. You do not have to hear it from Democrats. We have seen some \nretreat on that by the Republican leadership. Then providing pensions \nfor the wealthiest individuals as they do under this proposal; blocking \nworkers' rights to organize, the salting bill; and undermining worker \nsafety, providing the waivers of penalties for violations of OSHA; \ncutting workers' pay.\n  You can say, where does that come in? Under the Republican proposal, \nthey recalculate how overtime is going to be considered. This has not \nbeen done since 1945 when the proposal was struck down by the Supreme \nCourt which said they basically, fundamentally undermine the Fair Labor \nStandards Act. If you take the Republican proposal on recomputing \novertime, effectively you are undermining what many workers would be \nable to receive with an increase in the minimum wage. There has not \nbeen a word of that spoken by the proponents of this amendment. They \ntucked this right into their particular proposal.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am listening to this for the first time. This has \nnot been a part of this debate. There are 73 million Americans right \nnow who are entitled to overtime pay. Is the Senator saying part of the \nRepublican amendment effectively repeals the overtime pay provisions of \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act, which act has been in effect for 60 \nyears? This is a cornerstone of fairness for working families in this \ncountry. Is that what the Senator is saying?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This Senator is saying there will be an overtime \npayment, but the overtime payment will be calculated in a way that will \ndiminish, in a significant way, the actual overtime workers should be \nentitled to and the way it has been computed for the last 45 years. It \nis a dramatic change in the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  The Supreme Court has said, as I said, if that provision had been \naccepted when it was offered in 1945, it effectively emasculates the \novertime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The overtime words \nwill be there, there will be a base pay that they will pay overtime on, \nbut not the way they are being paid now. The Republican proposal will \nundermine, in a significant and dramatic way, the way that hourly \nworkers are being paid in the United States.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one final question for the Senator. If \ncompanies are going to now be able to make the payment in bonuses and \ndo an end run, basically, around the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is \nso important to 73 million Americans who right now are entitled to that \novertime pay, then am I not correct that what the Republicans are \nproposing is not a step forward, it is a great leap backward; that this \noverturns 60 years of sweat and tears of workers' commitment to getting \na fair pay for fair work, including overtime work?\n  They give a minimum wage increase with one hand and then they \nbasically repeal part of the Fair Labor Standards Act with the other \nhand. People need to understand this, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It is one of the \nreasons why we ought to have an opportunity to debate this in the light \nof day, not under the time limit. We are forced to take these time \nlimits in order to at least have a vote on the minimum wage. But this \nissue is too important to working families to be dismissed lightly. I \nhope, for reasons I have outlined briefly, the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Mexico will not be accepted.\n  The Senator from Connecticut desires time. I know the Senator from \nIowa wants time. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n\n[[Page S14272]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding this time. \nI commend him for his leadership on the minimum wage issue. There is so \nmuch to talk about concerning the proposal of the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the distinguishing features between that and what is \nbeing offered on the other side.\n  We are talking about a 50-cent increase over the next 2 years, as \nopposed to a 35-cent increase in year one and year two and a 30-cent \nincrease in year three. But there is an added feature to the Republican \nproposal on which some may not have focused. While they are suggesting \napproximately 33 cents a year for minimum-wage workers, there is also \nroughly a $75 billion tax cut, the bulk of which goes to the top income \nearners of the country. That is part of their minimum wage package.\n  It is somewhat ironic that we are talking about a 30-cent to 35-cent \nincrease for the lowest paid workers in the country instead of 50 \ncents, and we are going to have a $75 billion tax cut, the bulk of \nwhich goes to the top income earners in the country.\n  By the way, there is no offset for the $75 billion tax cut. We do not \nknow where the money comes from to pay for that. We heard a lot of \nspeeches in the last couple of weeks about not dipping into the Social \nSecurity trust funds. One basic question is, From where does the $75 \nbillion come? How are we paying for that? I have yet to hear anybody \nexplain from where it is going to come. I put that out for \nconsideration as we talk about these amendments this evening.\n  It is extremely important for a lot of people that we increase the \nminimum wage; 11.4 million people will actually get a pay raise if the \nminimum wage increase goes into effect. Some may say the economy has \nbeen so great, everyone is doing so well, why do people at the minimum-\nwage level need to have any increase at all?\n  While the economy has been fabulous and unprecedented historically, \nnot everybody in America has been the beneficiary of this great \nprosperity. For a lot of Americans in the bottom 20 percent of income \nearners, things have been rather stagnant. This income group has not \nseen the kind of tremendous increase in their earning power as have the \ntop 1 percent of households.\n  The top 1 percent of households is expected to gain 115 percent in \nafter-tax income as compared to an only 8-percent gain for the middle \nfifth of households in America. In contrast, the lowest fifth of \nhouseholds experienced a 9-percent decline during the same period, from \n1977 through 1999.\n  If you were doing well in America in 1977, then you are doing even \nbetter today. If you are in the middle in America, you have had a \nslight increase of about 8 percent. If you are in the bottom 20 \npercent, you have actually seen a decline in your earning power in the \nlast 20 years.\n  While we herald the great success of the economy with the lowest \nunemployment rates in years, we need to remind ourselves that for a lot \nof our citizens from Maine to California who work every day at the \nbottom levels of the economic ladder in this country, it has not been a \ngreat period for them.\n  We talk about 50 cents, $1 over 2 years. What better way to welcome \nthe new millennium, than to say to 11.4 million workers in this \ncountry: We recognize your contributions to the success of this country \nby giving you a $1 increase over the next 2 years.\n  What does that amount to? How about 7 months of groceries; 5 months \nof rent for the average minimum-wage worker; 10 months of utility \nbills; about 1\\1/2\\ years of tuition and fees at a community college.\n  Mr. President, $1 over 2 years may not seem like a lot, but if you \nmultiply that at a 40-hour workweek, 52 weeks a year, that dollar makes \na huge difference to some of the lowest paid workers in America. Again \nI mention, there are 11.4 million workers who will directly benefit \nfrom the Kennedy proposal to increase the minimum wage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Seventy percent of the workers who would benefit are over \nthe age of 20; 59 percent are women; 46 percent of these people have \nfull-time jobs; 15 percent are African American; 18 percent are \nHispanic American; and 46 percent work in retail.\n  The great boom that has occurred in our economy has been magnificent \nfor those at the upper-income levels. Unfortunately, after-tax income \nhas remained relatively flat for those in the middle, and actually \ndeclined for those in the bottom 20 percent.\n  This minimum wage increase will make a difference to some of the \nhardest working people in this country. I hope by tomorrow when this \nissue comes for a vote, a proposal to increase the minimum wage, not \nsmuggle a $75 billion tax cut without paying for it, will be the choice \nof the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time remains on this side on \nthe minimum wage issue?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-nine minutes 39 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the pension \nreform provisions which have been included in the minimum wage and \nbusiness tax amendment sponsored by colleague Senator Domenici.\n  Earlier this year I cosponsored with Senator Bob Graham of Florida, \ncomprehensive pension reform legislation--S. 741, The Pension Coverage \nand Portability Act. Many of the provisions in S. 741 were included in \nthe vetoed Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. Now, those provisions have been \nincluded as part of the Republican minimum wage amendment.\n  Experts say that, ideally, pension benefits should comprise about a \nthird of a retired worker's income. But pension benefits make up only \nabout one-fifth of the income in elderly households. Obviously, workers \nare reaching retirement with too little income from an employer \npension. Workers who are planning for their retirement will need more \npension income to make up for a lower Social Security benefit and to \nsupport longer life expectancies. While we have seen a small increase \nin the number of workers who are expected to receive a pension in \nretirement, only one half of our workforce is covered by a pension \nplan.\n  There is a tremendous gap in pension coverage between small employers \nand large employers. Eighty-five percent of the companies with at least \n100 workers offer pension coverage. Companies with less than 100 \nworkers are much less likely to offer pension coverage. Only about 50 \npercent of the companies with less than 100 workers offer pension \ncoverage. Small employers who may just be starting out in business are \nalready squeezing every penny to make ends meet. These employers are \nalso people who open up the business in the morning, talk to customers, \ndo the marketing, pay the bills, and just do not know how they can take \non the additional duties, responsibilities, and liabilities of \nsponsoring a pension plan.\n  I firmly believe that an increase in the number of people covered by \npension plans will occur only when small employers have more \nsubstantial incentives to establish them. The pension provisions \ncontained in the minimum wage amendment offered by Senator Domenici \nwould provide more flexibility for small employers, relief from \nburdensome rules and regulations, and a tax incentive to start new \nplans for their employees. These reforms would create new retirement \nplans which would help thousands of workers build a secure retirement \nnest egg.\n  The amendment also contains provisions which promote new \nopportunities to roll over accounts from an old employer to a new \nemployer. The lack of portability among plans is one of the weak links \nin our current pension system. This amendment contains technical \nimprovements which will help ease the implementation of portability \namong the different types of defined contribution plans.\n  There has been criticism that the benefits of pension reform \nlegislation would largely be directed toward the rich. However, to the \ncontrary, evidence suggests that pension benefits largely benefit \nmiddle class workers.\n\n[[Page S14273]]\n\n Over 75 percent of current workers participating in a pension plan \nhave earnings of less than $50,000. Among married couples nearly 70 \npercent of those receiving a pension had incomes below $50,000. Among \nwidows and widowers, over 55 percent of pension recipients had incomes \nbelow $25,000.\n  Furthermore, there are provisions in the amendment specifically \ndesigned to help rank-and-file workers earn meaningful benefits. \nProvisions such as reducing the vesting period for employer matching \ncontributions in defined contribution plans and eliminating the twenty-\nfive percent of compensation limit on combined employer and employee \ncontributions to defined contribution plans.\n  Finally, let me say there is a precedent for including reforms to the \nemployer provided pension system with an increase in the minimum wage. \nThree years ago we increased the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 as \npart of the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996. Included in that \nlegislation were a number of reforms to the employer-provided pension \nsystem. One in particular, was the creation of the SIMPLE pension \nplan--which has expanded coverage to thousands of employees of small \nbusinesses who otherwise might not have been able to participate in a \npension plan.\n  We have an opportunity to improve the incomes of the lowest paid \nmembers of the American labor market, and to improve retirement \nsecurity for millions of workers and their families. I support my \ncolleague's efforts, and encourage others to do the same.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenator Grassley and Senator Torricelli, in bringing bankruptcy reform \nlegislation before the Senate today.\n  Senator Grassley is the Senate's acknowledged leader on this issue, \nin every sense of the word. He has made reform of our bankruptcy code \nhis cause, and he has stayed the course, through the last session of \nCongress and again this year, to bring us to where we are today.\n  It is evidence of Senator Grassley's commitment that he has reached \nout to the ranking Democrat on his Subcommittee, Senator Torricelli, to \njoin him in that effort. He certainly chose the right man for the job.\n  Senator Torricelli has worked with Senator Grassley to bring the kind \nof balance to the bill before us today that marked last year's Senate \nfloor a bill that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by a \nbipartisan, 14-to-4 margin.\n  Last year, we brought to the floor a bill that passed the Senate 97 \nto 1--virtually unanimous agreement that our bankruptcy code needs \nreform, as well as consensus that reform must be fair.\n  I would like to address both of those points today, Mr. President--\nthe need for reform, and the need for that reform to be balanced and \nequitable.\n  To a large extent, the numbers speak for themselves--the number of \nbankruptcy filings has exploded in recent years, reaching a record 1.4 \nmillion last year. That's on top of double-digit increases in the \nnumber of consumer bankruptcy filings for most of this decade. This \nrecord was set in a time of the best economic conditions our country \nhas ever seen--the lowest persistent unemployment and inflation, the \nhighest sustained growth, widespread income gains, and a booming stock \nmarket.\n  These are not the conditions that we normally associate with the kind \nof widespread financial distress that could trigger a wave of \nbankruptcy filings.\n  This tells me--and a lot of others, as well--that there is something \nwrong with the way our consumer bankruptcy code operates today. Simply \nput, too many people are finding it too easy too easy to walk away from \ntheir legitimate obligations by filing for bankruptcy. When that \nhappens, somebody else pays the bill.\n  In the past year, a number different studies have looked at just how \nbig that bill can be. These studies have been conducted by all sides in \nthe debate, including the credit industry and the bankruptcy bar. The \nstudy conducted by the Department of Justice concluded that American \nbusinesses lose $3.2 billion annually to bankruptcies filed by \nindividuals who have the capacity to repay their debts.\n  The size of the bankruptcy problem--both the number of filings and \nthe dead-weight losses to our economy--was the foundation for last \nyear's overwhelming Senate support for reform.\n  The principle behind the reforms we bring to the floor today is \nsimple, Mr. President--if you file for the protection of bankruptcy, \none basic question will be asked: do you have the ability to pay some \nof your bills, or not?\n  If the facts--looking at your income on the one hand, and the bills \nyou have to pay on the other--show that you can pay, then you must file \nunder Chapter 13, that requires a period of at least partial repayment \nbefore you are forgiven your remaining debts. Under such a Chapter 13 \nplan, you are not required to sell off major assets such as your house \nor your car.\n  If the facts show that you simply don't have the income to under take \na Chapter 13 repayment plan, then the protection of Chapter 7 is still \nthere for you. Chapter 7, however, requires that you sell off any \nsignificant assets, and the proceeds go to your creditors.\n  Most Americans would agree that this is fair, and would be surprised \nto find that no test of someone's ability to pay is required to get the \nprotection of Chapter 7. But in fact, as even the strongest opponents \nof bankruptcy reform admit, today pretty much all the assumptions in \nthe bankruptcy code are in favor of the filers, who can voluntarily \nchoose a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 13 repayment plan.\n  The bill we bring to the floor today attempts to restore some balance \nto those assumptions, to require more responsibility on the part of \nthose who seek the protection of bankruptcy.\n  But some of my colleagues will argue during this debate that the \nsource of this problem is not really the operation of our bankruptcy \nlaws, but what they call ``irresponsible'' lending. Creditors--\nespecially the aggressive credit card companies--are pushing debt onto \npeople, and that is what is driving people into bankruptcy.\n  Now, I am sure all of us are tired of those millions--actually \nbillions--of credit card solicitations that come through the mail every \nyear. But I ask my colleagues to reflect for a moment on what the \nalternative to widely available consumer credit would be.\n  When I first came to the Senate, we were fighting against lending \npractices that ``red-lined'' whole neighborhoods, Mr. President, in \nwhich banks would simply decide that some people were not worthy of \ncredit, that they were incapable of managing their own affairs. A lot \nof us in Congress saw that as just plain wrong, and we worked to change \nit.\n  One of the things we did, in 1977, was to pass the Community \nReinvestment Act, that requires banks to lend into local communities \nwhere incomes may be lower or the risks of repayment higher than \nbankers might prefer.\n  We just passed an historic overhaul of our country's banking laws. \nThe Financial Services Modernization Act took many years of hard work \nto complete. Among the most contentious issues was the treatment of the \nCommunity Reinvestment Act.\n  In fact, President Clinton threatened a veto of that bill if the \nprinciples of the Community Reinvestment Act were not protected in the \nfinal deal. Those principles boil down to the idea that everyone \ndeserves access to credit, and it is the policy of this country that \nbanks must not unfairly restrict credit, despite what they think is the \nbest way to maximize returns and minimize the risks on their loans.\n  Now, I am not here to argue that the flood of credit card \nsolicitations is part of some new social program by the credit card \ncompanies. Of course they are trying to make money. By the way, it is \nalso evidence of a lot of competition in the lending business, as well. \nBut when I hear my colleagues argue about ``irresponsible lending,'' I \nhear echoes of those earlier debates about red-lining.\n  The ``democratization of credit,'' as some people have called it, has \nrisks, of course. Some people will not use credit responsibly. But the \nalternative to widely available credit--passing laws to cut back on \ncredit to the kinds of people we here in Washington have decided just \ncan't be trusted to use it wisely--that alternative is far, far, worse, \nin my view.\n  Should we do more to make sure that consumers are fully informed, and \nthat\n\n[[Page S14274]]\n\nlenders disclose the full cost consumers pay for credit? Of course we \nshould, Mr. President. During our Committee deliberations on this bill, \nwe considered proposals by Senator Schumer that would have imposed \nrequirements for more complete disclosure, in billing and in \nadvertising, by creditors.\n  Because those issues are under the jurisdiction of the Banking \nCommittee, we made the conscious decision to leave those provisions for \nan amendment here during the floor debate. That amendment will be among \nthe first items of business on this bill.\n  Should we do more to make sure consumers are informed about how to \nhandle debt, and how to avoid the ultimate step of bankruptcy? Of \ncourse we should, Mr. President. The bankruptcy reform bill before us \ntoday calls for new initiatives in those areas, as well. We look to the \ncauses of bankruptcy as part of a comprehensive approach to reform.\n  But to try to stem the tide of bankruptcies by making credit harder \nto get, Mr. President, is a cure that will prove to be worse than the \ndisease.\n  I thought one of the most important aspects of last years's Senate \ndebate was how, as we attempt to reduce the number of bankruptcy \nfilings, to still make sure that we continue to provide the full \nprotection from creditors and the fresh start that many Americans will \ncontinue to require and deserve.\n  For many of my colleagues, particularly on my side of the aisle, that \nhas been the real focus of the debate over bankruptcy reform, and it \nshould be.\n  I know that many of my colleagues are concerned that the means test \nin this bill, that determines a bankruptcy filer's ability to pay, will \nbe unfair to those who really need the full protection from creditors \nand the fresh start that Chapter 7 has historically provided. In fact, \nhowever, the means test is intended to ensure that a repayment plan--\nunder Chapter 13--will be required only of those individuals who \nactually have the documented ability to continue to pay some of their \nlegal obligations.\n  A range of studies from all sides in this debate has found that only \n3 to 15 per cent of filers under the current system would be steered \nfrom the complete protection of Chapter 7 into Chapter 13, where they \nwill be required to continue payments on--and, I have to stress, retain \npossession of--their credit purchases. The means test is designed to \nmake sure that these new responsibilities will be required only of \nthose who have the resources to meet them.\n  The managers' amendment that we will bring to the floor will provide \nadditional refinements and safeguards to make sure the means test \nachieves that goal.\n  Another major concern that has been expressed by my colleagues is \nthat bankruptcy reform will unfairly affect women and children, who may \ndepend on family support payments--alimony, child support--that are all \ntoo often part of the picture in the financial and personal distress \nthat can lead to bankruptcy. I want my colleagues to know just how much \nwe have done to protect family support payments--to protect them much \nmore than current law.\n  This bill will give alimony and child support payments the highest \npossible priority--over credit card companies, over department stores, \nover all other creditors--when the line forms to collect payments from \nsomeone who is in bankruptcy. This bill also requires that all alimony \nand child support must be paid in full before the final discharge of \ndebts at the end of bankruptcy. These are just two of the significant \nimprovements in the treatment of alimony and child support in this \nbill, and there are others.\n  The reform of our bankruptcy code is a complicated issue, and in the \ncoming days we will be debating a lot of the thousands of important \ndetails that are involved. But if we keep our eye on the big picture--\nfundamental principles of fairness, responsibility, and effectiveness--\nI am convinced that this bill will enjoy overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport on final passage.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts \nreleased a report in August that included some good news and some bad. \nOn the one hand, the report indicated that bankruptcy filings for the \n12-month period ending June 30, 1999 were down, albeit slightly--about \n0.3 percent. On the other hand, it noted that the number of petitions \nfiled still represented a 62.2 percent increase over the same period \nending in 1995.\n  Extraordinary circumstances can strike anyone, which is why it is \nimportant to preserve access to bankruptcy relief. No one disputes that \nthere should be an opportunity to seek relief and a fresh start when \nsomeone is struck by terrible circumstances beyond his or her control--\nfor example, when families are torn apart by divorce or ill health. I \nsuspect that creditors would be more than willing to work with someone \nwhen such tragedy strikes to help him or her through tough times.\n  But there is a good deal of evidence that too many people who file \nfor relief under Chapter 7 actually have the ability to pay back some, \nor even all, of what they owe. Inappropriate use of Chapter 7, or \nstraight bankruptcy, imposes higher costs on the vast majority of \nconsumers who make good on their obligations. The Justice Department \nestimates these costs at about $3.2 billion annually. This phenomenon \nof bankruptcy for the sake of convenience--bankruptcy as a financial \nplanning tool--is what led to the drafting of the bill before us today.\n  The Bankruptcy Reform Act, S. 625, is the product of a number of \nhearings, and months and months of deliberations. This bill has been in \nthe legislative process for several years now. It enjoys broad \nbipartisan support, having been approved overwhelmingly by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee on a vote of 14 to 4. In fact, similar bipartisan \nlegislation in the House of Representatives passed on May 5, by a \nlopsided vote of 313 to 108--an even greater margin than last year.\n  The bill would establish a presumption that a chapter 7 bankruptcy \nfiling--what is generally known as straight bankruptcy--should be \ndismissed or should be converted to Chapter 13 if, after taking into \naccount secured debts and priority debts like child support and living \nexpenses, the debtor could repay 25 percent or more of his or her \ngeneral unsecured debt, or $15,000, over a five-year period. The debtor \ncould rebut the presumption by demonstrating special circumstances to \nshow that he or she does not have a meaningful ability to repay his or \nher debts.\n  I suspect that most Americans would be surprised to find that this is \nnot already the norm. At the moment, bankruptcy judges do not \nnecessarily consider whether a debtor has a demonstrable capacity to \nrepay his or her debts before granting Chapter 7 relief.\n  Studies suggest that this means test we propose here would force \nbetween three percent and 15 percent of debtors to pay more to \ncreditors. This represents a relatively small number of debtors, but \nthey are the ones who have the means to repay, and fairness dictates \nthat they do so.\n  In short, the bill would steer individuals with the ability to repay \nsome or all of their debts into Chapter 13 repayment plans, while \npreserving access to Chapter 7 for those who truly need its protection \nand the fresh start it would provide. This is a reasonable and balanced \napproach.\n  Remember, when people run up debts they have no intention of paying, \nthey shift a greater financial burden onto honest, hard-working \nfamilies in America. Estimates are that bankruptcy costs every American \nfamily more than $400 a year. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers \nacknowledged as much during a recent hearing before the Finance \nCommittee. When asked whether debt discharged in bankruptcy results in \nhigher prices for goods and services as businesses have to offset \nlosses, here is what he said:\n\n       Certainly there is a strong tendency in that direction, and \n     also towards higher interest rates for other borrowers who \n     are going to pay back their debt.\n\n  So when we hear opponents of the bill talk of their concern for \nconsumers, let us remember the cost that the abuse of bankruptcy law \nimposes on the vast majority of consumers who responsibly abide by \ntheir obligations and pay back their debts. What we have here is really \nthe most pro-consumer bill we will consider this year.\n  I want to share with Senators a very good editorial that appeared in \nthe Tribune on May 24, 1999. I ask unanimous consent that the editorial \nbe printed in the Record at this point.\n\n[[Page S14275]]\n\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Picking Up the Tab\n\n       It's quite possible you receive several solicitations a \n     month for carpet-cleaning. But if you do, it's unlikely you \n     have someone clean your carpets that often. You know when to \n     say no.\n       It's also likely that you receive several credit card \n     solicitations every month. But that doesn't mean you sign up \n     for every card and then run out and charge the limit.\n       Or does it?\n       Consumer advocates seem to be of the opinion that Americans \n     are all but helpless when credit card companies sing their \n     siren song. That they are powerless to say no when the offers \n     come in the mail or over the phone. And that when they get \n     into financial trouble because of credit card debt, it's not \n     really their fault.\n       That scenario is being played out more and more often these \n     days, and soaring bankruptcy figures prove it. In 1980, three \n     out of every 1,000 Arizona households sought protection under \n     bankruptcy laws. In the supposedly booming year of 1998, that \n     number had jumped to 14.\n       Credit card debt is often a major factor.\n       When people wiggle out of paying their debts, of course, \n     someone else is left holding the bag--either their creditors, \n     or the creditors' other customers, who have to fork over \n     higher interest rates and fees to cover the loss.\n       Often bankruptcy is unavoidable. Loss of income, health \n     problems and other calamities can quickly plunge even \n     affluent families into hot water.\n       But often it is avoidable, and personal irresponsibility \n     plays a part.\n       That's why Congress is considering legislation to tighten \n     up bankruptcy laws so that people would be held more \n     accountable for debts they incur. More people would be \n     required to file under Chapter 13, which mandates repayment \n     of certain debts, and fewer would be allowed to use Chapter \n     7, which is much easier on borrowers.\n       The House already has passed the legislation, with all six \n     of Arizona's lawmakers voting for it.\n       Banks and credit card companies love the bill, of course. \n     And some see a connection between big-business campaign \n     contributions and the supposedly anti-consumer legislation.\n       But the bill, in truth, is not anti-consumer. At least it's \n     not anti- the consumers who do pay their debts and who, \n     because of higher interest rates, have to cover the tab for \n     those who don't.\n       Nor does it wash to blame the companies for luring people \n     into debt because of the incessant barrage of credit card \n     solicitations. Yes, there are a lot of them. It's called \n     advertising. In a capitalist, market economy, that's how \n     companies make their products available. It can be annoying, \n     but it's not wrong.\n       As with any product (beer, cigarettes, carpet-cleaning), it \n     falls on the individual consumer to make responsible choices.\n       Those who don't should not expect the rest of us to clean \n     up for the financial messes they themselves create.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I want to stop at this point and single out a few provisions \nof the bill for comment. These are provisions that I believe illustrate \nthe deficiencies in current law--provisions that demonstrate why this \nlegislation represents common sense reform of the bankruptcy system.\n  The first provision appears in Section 314 of the bill and provides \nthat debts that are fraudulently incurred could no longer be discharged \nin Chapter 13--the same as in Chapter 7. Again, I think most Americans \nwould be surprised to find out that this is not already the law.\n  Currently, at the conclusion of a Chapter 13 plan, a debtor is \neligible for a broader discharge than is available in Chapter 7, and \nthis superdischarge can result in several types of debts, including \nthose for fraud and intentional torts, being discharged whereas they \ncould not be discharged in Chapter 7. The language of the bill tracks \nan amendment I offered last year, and would simply add fraudulent debts \nto the list of debts that are nondischargeable under Chapter 13. It is \nas simple as that.\n  Here is what the Deputy Associate Attorney General, Francis M. \nAllegra, said about the dichargeability of fraudulent debts in a letter \ndated June 19, 1997:\n\n       We are unconvinced that providing a (fresh start) under \n     Chapter 13 superdischarge to those who commit fraud or whose \n     debts result from other forms of misconduct is desirable as a \n     policy matter.\n\n  Here is what Judge Edith Jones of Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals said \nin a dissenting opinion to the report of the Bankruptcy Review \nCommission:\n\n       The superdischarge satisfies no justifiable social policy \n     and only encourages the use of Chapter 13 by embezzlers, \n     felons, and tax dodgers.\n\n  Judith Starr, the Assistant Chief of the Litigation Counsel Division \nof Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission, testified \nbefore the House Judiciary Committee on March 18, 1998. Speaking about \nthe fraud issue, she said:\n\n       We believe that, in enacting the Bankruptcy Code, Congress \n     never intended to extend the privilege of the ``fresh start'' \n     to those who lie, cheat, and steal from the public.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       A fair consumer bankruptcy system should help honest but \n     unfortunate debtors get their financial affairs back in order \n     by providing benefits and protections that will help the \n     honest to the exclusion of the dishonest, and not vice versa. \n     It is an anomaly of the current system that bankruptcy is \n     often more attractive to persons who commit fraud than to \n     their innocent victims. Bankruptcy should not be a refuge for \n     those who have committed intentional wrongs, nor should it \n     encourage gamesmanship by failing to provide real \n     consequences for abuse of its protections.\n\n  And she concludes:\n\n       We support [the provision of the House bill] which makes \n     fraud debts nondischargeable in Chapter 13 cases. Inducements \n     to file under Chapter 13 rather than Chapter 7 should be \n     aimed at honest debtors, not at those who have committed \n     fraud.\n\n  A final quotation: The Honorable Heidi Heitkamp, the Attorney General \nof North Dakota, testified to the following before the House Committee \nlast year:\n\n       When a true ``bad actor'' is in the picture--a scam artist, \n     a fraudulent telemarketer, a polluter who stubbornly refuses \n     to clean up the mess he has created there is a real potential \n     for bankruptcy to become a serious impediment to protecting \n     our citizenry.\n\n  Furthermore, she says:\n\n       We must all be concerned because bankruptcy is, in many \n     ways, a challenge to the normal structure of a civilized \n     society. The economy functions based on the assumption that \n     debts will be paid, that laws will be obeyed, that order to \n     incur costs to comply with statutory obligations will be \n     complied with, and that monetary penalties for failure to \n     comply will apply and will ``sting.'' If those norms can be \n     ignored with impunity, and with little or no future \n     consequences for the debtor, this bodes poorly for the \n     ability of society to continue to enforce those requirements.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope there will be no dissent to these anti-fraud \nprovisions. Certainly, there should not be. Bankruptcy relief should be \navailable to people who work hard and play by rules, yet fall \nunexpectedly upon hard times. Perpetrators of fraud should not be \nallowed to find safe haven in the bankruptcy code.\n  The second amendment I offered, which was included in last year's \nbill, and which is again in this year's bill, is also found in Section \n314. It says that debts that are incurred to pay non-dischargeable \ndebts are themselves non-dischargeable. In other words, if someone \nborrows money to pay a debt that cannot be erased in bankruptcy, that \nnew debt could not be erased either. The idea is to prevent individuals \nfrom gaming the system and obtaining a discharge of debt that would \notherwise be non-dischargeable.\n  I want to emphasize that we have taken special care to ensure that \ndebts incurred to pay non-dischargeable debts will not compete with \nnon-dischargeable child- or family-support in a post-bankruptcy \nenvironment.\n  The third amendment of mine is reflected in Section 310 of the bill, \nand it is intended to discourage people from running up large debts on \nthe eve of bankruptcy, particularly when they have no ability or \nintention of making good on their obligations.\n\n  Current law effectively gives unscrupulous debtors a green light to \nrun up their credit cards just before filing for bankruptcy, knowing \nthey will never be liable for the charges they are incurring. That is \nwrong, and it has got to stop.\n  The provision would establish a presumption that consumer debt run up \non the eve of bankruptcy is non-dischargeable. The provision is not \nself-executing. In other words, it would still require that a lawsuit \nbe brought by the creditor against the debtor so that a bankruptcy \njudge could consider the circumstances and assess the claim. But if \nthis provision achieves the intended purpose, debtors will not only \nminimize the run-up of additional debt, they will have more money \navailable after bankruptcy to pay priority obligations, including \nalimony and child support.\n  Again, special care has been taken to ensure that we are only talking \nabout\n\n[[Page S14276]]\n\nconsumer debts incurred within 90 days of bankruptcy for goods or \nservices that are not necessary for the maintenance or support of the \ndebtor or dependent child. We want to be sure that family obligations \nare met.\n  I will discuss one other aspect of the bill before closing, and that \nrelates to the many provisions that Senators Hatch, Grassley, and I \ncrafted last year--and which have been improved on in this year's \nbill--to protect the interests of women and children.\n  Nothing in the earlier versions of the bill reduced the priority of, \nor any of the protections that are accorded to, child-support and \nalimony under current law. Nevertheless, concerns were expressed that \nprovisions of the legislation might indirectly or even inadvertently \naffect ex-spouses and children of divorce. Assuming that critics were \noperating in good faith--and because our intent was always to ensure \nthat family obligations were met first--Senators Hatch, Grassley, and I \ncrafted an amendment last year to remove any doubt whatsoever about \nwhether women and children come first.\n  As now written, the bill elevates the priority of child-support from \nits current number seven on the priority list for purposes of payment \nto number one. Our amendment mandates that all child support and \nalimony be paid before all other obligations in a Chapter 13 plan. It \nconditions both confirmation and discharge of a Chapter 13 plan upon \ncomplete payment of all child support and alimony that is due before \nand after the bankruptcy petition is filed. It helps women and children \nreach exempt property and collect support payments notwithstanding \ncontrary federal or state law. And it extends the protection accorded \nan ex-spouse by making almost all obligations one ex-spouse owes to the \nother non-dischargeable.\n  Many of us have heard the argument by opponents of this bill that \nwomen and children will be forced to compete with credit-card companies \nto collect resources from debtors, particularly once they emerge from \nbankruptcy. The provisions I just described answer that concern. \nMoreover, I think it is important to point out that the post-discharge \ndebtor generally does not have the option to pay a credit-card company \nbefore his or her former spouse anyway. More and more child support is \nwithheld from wages by the state. In other words, child support \nobligations are paid before the non-custodial parent or former spouse \never receives his or her paycheck. If withholding is not in place when \nthe bankruptcy is filed, it can be put in place quickly under other \nprovisions of the pending bill.\n  If any of these provisions can be improved on further, I know that \nSenators Hatch and Grassley, and myself would be more than willing to \nmodify them. My concern is that we do not allow concern for women and \nchildren to become an excuse for opposing the broader bill and letting \nother debtors off the hook for debts they are able to repay. That would \nonly hurt women and children in need by forcing them to bear the higher \ncosts associated with such bankruptcy abuse.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill--a bill that protects debtors who \ntruly need relief, while also protecting the interests of consumers who \nmeet their obligations to creditors by repaying their debts. It \nprotects the interests of women and children through a series of new \nprovisions. I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for this fair \nand balanced piece of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be laid \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor to the Senator from Iowa.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2751\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President. When I think of who the minimum wage \nincrease would benefit and why it is needed--I don't think of the \nteenager popping corn at the movie theater.\n  I think of the single mother of two, a full-time cashier at the local \ngrocery store, struggling to put dinner on the table and clothe her \nkids. She's off welfare, but still living far below the poverty level. \nRight now, the minimum wage pays her less than $11,000 a year, working \n40 hours a week.\n  If we really want to help parent succeed on their own, they need a \nfair wage. Senator Kennedy's amendment would help us get there.\n  Today we have the opportunity to assure that 11.8 million American \nworkers are provided with a much needed and much deserved raise. Two-\nthirds of minimum wage workers are adults. Nearly sixty percent are \nwomen. More than \\1/3\\ are the sole breadwinners, like the woman I \nspoke of.\n  Mr. President, it is a sad fact that in today's booming economy and \nskyrocketing executive pay, minimum wage workers earn 19 percent less, \nadjusted for inflation, than minimum wage workers earned 20 years ago. \nThe proposed increased would restore the wage floor to just above its \n1983 level--which is a positive step despite the fact that it would \nstill be 13 percent below its 1979 peak.\n  I believe that these workers are central to the U.S. economy and that \nthey\n\n[[Page S14278]]\n\nshould benefit from the recent surge in economic growth--not be left \nbehind.\n  But, I keep hearing the same tired argument echo in this chamber--\nthat raising the minimum wage would cause widespread job loss. Critics \nneed to find another argument--because they're wrong on this one--\nalways have been.\n  Let's look at what happened last time: The Economic Policy Institute \nreported that in September 1996, one month before the minimum wage \nincreased from $4.25 to $4.75, the national unemployment rate was 5.2 \npercent. In December 1997, two months after the second annual increase \nboosted the minimum wage to $5.15, the national unemployment rate was \n4.2 percent--a full point lower. More telling, retail trade jobs which \ndisproportionately employ low wage workers, grew as fast as jobs \noverall.\n\n  A recent Business Week editorial backed that up saying--\n\n       In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher minimum \n     wages raise income, not unemployment.\n\n  The workers who this amendment would target are central to the \neconomy--and they should benefit from the incredible growth of our \neconomy.\n  I know that there are proposals for a more gradual increase in the \nminimum wage--3 years instead of 2. This would cut the income of a \nfull-time, year-around worker roughly $1,500 over three years compared \nwith the current proposal. The minimum wage has already lost a lot of \nground with inflation. The three-year proposal would only hinder this \neffort to catch up.\n  There is another critical piece of Senator Kennedy's amendment--\nstopping the abuse of workers on U.S. land. It would apply the U.S. \nminimum wage to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands--the \nCNMI, also known as Saipan. The local government's current minimum wage \nthere is $3.10 an hour. This amendment would go a long way toward \nrelieving some of the egregious abuse and exploitation of temporary \nforeign workers brought to the U.S. territory to work at the garment \nfactories--most of which are owned by foreign interests.\n  The bottom line is this: All of America deserves a raise--that \nincludes those living and working in Saipan--and the 143,000 Iowans who \nwould benefit from the raise.\n  Profits and productivity are way up. There is room to give workers a \nwage they deserve without hurting economic growth. The rest of the \neconomy shouldn't be doing better than the people who make it run.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support a raise in the minimum wage. It is \nthe right thing to do for women, for America's families, and it is long \noverdue.\n  The Kennedy amendment also includes a number of very important tax \nprovisions that I strongly support. One of the most important points \nabout the tax provisions is that the new tax benefits are fully paid \nfor. The cost of these benefits are offset both for the coming year and \nfor the coming ten years so we do not eat into the funds we need to pay \nfor Social Security and needed improvements in Medicare as the baby \nboomers start retiring. It closes tax loopholes that allow some large \ncompanies to escape paying their fair share of taxes by creating \nartificial accounting gimmicks that have no purpose whatsoever except \nshifting the burden of taxes from a company to average taxpayers or the \npublic debt.\n  I am very pleased that this amendment includes the text of S. 1300, \nthe Older Workers Protection Act, which I have sponsored. Across \nAmerica, workers have worked for companies anticipating the secure \nretirement which is their due and expectation under their company's \npension plan. Now, as more Americans than ever before in history \napproach retirement, some employers are trying to cut their pension \nbenefits.\n  Under current law, a company cannot take away pension benefits that \nhave already been earned. But, in a slight of hand, when some companies \nchange their pension plan making it less generous, they quietly, simply \ndo not pay anything into an employee's account, often for 5 years or \nmore till the employee's pension is ``worn away'' to the lower value of \nthe new plan. This wear away is, I believe illegal under current age \ndiscrimination law. It certainly is a violation of the spirit of the \nlaw. This provision would clear, real protections for many thousands of \nworkers who are having their pensions slashed without their knowledge. \nThis measure eliminates wear away. It provides a company must pay into \nan employee's pension account under a new pension plan without regard \nto higher accrued benefits that might have been earned prior to plan \nchange.\n  The amendment also provides for numerous provisions that help smaller \nbusinesses and their owners that I support. These include:\n  100 percent deductibility for self-employed health insurance staring \non January 1, that I have been working for many years,\n  A tax credit for the start up costs of a small company pension plan \nincluding a 50 percent credit for the match that a small employer puts \ninto a employee's account during the first 5 years. This could really \nmake a difference; giving employers real incentives to setting up \nquality pension plans so crucial to workers retirement, a 25 percent \ntax credit for an employer's cost in setting up a day care center, \nExpanding the amount a small business can expanse to 25,000, Extension \nof the Work Opportunity Tax Credit and the related to Work Tax Credit, \nExpanding the Low Income Housing Tax Credit. But, I would have liked to \nsee a far faster increase in the increase in this program than the \namendment provided. The measure contains a number of benefits of \nparticular interest to farmers that I strongly support including a \nprovision that prevents the use of income averaging pushing a farmer \ninto having to pay the Alternative Minimum tax. And it provides for a \n10 year carryback for farmers that I have been advocating. This would I \nbelieve it would be important to have the carryback provision take \neffect for loses that occurred in both 1998 and 1999.\n\n  On the other hand, the Republican tax amendment has a net cost of \nover $75 billion over the coming decade that is not offset by closing \ntax loop holes or by other means. That means that the Republican \nproposal will have the likely effect of cutting into the funds we need \nto protect Social Security and to preserve and improve Medicare. That \nis a real problem under current projections of government revenues and \ncosts. But it is even worse if we end up with a serious downturn in our \neconomy. Some claim that the reason for these tax provisions is a \ndesire to mitigate the costs of the minimum wage increase on small \nemployers. But, the burden on Social Security and Medicare is three \ntimes the effect of the estimated effect of the version of the minimum \nwage provisions in the Majority package.\n  Many of the provisions are worthy of support, many are also in the \nDemocratic proposal where they are paid for. It also contains some \nprovisions that I support but which were not included in the Democratic \nproposal because of its cost. These include the tax benefits for health \ninsurance and long term care. On the other hand, this proposal unfairly \nbenefits the wealthy. For example, there is a $396 million cost to the \ngovernment over 10 years to allow a person to increase the amount of \nmoney that can be received from a defined benefit plan from $130,000 to \n$160,000 per year. Every penny of this cost benefits those at the top \nof the income scale, not one of whom is making less than 10 times the \nminimum wage just from one retirement benefit!\n  Unfortunately, there are a large number of provisions in the GOP plan \nthat reduce the incentive for small businesses to set up a good pension \nplan for their workers. The tax code provides about $130 billion a year \nin tax benefits to promote pensions. The purpose of that considerable \npublic investment is to provide incentives for people to invest in \npensions and for companies to fund pension plans for all of their \nworkers, not just owners and key employees. Many small employers are \npushed by the law's limits on what they can put into their own pension \naccounts without providing benefits to all employees to provide decent \npension plans for their workers. The majority amendment reduces those \nrestraints and will likely result in far fewer employees getting \npensions. That is bad public policy.\n  Lastly, the majority amendment includes provisions that provides \nsignificant special interest loopholes in the tax code. There is a \nprovision regarding ESOPs: employee stock ownership\n\n[[Page S14279]]\n\nplans. The Treasury believes this provision opens up a significant \nloophole for some taxpayers. If a high income self employed person or \nsomeone in a partnership with others, arranges that all of the people \nthat work with him and his partners are considered employees of another \nentity, then the partners can incorporate and form an ESOP. Under the \nprovision in the amendment, the doctors could then defer all of the \nincome they desire, effectively as pension income without any limit. \nSo, if they each make $300,000 and one decides that he needs to spend \nonly $150,000 to live on, that high income taxpayer could defer their \ntaxes on the whole whopping $150,000 unspent. That is outrageous. Why \nshould we be putting these very generous loopholes in the tax code that \nallow a few to not pay their fair share of taxes? They become a special \nclass of taxpayers who only have to pay taxes on what they spend and \neverything they save goes into the equivalent of a super IRA with all \ntaxes deferred. That makes no sense at all.\n  We need tax provisions that are designed to promote the creation of \npensions for the average employee making $25,000 or $50,000, not \ncreating special provisions only of interest to very high income \ntaxpayers that actually reduce their interest in setting up pension \nplans for their workers. I urge that we pass the Kennedy amendment and \nreject the majority amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President do I have some additional time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-two minutes 24 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I note Senator Landrieu is here from Louisiana. I won't \ntake that much time, and I will yield back the remainder so she may \nproceed in morning business, if that is her desire.\n  Let me just say, it is absolutely amazing that some group proposes \nthat the minimum wage should be increased because the poor families in \nAmerica, who are out there working at jobs, are the ones it will help, \nonly to find that every study reveals that isn't the case.\n  I am going to talk a minute about CNN. They proceeded with a very \nintense analysis of their own, and they have been running it on \ntelevision. It is sort of shocking to hear what they find versus what \nwe are hearing in justification of a $1 increase in the minimum wage in \nthe next 13 months-14 months.\n  First, let me start and read the dialog that occurred on CNN with \nreference to their research and who is helped and not helped by the \nminimum wage:\n\n       Highlight: Next week, Congress will be raising the minimum \n     wage by $1 to $6.15, which could benefit perhaps 10 million \n     low-wage workers. A look at who a minimum wage increase would \n     benefit. Body of the report: Jim Moret, anchor. There were \n     fewer Americans out of work last month. The jobless rate \n     dropped to 4.1 percent, the lowest it has been in 3 decades. \n     Also in the Labor Department's report, average hourly \n     earnings rose by only 1 penny last month to $13.37. That is \n     the average per hour. Next week, Congress considers a \n     minmimum wage of $1 which could benefit perhaps those 10 \n     million low-wage workers.\n  But who are they?\n\n       Our Brooks Jackson has some answers that may surprise you.\n\n  He says:\n\n       Who would be helped if the minimum wage went up to $6.15 \n     cents?\n\n  The answer is:\n\n       Not these workers.\n\n  The ones they have been talking about.\n\n       Bob Seidner, owner, Classic Auto Salon: I wouldn't even \n     consider paying somebody that level, because we're not going \n     to get the level of employee.\n       Jackson: In today's hot job market, Bob Seidner says he has \n     to pay $8 an hour to get an experienced car washer in \n     Maryland. And in his Atlanta restaurant, nobody stays at the \n     minimum wage for long.\n\n  They all move up rather rapidly.\n\n       Greg Vojnovic, Restaurant owner: If you look at the economy \n     today, there is so much pressure on the labor marketplace \n     that you can't pay anybody a minimum wage for any period of \n     time. Our typical dishwasher, who is typically the lowest \n     position, is making [more than the minimum wage today. In \n     fact, he is making] $7 an hour.\n       Jackson: So who would be helped? Experts say fewer than one \n     worker out of every ten, most of them part-time workers, and \n     mostly not in poverty.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       So who would be helped? One out of every ten, and most of \n     them are part-time workers and mostly not in poverty.\n\n  I am going to jump away from this for a minute and say, who do you \nthink those part-time workers are? They are the teenagers of America \nwho are working in restaurants, drive-ins, and all the kinds of places \nwhere they want to get jobs to learn how to work. Let's be honest about \nit; it would be nice if we could give them a 50-cent increase in the \nminimum wage in January and 50 cents the next year. But let's also be \nhonest that they are not the poverty people of America; they are \nteenagers breaking in at their new job. And it is most interesting, for \nthese comments and others that I have read say that even they are \ngetting paid more than the minimum wage these days.\n\n       Teenagers like Sara Schroff, a 19-year-old student making \n     $5.15, but only the start. She'll be promoted in a week.\n       Even McDonald's offers more than the minimum wage.\n\n  Says another who has looked out in the job market.\n\n       In fact, teenagers make up 28 percent of those who would \n     gain, and only 23 percent of the gainers are the main earners \n     in their families.\n       Opponents say there's still a good reason to raise the \n     minimum wage.\n\n  And the Economic Policy Institute says:\n\n       It's true that while the increase is not perfectly \n     targeted, most of the benefits do go to lower-income working \n     families. Fifty percent of the benefits, of the gains from \n     this next increase, will go to families whose income is \n     $25,000 or less; that's lower middle income. . . .\n       Those working poor households would get only 17 percent of \n     the gain from raising the minimum wage.\n\n  Frankly, we have heard all kinds of numbers on how many minimum-wage \npeople we have in America. I am just going to be rebutting their \ncomments for a moment, and then I will tell Americans about our bill.\n\n  To get to the 10 million they are bantering around here on the floor, \nlet me tell you where that comes from. Minimum-wage earners are 1.6 \nmillion of this 10 million that is being bantered around. Workers \nmaking between the present minimum wage and the new wage of $6.15, \nunder these amendments, are 5.9 million. Workers making less than the \nminimum wage and who are not going to be affected by the minimum wage \nbecause they are tip people, or the like, are 2.7.\n  So, in summary, 1.6 million are really minimum-wage earners working \nunder the minimum wage as a means of recompense for an hour's work. \nNonetheless, we have an amendment that I believe is far superior to the \nDemocrat amendment. I am very pleased to have been part of putting it \ntogether. We want to raise the minimum wage to keep steadily ahead of \ninflation, and it will be raised 30 cents in January, 35 cents the \nfollowing January, and 30 cents the following--$1 in a period of 26 \nmonths instead of a period of 14 months.\n  In addition, very simply put, we change some provisions in the tax \nlaw, which I now hear we should not do because it cuts taxes. Well, \ndoes anyone seriously believe that with the kind of surpluses we have \nprojected in the United States, we are not going to give the taxpayers \nback some of that money? I can say, with surpluses that are approaching \n$3.4 trillion, does anybody believe there is a better time to give the \nAmerican people a tax reduction, give them back some of their money? If \nwe can't do that now, I ask you, when can we? These are the largest \ndeficit, largest surpluses we could have predicted in the best of \ntimes.\n  The budget is under control. It is growing at the lowest rate in all \ncategories in the past 40 years on an annual basis. We take some credit \nfor that. The President deserves some credit for that. But that is \nsuccess. That is building a surplus. In the last year, we have not \nspent one penny of the Social Security trust fund money--in the year \nthat just passed. The Congressional Budget Office says, as a matter of \nfact, we have a surplus of a billion dollars. That has not occurred in \n40 years. We want to say to the Social Security trust fund, you keep \nall that is yours. That is about $2 trillion. What do we do with the \nother $1.3 trillion to $1.4 trillion? Do we leave it around here so we \ncan spend it?\n  Does anybody doubt, if we don't make appropriate tax cuts, or tax \nreductions, that it won't be spent? We\n\n[[Page S14280]]\n\nhave already heard that the worst thing to do with the surplus is to \nspend it. The best economic advisers that our country has say the worst \nthing you can do is spend it. So we have, in the first 5 years, $18.5 \nbillion in tax relief, mostly for small businesses so they can continue \nto be the driving force behind America's growth.\n  I am going to just quickly, in a moment, tick off three or four of \nthose tax proposals that I think are very good. Somebody said this is a \nwaste of effort because if the Republican package passes--and I hope it \ndoes because I think it is a very good package--the President will just \nveto it. Well, I am not too sure of that. Let me make sure the Senate \nunderstands that the tax package included in this Domenici, et al., \nproposal is 12.5 percent of the tax package we passed some months ago. \nIt is 12.5 percent--not 50 percent of it, not 75, but 12.5. If you \ncan't get that through, what can you get through? I believe the \nPresident would sign it in a minute because it does the kinds of things \nthat even he has talked about as being necessary for American business \nto retain its energizing effect and its competitive qualities.\n  For a moment, let's quickly go through the amendments we have \nattached and put in the tax amendments in this package.\n  One: For the first time, we really help workers in America pay for \nhealth care insurance. Heretofore, if a worker bought his own \ninsurance, he could not deduct it. He would have to put it in a large \npot called health expenditures.\n  Only if it exceeds 7.5 of his income could it be included in the \ndeduction. We have said let's try this out. Let's see what would happen \nif workers who buy their own health insurance--for whatever reason--\ndeducted the whole thing the same as a company today deducts the whole \nthing under an exclusionary rule that we have established by precedent \naround here, and then we made it part of the rule of law. That is in \nthere.\n  Self-employed men and women have had a raw deal on health insurance. \nEverybody in this Chamber knows it. If we have a surplus, we ought to \nmake that right. Let self-employed Americans deduct 100 percent of \ntheir insurance costs--not some percentage. That is built in with a \nrather rapid curve where they will be able to deduct the full amount.\n  This is a work opportunity tax credit. Almost everybody in this \nSenate wanted that when we put it in before and made it temporary. It \nruns along with welfare reform. We have reduced welfare by 48 percent, \nand we cry out to business to hire welfare trainees. Yet the credit \nthey get for doing that is temporary. We want to make it permanent. So \na welfare trainee is more apt to get a job if the employer can get some \nincentives up front while they are training them and helping them.\n  Who can be against that? Will the President veto that? I can't \nbelieve it.\n  There is an item where small business can do an expensing of certain \ncapital improvements. But we have a limit on it. Otherwise they have to \ndepreciate it over time. We have increased that to $30,000 a year. It \nwill be marvelous for small business to deduct those kinds of expenses \nthat are encapsulated in that amendment. It will make their businesses \ngrow and prosper. There are two or three others that go with this.\n  But essentially, I believe when you put that package together you are \nsaying there will be fewer minimum-wage workers in the future, small \nbusiness will have a chance to profit more, and they will pay higher \nwages because the marketplace will force them to. In the meantime, we \nalso increase minimum wage by $1. We just take 12 months longer to do \nit.\n  I believe it is a good package. I hope the Senate passes it tomorrow. \nWe will have a few more minutes of debate tomorrow before the vote. In \nthe meantime, I hope everyone looks at the package in their offices and \nwill get briefed on it because it is a very good package. I not only \nyield the floor, but I yield back any time that I had on my amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 2768 And 2772 En Bloc\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Thank you, Mr. President. I have a few important things \nto say tonight. I will try to fit that in with the time that has been \nallotted to me.\n  There are many important issues that need to be resolved in the next \nfew days in order for us to wrap up this year and move on. The minimum \nwage debate is clearly a very significant issue for us. I am glad we \nwill be voting on it and, hopefully, come to a resolution tomorrow. \nThere are other issues pending that have yet to be resolved. That is \nwhy I rise tonight to speak for a few minutes about one of them that is \nvery important to the people of my State, the State of Louisiana.\n  I say at the outset as respectfully as I can that I am going to \nobject to proceeding to any additional actions of the Senate until this \nissue is resolved, or until there is an answer in terms of what our \noptions are. Some of us are not party to some of the discussions that \nare going on behind closed doors and some being reported. There is some \ninformation that I am very interested in receiving, and many people in \nLouisiana are interested in the information because it has to do with \nmoney\n\n[[Page S14281]]\n\nthat our State is producing. It has to do with the kinds of investments \nwe are either going to make or not make to the environment of our \nNation, to the coast of Louisiana, which is critical to preserve and \nhelp restore that coastline.\n  It is a very important issue to the American people in terms of our \nopportunity to use a small percentage of the non-Social Security \nsurplus to invest in the Land and Water Conservation Fund to fully fund \nit, to invest in some extraordinarily successful wildlife conservation \nprograms, to invest in historic preservation, and to invest in \ncoastal restoration and impact assistance for States that produce oil \nand gas and for States that do not.\n\n  This is an issue that we have now been debating actually for many \nyears. This debate has gone on for 30 years in terms of funding for \nland and water. It has gone on for over 50 years in terms of what \npercentage would be fair for Louisiana, the producing State, to \nreceive. Texas is in that position. Mississippi is in that position to \na certain degree. Alaska could be in that position. So there are a few \nStates that are producing States. This debate has raged on, in my \nopinion, for too long.\n  In my opinion, there is broad bipartisan support for a concept that \nwould take a portion of these revenues. They are estimated to be about \n$3 billion a year; $120 billion has been generated off the coast in \noffshore oil and gas production in taxes that the companies are already \npaying and many continue to pay. These are not new taxes. These are not \nnew revenues. These are revenues that are coming into the Federal \nTreasury. There is bipartisan support for taking a portion of those \nrevenues and investing in the things that I have just outlined.\n  Let me tell you why it is important for me to respectfully object to \nmoving on to any further business.\n  I know that I am going to be the skunk at the garden party because \nLouisiana is not a huge State such as California or Texas or Illinois. \nWe have a small delegation.\n  Sometimes, because our numbers are smaller, we aren't able to get all \nthe attention I think we need and the people of our State deserve. \nFortunately, the rules of the Senate allow each Senator to be able to \nspeak at length, to be able to express their will and their opinion. As \nrespectfully as I can, I am going to object to any further business \nuntil some of these things can be resolved.\n  Let me begin by telling a story that is not well known. I think \nAmericans are very interested judging from all of the correspondence my \noffice has received over the last year and a half from thousands of \nindividuals and groups who seem to be very sympathetic about this \nissue.\n  Let me read from a brochure called ``Coast 2050,'' discussing \nsustaining coastal Louisiana. I will read a few pages that tell a story \nabout a great and mighty river.\n\n       At the end of Old Man River, the mighty Mississippi, lies \n     the largest expanse of coastal wetlands in North America. \n     This dynamic and bountiful landscape was literally built and \n     sustained by the sediment-laden waters that drain to the \n     river from 31 states and three Canadian provinces.\n\n  This is not a river that just drains a few States. This is a river \nthat drains our entire Nation. The economy of our Nation depends on the \ntaming of this river and this ecosystem. The future of our Nation \ndepends on how well we manage the resources of this great river.\n\n       The Louisiana coast is home to 2 million Americans. The \n     wetlands, bays, and islands of the coast constitute an \n     enormously productive ecosystem and resource base that \n     support the livelihood and well-being of the Nation. The \n     statistics are awesome: the ecosystem contributes nearly 30 \n     percent by weight of the total commercial fisheries harvest \n     in the lower 48 states and provides overwintering habitat \n     for 70 percent of the migratory waterfowl using the \n     Central and Mississippi Flyways; 18 percent of U.S. oil \n     production and 24 percent of U.S. gas production * * * \n     Louisiana's ports rank first in the Nation in total \n     shipping tonnage.\n\n  Again, not a river that just serves Louisiana or serves Mississippi \nbut a river that serves the entire Nation. It would be all for naught \nfor the Midwestern States to produce any agricultural product if they \ncouldn't get it to market. That is the great benefit and strength of \nthis Mississippi River--and we sit at the mouth--in terms of the \ntransport of goods for hundreds of years.\n\n       The unique human culture and beautiful setting of southern \n     Louisiana is world-renowned.\n\n  We are losing it at an enormous and frightening rate. Since 1930, \nLouisiana has lost over 1,500 square miles of marsh. The State is still \nlosing 25 to 30 square miles each year, nearly a football field of \nprime wetlands every 30 minutes. Environmentalists should be alarmed.\n  There are great needs in California, the West, and in the Everglades, \nbut there is a tremendous need that should call us to arms, call \ncitizens to action, to help preserve and restore the south Louisiana \ncoast and this tremendous ecosystem not just for the benefit of \nLouisiana and the 4 million people who live in our State but for the \nbenefit of the 260-plus million population of this Nation.\n  There is no one reason for this land loss. Some of our coastal \nwetlands have always been subsiding, but in the past the river built \nand sustained the wetlands and built new ones, which offset the natural \nlosses.\n  Since Europeans came to Louisiana, we have been building levees to \nprotect against the floods. Levees keep homes, businesses, and farms \nsafe, but they prevent the sediments from flooding to refurbish the \nmarsh. In addition, levees were built to tame the route and flow of the \nMississippi River to allow for the great transport and trade on which \nthis Nation is dependent to grow and prosper. Canals were dug through \nthe marshes to promote navigation and to recover petroleum resources \nthat have helped fuel this Nation, to turn the lights on, to run our \nmachinery, to run our factories.\n  We are happy to make that contribution, and we are trying to do it in \na more environmentally sensitive way. This ecosystem supports a \ntremendous amount of commerce, and I don't think I should have to \nexplain it much more. However, we are losing it.\n  Today, Louisiana has 3,800 square miles of marsh and over 800 square \nmiles of swamp. Even at the current pace of restoration efforts--which \nhave been, by the way, successful, albeit minimal because we don't have \nthe financial resources that we deserve, that we should get for this \nrestoration--we will lose more than 600 square miles of marsh and \nalmost 400 square miles of swamp by the year 2050 if we do not take \naction. Consequently, nearly 1,000 square miles of Louisiana wetlands \nwill become open water. The Nation will lose an area the size of the \nState of Rhode Island if we fail to act.\n  That is why I come to the floor tonight to speak about this issue. I \nknow some colleagues think perhaps there is nothing we can do or we \njust can't make this happen. I am compelled to speak again because of \nthis story, because of this great resource, and because I know what the \nserious consequences will be for my State and for the entire Nation if \nthere is no solution. It is not a difficult solution. It is not even an \nexpensive solution. It is a real solution that has been laid on the \ntable in this Congress.\n\n  If we do nothing, we face significant reductions in the $20 billion-\nper-year shipping and export industry in addition to our ports, our \ncommercial fisheries, and oil and gas, and leave ourselves open to \nserious hurricane damage.\n  There is a consensus about what we can do. We have learned two \nthings: We already know how to fix most of the problems; second, \ncoastal recovery will require much more effort than has been undertaken \nso far. We know what it will take to fix the problem. We just need to \nget the job done. That is why I am here tonight to try to get this job \ndone because it is most certainly something that is within our grasp.\n  I want to read for the record a letter from over 800 environmental \norganizations circulated last week. I want to take the time to read it. \nIt is a good letter using good common sense that is within the grasp of \nthe Interior appropriations bill that is now being debated. We have the \nopportunity to make this happen. Without adding any new money, we can \nmake this happen.\n\n       As the 20th century draws to a close, Congress has a rare \n     opportunity to pass landmark legislation that would establish \n     a permanent and significant source of conservation funding. A \n     number of promising legislative proposals will take revenue \n     from nonrenewable offshore oil and gas resources and reinvest \n     them in the protection of renewable resources such as \n     wildlife, public lands, our\n\n[[Page S14282]]\n\n     coast, our oceans, our cultural resources, historic \n     preservation, and outdoor recreation. Securing this funding \n     would allow us to build upon the pioneering conservation \n     tradition that Teddy Roosevelt initiated at the beginning of \n     this century. The vast majority of Americans recognize the \n     duty we have to protect and conserve our rich cultural and \n     natural legacies for future generations, a diverse array of \n     interests including sports men and women, conservationists, \n     historic preservationists, outdoor recreationists, the faith \n     community, the business community, State and local \n     governments. Over 40 Governors, Democrat and Republican, have \n     supported this initiative, and they support conservation \n     funding for this legislation because they recognize it is \n     our obligation to make these commitments for future \n     generations.\n\n  So this letter goes on to call on our body here, the Senate and the \nHouse, to:\n\n       * * * seize this unprecedented opportunity to pass \n     legislation that would make a substantial and reliable \n     investment in the conservation of our Nation's wildlife, \n     public lands, coastal and marine resources, historic \n     treasures, urban and rural parks, open spaces * * * design a \n     bill that provides significant conservation benefits free of \n     harmful environmental impacts to our coastal and ocean \n     resources, and one that does not unduly hinder land \n     acquisition programs.\n       We have this within our grasp.\n\n  It says:\n\n       We look to Congress to make this a reality.\n\n  I hope, as I slow down this process, perhaps we can get some answers \nfrom the White House, from the negotiators, about the real \npossibilities of this taking place. There are some on the right who say \nwe do not need any more public land. There are some on the left who say \nif we do anything that might encourage drilling, no matter how great \nthe benefits, we are not for it.\n  Let me say, in a markup that is being done, hopefully this Wednesday \nin the House, many of those criticisms will be put to rest. In the \nmarkup that is being considered on the House side on this bill, there \nare no incentives for oil and gas drilling. We can fight that battle \nanother day. There is an incentive and language that will help us spend \nthis money for coastal restoration in ways that are environmentally \nsensitive and that do not encourage drilling. There is language, on the \nother hand, that is going to suggest that Congress has a legitimate \nrole to play in the purchasing of lands, along with the \nadministration--whether it is this administration, President Clinton, \nor whether it is a future President--that it is right that this \nCongress and the President would make decisions about the purchases of \nland, how much, and when, and where.\n  Those differences could be worked out. So there is bipartisan \nagreement we should take a portion of these revenues.\n  I want to show a graph, because people think, Why does Mary keep \nspeaking about this issue over and over again? It is because the \nrevenues that are being considered for this come from basically one \nState. I know you would be able to guess what that State is. This is \nLouisiana. I know this is a very small sheet, but I think the camera \ncan pick this up. This red represents the contribution Louisiana \nmakes to offshore oil and gas revenues which totaled, in this \nparticular year, $4.8 billion. The average is about $3.5 billion. But \nLouisiana contributes over 90 percent.\n\n  When we talk about taking this money and funding programs I have \noutlined--and I am for all the things I have just suggested--we need to \nbe fair to the producing States. Louisiana produces the most, then \nTexas; Mississippi contributes; Alabama is a contributor. Of course, \nCalifornia did contribute. There is a moratorium there. This bill does \nnothing to upset that political decision, but it does save, for the \nStates that are producing, a portion.\n  Let me talk about a portion because I believe in fighting for your \nState. But I also believe in being fair. If I did not think my State \nwas correct, I would be the first one to stand up and say we should do \nit another way; we simply do not have an argument. But it is widely \nknown the interior States in our Nation get to keep 50 percent of the \nrevenues they produce. States such as Wyoming and New Mexico get to \nkeep 50 percent of their revenues, and they can spend it basically as \nthey wish, with few restrictions.\n  I am not coming to this body, nor have I introduced a bill, to give \nLouisiana 50 percent of this offshore oil and gas revenues. It is not \non our land, but it is right outside of our coast. If it were not for \nour land, this industry simply would not exist. Very few can dispute \nthat because I don't know where you would launch the helicopters, \nHonduras or Guatemala; or where you would build the machinery, the \ncanals, the barges, the railroads, or highways that allow this industry \nto exist. I do not know if a good option would be Honduras or \nGuatemala, but if you don't do it from the coast of Louisiana, \nMississippi, and Texas, you do not have many options.\n  But I did not come here to ask for 50 percent. I am asking the \nPresident and the administration and this Congress to give Louisiana \nnot even 30 percent. I am not even asking for 25 percent. I have simply \nsaid to the producing and coastal States, let us keep at least 10 \npercent of the dollars for Louisiana and the producing States, and \nshare with all the other coastal States, whether they produce or not, \nto give them moneys from this source of revenue because it does not \njust belong to us, it belongs to everyone.\n  But surely we should, since we produce 90 percent of the money, get a \nfair share as we try to distribute this money. Whether we do it for 1 \nyear--we have been doing sort of hit or miss over the last 30--or \nwhether we try to take the step and do it permanently, recognizing the \nneeds and legitimate concerns of the Western States and some others \nthat are concerned about purchasing land--then clearly Louisiana \ndeserves its fair share. So do the other coastal States.\n  For the record, we have produced over $120 billion since 1955 and \nhave received less than 1 percent. I guess that is worth it, to me, to \nbe a skunk at the garden party, because it is just not fair. One of the \nthings about the Senate and about Congress and about this whole body, \nand about America and the debate, is trying to pass legislation the \nAmerican people care about. The American people can understand \nfairness. Whether they are from a Western State or California or \nWashington, or from a Southern State, I think they would say: Senator \nLandrieu, you are correct. It is not fair for your State to produce 90 \npercent and get virtually nothing when we have a bill that will share \nthis with everyone and do something the American people want to do.\n  Let me talk about that for just a minute. Sometimes we come to \nWashington and I think we have the tendency to forget, or maybe just \ntemporarily lose our memory, about some of the things we promised to do \nwhen we came. Sometimes we get busy with the talk in Washington and we \nforget about what the talk at home is.\n  There was research done just recently, in fact a couple of months \nago, by Luntz Research Companies, one of the foremost pollsters in \nAmerica. He said some things that really brought this issue home to me. \nEven though I knew this was important to people, I frankly did not \nthink to take a survey which would have been a good thing, but the \nenvironmental groups did. The results are staggering.\n  I am just going to read the overview:\n\n       What matters to Americans most these days is ``quality of \n     life'' and ``peace of mind.'' Our nation's prosperity has \n     brought with it the need both to think beyond simple hand-to-\n     mouth economics and to address the anxieties posed by \n     perceived threats to our own health and safety. The public's \n     mood on the environment speaks to the opportunity to deliver \n     positively on a rising public priority.\n       More than 50% of Americans tell us they will head to the \n     outdoors on vacation this year. What they expect to find when \n     they get there is part of the legacy they most want to pass \n     along to the next generation.\n       There is an emotional intensity to issues that define the \n     legacy of what this generation will leave to the next. At the \n     turn of the Millennium--as we enter the 21st Century focused \n     more than ever on the future and rapid change--what drives \n     people's attitudes on protecting the great outdoors may be \n     the need to identify and carry with us those defining ideas \n     and principles that have made America the great pioneer.\n       To deliver on the call for preservation and progress, \n     policymakers can succeed by focusing more on the benefits the \n     public wants and expects and by spending less time talking \n     about the process that the public really doesn't care to \n     follow in a debate.\n       And no issue speaks more directly to Americans' \n     environmental ``quality of life'' than their ability to enjoy \n     open spaces, parks, and wilderness areas. Whether they want a \n     place to visit alone or with their families on vacation--or \n     just having the peace of mind that those places will still \n     exist (for\n\n[[Page S14283]]\n\n     themselves, for future generations, and for the plant and \n     animal species that assure diversity)--this desire presents \n     an opportunity to deliver on a political priority. Anyone who \n     wants to close their own ``credibility gap'' on environmental \n     issues can do so by talking about conservation of open \n     spaces. . . .\n\n  And by actually doing something about it, not just speaking about it.\n  Let me give some of the findings:\n\n       People like to spend their time outdoors. Over half of \n     Americans polled cite an outdoor location like a national \n     park, forest, wilderness areas, beach, shoreline, lake, \n     river, or mountain as their preferred place to spend a \n     vacation this year.\n       Ninety-four percent would justify spending more on Land & \n     Water Conservation because ``Parks, forests, and seashores \n     provide Americans a chance to visit areas vastly different \n     than their own.''\n       Those who think the overall quality of the environment is \n     deteriorating outnumber those who think things are improving. \n     Eighty-eight percent of all Americans agree that ``we must \n     act now or we will lose many special places, and if we wait, \n     what is destroyed or lost cannot be replaced.''\n\n  They also say this poll defies a myth that some people think of as \nreal, too much public land.\n  That meant, according to this survey which was conducted by a \nRepublican pollster, it does not hold even in mountainous Western \nStates where over 90 percent, in some places of the land is already \nowned by the Government. This poll indicates that even in places in the \nWest where lots of land is already owned by the Federal Government, \npeople still want us to make the effort and the small investment it \nwill take to preserve these precious resources to provide wilderness, \nparks, and forest for our children and grandchildren.\n  Let me finally read one very startling result because all of us voted \nfor the highway trust fund. We thought we should apply our gasoline \ntaxes to improve the highway system which has been an extraordinary \nbenefit for the growth of this Nation. We did it because we knew it was \npopular at home, because it was the right thing to do. In my State of \nLouisiana, and probably in your State, Mr. President, Illinois, people \noverwhelmingly support it.\n  Let me share this:\n\n       In a head to head between land and water and highway, the \n     wildly popular highway and airport funds head to head was 45 \n     percent for the conservation of land and water and 37 percent \n     for highways.\n\n  We know how popular that highway bill was, but people in America--in \nLouisiana, in Illinois, in Mississippi, in other places, in Washington \nState--want us to take some of these revenues--not new taxes, not \nraising taxes, not robbing it from other places--but taking it from the \nFederal Treasury where it has gone into sort of a nondescript fund and \nreinvest it into the environment and to do that in a way that shares \nwith the States and local governments--not a Federal land grab, not a \nFederal takings, but in partnership with local and State governments, \nand that is what our bill does.\n  In conclusion, there are over or close to 200 Members of the Senate \nand the House, Republicans and Democrats. It is the only environmental \ninitiative--there are others that have been filed and talked about and \nare being debated in committee, outside of committee, in the \nnegotiations taking place right now--but there is not a single proposal \nthat has Democrat and Republican support except for this one.\n  I urge the White House, I urge the President, I urge the negotiators, \nwhatever is in the bill, if we can afford $300 million, fine. If we can \nafford $500 million, fine. If we can afford $1 billion, whatever the \noffset is, I am not asking for more money. But I am asking if we are \ngoing to spend offshore oil and gas revenues for 1 year or permanently, \nthat it be done giving Louisiana and Mississippi and Texas and Alabama \nand the other producing States their fair share; that it will fund to \nthe degree that is possible the coastal initiatives we have outlined.\n  Yes, there are authorized programs to fully fund land and water \nconservation and to fund wildlife conservation, historic preservation, \nand urban parks, which is a package that makes sense. Do my colleagues \nknow why? Because it is fair. It is fair to the east coast; it is fair \nto the West; it is fair to the South; it is fair to the North; it is \nfair to the Great Lakes States that do not have an ocean or a gulf, but \nbecause they have the Great Lakes, they similarly have situations that \nneed attention.\n  We have not written a bill that is selfish. We have written a bill \nthat is generous. We have written a bill that we can afford.\n  I urge the President not to move to take a portion of the revenues \nthat two of the poorest States in the Nation contribute--Mississippi \nand Louisiana--and give them away without giving us a fair chance at \npreserving our coastline, helping us restore a tremendous ecosystem \nthat not only benefits our State and the 4 million people who live \nthere, and the 2 million people who live on the coast but literally \nserves as a treasure for this Nation--an environmental treasure and a \ncommercial base--without which this country could not possibly continue \nto grow and prosper without.\n  I am sensitive to the Florida Everglades. I have been to the \nredwoods. I believe in the preservation of the great lands of the West. \nI want to be fair to many places in this Nation, but I cannot in good \nconscience represent the State that is contributing 90 percent of the \nmoney and allow these negotiations to go on knowing there is some \nintention to take this money permanently away from us and give it to \neveryone else without sharing this with us to help us in our quest to \nrestore this coastline for the benefit of the entire Nation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience. I hold up our plan: ``Coast \n2050.'' It is a beautiful picture of Louisiana's coast. I ask my \ncolleagues to be sensitive to our great needs. I am sorry to have to \nobject, but I do it respectfully, and I do it because I know this is \nthe right thing for our country and the Nation at this time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, if I have any.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14283-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14283-S14284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SENATE PASSAGE OF IMPORTANT HISTORIC PRESERVATION MEASURES\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed \nmuch needed legislation to protect some of America's most threatened \nhistoric sites, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and the Corinth \nbattlefield. S. 710, the Vicksburg Campaign Trail Battlefields \nPreservation Act of 1999, is a bipartisan measure that authorizes a \nfeasibility study on the preservation of Civil War battlefields and \nrelated sites in the four states along the Vicksburg Campaign Trail. As \nmy colleagues know, Vicksburg served as a gateway to the Mississippi \nRiver during the Civil War. The 18-month campaign for the ``Gibraltar \nof the Confederacy'' included over 100,000 soldiers and involved a \nnumber of skirmishes and major battles in Mississippi, Arkansas, \nLouisiana, and Tennessee. The Mississippi Heritage Trust and the \nNational Trust for Historic Preservation named the Vicksburg Campaign \nTrail as being among the most threatened sites in the State and the \nNation. S. 710 would begin the process of preserving the important \nlandmarks in the four State region that warrant further protection. I \nappreciate the cosponsorship of Chairman Murkowski, Chairman Thomas, \nand Senators Landrieu, Breaux, Cochran, Hutchinson, and Craig on this \nmeasure.\n  The Senate also approved S. 1117, the Corinth Battlefield \nPreservation Act of 1999, a measure that establishes the Corinth Unit \nof the Shiloh National Military Park. The battle of Shiloh was actually \npart of the Union Army's overall effort to seize Corinth. This small \ntown was important to both the Confederacy and the Union. Corinth's \nrailway was vitally important to both sides as it served as a gateway \nfor moving troops and supplies north and south, east and west. The \noverall campaign led to some of the bloodiest battles in the Western \ntheater. In an effort to protect the city, Southern forces built a \nseries of earthworks and fortifications, many of which remain, at least \nfor now, in pristine condition. Unfortunately, the National Park \nService in its ``Profiles of America's Most Threatened Civil War \nBattlefields,'' concluded that many of the sites associated with the \nsiege of Corinth are threatened.\n  S. 1117 would give Corinth its proper place in American history by \nformally linking the city's battlefield sites with the Shiloh National \nMilitary Park. I\n\n[[Page S14284]]\n\nthank Senators Robb, Cochran, and Jeffords for cosponsoring this \nmeasure. I also express my appreciation to Chairman Thomas for his ever \nvigilant efforts on parks legislation, and in particular, for moving \nboth the Vicksburg Campaign Trail and Corinth battlefield bills \nforward. I take this opportunity to recognize Chairman Murkowski for \nhis continued stewardship over the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Mr. President, I also want to recognize Ken P'Pool, Deputy State \nHistoric Preservation Officer for Mississippi; Rosemary Williams, \nchairman of the Siege and Battle of Corinth Commission; John Sullivan, \npresident of the Friends of the Vicksburg Campaign and Historic Trail; \nand Terry Winschel and Woody Harrell of the U.S. Park Service for their \nsupport and guidance on these important preservation measures. Lastly, \nI recognize several staff members including Randy Turner, Jim O'Toole, \nand Andrew Lundquist from the Senate Energy Committee, Darcie Tomasallo \nfrom Senate Legislative Counsel, and Stan Harris, Angel Campbell, \nSteven Wall, Jim Sartucci, and Steven Apicella from my office, for \ntheir efforts to preserve Mississippi's and America's historic \nresources. Mr. President, as a result of the Senate's action today, our \nchildren will be better able to understand and appreciate the full \nhistoric, social, and economic impact of the Vicksburg Campaign Trail \nand the Siege and Battle of Corinth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14284-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REGIONAL COOPERATIVE HEALTH PROGRAM FUNDING THROUGH WYE SUPPLEMENTAL \n                           ASSISTANCE-FUNDING\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge the United States \nAgency for International Development (USAID) to allocate some of its \nWye Supplemental Assistance Funding to the first regional cooperative \nhealth program ever designed to serve both the Palestinians and \nIsraelis. Improving the health of Palestinians and Israelis through a \nsuccessful cooperative endeavor would provide a vibrant prescription \nfor peace in the Middle East.\n  This important health program, which pairs the Kuvin Center for the \nStudy of Infectious and Tropical Diseases of the Hebrew University in \nJerusalem with the Palestinian Al-Quds University, has requested \nsupport from USAID as a $20 million, five-year program. The purpose of \nthis program is to find innovative ways to fight infectious diseases in \nthe region, and calls upon these Universities to build a permanent, \ncollaborative infrastructure for improving the health of the \nPalestinian and Israeli people.\n  United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said the most \nimportant projects for promoting peace and cooperation between nations \nare what she calls ``people projects''--those projects that people of \nall races, religions, and beliefs can support. This program, which \nseeks to protect local people from the infectious and parasitic \ndiseases that are among the leading causes of death in the West Bank \nand Gaza, is a great example of fostering cooperation through people \nprojects of mutual interest.\n  USAID has successfully funded similar health programs in Egypt and \nTurkey, but this is the first such program proposed for the Israeli and \nPalestinian people. Members of Congress, the President, and the State \nDepartment all support this program. If USAID funds the program, it \nwould give the United States scientific and fiscal oversight through \nboth USAID and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n  I support the funding for this regional collaborative effort as a \npowerful example of what a working relationship should be in the Middle \nEast and I believe that it should be given the highest funding priority \nout of the Wye package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14284-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE FEMA EMERGENCY FOOD AND SHELTER ACT\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of S. 1516, legislation \nreauthorizing the Federal Emergency Administration's Emergency Food and \nShelter program, I am very pleased that the Senate is about to pass \nthis legislation and send it to the House of Representatives. I hope \nthat our colleagues in the House will swiftly approve this important \nbill, so that it can be sent to President Clinton for his signature \nbefore our legislative session adjourns for the year.\n  FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter (EFS) program provides financial \nassistance to supplement community efforts to provide food, shelter, \nand other valuable items to homeless and hungry people around the \ncountry. Most of the EFS' monies are distributed directly to local \nboards, which are comprised of representatives from religious and \ncharitable organizations from the surrounding area. These boards then \naward grants to non-profit, voluntary, and social service \norganizations, which assist individuals with their food, shelter, or \nemergency assistance costs. Using a local distribution network helps to \nensure that the EFS' funds are targeted to those who most need \nassistance.\n  To its credit, FEMA has been very successful in keeping the \nadministrative costs of this program very low. In fact, these costs \nconsume less than 3 percent of the funding, which is an inspiring \nexample that all of the Federal Government's agencies and departments \nshould strive to follow.\n  In Maine, the EFS program has been extremely helpful. For example the \nSister Mary O'Donnell Shelter, located in Presque Isle, Maine, received \na $10,500 grant from this program. Amazingly enough, this shelter was \nable to use this modest funding to provide the equivalent of 1,974 \nnights of shelter for the homeless in northern Maine.\n  EFS is a very successful program that carefully targets its resources \nwhere they are needed most, and does so with an absolute minimum of \nadministrative expense. The Government Affairs Committee approved this \nlegislation with a unanimous voice vote on November 3, 1999, and I hope \nthe full Senate will do likewise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14284-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14284-S14285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES ASSISTANCE AND BILL OF RIGHTS ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the current \nreauthorization of the Developmental Disabilities Act, and I commend \nSenator Jeffords for his leadership in making this reauthorization a \npriority.\n  I also commend the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and the administration for their leadership in \ndeveloping this bipartisan bill. I especially want to recognize Tom \nHarkin for his leadership and continued commitment to individuals with \ndisabilities. I also commend all the staff members for their skillful \nwork to make this process successful.\n  Today, I particularly want to take this opportunity to say thank you \nto my sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver for her many years of extraordinary \ndedication and commitment to children and adults with mental \nretardation and their families. Had it not been for her vision and \ncommitment on behalf of people with mental retardation, the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Act would not be the impressive success it \nis today.\n  For many years, since the Developmental Disabilities Act was first \nsigned into law by President Kennedy in 1963, developmental \ndisabilities programs in the states have worked effectively to improve \nthe lives of children and adults with mental retardation and other \ndevelopmental disabilities. The act serves as the foundation for a \nnetwork of programs that offer them real choices on where to live, \nwork, go to school, and participate in community life.\n  Through these programs, the 4 million individuals with mental \nretardation and other developmental disabilities are able to obtain the \nsupport they need to participate in all aspects of the community. They \nreceive needed assistance in education, and early intervention efforts \nare used to provide appropriate health care services and support.\n  For millions of Americans these services can mean the difference \nbetween dependence and independence, between lost potential and \nbecoming contributing and participating members of their communities.\n  Throughout the preparation of this legislation, we have listened to \nconsumers, advocates, families, and program administrators--all of whom \nhave\n\n[[Page S14285]]\n\ncontributed significantly to this legislation. Their commitment to \nconstructive compromise will improve the lives and choices of all \npeople with disabilities and their families.\n  This reauthorization builds on the gains of the past three decades, \nwhile addressing critical and emerging needs of individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  It improves the accountability of the programs under the Act by \nemphasizing better coordination, and by concentrating on activities \nrelated to child care, health care, housing, transportation, and \nrecreation;\n  It offers wider training opportunities by strengthening the network \nof university centers that provide technical assistance to persons with \ndisabilities, to their families, and to service providers across the \ncountry;\n  It supports stronger protection and advocacy services to prevent \nabuse and neglect, so that people with disabilities can live safely;\n  It targets funds for the development of statewide self-advocacy \norganizations, so that people with disabilities will have a stronger \nvoice in determining their lives and their future;\n  It helps states to develop support programs for families with a \ndisabled family member, so that living at home and becoming part of the \ncommunity is a real choice for persons with disabilities; and\n  It provides funds to develop a new educational curriculum and \nestablish scholarship opportunities for support workers who assist \npeople with developmental disabilities.\n  This bill gives us an excellent opportunity to do more to keep the \npromise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--by ensuring that \nindividuals with mental retardation and other significant developmental \ndisabilities, and their families, have realistic opportunities to \nobtain the support and services they need to reach their dream of being \ncontributing members of their communities.\n  Disabled people are not unable.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the \nenclosed notice, stating that the Iran emergency declared in 1979 is to \ncontinue in effect beyond November 14, 1999, to the Federal Register \nfor publication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the \nCongress and published in the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. \nThe most recent notice appeared in the Federal Register on November 12, \n1998. This emergency is separate from that declared with respect to \nIran on March 15, 1995, in Executive Order 12957.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has \nnot been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to \nadjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran \nand of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United \nStates continues to function, and normalization of commercial and \ndiplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been \nachieved. On March 15, 1995, I declared a separate national emergency \nwith respect to Iran pursuant to the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act and imposed separate sanctions. By Executive Order 12959 of \nMay 6, 1995, these sanctions were significantly augmented, and by \nExecutive Order 13059 of August 19, 1997, the sanctions imposed in 1995 \nwere further clarified. In these circumstances, I have determined that \nit is necessary to maintain in force the broad authorities that are in \nplace by virtue of the November 14, 1979, declaration of emergency, \nincluding the authority to block certain property of the Government of \nIran, and which are needed in the process of implementing the January \n1981 agreements with Iran.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nprovide that an employee's ``regular rate'' for purposes of calculating \ncompensation will not be affected by certain additional payments; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                      bonus incentive act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bonus \nIncentive Act of 1999. I am joined in introducing this bill by my \ncolleagues, Senators Nickles, Brownback, Voinovich, Ashcroft, Craig, \nEnzi, and Thomas. This important legislation will give America's hourly \nwage workers the same ability to receive performance-based bonuses that \nsalaried employees currently have.\n  Mr. President, under the Fair Labor Standards Act, employers who give \nperformance-based bonuses (usually at the end of the year) must go back \nand recalculate each employee's hourly base rate of pay and thus any \novertime pay they received must be adjusted accordingly. Often, the \nemployer must spend many hours of accountants' time for relatively \nminor adjustments in overtime pay.\n  This unnecessary and overly burdensome requirement discourages many \nemployers (those who even know about this obscure provision) from \nproviding a performance-based bonus system to their hourly wage \nemployees, while salaried or ``exempt'' employees can enjoy such \nbonuses. Other employers attempt to comply with the law by \nreclassifying bonuses as not being performance-based. The net result of \nthis law has been to hamper the productivity of the American worker and \nto trap unwary employers with unnecessary paperwork and even fines.\n  My legislation, the companion of which has been passed by the House \nEducation and Workforce Committee, would allow performance-based \nbonuses to be paid to employees without the need to recalculate \novertime pay, provided that employees are made fully aware of the \nrequirements of receiving such bonuses and provided that such bonuses \nare not used as a substitute for hourly pay.\n  Mr. President, when the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was enacted \nin 1938, over 60 years ago, employers typically rewarded only their \nmanagement personnel for the level of their achievement with \nperformance-based bonuses. Such bonus programs for employees were very \nrare. But times have changed, and so has the American workplace. With \nthe rise of the service-sector, post-industrial economy, increased \ncompetition from overseas, and the growing importance of workplace \nproductivity and efficiency, ``gainsharing'' and other performance-\nbased bonus programs for workers are commonplace.\n  Such programs are as varied as they are common. The model that comes \nfirst to mind is a bonus based on the number of items a factory worker \nproduces in a month, quarter, or year. But gainsharing programs are \nequally effective in the service sector. Pam Farr, former senior vice \npresident for Marriott Lodging and now president of the Cabot Advisory \nGroup, recently testified before the House Education and the Workforce \nCommittee that Marriott used gainsharing plans for housekeeping and \ncustomer service personnel that rewarded employees for the cleanliness \nof rooms, and customer service evaluations. Cordant Technologies, which \nmakes solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle, rewards its workers \nfor achieving goals involving workplace safety, customer satisfaction, \nand indirect cost reduction.\n  Whatever type of gainsharing arrangement an employer may have, there \ncan be no doubt that these programs increase workers' pay, \nproductivity, and contribute to higher customer satisfaction and better \nworkplace relations. Studies have demonstrated that employees who \nparticipate in gainsharing arrangements on average receive about 5 to \n10 percent more pay from such participation, and many bonus programs \nallow employees to increase their base pay by as much as 50 percent.\n\n  Employees who participate in these programs also report being more \nsatisfied on the job and to have a more positive attitude toward their \nemployer. A 1981 survey by the General Accounting Office found that \nover 80 percent of firms they interviewed reported improvements in \nlabor-management relations from such programs. Grievances in such \ncompanies dropped 50 percent, and absenteeism by 20 percent when \ngainsharing was offered to workers.\n\n[[Page S14288]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the majority of performance-based bonus programs are \noffered only to one segment of the American workforce: those employees \nwho are salaried and therefore ``exempt'' from many of the strictures \nof the Fair Labor Standards Act. The other 70-plus million Americans \nwho get paid by the hour are precluded from fully participating in \nthese programs. Why is this? If performance bonuses work so well, why \naren't they offered to more hourly wage workers?\n  The answer is that the 61-year-old FLSA requires that when such \nbonuses are provided to hourly workers, the employer must then re-\ncalculate each employee's ``regular rate'' of pay, which in turn \nrequires a recalculation of worker's overtime pay. This process of \nrecalculating employee overtime can consume substantial administrative \ntime, often for very little in the way of additional overtime pay. One \nhuman resources director testified before Congress that it took four \npeople 160 hours to calculate the bonuses for 235 employees.\n  This requirement can be particularly burdensome for many of the \nnation's millions of small businesses that may not have computer \nhardware and software that can run these types of calculations. For \nemployers who must try to do these calculations by hand, it can be such \na headache that the employer will either drop the bonus program \naltogether or simply ignore the law, both of which are obviously \nundesirable outcomes.\n  The Bonus Incentive Act I am introducing today will alleviate this \nunnecessary and counterproductive requirement, and allow all employees \nto participate equally in gainsharing programs. In fact, by extending \nthese programs to hourly wage employees who, on average, make less than \ntheir salaried counterparts, this bill could be a significant shot-in-\nthe-arm to their take home pay. The Employee Policy Foundation reports \nthat a median wage U.S. worker could earn between an additional $17,000 \nand $26,000 over a 20-year period by participating in a performance-\nbased bonus plan.\n  Why would anyone oppose this bill, Mr. President? It is good for \nemployers and employees alike. It means less paperwork and more pay, \nless bureaucracy and more productivity.\n  Some have raised the concern that employers may somehow attempt to \ndisguise regular hourly pay as gainsharing bonuses. While it would take \na very ambitious employer to make such a scheme profitable, \nparticularly considering the impact such conduct would have on employee \nmorale, there are protections in the bill against such a possibility.\n  First, the employer must provide all employees, in writing, a \ndetailed description of what the requirements and benefits of the \ngainsharing plan will be. The actual formula by which the bonus is to \nbe calculated must also be spelled-out. There can be no doubt about \nwhat the employee would be required to do and what he or she would \nstand gain.\n  Second, the employer is absolutely prohibited from using a \nperformance-based bonus to in any way replace the hourly wage pay the \nemployee would otherwise have received. In fact, the bill requires that \nthe plan be ``established and maintained in good faith for the purpose \nof distributing to employees additional remuneration over and above the \nwages and salaries that are not dependent upon the existence of such \nplan.'' If an employer should violate this and, for example, but \nworkers pay and substitute that for bonus pay, that employer would be \nsubject to the same civil and even criminal sanctions as he would for \nany violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act, which is vigorously \nenforced by the U.S. Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division.\n  But the truth is, Mr. President, that there is very little reason for \nemployers today to abuse this provision, and every reason in the world \nto use it for the betterment of employees and to the long-term success \nof the company. If the tremendous economic revolution and growth we \nhave witnessed in the last two decades has taught us anything, it is \nthat wealth is not a zero-sum game. Our economy continues to outstrip \nthat of the rest of the world not because we have more natural \nresources: other countries have more oil, gold, timber, and other \nresources than we. It is because the productive capacity, ingenuity, \nand entrepreneurship of the American people is allowed to flourish \nunder our system.\n  Outdated laws such as this must be revised if we are to continue to \nenjoy the growing fruits of our labor. The Bonus Incentive Act will \nhelp accomplish this goal, and I urge my colleagues to support and pass \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1880. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve the \nhealth of minority individuals; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                    health care fairness act of 1999\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past few decades, we have made \nextraordinary advances as a nation in science and medicine. \nUnfortunately, those advances are not benefitting all of our citizens \nequally. Minority communities suffer disproportionately from many \nsevere health problems.\n  We know that poverty, lack of health insurance, and other barriers to \ncare continue to undermine the health of minorities. Clearly we need to \ndo more to give all Americans the fair chance for a healthy future that \nthey deserve.\n  The Administration has taken important steps to address this \nchallenge. Last year, the President announced the Initiative to \nEliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health. This initiative, led \nby the Department of Health and Human Services, has identified several \nareas where new commitments, new ideas, and new resources are \nnecessary. The goal is to eliminate disparities in the areas of \ncardiovascular disease, cancer screening and management, diabetes, \ninfant mortality, HIV/AIDS, and immunizations by 2010. This ambitious \ngoal cannot be met without a major effort to improve research on the \nhealth of minorities and develop the steps needed to reduce these \ndisparities.\n  Today, Senators Akaka, Inouye, Lincoln, Wellstone, and I are \nintroducing the Health Care Fairness Act of 1999, to secure the \ncommitment and resources needed in each of these areas to ensure that \nminorities have a fair chance for improved health.\n  Minority populations suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular \ndisease. They have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure, \nand are less likely to receive treatment to manage the condition after \nit develops. As a result, African Americans are 40 percent more likely \nto die from coronary heart disease than whites.\n  A Georgetown University study published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine last February found that bias in the decisions made by doctors \nis a factor in the treatment that African Americans receive when they \nsuffer from heart disease. These findings are based on an experiment \nwhere physicians volunteered to view a video of actors posing as \npatients with significant symptoms of heart disease. The physicians \nwere asked to prescribe further interventions for each ``patient,'' all \nof whom had identical medical histories, insurance coverage, and \noccupations. While 91 percent of the white males, white females, and \nAfrican American males in the study were referred for cardiac \ncatheterization, a more effective but more expensive diagnostic \nprocedure, only 79 percent of the African American females in the study \nwere referred for this test.\n  A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine last month \nfound similar disparities in the treatment of lung cancer. Patients \nwhose tumors are discovered early are often able to be cured with \nsurgery. This study found that African American patients with tumors \nsmall enough to be surgically removed were treated surgically in only \n64 percent of cases, compared with 77 percent of white patients treated \nsurgically. As a result, African Americans have only a 26 percent \nchance of surviving lung cancer, compared with a 34 percent survival \nrate for whites.\n  Other types of cancer also strike racial and ethnic minorities in \ndisproportionate numbers. Vietnamese American women are five times more \nlikely than white women to contract cervical cancer. Hispanic women are \ntwice as likely to contract cervical cancer. Native Hawaiian men are 13 \npercent more likely to contact lung cancer. Alaskan\n\n[[Page S14289]]\n\nNative women are 72 percent more likely to contract colon cancer and \nrectal cancer, when compared with whites. In addition, African \nAmericans and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with \ncancer once the disease has reached an advanced stage. For African \nAmericans, the result is a 35 percent higher death rate.\n  The Institute of Medicine, issued a report last February concluding \nthat federal efforts to research cancer in minority communities are \ninsufficient. The report recommended an increase in resources and the \ndevelopment of a strategic plan to coordinate this research. The \nresults of this study confirm that while NIH has been extremely \nsuccessful in producing medical breakthroughs that improve health care, \nthose breakthroughs do not always reach into racial and ethnic \ncommunities.\n  The same troubling differences are found with HIV/AIDS. The powerful \nnew drugs that have dramatically decreased AIDS deaths and prevented or \ndelayed progression from HIV to AIDS for so many citizens are not \nreaching minorities in proportion to their need. Racial and ethnic \nminorities make up approximately 25 percent of the total population, \nbut these groups account for over half of all AIDS cases. The disparity \nis even greater for African American and Hispanic women, who account \nfor nearly 80 percent of the AIDS cases reported among women.\n  In spite of recent bipartisan efforts to increase access to health \ncare for all children, racial and ethnic disparities exist among young \nAmericans as well. Minority children are less likely to receive \nprescription medications, and they have lower immunization rates than \nwhite children. Inadequate health care places a barrier in the path of \nhealthy development for minority children, and that is an unfair \ndisadvantage.\n  The Health Care Fairness Act of 1999 addresses these racial and \nethnic health disparities in many ways. It contains sections on \nresearch, data collection, medical education, and outreach. Each of \nthese aspects has an important role to play in the reduction and \neventual elimination of these unacceptable health disparities.\n  Title I establishes a Center for Research on Minority Health at the \nNational Institutes of Health. The Center will oversee the development \nof an NIH-wide strategic plan for minority health research. This step \nwill enable those concerned with the advancement of research on \nminority health, both inside and outside NIH, to monitor the progress \nof NIH in this area. The Center will award Centers of Excellence grants \nto institutions across the country that serve under-represented \npopulations. These funds will be used to conduct research into the \nnature, causes, and remedies for health disparties, to train minorities \nto become biomedical research professionals, to improve the \ninfrastructure for conducting biomedical research on health disparties, \nand to provide long-term stability to these biomedical research \nprograms.\n\n  Changing attitudes about race and ethnic backgrounds are an ongoing \nchallenge for all sectors of our society. The Georgetown study does not \nconclude that most doctors are racist. No such assumptions are drawn \nfrom its results. What is shown is that health care providers, like all \nmembers of our society, enter their profession with perceptions and \nbiases related to race. Many industries have confronted racial \nsensitivity issues in their training programs. This study shows that \nsuch training must also be a part of medical education, for both new \nstudents and experienced practitioners alike.\n  To help health care providers improve their ability to work with \npatients of different backgrounds, we must also develop educational \ntechniques that are effective in improving this aspect of health care \ndelivery. Title II of the Health Care Finance Act establishes \ndemonstration projects to develop effective educational techniques such \nas courses that focus on reducing racial and ethnic disparties in \nhealth care.\n  The close connection between race and poverty in this country has had \na significant negative impact on the access of minority communities to \nquality health care. Reducing racial and ethnic health disparties will \nrequire a better understanding of issues beyond effective treatments \nand other questions of basic science. Barriers to care, poor quality \nhealth services, and the lack of useful outcome measures are all part \nof this complex problem. Title III of our bill strengthens the federal \ncommitment to these social science aspects of health disparties. It \ndirects the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to conduct and \nsupport research in these areas, to promote effective interventions in \nminority communities, and to develop outcome measures to assess and \nimprove health care for minority populations.\n  Measuring our progress in reducing these racial and ethnic disparties \nwill also require reliable and complete data on miniority health. In \norder to provide reliable information on the health status of minority \ncommunities, Title IV of our bill directs the National Academy of \nSciences to conduct a study of the data collection and reporting \nsystems at the Department of Health and Human Services that include \nrace and ethnicity.\n  This study will evaluate the effectiveness of data collection at HHS \nand recommend improvements for ensuring that reliable and complete \ninformation on racial and ethnic health disparties is available.\n  The estimated cost of these provisions for fiscal year 2000 totals \njust under $350 million. The estimated cost in subsequent years is \napproximately $260 million. This is a small price when compared to the \ndamage that racial and ethnic health disparties are causing in so many \ncommunities. We all know that in the long run better health is always \nless expensive than sickness and hospitalization.\n  We know that many other structural, personal, and historical factors \ncontribute to racial and ethnic disparties in health care. Our \nlegislation asks that we make the elimination of these disparties a \nhigher priority. It asks that we do all we can to develop the knowledge \nnecessary to do better. The result will be a fairer chance for the \nhealthy future that all Americans deserve, and I look forward to early \naction by Congress on this needed legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the accompanying letters and statement of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1880\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States ranks below most industrialized \n     nations in health status as\n\n[[Page S14290]]\n\n     measured by longevity, sickness, and mortality.\n       (2) The United States ranks 24th among industrialized \n     nations in infant mortality.\n       (3) This poor rank in health status is attributed in large \n     measure to the lower health status of America's minority \n     populations.\n       (4) Many minority groups suffer disproportionately from \n     cancer. Disparities exist in both mortality and incidence \n     rates. For men and women combined, African Americans have a \n     cancer death rate about 35 percent higher than that for \n     whites. Paralleling the death rate, the incidence rate for \n     lung cancer in African American men is about 50 percent \n     higher than white men. Native Hawaiian men also have elevated \n     rates of lung cancer compared with white men. Alaskan Native \n     men and women suffer from higher rates of cancers of the \n     colon and rectum than do whites. Vietnamese women in the \n     United States have a cervical cancer incidence rate more than \n     5 times greater than white women. Hispanic women also suffer \n     elevated rates of cervical cancer.\n       (5) Infant death rates among African American, Native \n     Americans and Alaskan Natives, and Hispanics were well above \n     the national average. The greatest disparity exists for \n     African Americans. The overall Native American rate does not \n     reflect the diversity among Indian communities, some of which \n     have infant mortality rates approaching twice the national \n     rate.\n       (6) Sudden infant death syndrome (referred to in this \n     section as ``SIDS'') accounts for approximately 10 percent of \n     all infant deaths in the first year of life. Minority \n     populations are at greater risk for SIDS. In addition to the \n     greater risks among African Americans, the rates are 3 to 4 \n     times as high for some Native American and Alaskan Native \n     populations.\n       (7) Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death \n     for all racial and ethnic groups. Major disparities exist \n     among population groups, with a disproportionate burden of \n     death and disability from cardiovascular disease in minority \n     and low-income populations. Stroke is the only leading cause \n     of death for which mortality is higher for Asian-American \n     males than for white males.\n       (8) Racial and ethnic minorities have higher rates of \n     hypertension, tend to develop hypertension at an earlier age, \n     and are less likely to undergo treatment to control their \n     high blood pressure.\n       (9) Diabetes, the seventh leading cause of death in the \n     United States, is a serious public health problem affecting \n     racial and ethnic communities. The prevalence of diabetes in \n     African Americans is approximately 70 percent higher than \n     whites and the prevalence in Hispanics is nearly double that \n     of whites. The prevalence rate of diabetes among Native \n     Americans and Alaskan Natives is more than twice that for the \n     total population and at least 1 tribe, the Pimas of Arizona, \n     have the highest known prevalence of diabetes of any \n     population in the world.\n       (10) The human immunodeficiency virus (referred to in this \n     section as ``HIV''), which causes acquired immune deficiency \n     syndrome (referred to in this section as ``AIDS''), results \n     in disproportionate suffering in minority populations. \n     Minority persons represent 25 percent of the total United \n     States population, but 54 percent of all cases of AIDS.\n       (11) More than 75 percent of AIDS cases reported among \n     women and children occur in minority women and children.\n       (12) Nearly 2 of 5 (38 percent) Hispanic adults, 1 of 4 (24 \n     percent) African American adults, and 1 of 4 (24 percent) \n     Asian-American adults are uninsured, compared with 1 of 7 (14 \n     percent) white adults.\n       (13) Elderly minorities experience disparities in access to \n     care and health status, in part because medicare covers only \n     half the health care expenses of older Americans.\n       (14) Two of 5 Hispanic and 2 of 5 African Americans age 65 \n     and older rate their health status as fair or poor, compared \n     with less than 1 of 4 (23 percent) white Americans 65 and \n     over.\n       (15) Nearly 2 of 5 (39 percent) African American adults and \n     almost half (46 percent) of Hispanic adults report that they \n     do not have a regular doctor, compared with 1 of 4 (26 \n     percent) of white adults.\n       (16) Minority Americans 65 and older are less likely to \n     have a regular doctor or to see a specialist.\n       (17) Ninety percent of minority physicians produced by \n     Historically Black Medical Colleges live and serve in \n     minority communities.\n       (18) Almost half (45 percent) of Hispanic adults, 2 of 5 \n     (41 percent) Asian-American adults, and more than 1 of 3 (35 \n     percent) African American adults report difficulty paying for \n     medical care, compared with 1 of 4 (26 percent) white adults.\n       (19) Despite suffering disproportionate rates of illness, \n     death, and disability, minorities have not been \n     proportionately represented in many clinical research trials, \n     except in studies of behavioral risk factors associated with \n     negative stereotypes.\n       (20) Culturally sensitive approaches to research are needed \n     to encourage minority participation in research studies.\n       (21) There is a national need for minority scientists in \n     the field of biomedical, clinical, and health services \n     research.\n       (22) In 1990, only 3.3 percent of all United States medical \n     school faculties were underrepresented minority persons.\n       (23) Only 1 percent of full professors were \n     underrepresented minority persons in 1990.\n       (24) The proportion of underrepresented minorities in high \n     academic ranks, such as professors and associated professors, \n     decreased from 1980 to 1990.\n       (25) African Americans with identical complaints of chest \n     pain are less likely than white Americans to be referred by \n     physicians for sophisticated cardiac tests.\n       (26) Cultural competency training in medical schools and \n     residency training programs has the potential to reduce \n     disparities in health care and health outcomes.\n       (27) More detailed data on health disparities is needed \n     to--\n       (A) evaluate the impact that race and ethnicity have on \n     health status, access to care, and quality of care; and\n       (B) enforce existing protections for equal access to care.\n\n TITLE I--IMPROVING MINORITY HEALTH THROUGH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF \n                                 HEALTH\n\n     SEC. 101.

Sullivan, M.D., President, Morehouse School of \n   Medicine on the Health Care Fairness Act of 1999, November 5, 1999\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to speak in strong support of \n     the Health Care Fairness Act of 1999, which would elevate the \n     NIH's Office of Research on Minority Health to a National \n     Center for Research on Minority Health and Health \n     Disparities. Senator Kennedy and his colleagues are to be \n     commended for their initiative.\n       For too many years, this country has witnessed one \n     disturbing report after another detailing the growing \n     disparities in health status between our minority and \n     majority populations. Unfortunately, while these reports \n     continue, not enough has been done to change this shocking \n     and unacceptable dynamic.\n       Infant mortality is nearly twice the rate for minorities as \n     it is for non-minorities.\n       African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans \n     disproportionately suffer a variety of health care \n     disparities including cancer, diabetes, heart disease and \n     stroke.\n       The HIV virus and AIDS cases result in disproportionate \n     suffering in minority populations. While minorities in the \n     United States represent about 28% of the population, \n     minorities account for 54% of all AIDS cases.\n       The above mentioned are only a few of the health care \n     challenges faced by minorities and disadvantaged populations.\n       If we as a nation are to solve these complex problems, we \n     must take an aggressive approach on all fronts. At the core \n     of improving the health status for all Americans is a strong \n     biomedical research effort to understand the factors which \n     contribute to health problems.\n       During the time I was HHS Secretary, I was very pleased to \n     work with the Congress, particularly Congressman Louis Stokes \n     (D-OH) to establish the existing Office for Research on \n     Minority Health at NIH. Notwithstanding the success of this \n     office in highlighting and addressing health disparities, and \n     in supporting research focused on improving minority health, \n     the magnitude of the problem of health status disparities \n     warrants an even more aggressive effort.\n       At the beginning of this year, we were very pleased to \n     begin working with Congressman Jesse Jackson, Jr. (D-IL), \n     Charlie Norwood (R-GA), J.C. Watts (R-OK), and Congresswoman \n     Donna Christensen (D-VI) to introduce H.R. 2391, the National \n     Center for Domestic Health Disparities Act of 1999. The \n     bipartisan Jackson bill, and the legislation that is being \n     introduced today, would elevate the existing NIH Office of \n     Research on Minority Health to a National Center for Research \n     on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and provide the \n     National Center with four new major mechanisms, which the \n     existing office does not have. They are:\n       (1) The Director of the Center will participate with other \n     Institute and Center Directors to determine research policy \n     and initiatives at NIH.\n       (2) The Center will serve as the catalyst for forward-\n     thinking, strategic planning for the entire NIH, in order to \n     bring all of NIH's considerable resources to bear, to close \n     the health status gap.\n       (3) The bill empowers the Center Director to make peer-\n     reviewed grants in areas of promising research which are not \n     being addressed by the existing centers and institutes at \n     NIH.\n       (4) There will be a new program of support for research \n     excellence at those academic health centers which have \n     demonstrated a historic commitment to studying and addressing \n     diseases which disproportionately affect minority Americans. \n     As a result of this legislation, minority investigations and \n     institutions like Morehouse School of Medicine, of which I am \n     President, Meharry Medical College, and others will have \n     access to the types of resources necessary to build and \n     enhance research infrastructure, and seek to compete on a \n     level playing field with other prominent institutions.\n       I am grateful that both of the comprehensive bills which \n     are being introduced today in the Senate and the House embody \n     these four principles, and I am particularly pleased that \n     both bills enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n       Today, I am urging members of Congress in both chambers, \n     and from both sides of the aisle to support and cosponsor \n     these important bills. We need to act as quickly as possible \n     to reverse the persistent health status gap, which affects \n     some 28% of our citizens.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           Association of Minority\n\n\n                                   Health Professions Schools,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1999.\n     Hon.

Edward Kennedy,\n     Ranking Minority, Senate Committee on Health, Education, \n         Labor and Pensions, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The National Medical Association \n     (NMA) is pleased to support the ``Health Care Fairness Act of \n     1999.'' While the nation has experienced tremendous advances \n     in biomedical research, the benefits of these advances have \n     not fully transferred to the African American and other \n     minority communities, which are unduly plagued with \n     disproportionate rates of death and disease. As the changing \n     demographics of the United States yield growing racial and \n     ethnic minority populations, it is absolutely essential that \n     the nation become more proactive in addressing the critical \n     health and biomedical research needs of communities of color.\n       Critical provisions of the ``Health Care Fairness Act of \n     1999'' include:\n       The establishment of the Center for Research on Minority \n     Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of \n     Health (NIH);\n       The provision of funds for peer-reviewed minority health-\n     focused research grants, at the Institutes and Centers of the \n     NIH;\n       The requirement to establish a comprehensive plan and \n     budget for the conduct and support of all minority research \n     activities of the NIH agencies; and\n       The establishment of a grant program to support the \n     development of culturally competent curricula in health care \n     education.\n       The NMA supports the ``Health Care Fairness Act of 1999'' \n     and believes that this legislation will create important \n     opportunities for the nation to make concrete advances in \n     it's effort to close the health disparity gap.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Walter W.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Honorable Senator Kennedy: The Association of Black \n     Cardiologists, Inc. (ABC) would like to offer its full \n     support of The Health Care Fairness Act of 1999. Its premise \n     and objectives serve to meet the creativity and foresight \n     needed to eliminate the disparity in health care and the \n     mortality rate among African Americans versus White \n     Americans. We wholeheartedly endorse the efforts of this bill \n     to improve minority health, minority health research, data \n     collection relating to race or ethnicity, and the promotion \n     of medical education.\n       A robust economy and years of government pressure have \n     helped move minority groups closer to the mainstream, but \n     when it comes to health, studies show a stubborn, daunting \n     and in some respects continuous disparity between Black and \n     White Americans. For decades, Blacks have suffered higher \n     death rates from nearly all-major causes including asthma, \n     diabetes, cancer, major infectious diseases and \n     cardiovascular diseases. The ABC recognizes that \n     cardiovascular diseases, the leading cause of deaths in the \n     United States, affect every family. CVD is the major cause of \n     death for the African American population. Contrary to \n     popular belief, the number one killer in the African American \n     community is not violence, cancer, or AIDS. Blacks are more \n     likely to die from cardiovascular disease than from any other \n     disease. We can reduce the cost of health care, improve \n     patient adherence to prescribed drug regimens, and improve \n     the cultural competence of medical professionals with the \n     passing of this bill.\n       The ABC mission states: ``We believe that good health is \n     the cornerstone of progress for our people. We are firm in \n     our resolve to make exemplary health care accessible and \n     affordable to all in need, dedicated to lowering the high \n     rate of cardiovascular diseases in minority populations and \n     committed to advocacy and diversity. We are guided by high \n     ethics in all our transactions and strive for excellence in \n     our training and skills.''\n       Our mission throughout our organization is to assure that \n     `African American Children know their Grandparents'. \n     Typically, African American men, with a life expectancy of \n     less than 65 years, die without the joy of nurturing and \n     guiding their grandchildren as only grandparents can.\n       What we know from our past efforts to address this issue is \n     that it takes a focus effort to increase awareness, to \n     educate, and to eliminate the disparities in health care. We \n     are pleased that this bill will take this direction. Little \n     progress will be made without a strong partnership among \n     medical, public health and community organizations, and \n     government. Please let us know what else we can do to aid in \n     this effort. We applaud your commitment and stand ready to \n     work actively with you to accomplish these objectives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    B.

A bill to amend chapter 84 of title 5, United States Code, \nto make certain temporary Federal service creditable for retirement \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                      THE FERS BUYBACK ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the FERS Buyback Act \nof 1999, legislation that offers retirement security to many federal \nemployees. Companion legislation has already been introduced in the \nHouse. Specifically, this legislation would help employees throughout \nthe country hired as temporary workers in the 1980s that continued to \nwork for the federal government into the 1990s.\n  Hundreds of current and former term employees in federal service find \nthemselves ineligible to receive retirement benefits because of their \ninability to receive credit for post-1988 service as temporary federal \nworkers.\n  This legislation would close a loophole in the federal pension system \nthat has adversely impacted many federal workers through no fault of \ntheir own. It would change current law to allow individuals who have \nbecome eligible for the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS) the \noption to receive credit for their past service as temporary employees \nand pay into the retirement fund for the prior years they worked as \ntemporary employees. Because the legislation would merely allow \nqualified workers to buy into the retirement system, the government \nwould not incur costs that it would not have incurred had the law \ntreated them as permanent employees.\n  During the 1980s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) \nhired thousands of employees under temporary status in response to the \nsavings and loan crisis. Despite their temporary designation, many \nserved in excess of five years with the federal government because of \nthe FDIC's annual renewal of their one-year contracts. Unfortunately, \nthese loyal employees did not enjoy the retirement benefits accorded \ntheir colleagues serving the same length of service under permanent \nstatus. To their credit, the FDIC did try to rectify the problem \nseveral years ago by granting many of their former temporary employees \nterm appointments. Such appointments are for more than one year and \nallowed employees to be eligible for FERS.\n  The original FERS Act allowed for employees to make payments or buy \nback certain years of service prior to 1989 for which deductions were \nnot taken. Therefore, the bill unintentionally denied many federal \nemployees credit for time served after January 1, 1989.\n  I invite you to join me in correcting this inequity and ask that you \ncosponsor this fair and straightforward legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1882. A bill to expand child support enforcement through means \nother than programs financed at Federal expense; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n             Child Support Enforcement Options Act of 1999\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nmy colleague, Senator Stevens, the Child Support Enforcement Options \nAct of 1999. This bill will give parents the tools and options they \nneed to made sure their children have the resources they need to get a \ngood start in life.\n  This bill will provide local public agencies and private attorneys \naccess to certain child support enforcement procedures and information \nnot currently available to them. To obtain this access, however, a \nlocal public agency or private attorney would first have to obtain a \ncertificate of registration from the Secretary of the Federal \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and agree to certain federal \nrequirements and procedures in using the enforcement tools.\n  Mr. President, in recent years Congress created a number of new \ninformation gathering and child support enforcement tools to enable \nsome child support enforcement agencies to better enforce support \nawards. Unfortunately, these new tools are not available to hundreds of \ngovernmental and a growing number of private collection entities which \nmany parents must use or choose to use. These so-called ``non IV-D'' \nentities have limited or no access to some new and effective federal \ncollection tools. This legislation will extend these tools to so-called \n``non IV-D'' entities that are properly approved and monitored by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n  Specifically, the bill will allow non-IV-D government agencies and \nprivate collection firms to be able to submit cases for the \ninterception of Federal and State tax refunds for the collection of \nunpaid child support, in accordance with Federal and State statutory \nguidelines; to seek passport sanctions against delinquent parents; to \nreport unpaid child support to credit bureaus; and to obtain current \nlocation and asset information on parents who owe child support. In \naddition, the bill provides that unemployment compensation benefits \nwould be subject to income withholding for child support obligations in \nall child support cases, not just those enforced by a IV-D agency, as \ncurrent law allows.\n  Mr. President, my bill will cost the Federal Government minimal or no \nadditional funds. Nor will it impose any significant obligation on \nstate or local child support agencies, since all government agencies \nwould be allowed under the bill to charge necessary fees to non-IV-D \nagencies with which they share this information.\n  What this bill will do is take a significant step toward collecting \non the estimated $57 billion in overdue child support owed in this \ncountry. Many states and local child support agencies are simply \noverwhelmed and unable to effectively and timely enforce the tens of \nmillions of child support awards in this country. Far from undermining \ntheir role in this process, the Child Support Enforcement Options Act \nwill help them accomplish the mutual goal of making sure that child \nsupport is collected and delivered to where it is needed the most--to \nthe children to whom it is owed.\n  Particularly for families on welfare or other public assistance, \nchild support is often critical to make ends meet. It helps put food on \nthe table, clothes in the closet, and gas in the car. When a non-\ncustodial parent reneges on his or her obligation to provide that \nsupport, it is incumbent upon the government to help enforce that \naward, through whatever means are available to the struggling custodial \nparent. In my opinion, any other consideration is secondary, and I am \nhopeful and confident that my colleagues in the Senate will agree and \nwill work to pass this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1883. A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to eliminate an \ninequity on the applicability of early retirement eligibility \nrequirements to military reserve technicians; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n\n\n    the dual status national guard technicians retirement equity act\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nseeks to remove an inequity in retirement pay benefits for critical \npersonnel in our National Guard and Reserve units who are Dual Status \nTechnicians. They are called ``Dual Status'', Mr. President, because \nthey serve both as military and civilian personnel. There are about \n40,000 Dual Status Technicians covered by retirement requirements and \nrestrictions contained in Title 32 of the United States Code. These men \nand women are the backbone of the National Guard and Reserve structure. \nThey are the mechanics, pilots, engineers, equipment operators, supply \nand support technicians who keep things running so that the Guard is \nable to respond to natural disasters and national emergencies, as well \nas serve on active duty in accordance with the ``total force concept'' \nthat integrates active and reserve forces in the military.\n\n[[Page S14297]]\n\nThese hardworking men and women are often the first called to duty in \nan emergency.\n  As essential as Dual Status Technicians are, they suffer from the \nworst of two employment worlds. These technicians are by statute both \nmilitary and civilian employees. Guard technicians must maintain their \nmilitary job and grade in order to keep their technician status and \nremain a federal employee. In the event of separation from military \nservice, however, they are denied the retirement benefits of those who \nserve in the same grade in the active military. Frequently, Dual Status \nTechnicians who are separated from the military must wait years to \nqualify for their Federal Service retirement benefits.\n  The bill I am introducing in the Senate today is a companion bill \nalready introduced on the House side by Representative Abercrombie. It \nseeks to eliminate retirement inequities--a problem we just addressed \nhead on in the Armed Services Committee when we included a provision in \nthis year's Defense Authorization Bill the eliminate retirement \ninequities between active duty personnel who retired before or after \n1986. We voted this year to effectively eliminate the ``Redux'' \nretirement benefit program because of the lower benefits it offered to \npersonnel who retired after 1986. The action I am proposing in this \nlegislation is somewhat similar.\n  This bill will permit Dual Status Technicians to retire at any age \nwith 25 years of service or at 50 with 20 years of service. Those \nbenefits are similar to benefits provided to Federal police and fire \nemployees. They're similar to federal employees who retire from the \nCongress.\n  I am pleased to see, Mr. President, that this year's Defense \nAuthorization bill took a step to provide equitable benefits to Dual \nStatus Technicians, but in doing so, it crated an inequity within the \nTechnician community itself. A provision in the bill provides for early \nretirement after 25 years at any age, or at age 50 with 20 years of \nservice--but only for those employed as Dual Status Technicians after \n1996. Those same benefits are withheld from those employed before 1996. \nIn other words, Mr. President, we created a situation similar to the \none the Senate dealt with regarding the ``Redux'' retirement program in \nthe Defense Authorization bill. The bill I offer today would remove \nthat inequity in the same way the Senate voted to remove the inequity \nfor active duty personnel who retired under the ``Redux'' program.\n  Mr. President, the cost of equity is not high. An initial estimate by \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimates that this bill could cost \nabout $54 million over a five year period. That number will vary, of \ncourse, depending on the number of Technicians who would choose to take \nadvantage of the change in the law when this bill is enacted. Of \ncourse, we're not only paying for equity here, Mr. President. We're \npaying appropriate, equitable compensation to the men and women who \nhave devoted their careers to service for the nation both at home and \nabroad--our National Guard and Reserve who serve us all so well.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and urge my fellow Members \nto support this effort through cosponsorship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ",

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Frist, Senator DeWine, Senator Kennedy, Senator \nLevin and others in submitting a resolution that would designate \nNovember 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a day for families to discuss \norgan and tissue donation with other family members. The resolution \nuses the theme Give Thanks, Give Life to encourage these discussions so \nthat informed decisions can be made if the occasion to donate arises.\n  Traditionally, Thanksgiving is a time for families to take time out \nof their busy lives to come together and give thanks for the many \nblessings in their lives. This presents the perfect opportunity for \nfamily members to discuss their intentions on the issue of organ and \ntissue donation. Although designation as an organ donor on a driver's \nlicense or voter's registration is a valuable first step in the \ndonation process, it does not ensure donation will take place since the \nfinal decision on whether a potential donor will share the gift of life \nis always made by surviving family members regardless of their loved \none's initial intent.\n  There are approximately 21,000 men, women, and children in the United \nStates who receive the gift of life each year through transplantation \nsurgery made possible by the generosity of organ and tissue donations. \nThis is only a small proportion of the more than 66,000 Americans who \nare on the waiting list, hoping for their chance to prolong their lives \nby finding a matching donor. Tragically, nearly 5,000 of these patients \neach year (or 13 patients each day) die while waiting for a donated \nheart, liver, kidney, or other organ.\n  In order to narrow the gap between the supply and the increasing \ndemand for donated organs, there must be an effort to encourage willing \ndonors to make their desire to donate clear to the only people able to \nmake the decision, if the occasion should arise--their immediate family \nmembers. Although there are up to 15,000 potential donors annually, \nfamilies' consent to donation is received for less than 6,000 donors. \nAs the demand for transplantation increases due to prolonged life \nexpectancy; increased prevalence of diseases that lead to organ damage \nand failure including hypertension, alcoholism, and hepatitis C \ninfection, this shortfall will become even more pronounced. \nAdditionally, the need for a more diverse donor pool, including a \nvariety of racial and ethnic minorities, will also continue to grow \nwith the predicted population trends.\n  Many Americans will spend part of the Thanksgiving Day with some of \nthose family members who would be most likely approached to make the \nimportant decision of whether or not to donate. Therefore, this would \nbe a good time for families to spend a portion of that day discussing \nhow they might give life to others on a day devoted to giving thanks \nfor their own blessings. Open family discussions on this topic on a day \nof relaxation and family togetherness will increase awareness of the \nintentions of those willing to make the courageous and selfless \ndecision to be organ donors, leading to more lifesaving transplants in \nthe future. Designation of November 23, 2000, Thanksgiving Day, as a \nday for families to Give Thanks, Give Life is an important next step to \npromoting the dialogue between willing donors and their families, so \nthat family members will know their loved ones' wishes long before the \nissue arises.\n  We have received the support of many national organ and tissue \ndonation organizations for this resolution including: the American \nHeart Association, American Kidney Fund, American Liver Foundation, \nAmerican Lung Association, American Society of Transplant Surgeons, \nAssociation of Organ Procurement Organizations, Coalition on Donation, \nEye Bank Association of America, National Kidney Foundation, National \nMinority Organ and Tissue Transplant Education Program (MOTTEP), \nTransplant Recipients International Organization (TRIO), United Network \nfor Organ Sharing (UNOS), and the Wendy Marks Foundation for Organ \nDonor Awareness. The efforts of these groups and others have been \ncritical in increasing donor awareness and education of the public on \nthis extremely important cause.\n  Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting \nthis worthwhile resolution designating Thanksgiving day of 2000 as a \nday for families to discuss organ and tissue donation with other family \nmembers, a day to ``Give Thanks, Give Life.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14300-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14300-S14305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED ON NOVEMBER 5, 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        FRIST AMENDMENT NO. 2542\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Frist) proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. \n1654) to authorize appropriations for the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration for fiscal year 2000, 2001, and 2002, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Paul Kirk, who is well known to many of \nus as a distinguished past chairman of the Democratic Party, recently \nwrote an eloquent and insightful article on the state of politics in \nAmerica today. Entitled ``What We Can Do For Democracy,'' Mr. Kirk's \narticle discusses the growing political apathy of Americans, and \nchallenges citizens to take a more active role in government. This \nissue goes to the heart of our democracy, and I believe that all of us \nwho are concerned about it will be interested in Mr. Kirk's ideas. I \nask that his article may be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Nov. 3, 1999]\n\n                    ``What We Can Do for Democracy''\n\n                         (By Paul G. Kirk, Jr.)\n\n       Alarms have sounded; no one has panicked; the response has \n     been universal. Much time and an estimated $200 billion have \n     been spent on readiness and remediation plans to avert a Y2K \n     computer calamity. But how well are we responding to a Y2K \n     alarm of greater consequence--the distressed health of \n     America's democracy?\n       John Kennedy once admonished: ``Democracy is never a final \n     achievement . . . it is a call to an untiring effort.'' In \n     this twilight of ``America's Century'' and before the dawn of \n     a new millennium, now seems a logical time to take stock of \n     our effort.\n       A few weeks ago the Kennedy Library observed its 20th \n     anniversary by inviting more than 75 distinguished business \n     leaders, college presidents, public officials, nonprofit \n     executives, and journalists to begin the assessment. They \n     found the following symptoms:\n       An all-time high level of cynicism, disaffection, and \n     citizen disconnect from politics coincides with an all-time \n     high level of powerful interest money being spent on \n     political campaigns.\n       Money is now the all-consuming obsession of candidates and \n     parties, the deterrent to political competition, the barrier \n     to equal representation, the controlling factor in \n     nominations and elections, and the corrupting influence of \n     public policy decisions.\n       62 percent of Americans eligible to vote in the 1998 \n     midterm election chose not to, while less than a majority \n     voted in the 1996 presidential election.\n       Those of us who know less, care less, participate less, and \n     vote less than other eligible voters are the 18- to 24-year-\n     olds.\n       Personal consumption and borrowing are at an all-time high \n     while our savings rate is at an all-time low.\n       Record market growth and new prosperity will likely result \n     in the largest transfer of individual fortune and economic \n     capital to the next generation in our history.\n       Concurrently, the abrogation of any obligation to transfer \n     to the next generation some appreciation of civic capital and \n     public responsibility is more palpable than ever in our \n     history.\n       Writing of an earlier democracy, historian Edward Gibbon \n     put our symptoms in perspective: ``When the Athenians finally \n     wanted not to give to society but for society to give to \n     them, when the freedom they wished for most was freedom from \n     responsibility, then Athens ceased to be free.''\n       Let's face it. We, too, have become so obsessed with self-\n     gratification and gain that we view our rights and freedoms \n     as entitlements and ignore the civic duties and \n     responsibilities that ensure them.\n       George Santayana warned: ``Those who fail to remember the \n     past are condemned to repeat it.'' To avert a repeat of an \n     Athenian calamity, Americans' attitudes must change.\n       When the Kennedy Library conference asked what we must do \n     to strengthen citizenship and service for the future, the \n     attendees responded:\n       The present ``access for sale'' culture must be replaced \n     with comprehensive campaign finance reform that provides some \n     public financing and free TV time to candidates who agree to \n     reasonable spending limits. Only this can renew citizens' \n     trust that our votes matter and our voices will be heard \n     equally.\n       Civic literacy education must be ingrained from grade \n     school through college with extra-curricular citizenship \n     activities that include possible school credit for community \n     service.\n       An attitude of welcome inclusion and continuing citizenship \n     education must be available to all ``new'' Americans.\n       Each measure is critical, but who will assure their \n     adoption? John W. Gardner counseled that the ``plain truth is \n     that government (and other powerful institutions) will not \n     become worthy of trust until citizens take positive action to \n     hold them to account.'' You and I can ignore the alarm, thus \n     contributing to the calamity, or we can take positive action \n     to rescue our democracy.\n       Citizens must launch a campaign to renew our national \n     character and the spirit of citizenship and participation. \n     One by one, our individual response can inspire a collective \n     national chorus reminding others that our freedom and \n     democracy are directly dependent on our own patriotism, \n     active citizenship, unselfish service, respect for pluralism, \n     and intolerance of the present condition.\n       Mark my words. If you and I commit ``an untiring effort'' \n     to this national civic campaign, communities, organizations, \n     educators, religious and business leaders, the media and \n     opinion shapers, political candidates and parties, and, yes, \n     the President of the United States whom we elect one year \n     from now will follow.\n       Think about it. It's called ``consent of the governed.'' \n     It's our democracy, and it's a noble campaign you'll be proud \n     to win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14306-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.N. ARREARS PACKAGE\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to \ncall on Congress and the President to make sure the UN reform package \nis signed into law before we recess. As Chairman of the International \nOperations Subcommittee, I have worked hard to help forge a solid \nbipartisan United Nations reform package.\n  Our message in crafting this legislation is simple and \nstraightforward. The U.S. can help make the United Nations a more \neffective, more efficient and financially sounder organization, but \nonly if the U.N. and other member states, in return, are willing to \nfinally become accountable to the American taxpayers.\n  The reforms proposed by the United States are critical to ensure the \nUnited Nations is effective and relevant. Ambassador Holbrooke has been \npushing other member states to accept the reforms in this package in \nreturn for the payment of arrears. He has succeeded beyond all \nreasonable expectations, by gaining our seat back on the budget \noversight committee--the ACABQ. But he needs this bill signed into law \nin order to convince the UN that reform will bring certain rewards.\n  But passing this UN package is not just about a series of reforms for \nthe future. It impacts directly on the ability of the US mission to \nachieve our goals at the United Nations right now. The US does not owe \nmost of these arrears to the UN. It owes them to our allies, like \nBritain and France, for reimbursement for peacekeeping expenses. And \nour arrears are being used as a convenient excuse to dismiss US \nconcerns on matters of policy. Depriving the US government the ability \nto use these funds as leverage is irresponsible; after all, our \ndiplomats need ``carrots'' as well as reasonable ``sticks'' to achieve \nour foreign policy goals.\n  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration and my colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives are jeopardizing the payment of our arrears \nover a policy that I call ``Mexico City lite.'' While I support the \nproposal to prohibit US government grant recipients from lobbying \nforeign governments to change their abortion laws, I do not believe it \nshould be linked to the payment of our UN arrears. If these unrelated \nissues continue to be tied, then there is a good chance neither \nproposal will be enacted.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues in the House and the Administration \nwill see the wisdom of adopting measures that will enhance America's \nability to exert leadership in the international arena with the \nrevitalization of the UN. The State Department Authorization bill \nshould be allowed to pass or fail on its own merit--not on the merits \nof the Mexico City lite policy. This agreement is in America's best \ninterest, and the best interest of the entire international \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14306-3", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14306-S14307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAYOR JOE SERNA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a great American died this past \nweekend: Mayor Joe Serna Jr. of Sacramento, California. Mayor Serna was \nmuch beloved by his constituents, family, and friends. We will all miss \nhim terribly.\n  Joe Serna and I became friends while working closely together on gun \ncontrol, education, and other issues of mutual concern. He was a man of \ngreat vision, courage, energy, warmth, and humor.\n  He was also a living embodiment of the American Dream: a first-\ngeneration American who helped to reshape the capital of our Nation's \nlargest state.\n  Joe Serna Jr. was born in 1939, the son of Mexican immigrants. As the \noldest of four children, Joe grew up in a bunkhouse and worked with his \nfamily in the beet fields around Lodi.\n  Joe never forgot his roots. After attending Sacramento City College \nand graduating from California State University, Sacramento, he served \nin the\n\n[[Page S14307]]\n\nPeace Corps and went to work for the United Farm Workers, where Cesar \nChavez became his mentor and role model.\n  In 1969, Joe managed the successful campaign of Manuel Ferrales for \nthe Sacramento City Council. After serving on the city's redevelopment \nagency in the 1970s, Joe was elected to the Council himself in 1981. He \nwas elected mayor in 1992 and re-elected in 1996, winning both races by \nwide margins. Throughout his terms in office, he continued to work as a \nprofessor of government and ethnic studies at his alma mater, Cal State \nSacramento.\n  Mayor Serna virtually rebuilt the city of Sacramento.

Mr. President, I rise today before the Senate \nto praise one of the true heroes of the civil rights movement, Daisy \nBates. In her death yesterday at age 84, America has lost one of the \nmost courageous advocates for justice and equality between races.\n  Daisy Bates' life was one of conviction and resolve. Her character \nwas a model of grace and dignity.\n  Mrs. Bates was born in 1914, the small town of Huttig, Arkansas in \nthe southern part of the state. Her life was touched by the violence of \nracial hatred at a young age, when her mother was killed while \nresisting the advances of three white men. Her father left soon \nthereafter, and Daisy was raised by friends of her family.\n  Daisy moved to Little rock and married L.C. Bates, a former \nnewspaperman, in 1942. For eighteen years, the two published the \nArkansas State Press, the largest black newspaper in the state. The \nArkansas State Press was an influential voice in the state of Arkansas \nwhich played a key role in the civil rights movement. Daisy and L.C. \nused the State Press to focus attention on issues of inequity in the \ncriminal justice system, police brutality and segregation.\n  In 1952, Daisy was elected president of the state chapter of the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People. It was from \nthis position that she was thrust into the national spotlight, as a \nleader during the crisis of Central High School in 1957, when black \nstudents attempting to enter the school were blocked by rioters and the \nNational Guard.\n  Throughout the crisis, the Little Rock Nine would gather in her tiny \nhome before and after school to strategize about their survival. It was \nher home from which the Little Rock Nine were picked up from every \nmorning by federal troops to take them to Central High, to face the \nrioters and the hatred. It was her home that was attacked by the \nsegregationists.\n  Even after the Little Rock Nine finally received federal protection \nto attend Central High, Daisy Bates continued to face violence and \nharassment. Threats were made against her life. Bombs made of dynamite \nwere thrown at her house. KKK crosses were burned on her lawn. On two \nseparate occasions, her house was set on fire and all the glass in the \nfront of the house was broken out.\n  It's hard to imagine how difficult it must have been for Daisy Bates \nto continue pursuing her convictions under such circumstances, but her \nperseverance is true testament to the strength of her character. \nDespite the violence, harassment and intimidation, Daisy Bates would \nnot be deterred. She spent several more decades actively advancing the \ncause of civil rights, and helped the town of Mitchellville, Arkansas \nto elect its first black mayor and city council.\n  I am saddened that Mrs. Bates will not be on hand next week when the \nLittle Rock Nine is presented the Congressional Medal of Honor. That \nhonor is truly one that belongs to her, the woman who shepherded those \nbrave young men and women through those extremely difficult days forty \nyears ago. My prayers go out to the family and the many friends of \nDaisy Bates. I know that God is throwing open the gates of heaven today \nfor Daisy, a woman who helped so many others enter doors that were once \nbarred to them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14307-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14307-S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE DEPARTURE OF A.M. ROSENTHAL FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Please read these remarks! A.M. \nRosenthal has just this past Friday concluded fifty-five years as a \nreporter, editor, and columnist for The New York Times. There has been \nnone such ever. Nor like to be again. Save, of course, that this moment \nmarks a fresh start for the legendary, and although he would demur, \nbeloved Abe.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that A.M. Rosenthal's last \ncolumn and an editorial from Friday's Times be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Nov. 5, 1999]\n\n                               On My Mind\n\n                          (By A.M. Rosenthal)\n\n       On Jan. 6, 1987, when The New York Times printed my first \n     column, the headline I had written was: ``Please Read This \n     Column!'' It was not just one journalist's message of the \n     day, but every writer's prayer--come know me.\n       Sometimes I wanted to use it again. But I was smitten by \n     seizures of modesty and decided twice might be a bit showy. \n     Now I have the personal and journalistic excuse to set it \n     down one more time.\n       This is the last column I will write for The Times and my \n     last working day on the paper. I have no intention of \n     stopping writing, journalistically or otherwise. And I am \n     buoyed by the knowledge that I will be starting over.\n       Still, who could work his entire journalistic career--so \n     far--for one paper and not leave with sadnesses, particularly \n     when the paper is The Times? Our beloved, proud New York \n     Times--ours, not mine or theirs, or yours, but ours, created \n     by the talents and endeavor of its staff, the faithfulness of \n     the publishing family and, as much as anything else, by the \n     ethics and standards of its readers and their hunger for ever \n     more information, of a range without limit.\n       Arrive in a foreign capital for the first time, call a \n     government minister and give just your name. Ensues iciness. \n     But add ``of The New York Times,'' and you expect to be \n     invited right over and usually are; nice.\n       ``Our proud New York Times''--sounds arrogant and is a \n     little, why not? But the pride is individual as well as \n     institutional. For members of the staff, news and business, \n     the pride is in being important to the world's best paper--\n     you hear?--and being able to stretch its creative reach. And \n     there is pride knowing that even if we are not always honest \n     enough with ourselves to achieve fairness, that is what we \n     promise the readers, and the standard to which they must hold \n     us.\n       I used to tell new reporters: The Times is far more \n     flexible in writing styles than you might think, so don't \n     button up your vest and go all stiff on us. But when it comes \n     to the foundation--fairness--don't fool around with it, or we \n     will come down on you.\n       Journalists often have to hurt people, just by reporting \n     the facts. But they do not have to cause unnecessary cruelty, \n     to run their rings across anybody's face for the pleasure of \n     it--and that goes for critics, too.\n       When you finish a story, I would say, read it, substitute \n     your name for the subject's. If you say, well, it would make \n     me miserable, make my wife cry, but it has no innuendo, no \n     unattributed pejorative remarks, no slap in the face for joy \n     of slapping, it is news, not gutter gossip, and as a reporter \n     I know the writer was fair, then give it to the copy desk. If \n     not, try again--we don't want to be your cop.\n       Sometimes I have a nightmare that on a certain Wednesday--\n     why Wednesday I don't know--The Times disappeared forever. I \n     wake trembling; I know this paper could never be recreated. I \n     will never tremble for the loss of any publication that has \n     no enforced ethic of fairness.\n       Starting fresh--the idea frightened me. Then I realized I \n     was not going alone. I would take my brain and decades of \n     newspapering with me. And I understood many of us had done \n     that on the paper--moving from one career to another.\n       First I was a stringer from City College, my most important \n     career move. It got me inside a real paper and paid real \n     money. Twelve dollars a week, at a time when City's free \n     tuition was more than I could afford.\n       My second career was as a reporter in New York, with a \n     police press pass, which cops were forever telling me to \n     shove in my ear.\n\n[[Page S14308]]\n\n       I got a two-week assignment at the brand-new United \n     Nations, and stayed eight years, until I got what I lusted \n     for--a foreign post.\n       I served The Times in Communist Poland, for the first time \n     encountering the suffocating intellectual blanket that is \n     Communism's great weapon. In due time I was thrown out.\n       But mostly it was Asia. The four years in India excited me \n     then and forever. Rosenthal, King of the Khyber Pass!\n       After nine years as a foreign correspondent, somebody \n     decided I was too happy in Tokyo and nagged me into going \n     home to be an editor. At first I did not like it, but I came \n     to enjoy editing--once I became the top editor. Rosenthal, \n     King of the Hill!\n       When I stepped down from that job, I started all over again \n     as a times Op-Ed columnist, paid to express my own opinions. \n     If I had done that as a reporter or editor dealing with the \n     news, I would have broken readers' trust that the news would \n     be written and played straight.\n       Straight does not mean dull. It means straight. If you \n     don't know what that means, you don't belong on this paper. \n     Clear?\n       As a columnist, I discovered that there were passions in me \n     I had not been aware of, lying under the smatterings of \n     knowledge about everything that I had to collect as executive \n     editor--including hockey and debentures, for heaven's sake.\n       Mostly the passions had to do with human rights, violations \n     of--like African women having their genitals mutilated to \n     keep them virgin, and Chinese and Tibetan political prisoners \n     screaming their throats raw.\n       I wrote with anger at drug legitimizers and rationalizers, \n     helping make criminals and destroying young minds, all the \n     while with nauseating sanctimony.\n       As a correspondent, it was the Arab states, not Israel, \n     that I wanted to cover. But they did not welcome resident \n     Jewish correspondents. As a columnist, I felt fear for the \n     whittling away of Israeli strength by the Israelis, and still \n     do.\n       I wrote about the persecution of Christians in china. When \n     people, in astonishment, asked why, I replied, in \n     astonishment, because it is happening, because the world, \n     including American and European Christians and Jews, pays \n     almost no attention, and that plain disgusts me.\n       The lassitude about Chinese Communist brutalities is part \n     of the most nasty American reality of this past half-century. \n     Never before have the U.S. government, business and public \n     been willing, eager really, to praise and enrich tyranny, to \n     crawl before it, to endanger our martial technology--and all \n     for the hope (vain) of trade profit.\n       America is going through plump times. But economic strength \n     is making us weaker in head and soul. We accept back without \n     penalty a president who demeaned himself and us. We rain \n     money on a Politburo that must rule by terror lest it lose \n     its collective head.\n       I cannot promise to change all that. But I can say that I \n     will keep trying and that I thank God for (a) making me an \n     American citizen, (b) giving me that college-boy job on The \n     Times, and (c) handing me the opportunity to make other \n     columnists kick themselves when they see what I am writing, \n     in this fresh start of my life.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From The New York Times, Nov. 5, 1999]\n\n\n                  a.m. rosenthal of the new york times\n\n       The departure of a valued colleague from The New York Times \n     is not, as a rule, occasion for editorial comment. But the \n     appearance today of A. M. Rosenthal's last column on the Op-\n     Ed page requires an exception. Mr. Rosenthal's life and that \n     of this newspaper have been braided together over a \n     remarkable span--from World War II to the turning of the \n     millennium. His talent and passionate ambition carried him on \n     a personal journey from City College correspondent to \n     executive editor, and his equally passionate devotion to \n     quality journalism made him one of the principal architects \n     of the modern New York Times.\n       Abe Rosenthal began his career at The Times as a 21-year-\n     old cub reporter scratching for space in the metropolitan \n     report, and he ended it as an Op-Ed page columnist noted for \n     his commitment to political and religious freedom. In between \n     he served as a correspondent at the United Nations and was \n     based in three foreign countries, winning a Pulitzer Prize in \n     1960 for his reporting from Poland. He came home in 1963 to \n     be metropolitan editor. In that role and in higher positions, \n     he became a tireless advocate of opening the paper to the \n     kind of vigorous writing and deep reporting that \n     characterized his work. As managing editor and executive \n     editor, Abe Rosenthal was in charge of The Times's news \n     operations for a total of 17 years.\n       Of his many contributions as an editor, two immediately \n     come to mind. One was his role in the publication of the \n     Pentagon Papers, the official documents tracing a quarter-\n     century of missteps that entangled America in the Vietnam \n     War. Though hardly alone among Times editors, Mr. Rosenthal \n     was instrumental in mustering the arguments that led to the \n     decision by our then publisher, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, to \n     publish the archive. That fateful decision helped illustrate \n     the futile duplicity of American policy in Vietnam, \n     strengthened the press's First Amendment guarantees and \n     reinforced The Times's reputation as a guardian of the public \n     interest.\n       The second achievement, more institutional in nature, was \n     Mr. Rosenthal's central role in transforming The Times from a \n     two-section to a four-section newspaper with the introduction \n     of a separate business section and new themed sections like \n     SportsMonday, Weekend and Science Times. Though a journalist \n     of the old school, Abe Rosenthal grasped that such features \n     were necessary to broaden the paper's universe of readers. He \n     insisted only that the writing, editing and article selection \n     measure up to The Times's traditional standards.\n       By his own admission, Abe Rosenthal could be ferocious in \n     his pursuit and enforcement of those standards. Sometimes, \n     indeed, debate about his management style competed for \n     attention with his journalistic achievements. But the scale \n     of this man's editorial accomplishments has come more fully \n     into focus since he left the newsroom in 1986. It is now \n     clear that he seeded the place with talent and helped ensure \n     that future generations of Times writers and editors would \n     hew to the principles of quality journalism\n       Born in Canada, Mr. Rosenthal developed a deep love for New \n     York City and a fierce affection for the democratic values \n     and civil liberties of his adopted country. For the last 13 \n     years, his lifelong interest in foreign affairs and his \n     compassion for victims of political, ethnic or religious \n     oppression in Tibet, China, Iran, Africa and Eastern Europe \n     formed the spine of his Op-Ed columns. His strong, \n     individualistic views and his bedrock journalistic \n     convictions have informed his work as reporter, editor and \n     columnist. His voice will continue to be a force on the \n     issues that engage him. And his commitment to journalism as \n     an essential element in a democratic society will abide as \n     part of the living heritage of the newspaper he loved and \n     served for more than 55 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14308-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE MARTEL FAMILY\n\n Mr. BURNS.

In 1960, Emil and his son, Bill, formed \nMartel Construction and constituted its entire workforce. In the past \nforty years, however, Martel Construction has grown to employ 200 \npeople and now contracts in six states. Today, Martel Construction \nmaintains its familiar character and is still run as a family business. \nMartel Construction was recently awarded the United States Small \nBusiness Administration's 1999 Entrepreneurial Success Award as well as \nthe 1999 Montana Family Business of the Year award by the College of \nBusiness at Montana State University-Bozeman.\n  Martel Construction and the Martel family represent a modern American \nsuccess story. I applaud them not only for what they have accomplished \nfor themselves but also for what they have given back to their \ncommunity. Their hard work serves as inspiration for other small \nbusinesses in my state of Montana; their success is proof that the \nAmerican Dream lives on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14308-2", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3196\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Res. 68\n\n       Whereas on September 3, 1918, the United States Government \n     recognized the Czecho-Slovak National Council as the official \n     Government of Czechoslovakia;\n       Whereas on October 28, 1918, the peoples of Bohemia, \n     Moravia, and part of Silesia, comprising the present Czech \n     Republic, and peoples of Slovakia, comprising the present \n     Slovak Republic, proclaimed their independence in a common \n     state of the Czechoslovak Republic;\n       Whereas on November 17, 1939, the Czech institutions of \n     higher learning were closed by the Nazis, many students were \n     taken to concentration camps, and nine representatives of the \n     student movement were executed;\n       Whereas between 1938 and 1945, the Nazis annexed part of \n     Bohemia, set up a fascist ``protectorate'' in the rest of \n     Bohemia and in Moravia, and installed a puppet fascist \n     government in Slovakia;\n       Whereas the Communists seized power from the democratically \n     elected government of Czechoslovakia in March 1948;\n       Whereas troops from Warsaw Pact countries invaded \n     Czechoslovakia in August 1968, ousted the reformist \n     government of Alexander Dubcek, and restored a hard-line \n     communist regime;\n       Whereas on November 17, 1989, the brutal break up of a \n     student demonstration commemorating the 50th anniversary of \n     the execution of Czech student leaders and the closure of \n     universities by the Nazis triggered the explosion of mass \n     discontent that launched the Velvet Revolution, which was \n     characterized by reliance on nonviolence and open public \n     discourse;\n       Whereas the peoples of Czechoslovakia overthrew 40-years of \n     totalitarian communist rule in order to rebuild a democratic \n     society;\n       Whereas since November 17, 1989, the people of the Czech \n     and Slovak Republics have established a vibrant, pluralistic, \n     democratic political system based upon freedom of speech, a \n     free press, free and fair open elections, the rule of law, \n     and other democratic principles and practices as they were \n     recognized by President Wilson and President Thomas G. \n     Masaryk;\n       Whereas the Czech Republic joined the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization on March 12, 1999, the admission of which was \n     approved by the Senate of the United States on April 30, \n     1998;\n       Whereas the Czech and Slovak Republics are in the process \n     of preparing for admission to the European Union;\n       Whereas the people of the United States and the Czech and \n     Slovak Republics have maintained a special relationship based \n     on shared democratic values, common interests, and bonds of \n     friendship and mutual respect; and\n       Whereas the American people have an affinity with the \n     peoples of the Czech and Slovak Republics and regard the \n     Czech and Slovak Republics as trusted and important partners: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the Congress--\n       (1) recognizes the 10th anniversary of the historic events \n     in Central and Eastern Europe that brought about the collapse \n     of the communist regimes and the fall of the Iron Curtain, \n     and commemorates with the Czech and Slovak Republics the 10th \n     anniversary of the Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia, which \n     underscores the significance and value of reclaimed freedom \n     and the dignity of individual citizens;\n       (2) commends the peoples of the present Czech and Slovak \n     Republics for their achievements in building new states and \n     pluralistic democratic societies nearly 60 years of \n     totalitarian fascist and communist rule;\n       (3) supports the peoples of the Czech and Slovak Republics \n     in their determination to join trans-Atlantic institutions \n     through memberships in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     (NATO) and the European Union;\n       (4) reaffirms the bonds of friendship and close cooperation \n     that have existed between the United States and the Czech and \n     Slovak Republics; and\n       (5) extends the warmest congratulations and best wishes to \n     the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic and their people for a \n     peaceful, prosperous, and successful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14309-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IMMIGRATION AND NATIONALITY ACT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, today the Senate is considering \nlegislation reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nto make technical corrections to the Water Resources Development Act of \n1999.\n  In July, 1999, the conference report on the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act was enacted. The press of the conference business to \nreach final agreement prior to the August recess led to inaccurate cite \nreferences and omissions that need to be corrected.\n  This legislation and the accompanying amendment simply address \ntechnical modifications that have been brought to our attention by the \nCorps of Engineers. There are no new project authorizations, policy \nchanges, or funding issues contained in this legislation.\n  As the Committee, by practice, has reauthorized the civil works \nmission of the Corps of Engineers every two years, the 1999 \nauthorization bill is a produce initiated by the Committee in 1998. it \nis expected that, again next year, the Committee will examine the civil \nworks mission of the Corps with all of the associated policy issues.\n  I respectfully request that my colleagues support this legislation \nand the\n\n[[Page S14311]]\n\namendment so that WRDA 1999 can be fully implemented.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto.\n  The amendment (No. 2773) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute, as amended, \nwas agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2724), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14311-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14311-S14313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            ARCTIC TUNDRA HABITAT EMERGENCY CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The winter index population of mid-continent light \n     geese was 800,000 birds in 1969, while the total population \n     of such geese is more than 5,200,000 birds today.\n       (2) The population of mid-continent light geese is \n     expanding by over 5 percent each year, and in the absence of \n     new wildlife management actions it could grow to more than \n     6,800,000 breeding light geese in 3 years.\n       (3) The primary reasons for this unprecedented population \n     growth are--\n       (A) the expansion of agricultural areas and the resulting \n     abundance of cereal grain crops in the United States;\n       (B) the establishment of sanctuaries along the United \n     States flyways of migrating light geese; and\n       (C) a decline in light geese harvest rates.\n       (4) As a direct result of this population explosion, the \n     Hudson Bay Lowlands Salt-Marsh ecosystem in Canada is being \n     systematically destroyed. This ecosystem contains \n     approximately 135,000 acres of essential habitat for \n     migrating light geese and many other avian species. \n     Biologists have testified that one-third of this habitat has \n     been destroyed, one-third is on the brink of devastation, and \n     the remaining one-third is overgrazed.\n       (5) The destruction of the Arctic tundra is having a severe \n     negative impact on many avian species that breed or migrate \n     through this habitat, including the following:\n       (A) Canada Goose.\n       (B) American Wigeon.\n       (C) Dowitcher.\n       (D) Hudsonian Godwit.\n       (E) Stilt Sandpiper.\n       (F) Northern Shoveler.\n       (G) Red-Breasted Merganser.\n       (H) Oldsquaw.\n       (I) Parasitic Jaeger.\n       (J) Whimbrel.\n       (K) Yellow Rail.\n       (6) It is essential that the current population of mid-\n     continent light geese be reduced by 50 percent by the year \n     2005 to ensure that the fragile Arctic tundra is not \n     irreversibly damaged.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this [Act] title are the \n     following:\n       (1) To reduce the population of mid-continent light geese.\n       (2) To assure the long-term conservation of mid-continent \n     light geese and the biological diversity of the ecosystem \n     upon which many North American migratory birds depend.\n\n     [SEC. 3.] SEC. 103. FORCE AND EFFECT OF RULES TO CONTROL \n                   OVERABUNDANT MID-CONTINENT LIGHT GEESE \n                   POPULATIONS.\n\n       (a) Force and Effect.--\n       (1) In general.--The rules published by the Service on \n     February 16, 1999, relating to use of additional hunting \n     methods to increase the harvest of mid-continent light geese \n     (64 Fed. Reg. 7507-7517) and the establishment of a \n     conservation order for the reduction of mid-continent light \n     goose populations (64 Fed. Reg. 7517-7528), shall have the \n     force and effect of law.\n       (2) Public notice.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Director of the Service, shall take such action as is \n     necessary to appropriately notify the public of the force and \n     effect of the rules referred to in paragraph (1).\n       (b) Application.--Subsection (a) shall apply only during \n     the period that--\n       (1) begins on the date of the enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) ends on the latest of--\n       (A) the effective date of rules issued by the Service after \n     such date of enactment to control overabundant mid-continent \n     light geese populations;\n       (B) the date of the publication of a final environmental \n     impact statement for such rules under section 102(2)(C) of \n     the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. \n     4332(2)(C)); and\n       (C) May 15, 2001.\n       (c) Rule of Construction.--This section shall not be \n     construed to limit the authority of the Secretary or the \n     Service to issue rules, under another law, to regulate the \n     taking of mid-continent light geese.\n\n     [SEC. 4.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this [Act] title:\n       (1) Mid-continent light geese.--The term ``mid-continent \n     light geese'' means Lesser snow geese (Anser caerulescens \n     caerulescens) and Ross' geese (Anser rossii) that primarily \n     migrate between Canada and the States of Alabama, Arkansas, \n     Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, \n     Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, \n     Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, \n     South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (3) Service.--The term ``Service'' means the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\n           TITLE II--NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION\n\n     SEC. 201. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n     the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n       (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n     environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n     to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n     considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n     the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n     jeopardy; and\n       (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n     of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n     pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n       (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n     numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n     requires the commitment and effort of all countries along \n     their migration routes; and\n       (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n     migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n     significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n     coordination.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee amendments be agreed to.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2774\n\n (Purpose: To assure the long-term conservation of mid-continent light \n                                 geese)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Abraham has an amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Abraham, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2774.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike Title II.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on two pieces of \nlegislation designed to protect the habitat of this continent's \nmigratory birds. Both H.R. 2454, known as the ``Snow Goose'' bill, and \nS. 148, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act are intended to \nprotect bird habitat, and by extension, the species which frequent \nthese lands.\n  At the Senate markup last month, Senator Chafee combined these two \nbills in the hopes of passing them as a complete package this year. \nUnfortunately, it has become obvious that this strategy will not work \nbecause some Members of the House, lacking a better vehicle, intend to \nuse the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act as a tool for \ndebating the merits of property rights legislation. Apparently, they do \nnot care that in doing so they jeopardize the passage of both bills.\n  I want very much for the Congress to pass the Neotropical Migratory \nBird Conservation Act and am disappointed that the House has failed to \neven bring this issue to the floor. It is an important bill that will \nhelp ensure that the migratory species which Americans enjoy will \nreceive additional protection in their winter habitats.\n\n[[Page S14313]]\n\n  But the Snow Goose is equally important and it is imperative that the \nCongress Act on this legislation as soon as possible. I fear the \nrefusal of the House to act on S. 148 jeopardizes the chances of the \nSnow Goose legislation this year. For that reason, I have offered an \namendment to H.R. 2454 to strip the language pertaining to the \nneotropicals from the text of the Snow Goose bill.\n  As part of my agreeing to do this, I have been assured by both the \nChairman of the House Resources Committee and the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Fisheries Conservation, Wildlife and Oceans that they \nwill do everything they can to assure that the Neotropical Migratory \nBird Conservation Act is considered by the full House early next year. \nI am encouraged by their support and wish to thank them for their \nwillingness to try to move this legislation.\n  Therefore, I believe that removing the text of the Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act is only a short-term setback. I am \nconfident that once the full House has the opportunity to consider this \nlegislation that a good bill will emerge from that respected body. I \nurge my colleagues to pass H.R. 2454, as amended.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2774) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2454), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14313-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n BOUNDARY CLARIFICATION ON MAPS RELATING TO COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES \n                                 SYSTEM\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) disability is a natural part of the human experience \n     that does not diminish the right of individuals with \n     developmental disabilities to live independently, to exert \n     control and choice over their own lives, and to fully \n     participate in and contribute to their communities through \n     full integration and inclusion in the economic, political, \n     social, cultural, and educational mainstream of United States \n     society;\n       (2) in 1999, there are between 3,200,000 and 4,500,000 \n     individuals with developmental disabilities in the United \n     States, and recent studies indicate that individuals with \n     developmental disabilities comprise between 1.2 and 1.65 \n     percent of the United States population;\n       (3) individuals whose disabilities occur during their \n     developmental period frequently have severe disabilities that \n     are likely to continue indefinitely;\n       (4) individuals with developmental disabilities often \n     encounter discrimination in the provision of critical \n     services, such as services in the areas of emphasis (as \n     defined in section 102);\n       (5) individuals with developmental disabilities are at \n     greater risk than the general population of abuse, neglect, \n     financial and sexual exploitation, and the violation of their \n     legal and human rights;\n       (6) a substantial portion of individuals with developmental \n     disabilities and their families do not have access to \n     appropriate support and services, including access to \n     assistive technology, from generic and specialized service \n     systems, and remain unserved or underserved;\n       (7) individuals with developmental disabilities often \n     require lifelong community services, individualized supports, \n     and other forms of assistance, that are most effective when \n     provided in a coordinated manner;\n       (8) there is a need to ensure that services, supports, and \n     other assistance are provided in a culturally competent \n     manner, that ensures that individuals from racial and ethnic \n     minority backgrounds are fully included in all activities \n     provided under this title;\n       (9) family members, friends, and members of the community \n     can play an important role in enhancing the lives of \n     individuals with developmental disabilities, especially when \n     the family members, friends, and community members are \n     provided with the necessary community services, \n     individualized supports, and other forms of assistance;\n       (10) current research indicates that 88 percent of \n     individuals with developmental disabilities live with their \n     families or in their own households;\n       (11) many service delivery systems and communities are not \n     prepared to meet the impending needs of the 479,862 adults \n     with developmental disabilities who are living at home with \n     parents who are 60 years old or older and who serve as the \n     primary caregivers of the adults;\n       (12) in almost every State, individuals with developmental \n     disabilities are waiting for appropriate services in their \n     communities, in the areas of emphasis;\n       (13) the public needs to be made more aware of the \n     capabilities and competencies of individuals with \n     developmental disabilities, particularly in cases in which \n     the individuals are provided with necessary services, \n     supports, and other assistance;\n       (14) as increasing numbers of individuals with \n     developmental disabilities are living, learning, working, and \n     participating in all aspects of community life, there is an \n     increasing need for a well trained workforce that is able to \n     provide the services, supports, and other forms of direct \n     assistance required to enable the individuals to carry out \n     those activities;\n       (15) there needs to be greater effort to recruit \n     individuals from minority backgrounds into professions \n     serving individuals with developmental disabilities and their \n     families;\n       (16) the goals of the Nation properly include a goal of \n     providing individuals with developmental disabilities with \n     the information, skills, opportunities, and support to--\n       (A) make informed choices and decisions about their lives;\n       (B) live in homes and communities in which such individuals \n     can exercise their full rights and responsibilities as \n     citizens;\n       (C) pursue meaningful and productive lives;\n       (D) contribute to their families, communities, and States, \n     and the Nation;\n       (E) have interdependent friendships and relationships with \n     other persons;\n       (F) live free of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual \n     exploitation, and violations of their legal and human rights; \n     and\n       (G) achieve full integration and inclusion in society, in \n     an individualized manner, consistent with the unique \n     strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and \n     capabilities of each individual; and\n       (17) as the Nation, States, and communities maintain and \n     expand community living options for individuals with \n     developmental disabilities, there is a need to evaluate the \n     access to those options by individuals with developmental \n     disabilities and the effects of those options on individuals \n     with developmental disabilities.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to assure that \n     individuals with developmental disabilities and their \n     families participate in the design of and have access to \n     needed community services, individualized supports, and other \n     forms of assistance that promote self-determination, \n     independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in \n     all facets of community life, through culturally competent \n     programs authorized under this title, including \n     specifically--\n       (1) State Councils on Developmental Disabilities in each \n     State to engage in advocacy, capacity building, and systemic \n     change activities that--\n       (A) are consistent with the purpose described in this \n     subsection and the policy described in subsection (c); and\n       (B) contribute to a coordinated, consumer- and family-\n     centered, consumer- and family-directed, comprehensive system \n     that includes needed community services, individualized \n     supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-\n     determination for individuals with developmental disabilities \n     and their families;\n       (2) protection and advocacy systems in each State to \n     protect the legal and human rights of individuals with \n     developmental disabilities;\n       (3) University Centers for Excellence in Developmental \n     Disabilities Education, Research, and Service--\n       (A) to provide interdisciplinary pre-service preparation \n     and continuing education of students and fellows, which may \n     include the preparation and continuing education of \n     leadership, direct service, clinical, or other personnel to \n     strengthen and increase the capacity of States and \n     communities to achieve the purpose of this title;\n       (B) to provide community services--\n       (i) that provide training and technical assistance for \n     individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, \n     professionals, paraprofessionals, policymakers, students, and \n     other members of the community; and\n       (ii) that may provide services, supports, and assistance \n     for the persons described in clause (i) through demonstration \n     and model activities;\n       (C) to conduct research, which may include basic or applied \n     research, evaluation, and the analysis of public policy in \n     areas that affect or could affect, either positively or \n     negatively, individuals with developmental disabilities and \n     their families; and\n       (D) to disseminate information related to activities \n     undertaken to address the purpose of\n\n[[Page S14315]]\n\n     this title, especially dissemination of information that \n     demonstrates that the network authorized under this subtitle \n     is a national and international resource that includes \n     specific substantive areas of expertise that may be accessed \n     and applied in diverse settings and circumstances; and\n       (4) funding for--\n       (A) national initiatives to collect necessary data on \n     issues that are directly or indirectly relevant to the lives \n     of individuals with developmental disabilities;\n       (B) technical assistance to entities who engage in or \n     intend to engage in activities consistent with the purpose \n     described in this subsection or the policy described in \n     subsection (c); and\n       (C) other nationally significant activities.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that all \n     programs, projects, and activities receiving assistance under \n     this title shall be carried out in a manner consistent with \n     the principles that--\n       (1) individuals with developmental disabilities, including \n     those with the most severe developmental disabilities, are \n     capable of self-determination, independence, productivity, \n     and integration and inclusion in all facets of community \n     life, but often require the provision of community services, \n     individualized supports, and other forms of assistance;\n       (2) individuals with developmental disabilities and their \n     families have competencies, capabilities, and personal goals \n     that should be recognized, supported, and encouraged, and any \n     assistance to such individuals should be provided in an \n     individualized manner, consistent with the unique strengths, \n     resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities \n     of such individuals;\n       (3) individuals with developmental disabilities and their \n     families are the primary decisionmakers regarding the \n     services and supports such individuals and their families \n     receive, including regarding choosing where the individuals \n     live from available options, and play decisionmaking roles in \n     policies and programs that affect the lives of such \n     individuals and their families;\n       (4) services, supports, and other assistance should be \n     provided in a manner that demonstrates respect for individual \n     dignity, personal preferences, and cultural differences;\n       (5) specific efforts must be made to ensure that \n     individuals with developmental disabilities from racial and \n     ethnic minority backgrounds and their families enjoy \n     increased and meaningful opportunities to access and use \n     community services, individualized supports, and other forms \n     of assistance available to other individuals with \n     developmental disabilities and their families;\n       (6) recruitment efforts in disciplines related to \n     developmental disabilities relating to pre-service training, \n     community training, practice, administration, and \n     policymaking must focus on bringing larger numbers of racial \n     and ethnic minorities into the disciplines in order to \n     provide appropriate skills, knowledge, role models, and \n     sufficient personnel to address the growing needs of an \n     increasingly diverse population;\n       (7) with education and support, communities can be \n     accessible to and responsive to the needs of individuals with \n     developmental disabilities and their families and are \n     enriched by full and active participation in community \n     activities, and contributions, by individuals with \n     developmental disabilities and their families;\n       (8) individuals with developmental disabilities have access \n     to opportunities and the necessary support to be included in \n     community life, have interdependent relationships, live in \n     homes and communities, and make contributions to their \n     families, communities, and States, and the Nation;\n       (9) efforts undertaken to maintain or expand community-\n     based living options for individuals with disabilities should \n     be monitored in order to determine and report to appropriate \n     individuals and entities the extent of access by individuals \n     with developmental disabilities to those options and the \n     extent of compliance by entities providing those options with \n     quality assurance standards;\n       (10) families of children with developmental disabilities \n     need to have access to and use of safe and appropriate child \n     care and before-school and after-school programs, in the most \n     integrated settings, in order to enrich the participation of \n     the children in community life;\n       (11) individuals with developmental disabilities need to \n     have access to and use of public transportation, in order to \n     be independent and directly contribute to and participate in \n     all facets of community life; and\n       (12) individuals with developmental disabilities need to \n     have access to and use of recreational, leisure, and social \n     opportunities in the most integrated settings, in order to \n     enrich their participation in community life.\n\n

The Secretary shall reallot the amount in \n     proportion to the original allotments of the other States for \n     such fiscal year, but shall reduce such proportionate amount \n     for any of the other States to the extent the proportionate \n     amount exceeds the sum that the Secretary estimates the State \n     needs and will be able to use during such period.\n       (4) Reallotment of reductions.--The Secretary shall \n     similarly reallot the total of the reductions among the \n     States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.\n       (5) Treatment.--Any amount reallotted to a State under this \n     subsection for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of \n     the allotment of the State under subsection (a) for such \n     fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 123.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Families of Children With \n     Disabilities Support Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS, PURPOSES, AND POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) It is in the best interest of our Nation to preserve, \n     strengthen, and maintain the family.\n       (2) Families of children with disabilities provide support, \n     care, and training to their children that can save States \n     millions of dollars. Without the efforts of family \n     caregivers, many persons with disabilities would receive care \n     through State-supported out-of-home placements.\n       (3) Most families of children with disabilities, especially \n     families in unserved and underserved populations, do not have \n     access to family-centered and family-directed services to \n     support such families in their efforts to care for such \n     children at home.\n       (4) Medical advances and improved health care have \n     increased the life span of many people with disabilities, and \n     the combination of the longer life spans and the aging of \n     family caregivers places a continually increasing demand on \n     the finite service delivery systems of the States.\n       (5) In 1996, 49 States provided family support initiatives \n     in response to the needs of families of children with \n     disabilities. Such initiatives included the provision of cash \n     subsidies, respite care, and other forms of support. There is \n     a need in each State, however, to strengthen, expand, and \n     coordinate the activities of a system of family support \n     services for families of children with disabilities that is \n     easily accessible, avoids duplication, uses resources \n     efficiently, and prevents gaps in services to families in all \n     areas of the State.\n       (6) The goals of the Nation properly include the goal of \n     providing to families of children with disabilities the \n     family support services necessary--\n       (A) to support the family;\n       (B) to enable families of children with disabilities to \n     nurture and enjoy their children at home;\n       (C) to enable families of children with disabilities to \n     make informed choices and decisions regarding the nature of \n     supports, resources, services, and other assistance made \n     available to such families; and\n       (D) to support family caregivers of adults with \n     disabilities.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to promote and strengthen the implementation of \n     comprehensive State systems of family support services, for \n     families with children with disabilities, that are family-\n     centered and family-directed, and that provide families with \n     the greatest possible decisionmaking authority and control \n     regarding the nature and use of services and support;\n       (2) to promote leadership by families in planning, policy \n     development, implementation, and evaluation of family support \n     services for families of children with disabilities;\n       (3) to promote and develop interagency coordination and \n     collaboration between agencies responsible for providing the \n     services; and\n       (4) to increase the availability of, funding for, access \n     to, and provision of family support services for families of \n     children with disabilities.\n       (c) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States that all \n     programs, projects, and activities funded under this title \n     shall be family-centered and family-directed, and shall be \n     provided in a manner consistent with the goal of providing \n     families of children with disabilities with the support the \n     families need to raise their children at home.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself, and my colleagues \nSenators Kennedy, Harkin, Frist, Collins, Wellstone, Reed, Dodd, \nMurray, and Enzi, I am pleased that we are considering S. 1809, the \nDevelopmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999. \nThis legislation, commonly referred to as the DD Act, represents the \nreauthorization of a piece of legislation with a rich legacy, and a \nlong history of bipartisan Congressional support. It was initially \nenacted as Title I of the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community \nMental Health Centers Construction Act of 1963 as part of the legacy of \nPresident Kennedy, and was last reauthorized in 1996 under the \nsponsorship of Senator Frist. It has always focused on the needs of our \nmost vulnerable citizens, currently an estimated four million Americans \nwith developmental disabilities, including individuals with mental \nretardation and other lifelong, severe disabilities. I am pleased to \nsay that S. 1809 was reported out, unanimously, by the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions on November 3, 1999.\n  I would like to take a moment to review the history of this \nlegislation, and the programs in each State that it authorizes. The \nearliest version of this legislation focused on the interdisciplinary \ntraining of professionals to work with individuals with developmental \ndisabilities by authorizing funding for University Affiliated \nFacilities charged with expanding the carde of professionals able to \naddress the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities. \nLater, the name of the programs was changed to University Affiliated \nPrograms (UAPs), and their mission was expanded to include community \nservices and information dissemination pertaining to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities. In 1996, after 33 years of planned \nexpansion by Congress, the DD Act provided funding for at least one UAP \nin each State. The present reauthorization recognizes the development \nof these programs, adds research as a core function, and renames UAPs \nas Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, \nResearch, and Service.\n  In the 1970 reauthorization of the DD Act, Congress recognized the \nneed for and value of strengthening State efforts to coordinate and \nintegrate services for individuals with developmental disabilities. As \na result, Congress established and authorized funding for State \nDevelopmental Disabilities Councils (DD Councils) in each State. The \npurpose of the Councils was, and continues to be, to advise governors \nand State agencies regarding the use of available and potential \nresources to meet the needs of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. Every State has a DD Council. The Councils undertake \nadvocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities directed at \nimproving access to and quality of community services, supports, and \nother forms of assistance for individuals with disabilities and their \nfamilies.\n  In 1975, Congress created and authorized funding for Protection and \nAdvocacy Systems (P & As) in each State to ensure the safety and well \nbeing of individuals with developmental disabilities. The mission of \nthese systems has evolved over the years, initially addressing the \nprotection of individuals with developmental disabilities who lived in \ninstitutions, to the present responsibilities related to the protection \nof individuals with developmental disabilities from abuse, neglect, and \nexploitation, and from the violation of their legal and human rights, \nboth in institutions and other community settings.\n  The 1975 reauthorization of the DD Act also established funding for \nProjects of National Significance. Through this new authority Congress \nauthorizes funding for initiatives to address areas of national \nimportance. Over the years, projects related to individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their treatment in the criminal justice \nsystem, their experiences with home ownership, in employment, their use \nof assistive technology, and their involvement in self-advocacy have \nbeen supported through Projects of National Significance.\n  The legislation before us today, S. 1809, the Developmental \nDisabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 1999 builds on the \npast successes of these programs. Additionally, this bill reflects \ntoday's changing society and seeks to provide a foundation for the \nservices and supports that individuals with developmental disabilities, \ntheir families, and communities need as we enter the next century. Let \nme take a moment to highlight the major provisions of this legislation.\n  S. 1809 continues a tradition of support for DD programs in each \nState including DD Councils, Protection and Advocacy Systems, and \nUniversity Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities \nEducation, Research, and Service. The purpose of the DD programs in \neach State is to engage in advocacy, capacity building, and systemic \nchange activities related to improving the quality of life for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and their families. This \nlegislation seeks to ensure that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities are able to fully participate in and contribute to their \ncommunities through fall integration and inclusion in the economic, \npolitical, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of our Nation. \nIt also assists DD Act programs to improve the range and quality of \nsupports and services for individuals with developmental disabilities \nand their families regardless of where they choose to live.\n  This legislation recognizes that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities often have multiple, evolving, life long needs that \nrequire services and supports from agencies and organizations that \noffer specialized and generic forms of assistance in their communities. \nThe nature of the needs of these individuals and the capacity of States \nand communities to respond to them have changed. In the past 5 years, \nnew strategies for reaching, engaging, and assisting individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities have gained visibility and credibility. \nThese state of the art strategies are reinforced by and reflected in \nthis bill.\n  This bill also recognizes that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities often are at greater risk of abuse, neglect, financial and \nsexual exploitation, and the violation of their legal and human rights, \nthan the general population. Based upon this recognition, the bill \nsupports the extra effort and attention needed, in both individual and \nsystemic situations, to ensure that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities are at no greater risk of harm than others in the general \npopulation.\n\n[[Page S14331]]\n\n  In the past, the Councils, P Systems, and Centers have been \nauthorized to provide advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change \nactivities to make access to and navigation through various service \nsystems easier for individuals with developmental disabilities. Over \ntime there has been pressure for these three programs to provide \nassistance beyond the limit of their resources and beyond their \nauthorized missions. The bill clearly and concisely specifies the roles \nand responsibilities of Councils, P Systems, and Centers so that \nthere is a common understanding of what the programs are intended to \ncontribute toward a State's efforts to respond to the needs of \nindividuals with developmental disabilities and their families.\n  S. 1809 gives States' Councils, P Systems, and Centers increased \nflexibility. Each program in a State, working with stakeholders, is to \ndevelop goals for how to assure that individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families participate in the design of and have \naccess to needed community services, individualized supports, and other \nforms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, \nproductivity, integration, and inclusion in all facets of community \nlife. Goals may be set in any of the following areas of emphasis: \nquality assurance, education and early intervention, child care, \nhealth, employment, housing, transportation, recreation, or other \ncommunity services.\n  Consistent with Congressional emphasis on strengthening \naccountability for all Federal programs, this legislation requires each \nprogram to determine, before undertaking a goal, how that goal will be \nmeasured. The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS) is to develop indicators of progress to evaluate how the three \nprograms in each State have engaged in activities to promote and \nachieve the purposes of the Act. In particular, the Secretary is to \nmonitor how the three programs funded in each State coordinate their \nefforts, and how that coordination affects the quality of supports and \nservices for individuals with developmental disabilities and their \nfamilies in that State. In doing so Congress recognizes that the \nprograms funded under the DD Act do not have day to day responsibility \nfor the outcomes of the programs directly serving people with \ndevelopmental disabilities in their States. Therefore, Congressional \nintent is that the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human \nServices develop measures regarding the quality of program activities \nfunded under Title I of this bill, to provide accountability in the \nareas of advocacy, capacity building, and systems changes as they \nrelate to the areas of emphasis defined in Section 102(2), and that \nthese measures are consistent with the purposes and policies \narticulated in Section 101.\n  In recent years, a clearer picture has emerged of what individuals \nwith developmental disabilities are able to accomplish, with the \nappropriate support, when they have access to the same choices and \nopportunities available to others. There has been increasing \nrecognition of and support for self-advocacy organizations established \nby and for individuals with developmental disabilities, particularly \nindividuals with cognitive disabilities. This bill reflects and \npromotes such efforts by authorizing DD Councils to support the \nestablishment and strengthening of at least one statewide self-advocacy \norganization for individuals with developmental disabilities in each \nState. It also authorizes national technical assistance for self \nadvocacy organizations.\n  In addition to S. 1809 renaming the University Affiliated Programs as \nUniversity Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities \nEducation, Research, and Service, this legislation expands Centers' \nresponsibilities to include the conduct of research, authorizes \nNational Training Initiatives on Critical and Emerging Needs, and links \nthe Centers to create a National Network. In doing so Congress \nrecognizes that Centers have a long history of providing state of the \nart community education and training in a variety of areas related to \nimproving the capacity of communities to meet the needs of individuals \nwith developmental disabilities and their families. It is the intention \nof Congress that Centers will continue to provide this training. It is \nalso Congress' intention to recognize and utilize the capacity of all \nCenters to meet critical and emerging training needs in accordance with \nSections 152(c) and 153(b). It also anticipates that Congress will \nauthorize Centers to meet other emerging and critical training and \nresearch needs related to individuals with developmental disabilities \nthrough other legislation.\n  By administering the three programs specifically authorized under the \nDD Act and by funding Projects of National Significance to accomplish \nsimilar or complementary efforts, the Administration on Developmental \nDisabilities (ADD) in HHS plays a critical role in supporting and \nfostering new ways to assist individuals with developmental \ndisabilities and their families, and in promoting system integration to \nexpand and improve community services for individuals with \ndisabilities. The bill provides ADD with the ability to foster similar \nefforts across the Executive Branch. It authorizes ADD to pursue and \njoin with other Executive Branch entities in activities that will \nimprove choices, opportunities, and services for individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and to fully utilize the potential of the \nentities authorized under title I to achieve these goals. Since this \nbill adds new responsibilities for tracking accountability and \ncollaboration which may trigger the need for additional resources, \nSection 163(b)(2) authorizes funds for administrative purposes. The \nintent is that these funds supplement, but not supplant existing \nadministrative funds provided to ADD.\n  I would like to thank Senator Harkin, and Senators Frist and \nWellstone for drafting provisions in Title II and Title III, \nrespectively. Title II of this legislation addresses the critical need \nfor family support for families of individuals with severe \ndisabilities. The bill authorizes grants (one, 3-year grant per State, \non a competitive basis) to assist States to provide services to \nfamilies who choose to keep their children with disabilities at home. \nIt gives support to States' efforts to assist families. Family support \nservices are cost effective in reducing the costs associated with life-\nlong disability, and in preventing the expense of out-of-home \nplacement. Such services allow individuals with disabilities to stay at \nhome with their families.\n  Title II gives flexibility and authority to States in the design of \nstatewide systems of family support services for families of children \nwith disabilities. Family support activities supported through this \nbill should be family-centered and family-directed. This means families \nof children with disabilities have control over decisions relating to \nthe supports that will meet the priorities of their family, and \nparticipate in the planning, development, implementation, and \nevaluation of the statewide system of family support.\n  When applying for a grant, States are expected to demonstrate the \nnature and extent of the involvement of families of children with \ndisabilities and individuals with disabilities in the development of \nthe application and in the development, implementation, and evaluation \nof the statewide system of family support for families of children with \ndisabilities.\n  The bill requires States to designate a lead entity that will \ncoordinate activities funded under the grant. The lead agency should \nhave the capacity to promote a statewide system of family support \nservices that is family-centered and family-directed; to promote and \nimplement systems change activities; and to maximize access to public \nand private funds for family support services for families of children \nwith disabilities. The application should also designate the \ninvolvement of other State or local agencies, including local councils, \nin both the preparation of the application and the continuing role of \neach agency in the statewide system of family support for families of \nchildren with disabilities.\n  This legislation also gives States maximum flexibility in selecting \nactivities they will implement in providing family support services for \nfamilies of children with disabilities, including populations who are \nunserved or underserved. Activities may include training and technical \nassistance; the development or strengthening of family-centered and \nfamily-directed approaches to services, including service coordination \nservices, service planning\n\n[[Page S14332]]\n\nservices, and respite care services; and assistance to families of \nchildren with disabilities in accessing natural and community supports \nand in obtaining benefits and services. A State may also conduct needs \nassessments; evaluations of data related to the statewide system of \nfamily support for families of children with disabilities; or pilot \ndemonstration projects to demonstrate new approaches to the provision \nof family support services for families of children with disabilities.\n  Title III recognizes and responds to a national need to increase the \nnumber of, and improve the training for, direct support workers who \nassist individuals with developmental disabilities where they live, \nwork, go to school, and engage in other aspects of community life, \nconsistent and in coordination with title I of this legislation. Title \nIII acknowledges that direct support workers play essential roles in \nproviding the support that individuals with developmental disabilities \nneed, and in expanding community options for these individuals.\n  Section 303 of title III authorizes the Reaching Up Scholarships \nProgram to encourage continuing education for individuals who provide \ndirect support to individuals with developmental disabilities. This \nscholarship program authorizes vouchers of up to $2,000 to an eligible \ndirect support worker. Recipients of these vouchers will be direct \nsupport workers who assist individuals with developmental disabilities \nin a wide range of settings. This grant program will be administered \nthrough institutions of higher education, State agencies, or consortia \nof such institutions or agencies. It will enable direct support workers \nto access training related to providing state of the art supports and \nservices to individuals with developmental disabilities and their \nfamilies.\n  Title III, section 304 of this legislation provides funding for the \ndevelopment, evaluation, and dissemination of a staff development \ncurriculum, and related guidelines for computer-assisted, competency-\nbased, multi-media, interactive instruction to provide staff \ndevelopment for individuals in direct service roles with people with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their families. Title III also \nrecognizes the potential contribution of individuals with developmental \ndisabilities who themselves may choose to become direct service \nproviders. This state of the art curriculum will allow direct service \nworkers, including those with limited levels of literacy, access to and \nparticipation in, state of the art training that reflects the \nprinciples articulated in title I, particularly the principles of self-\ndetermination, independence, productivity, integration, and inclusion \nof individuals with developmental disabilities in all aspects of \ncommunity life. The curriculum will also address the use of positive \nsupports and interventions as alternatives to the use of aversive \ntreatment, particularly the inappropriate use of restraint and \nseclusion with individuals with developmental disabilities across the \nage span and in a variety of settings. The curriculum will be fully \nfield-tested, evaluated, and nationally disseminated.\n  Throughout the country, the DD Act programs have a long history of \nachievement. In Vermont, the DD Act programs make on-going \ncontributions to major initiatives affecting individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and their families. They play significant \nroles in many of Vermont's accomplishments, including: the inclusion of \nchildren with severe disabilities into local schools and classrooms; \nearly intervention and family leadership initiatives that are national \nmodels; and innovative programs in the areas of employment, and \ncommunity living options for individuals with developmental \ndisabilities. Based upon the letters our office has received from \nacross the country, it is clear that these DD programs make \nsubstantial, positive differences in all States.\n  S. 1809 is bi-partisan, balanced, and responsive legislation that \nreflects months of discussion and collaboration among individuals and \norganizations representing a full range of opinion. I would like to \nrecognize the contributions of the numerous disability and advocacy \ngroups that provided public input, especially the Developmental \nDisabilities Task Force of the Consortium for Citizens with \nDisabilities and their co-chairs, who have worked with staff over nine \nmonths to develop this legislation.\n  I would like to thank Senate staff including Connie Garner from \nSenator Kennedy's staff, Katie Corrigan and Tom Hlavacek from Senator \nHarkin's staff, Dave Larson from Senator Frist's staff, Cheryl Chambers \nfrom Senator Wellstone's staff, and Liz King from the Senate \nLegislative Counsel. I would also like to thank staff from the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services including Sue Swenson, Reggie \nWells, and Elsbeth Wyatt from the Administration on Developmental \nDisabilities, and Barbara Clark and Amy Lockhart from the Office of the \nAssistant Secretary for Legislation. And finally, I would like to thank \nmy own HELP Committee staff particularly Pat Morrissey, Lu Zeph, Leah \nMenzies, Heidi Scheuermann, and Mark Powden who worked long and hard on \nthis legislation.\n  S. 1809 continues a long tradition of Congressional support for \nindividuals with developmental disabilities, their families, and their \ncommunities and ensures that this support will continue to meet their \nneeds into the next century. I ask my colleagues to join me today in \nvoting to pass this bill out of the Senate.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I support the passage of Senate Bill 1809, \nthe Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of \n1999.\n  As the chief sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the \nformer chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Disability Policy, I take a \nparticular interest in the Developmental Disabilities Act, which has \nbeen a cornerstone of our national policy for people with disabilities. \nIn fact, the Supreme Court cited the Developmental Disabilities Act in \nthe recent Olmstead decision as evidence of Congress' intent that \npeople with disabilities should have the choice to receive services in \nthe community.\n  The entities funded under the Act--the Developmental Disabilities \nCouncils, University Affiliated Programs, and the Protection and \nAdvocacy systems--have enabled us to move away from a service system \nthat denied people with disabilities the choice to receive services \nwhere families and individuals want them--in their own homes, \ncommunities, and neighborhoods.\n  This year's reauthorization is very important for several reasons. \nFirst, we must continue our progress toward ensuring that people with \ndevelopmental disabilities achieve their maximum potential through \nincreased self-determination, independence, productivity, and \nintegration in all facets of life.\n  Second, we must ensure that people with developmental disabilities \nare free from abuse and neglect in all aspects of the service delivery \nsystem. This bill will help protect people with disabilities from abuse \nand neglect no matter where they live--inside an institution or in the \ncommunity.\n  And finally, we must do more to strengthen and support families as \nthey provide care and support to family members with a disability. \nFamily caregivers are the true heroes of our long-term care system. In \nTitle II of this bill, Congress lends support to State efforts to give \nindividuals with disabilities the choice to stay at home, with their \nfamilies.\n  I thank Senator Jeffords for acknowledging my strong interest and \ncontributions to this important title. This Family Support grant \nprogram gives flexibility and authority to the States in designing \nstatewide systems of family support services for families of children \nwith disabilities. It is our intention that all activities conducted \nunder the Family Support program should be family-centered and family-\ndirected. This means that services and programs should facilitate the \nfull participation and control by families of children with \ndisabilities in decisions relating to the supports that will meet the \npriorities of the family; and in the planning, development, \nimplementation, and evaluation of the statewide system of family \nsupport.\n  We have given States the flexibility of defining what Family Support \nservices will be provided. Family Support services should lead to the \nintegration and inclusion of children with disabilities and their \nfamilies in the use and participation of the same community resources \nthat are used by and available to other individuals and families.\n\n[[Page S14333]]\n\n  Family Support services may include help with service coordination; \nthe provision of goods and services such as specialized evaluations and \ndiagnostic services, adaptive equipment, respite care, personal \nassistance services, homemaker and chore services, behavioral supports, \nassistive technology services and devices, permanency and future \nplanning, home and vehicle modifications and repairs, equipment and \nconsumable supplies, transportation, specialized nutrition and \nclothing, counseling and mental health services, family education and \ntraining services, communication services, crisis intervention, daycare \nand child care for a child with a disability, supports and services for \nintegrated and inclusive community activities, parent or family member \nsupport groups, peer support, sitter service or companion service, \neducation aids; and financial assistance, which may include cash \nsubsidies, allowances, voucher or reimbursement systems, low-interest \nloans, or lines of credit.\n  A statewide system of Family Support Services means a system that is \nfamily-centered and family-directed, and that assists and enables \nfamilies to receive rights and procedural safeguards and to gain access \nto social, medical, legal, educational, and other supports and \nservices; and that include follow along services that ensure that the \nchanging needs of the child and family are met; the coordination and \nmonitoring of services provided to the family; the provision of \ninformation to children with disabilities and their families about the \navailability of services, and assistance to such children and their \nfamilies in obtaining appropriate services; and the facilitation and \norganization of existing social networks and natural sources of \nsupport, and community resources and services.\n  Such a statewide system should also be culturally competent, \ncommunity-centered, and comprehensive so that it addresses the needs of \nall families of children with disabilities, including unserved and \nunderserved populations; and addresses such needs without regard to the \nage, type of disability, race, ethnicity, or gender of such children or \nthe major life activity for which such children need the assistance.\n  When applying for a grant, States should demonstrate the nature and \nextent of the involvement of families of children with disabilities and \nindividuals with disabilities in the development of the application, \nincluding the involvement of unserved and underserved populations; and \nin strategies for actively involving families of children with \ndisabilities and individuals with disabilities in the development, \nimplementation, and evaluation of the statewide system of family \nsupport for families of children with disabilities. In the application, \nStates should also describe the unmet needs for family support for \nfamilies of children with disabilities in the State.\n  When applying for a grant, States should designate a lead entity that \nwill coordinate activities funded under the grant with activities of \nother relevant State and local agencies. The lead agency should have \nthe capacity to promote a statewide system of family support for \nfamilies of children with disabilities throughout the State that is \nfamily-centered and family-directed; to promote and implement systems \nchange activities; and to maximize access to public and private funds \nfor family support services for families of children with disabilities. \nThe application should also designate the involvement of other State or \nlocal agencies, including local councils, in the preparation of the \napplication and the continuing role of each agency in the statewide \nsystem of family support for families of children with disabilities.\n  We have given States maximum flexibility in selecting activities they \nwill implement in providing family support services for families of \nchildren with disabilities. The State may support training and \ntechnical assistance activities for family members, service providers, \ncommunity members, professionals, students, and others to increase \nfamily participation, choice, and control in the provision of family \nsupport services for families of children with disabilities; to develop \nor strengthen family-centered and family-directed approaches to \nservices, including service coordination services, service planning \nservices, and respite care services; and to assist families of children \nwith disabilities in accessing natural and community supports and in \nobtaining benefits and services.\n  A State may conduct needs assessments, evaluations of data related to \nthe statewide system of family support for families of children with \ndisabilities, or pilot demonstration projects to demonstrate new \napproaches to the provision of family support services for families of \nchildren with disabilities. A State may also support activities to \nidentify and coordinate Federal and State policies, resources, and \nservices, relating to the provision of family support services for \nfamilies of children with disabilities, including interagency \nactivities and agreements.\n  In addition, a State may conduct outreach activities to locate \nfamilies who are eligible for family support services for families of \nchildren with disabilities; to solicit input from such families; and to \nidentify groups who are unserved and underserved. Such activities may \ninvolve the creation or maintenance of, support of, or provision of, \nassistance to statewide and community parent organizations, and \norganizations that provide family support to families of children with \ndisabilities; the dissemination of relevant information; and other \neducation activities.\n  In closing, I remind my colleagues that the toughest barriers faced \nby people with disabilities are not architectural, they are \nattitudinal. They are not in the environment, they are in our hearts \nand in our minds. When people with disabilities are integrated \nthroughout our communities, we are given the opportunity to change our \nattitudes from ones based on stereotypes, fear, and ignorance, to ones \nbased on admiration, acceptance, and affection.\n  In this way, the Developmental Disabilities Act benefits all of us. \nNot only are people with disabilities assisted in taking their rightful \nplace in the mainstream of American society. Not only are families that \ninclude a child with a disability given access to the supports, \nresources, and services needed to maintain family unity. But in the \nprocess, we all gain from the opportunity to experience people with \ndevelopmental disabilities as friends, as neighbors, as co-workers, as \nclassmates.\n  I especially thank Senator Jeffords and Senator Kennedy for their \nleadership on this issue, and I am glad to join so many of my \ncolleagues from the HELP Committee as a co-sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1809), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14333-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S14333-S14334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING AMERICA'S NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS AND PRIVATE \n                        VOLUNTEER ORGANIZATIONS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar No. 377, S. Res. \n208.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 208) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding United States policy toward the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization and European Union, in light of \n     the Alliance's April 1999 Washington Summit and the European \n     Union's June 1999 Cologne Summit.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2776\n\n       (Purpose: To make technical amendments)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for Mr. Levin, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2776.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In section 1(b), strike paragraph (1) and insert the \n     following:\n       (1) on matters of trans-Atlantic concern, the European \n     Union should make clear that it would undertake an autonomous \n     mission through the European Security and Defense Identity \n     only after the North Atlantic Treaty Organization had \n     declined to undertake that mission;\n       In section 1(b)(5), strike ``must'' and insert ``should''.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to explain my amendment to S. Res. \n208 expressing the sense of the Senate on United States policy toward \nNATO and the European Union and my own personal view regarding the \ndesirability of our European Allies conducting operations in their own \nbackyard.\n  My amendment makes three important changes to the language of the \nresolution as reported out by the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  First of all, the amendment substitutes ``the'' for ``its'' before \n``European Security and Defense Identity'' to make the point that the \nEuropean Security and Defense Identity, or ESDI, is being developed \nwithin, not outside, the NATO Alliance. This simple fact is enshrined \nin a number of North Atlantic Council communiques and declarations, \nstarting with the Declaration of Heads of State and Government issued \nat the Council meeting in Brussels on June 11, 1994. This is important \nbecause the development of the ESDI within the Alliance means that, as \nthe 1994 Brussels Declaration stated, ``NATO will remain the essential \nforum for consultation among its members and the venue for agreement on \npolicies bearing on security and defense commitments of Allies under \nthe Washington Treaty.''\n  Next, my amendment deletes the references to NATO being ``offered the \nopportunity to undertake the mission'' and then that NATO ``referred it \nto the European Union for action.'' The first point here is that on one \nhas to offer a mission to NATO; the North Atlantic Council is in \npermanent session so that it can continuously review events that could \nimpact on stability in the Euro-Atlantic area and can react to them, if \nnecessary. Consequently, it doesn't have to be offered an opportunity \nto undertake a mission; it has that responsibility and the means to \neffect it on a continuing basis. The next point is that NATO doesn't \nrefer a mission to the European Union; the EU will undoubtedly have \nbeen following such an\n\n[[Page S14335]]\n\nevent on its own and won't need a referral from NATO to do so. And the \nfinal and perhaps most important point is that this change removes the \nconnotation that somehow the European Union is subservient to NATO.\n  The last change is to simply substitute ``should'' for ``must'' in \nthe subparagraph relating to the implementation of the European Union's \nCommon Foreign and Security Policy. This will avoid the connotation \nthat the United States is dictating to an organization of sovereign \nstates.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to express my own personal view \nconcerning the desirability of our European Allies conducting \noperations in their own backyard. I have long been a supporter of the \nESDI and I am a supporter of the U.S.-sponsored Defense Capabilities \nInitiative that was recently adopted by NATO. NATO's Operation Allied \nForce demonstrated a capabilities gap between the United States and our \nNATO Allies. I welcome the stated determination of our European Allies \nto develop the capability to act on their own. I welcome the fact that \nthey are providing more than 80 percent of the forces participating in \nthe NATO-led Kosovo Force. I would welcome it if our European Allies \nwould handle the next crisis that develops in Europe. I would be happy \nif the United States' contribution was limited, for instance, to \nproviding such things as command and control, communications, and \nintelligence support and I would be even more pleased if the United \nStates didn't have to provide any support and our European Allies were \ncapable of handling a crisis on their own.\n  I have characterized the United States as being a junior partner and \nthe European Allies being the senior partner in the KFOR peacekeeping \nmission. I know that there are many people, including some within the \nAdministration who don't like that characterization, but I see nothing \nwrong with it.\n  Mr. President, the United States Congress for years has urged Europe \nto play a greater role in its own defense and to bear more of the \ncollective security burden in NATO. I, for one, can take yes for an \nanswer.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the resolution and preamble be agreed to en \nbloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, that any \nstatements relating thereto be placed in the Record as if read in the \nappropriate place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2776) was agreed to.\n  The resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n  [The resolution was not available for printing.

Mr. President, the newspapers of the Nation this weekend \nwere filled with stories about the politics of prescription drug \ncoverage for the Nation's elderly. One poll after another said that the \nquestion of covering prescription drugs for seniors was one of the top \nthree concerns of millions of Americans--not just seniors, but people \nof all ages. And then, in addition to all the polls and surveys that \nwere published this weekend, some of our most distinguished political \njournalists were out across the country interviewing people in America \nasking them what they thought about Congress' handling of the \nprescription drug issue. And one interview after another essentially \nhas seniors and families responding that they could not figure out why \nthe Congress in Washington, DC, could not tackle this issue in a \nbipartisan way.\n  I remember one of the interviewees in particular, in effect, saying, \n``What are they so busy fussing about in Washington, DC, that they \ncan't find the time to deal with an issue so important to millions of \nolder people?'' I think that person who got interviewed pretty much \nsummed it up.\n  I have been coming up to the floor of the Senate over the last 2 or 3 \nweeks in an effort to try to bring folks' attention, both in the Senate \nand in our country, that there is bipartisan legislation to cover the \nquestion of prescription drugs for older people, and to talk about why \nit is so important. As part of that effort, as you can see in the \nposter next to me, I have been urging that seniors send in copies of \ntheir prescription drug bills--actually send in copies of their \nprescription drug bills to those of us in the Senate in Washington, DC. \nI have been getting a great many of these bills. I have been coming to \nthe floor on a number of occasions and actually reading from these \nbills because I think it helps to drive home what we saw in the \nnewspapers all across the country this weekend, and that is that we \nhave to come up with a bipartisan plan to meet these needs of \nvulnerable elderly people.\n  So tonight I am going to read from some of the letters that I am \nreceiving from older people at home in Oregon. Four letters in \nparticular struck me as particularly compelling in recent days. I have \nheard from folks in North Bend, Redmond, Roseburg, and Milwaukie in the \nmetropolitan area of our State. All of them essentially make the same \nkind of case, and that is that so many seniors are walking on an \neconomic tightrope. They are balancing food costs against the fuel \ncosts and the fuel costs against their medical bills. With so many \nbeing unable to afford their prescriptions, they are writing and saying \nthey can't afford to wait for another election, the 2000 election, to \nresolve this issue. They have been reading these articles with Members \nof Congress saying that it is too complicated to tackle now. It is too \ndifficult to get a consensus. I just don't think that is the case.\n  There is a bipartisan bill now before the U.S. Senate. It is one that \nwas drafted by the distinguished senior Senator from Maine, Olympia \nSnowe, and myself. We got 54 votes for it on the floor of the Senate. A \nmajority of Members of the Senate voted in a specific way to fund the \nprescription drug benefit for the Nation's older people. So it is just \nnot right to say that there is no consensus, there is no way to bring \nSenators of both political parties together on this issue. It is just \nfactually wrong. Fifty-four Members of the\n\n[[Page S14336]]\n\nSenate have said that they would vote for a specific approach to \nfunding a drug benefit for the Nation's older people, and it was a \nbipartisan vote. It wasn't done in the dead of night. It was part of \nthe budget debate. A majority in the Senate is now on record.\n  It is a plan that I think unleashes the forces of the marketplace. It \nis built on the model from which Members of Congress get their health \ncare, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. It is called the \nSPICE Program, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity Act. \nIt gives seniors the kind of bargaining power that some of these big \npurchasers such as the health maintenance organizations have.\n  Right now, seniors with prescriptions get hit by sort of a double \nwhammy.\n  First, Medicare doesn't cover prescriptions. It hasn't since the \nprogram began in 1965.\n  Second, when a senior citizen walks into a drugstore, walks into \ntheir neighborhood pharmacy, in effect that senior has to pay a premium \nfor their prescription drugs because the big buyers actually get \ndiscounts.\n  You have these health care plans. You have health maintenance \norganizations. You have the big buyers going out and negotiating \ndiscounts. Then senior citizens walk into the pharmacy in their \ncommunity in effect having to pay a premium and in effect subsidizing \nthe big buyers in town who get these discounts.\n  I am often asked whether our country can afford to cover prescription \ndrugs for the Nation's older people. My response is that America can't \nafford not to cover these prescription drugs because so many of these \ndrugs at this time are essentially ones that help keep older people \nwell. They help keep them healthy--lower blood pressure, deal with \ncholesterol problems--and keep seniors from getting sick and landing in \nthe hospital where they need very expensive services from what is \ncalled the Part A program of Medicare, the hospital institutional part.\n  I have cited on several occasions on the floor of the Senate \nanticoagulant drugs because I think they best illustrate how serious \nthe problem is and why it needs a bipartisan solution along the lines \nof the Snowe-Wyden bill. It makes some sense. These anticoagulant drugs \nmight cost in the vicinity of $1,000 a year to cover the needs of an \nolder person. But if with anticoagulant medicine we can prevent this \ndebilitating injury, that could save in the vicinity of $100,000. That \nwould be expenses incurred when an older person suffers a stroke.\n  Think of that: $1,000 for an anticoagulant medicine, and as a result \nof a senior being able to afford that, very often that person can stay \nhealthy and keep from being struck by debilitating stroke and incurring \n$100,000 in expenses that would come about as a result of that illness.\n  I hope seniors will continue to write to me and to other Members of \nthe Senate, as this poster says. We hope they will send us copies of \ntheir prescription drug bills and actually send copies of how they are \naffected to each of us here in the Senate in Washington, DC.\n  I want to take just a minute or two now to read from some of the \nletters I have received in the last few days.\n  One of the first is a letter I received from an older couple in North \nBend. The spouse is 73. Her husband is 77. They report that they have \nabout $18,000 a year in Social Security income and spend about $2,000 \nof it on their prescription drugs. They have a Blue Cross plan. It \ndoesn't cover any of their prescriptions--none of them.\n  I think this is really sort of typical of what I have been hearing \nfrom senior citizens across our State.\n  Here is a copy of what these bills look like for folks who are \nthinking about sending them to us. This one comes from North Bend, OR. \nIt comes from the Safeway pharmacy there in North Bend. An older couple \npoints out in a letter to me that they simply are not going to be able \nto afford what they are told is going to be the next increase. They are \ntold that next month their bills are going to go up again on top of \nwhat I have cited they are having to pay for over-the-counter \nmedications as well. Compared to some of their friends, they are not \nwhat they call ``pill takers.'' With an income of $18,000 a year, think \nof having to spend about $2,000 of it on prescription drugs, and that \ndoesn't even count for what they spend on over-the-counter medications. \nTheir bills are going up again next month.\n  These are the kinds of people to whom I think the Senate ought to be \nlistening.\n  Another letter I received in the last few days comes from an older \ncouple in Redmond. They sent me this bill for the month of October. \nJust for the month of October, colleagues who maybe listening in--$282 \na month just for the month of October from an older couple in Redmond. \nThey went to the Rite-Aid Pharmacy in a mall in Redmond. They are faced \nnow with the prospect of having to spend $282 a month all year round on \ntheir prescriptions, and, suffice it to say, they too are asking why it \nis that the Congress, and the Senate specifically, isn't being \nresponsive. Here is a third bill I received in the last few days. This \nis from an older woman who is spending close to $300 a month on her \nprescription drugs at the Wal-Mart in Roseburg.\n  This is again the kind of real-life case to which I think the Senate \nought to be paying attention. They are just sending us now copies of \ntheir bills. These are not drugs that are uncommon. Glucophage, for \nexample, for a lot of seniors is an essential medicine because it helps \nthem with their diabetes. When senior citizens can't afford to pay for \na prescription for glucophage, they are going to suffer some very \nserious health problems as a result.\n  I cited examples at the end of last week.\n  There are seniors at home in Oregon who have prescriptions their \ndoctor wrote out for drugs such as that, and they simply could not \nafford to have them filled. They were hanging on to the prescription \nhoping that sometime down the road they would get the funds to be able \nto afford their prescriptions.\n  That is the kind of case we are hearing about from the Nation's older \npeople.\n  I hope folks who are listening in tonight will see, as this poster \nsays, that we hope to hear from more of them. We would like for them, \nas this poster says, to send copies of their prescription drug bills \ndirectly to us in the Senate in Washington, DC.\n  I intend to keep coming to the floor of this body and going through \nsome of these cases in the hopes that this can pique the conscience of \nthe Senate for bipartisan action.\n  Finally, tonight I have one other bill that struck me as so poignant \nand really summing it up. It comes from an older man who sends his \nwife's mother's bill because she is 91 and she is spending about $400 \nper month on prescription medicines. The letter says this is outrageous \nfor a 91-year-old person, a person who is on a fixed income, to have to \npay. She is 91 years old. The list goes on for pages.\n  I am going to wrap up tonight by saying it would be one thing if you \ncouldn't bring Senators together around an important issue and simply \nnot find any consensus whatsoever.\n  That is not the case with respect to the Snowe-Wyden legislation. The \nsenior Senator from Maine and I have teamed up on a bill that is \nmodeled after the kind of health care Members of the United States \nSenate receive.\n  Mr. President, 54 Members of the Senate, as part of the budget \ndebate, said they would vote for a way to pay for the plan. We are \nseeing these polls and interviews along the lines of what I cited. \nNewspapers were filled this weekend with folks saying, why can't the \nSenate act? That is the question: Why can't the Senate act when there \nis a bipartisan bill?\n  The SPICE legislation, the Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage \nEquity Act, is legislation I believe can move forward because it is \nbipartisan. Certainly, our colleagues have other ideas about how to \nproceed. Senator Snowe and I are anxious to hear from them with respect \nto their approach.\n  What is important is that the Senate stop ducking this issue. The \nSenate ought to say we are now going to recognize how serious these \nconcerns of the Nation's older people are and not just put them off and \nsay it is too complicated to deal with now and we will talk about it in \n2001, but with a year to go until election, we ought to roll up our \nsleeves and come up with a bipartisan plan to address these needs.\n  Until that time, I hope seniors will continue to send copies of their \nprescription drug bills to each Senator. I\n\n[[Page S14337]]\n\nam particularly anxious to have them. Send them to our offices in \nWashington, DC. I will keep coming to the floor of this body, reading \nfrom letters from folks, including this 91-year-old who cannot afford \nnext month's increase in prescription drugs, folks who cannot pay for \ntheir diabetes medicine and are likely to get much sicker as a result. \nI intend to keep coming to the floor of this body, reading from those \nletters, and doing everything I can to try to bring the Senate together \naround bipartisan legislation to meet the needs of our elderly.\n  The approach behind the Snowe-Wyden legislation does not involve \nprice controls. We have a lot of Senators legitimately concerned about \nthat. It is not a one-size-fits-all Federal regime. It is a model based \non something we all know well. That is the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. In fact, the SPICE Program that Senator Snowe and I have \ndrafted is a senior citizens version of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan. We are convinced it can work for the Nation's older \npeople.\n  I hope we will not pass up this opportunity to address these \nheartfelt concerns that seniors are passing on. I hope we will not say \nthis issue is too complicated for the Senate to act. We may be leaving \nin a few days, but there will be an opportunity in the days ahead to \nbring Senators of both political parties together and fashion \nlegislation that is responsive to the country's older people. I am \nconvinced older people cannot afford to wait another year, wait another \nyear for politicking and debates to go forward. Certainly, based on the \nkinds of bills, as the bill I read from, including the 91-year-old \nsenior spending $400 a month, she cannot afford to wait, at 91, for \nanother year of electioneering. I believe when there is a bipartisan \nbill before the Senate, she shouldn't have to wait.\n  I will continue to read from these letters. I hope folks will send \ncopies of their prescription drug bills. We need to act on this matter. \nWe saw again this weekend how important it is to the American people. I \nwill be coming back to this floor again and again and again until we \nget bipartisan action on this urgent matter for millions of the \nNation's older people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/11/08/senate-section/article/S14337-1", "month": "11", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S14337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
