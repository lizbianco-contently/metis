I ask unanimous consent that the oversized posters we use \nthis morning be permitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the past 2 days, we have heard \nseveral Senators who oppose the flag desecration amendment speak about \nthe American flag as only a symbol or a piece of cloth that should not \nbe confused with the real freedoms that we as Americans enjoy. They \nwant to know why we get so worked up over a symbol, a mere piece of \ncloth. They want to know why we should care if someone urinates or \ndefecates on the American flag. They ask: Aren't we strong enough as a \nnation to overlook such behavior?\n  The U.S. flag is a lot more than a symbol and a lot more than a piece \nof cloth. Don't take my word for it. Listen to the story of how Mike \nChristian feels about the American flag. Mike Christian was one of \nSenator John McCain's cellmates at the ``Hanoi Hilton'' during the \nVietnam war. He sewed an American flag on the inside of his shirt, and \nhe often led his prisoners of war in the Pledge of Allegiance to the \nflag. One day, his captors found that flag and they beat him severely \nfor possessing it. Despite the risk of even more life-threatening \nabuse, Mr. Christian sharpened a little piece of bamboo into a needle \nand painstakingly made another flag out of bits of cloth. His new flag, \nand the heroics it inspired, helped the other American prisoners \nsurvive their prolonged captivity under brutal conditions.\n  If a makeshift flag can stir such emotions, it is illogical for the \nSenate to ignore the feelings of the overwhelming number of Americans \nwho support flag protection. The flag is not just a piece of cloth or a \nsymbol. It is the embodiment of our heritage, our liberties, and indeed \nour sovereignty as\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\na nation. The American flag unites Americans because it embodies shared \nvalues and history.\n  Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of the U.S. and allied forces \nduring the gulf war, summed this up eloquently in his letter supporting \nthe flag amendment. General Schwarzkopf wrote:\n\n       We are a diverse people living in a complicated fragmented \n     society. I believe we are imperiled by a growing cynicism by \n     certain traditions that bind us, particularly service to our \n     Nation. The flag remains the single preeminent connection to \n     each other and to our country. Legally sanctioning flag \n     desecration only serves to undermine this national unity and \n     identity which must be preserved.\n\n  That was General Schwarzkopf, one of the great heroes of our country.\n  I have a few flags that will help illustrate what the flag means to \nour shared history. These flags tell part of the story of how this \nNation we all call ours came to be so great.\n  The flag with the circle of 13 stars was the first official flag of \nthe United States. It was adopted by an act of Congress on June 14, \n1777. According to legend, a group headed by George Washington came up \nwith this design and commissioned seamstress Betsy Ross to execute it \nfor presentation to Congress. It is a beautiful flag.\n  Let me go to the next flag. This design is believed by many \nauthorities to be the stars and stripes used by the American land \ntroops during the Revolutionary War. A flag such as this was flown over \nthe military stores at Bennington, VT, on August 16, 1777, when Gen. \nJohn Stark's militia led Americans to victory over a British raiding \nforce. The original of that flag is preserved in the Bennington, VT, \nmuseum.\n  The 15 stars and 15 stripes design was adopted prior to the War of \n1812 after two States were added to the Union. Notice that it not only \nhas 15 stars but also 15 stripes. This is the design that flew over \nFort McHenry during a naval bombardment and inspired Francis Scott Key \nto compose what later became our national anthem. The actual flag that \nsurvived that night over Fort McHenry has been restored and now hangs \nin the Smithsonian.\n  Today's flag has 50 stars and 13 stripes. Its design was born of the \nneed for a more practical way of adding states than adding both a star \nand a stripe for each one. Congress approved this design--seven red and \nsix white stripes, and a star for each state--on April 4, 1818. The 50-\nstar flag has been in use since July 4, 1960. It's a flag like this \nthat Mike Christian tried to fashion from his cell in the Hanoi Hilton. \nIt's a flag like this that flies over the Capitol and our Federal \nbuildings around the world. It is a flag like this that we pledge \nallegiance to every day when we open the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, do we mean what we say when we stand here each morning \nand pledge allegiance to the flag, or is it simply a hollow gesture? I \nfear that the significance of these flags, and their meaning to \nAmericans, is being belittled by some who suggest the Senate's time is \ntoo important for the flag protection constitutional amendment.\n  Listen to the American people. That is what I would like to say to \nthe Members of the Senate. The vast majority of our citizens support \namending the Constitution to protect our Nation's flag. To us, \nprotecting the flag as the symbol of our national community--and \nutilizing the constitutional amendment process to do so--is no trivial \nmatter.\n  There are tens of thousands of veterans living on our country today \nwho have put their lives on the line to defend our flag and the \nprinciples for which it stands. Those are the fortunate ones who were \nnot required to make the ultimate sacrifice, as did my brother and my \nbrother-in-law. For every one of those, there is someone who has traded \nthe life of a loved one for a flag, folded at a funeral. Let's think \nabout that trade--and about the people who made that sacrifice for us--\nbefore deciding whether the flag is important enough to be addressed in \nthe Senate.\n  Would it really trivialize the Constitution, as some critics suggest, \nto pass an amendment that is supported by a vast majority of Americans? \nIs it somehow frivolous to employ the amendment process that our \nFounding Fathers wrote into Article V of the Constitution? Are we \nirresponsible if we simply restore the law as it existed for centuries \nprior to two recent Supreme Court decisions?\n  The Constitution itself establishes the process for its own \namendment. It says that the Constitution will be amended when two-\nthirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states want to do so. It \ndoes not say that this procedure is reserved for issues that some law \nprofessors think are important, or for an issue that would immediately \ncrush the foundations of our great republic if left unaddressed. If \n``government by the people'' means anything, it means that the people \ncan decide the fundamental questions concerning the checks and balances \nin our government. It means the people can choose whether it is \nCongress or the Supreme Court that decides whether flag desecration is \nagainst the law. The people have said that they want Congress to decide \nit in the state legislatures.\n  I urge my colleagues to think hard about what they consider \n``important'' before they conclude that the Senate should ignore the \npeople's desire to make decisions about the government which governs \nthem. The flag amendment is the very essence of ``government by the \npeople'' because it reflects the people's decision to give Congress a \npower that the Supreme Court has taken away. This question is very \nimportant. It involved the separation of power doctrine of our \nConstitution.\n  I think we all have a pretty good idea of where the votes are on this \namendment. The question is why my colleagues wish to delay a vote on \nthis important measure. Perhaps they feel the need to turn a few more \nvotes . . . I don't know. Whatever the reason, I urge all my \ncolleagues, whether they support the flag amendment or not, to vote for \ncloture so we can then have an up and down vote on the merits of S.J. \nRes. 14.\n  Finally, all this amendment does is give Congress the power to \nprohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. I \nhappen to think that is a wise thing to do. The vast majority of the \nAmerican people think it is a wise thing to do. A vast majority of the \nHouse of Representatives think it is a wise thing to do. And a majority \nhere--although, alas, probably not enough--do believe it is a wise \nthing to do as well.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available to the Senator \nfrom Utah and the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 3 minutes remaining. \nThe Senator from Vermont has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thirteen? I thought the Senator from Vermont had half the \ntime, which would have been 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Half the time is 13 minutes to the side since \nthe Senate started at 9:30.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we extend debate \nfor 30 minutes so he can have 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I note we had discussion about whether \npeople want to prolong this debate. We do want to have debate on the \nconstitutional amendment. People have given tremendous speeches, pro \nand con, on this issue. I hope everybody will vote for cloture, for \nexample. But let us not have any suggestion that anybody here is trying \nto stop a vote on this constitutional amendment. We all want it. But \nmost Senators believe, if you are going to amend the Constitution, it \nrequires at least more debate and more time than we might give to a \nsimple resolution.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator for his tremendous leadership in \nopposition to this constitutional amendment. I thank him for his \nleadership on this whole issue.\n\n\n              the bill of rights and freedom of expression\n\n  Honoring the flag demands that we consider carefully the history of \nthe Bill of Rights before we choose to alter it. Many of our Founders \nsought a Bill of Rights because, in their view, the Constitution failed \nproperly to consider and protect the basic and fundamental rights of \nindividuals.\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\n  Although many Federalists, including James Madison, felt that the \nlimited powers conferred on the government by the Constitution were \nsufficiently narrow so as to leave those rights unquestioned, the Bill \nof Rights was adopted in order to provide reluctant states with the \nassurances necessary for approval of the Constitution.\n  From this beginning in compromise 209 years ago, the Bill of Rights \nhas evolved into the single greatest protector of individual freedom in \nhistory. It has done so, in large measure, because attempts to narrow \nit have, to date, been rejected.\n  It was fundamental to the founding of this Nation that individuals \nshould be free to express themselves, secure in the knowledge that \ngovernment will not suppress their expression because of its content. \nOur Nation's Founders created this new country to escape oppression at \nthe hands of the state. They firmly believed that government should not \nlimit one's ability to speak out. They wrote into our fundamental \ncharter the ten simple words: ``Congress shall make no law . . . \nabridging the freedom of speech.''\n  Over time, this Nation has grappled with the boundaries of free \nspeech, regulating defamation or obscenity. That government may \nregulate some expression, however, does not change the law's \npresumption against content-based regulation. In the words of Justice \nScalia: ``[T]he government may proscribe libel; but it may not make the \nfurther content discrimination of proscribing only libel critical of \nthe government.''\n  We need not concern ourselves with the parameters of speech that can \nbe proscribed, because the expression in question--political \nexpression--is clearly protected under the first amendment. The \ndefining standard that has marked the history of free expression in \nthis Nation is that speech may not be regulated based upon its content.\n  The presumptive invalidity of content regulation protects all forms \nof speech--that with which we agree, as well as that to which we \nobject. To do otherwise would make hollow, at best, the promise of free \nspeech. As the Supreme Court held in Street v. New York: ``[F]reedom to \ndiffer is not limited to things that do not matter much. That would be \na mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance is the right to \ndiffer as to things that touch the heart of the existing order.''\n  My colleagues, this amendment departs from that noble and time-\nhonored standard. It seeks instead to prohibit expression solely \nbecause of its content.\n  Proponents of this amendment have made plain that they direct their \neffort at expression that they deem ``disrespectful.'' Even more \ntroubling is that this amendment leaves the determination of what is \ndisrespectful to the government.\n  For the promise of free expression to be fulfilled, the first \namendment must protect those who rise to challenge the existing \nwisdom--to raise those views that may anger or offend. As Justice \nWilliam O. Douglas observed, free speech, ``may indeed serve its high \npurpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction \nwith conditions as they are, or even stirs people to anger.''\n  Adherence to this ideal is what separates America from oppressive \nregimes across the world. We tolerate dissent and protect dissenters. \nThey suppress dissent and jail dissenters, or condemn dissenters to a \nfate still more grave.\n  The first amendment to the United States Constitution is not \ninfallible. It cannot sanitize free expression any more than it can \nimpart wisdom to thoughts which otherwise have none. Nor can the first \namendment ensure that free expression will always comport with the \nviews of a majority of the American people or the American government.\n  What the first amendment does promise, however, is the right of each \nindividual in this Nation to stand and make a case, regardless of \nparticular point of view, and to do so absent fear of government \ncensor. This right is worthy of preserving. It is this right that is at \nrisk today. When we start down the road to distinguishing between whose \nmessage is appropriate and whose is not, we risk something far greater \nthan the right to burn a flag as political expression.\n  Much of what is clearly protected expression can easily be deemed \nobjectionable. So it is with flag burning. As the Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly stated, the act of flag burning cannot be divorced from the \ncontext in which it occurs--that of political expression. This Nation \nhas a proud and storied history of political expression--much of which \ncould easily be characterized as objectionable.\n  Does any Member of this body believe that if the question had been \nput to the crown as to whether or not the speech and expression \nemanating from the colonies, in the form of Thomas Paine's ``Common \nSense'' or the Articles of Confederation, should be sustained, the \nanswer would have been anything but a resounding no? Could not the same \nbe said of messages of the civil rights and suffrage movements?\n  This Nation was born of dissent. Contrary to the view that it weakens \nour democracy, this Nation stands today as the leader of the free world \nbecause we tolerate these varying forms of dissent--not because we \npersecute them.\n  In seeking to protect the American flag, this amendment asks us to \ndepart from the fundamental ideal that government shall not suppress \nexpression solely because it is disagreeable. As Justice Brennan wrote \nfor the majority in Texas v. Johnson:\n\n       If there is a bedrock principle underlying the first \n     amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit \n     expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea \n     itself offensive or disagreeable. We have not recognized an \n     exception to this principle even where our flag has been \n     involved.\n\n  So this amendment runs counter to the very premise of the Bill of \nRights--that the rights of individuals should remain beyond the purview \nof unwarranted government intervention. That is what lead to the \nadoption of the Bill of Rights. In the words of Justice Jackson, \nspeaking for the Supreme Court in 1943:\n\n       The very purpose of the Bill of Rights was to withdraw \n     certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political \n     controversy, to place them beyond the reach of majorities and \n     officials, to establish them as legal principles to be \n     applied by the courts. One's right to life, liberty, and \n     property, to free speech, a free press, freedom of worship \n     and assembly, and other fundamental rights may not be \n     submitted to vote; they depend on the outcome of no \n     elections.\n\nYet, this amendment would do exactly that. It would subject the fate of \none of our most fundamental rights to turn upon the outcome of \nelections. What comfort is a first amendment that tells the people that \nthe appropriateness of their political expression will be left to the \ngovernment?\n  In charting a divergent course, this amendment would create that \nexception--an exception at odds with free expression and with our \nhistory of liberty. If adopted, this amendment would for the first time \nin our history, signal an unprecedented, misguided, and troubling \ndeparture from our history as a free society.\n\n\n                                 values\n\n  During this debate and debates like it that often occur in years \ndivisible by four, we often hear a great deal about values. We often \nhear a great deal about the kinds of things we are teaching our \nchildren. We often hear aspirations for this amendment that appear at \nleast a little exaggerated: that it's going to stop the downward slide \nthat our culture has supposedly been on since the 1940s, that it's \ngoing to improve our schools, that it even might help get rid of bad \nmovies. All kidding aside, when some proponents of the amendment start \ntalking about this amendment as a fight over values, I get nervous. It \nreminds me of the ``culture war'' that some have invoked in the past \ndecade. We do not need to create one more source of division and \ndivisiveness. We need understanding and tolerance and community.\n  In any event, I am skeptical as to whether the alleged increased \nincidence of disrespect for the flag, supposedly stemming from a \nSupreme Court decision in 1989, has caused the purported deterioration \nin our culture that some have cited. If it is, passing this amendment \nis surely not going to stop it.\n  What this amendment will do is abridge the most precious freedom and \nthe most important principle that our country stands for, the right of \nfree speech. I do not say ``most precious'' and ``most important'' \nlightly. What message is curtailing that freedom going to send to our \nchildren? What\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nvalues are we upholding by taking this extreme step to deal with a \nproblem that by all accounts is not severe at all?\n  A fine piece in the March 22 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that \n``[o]ne academic research found fewer than 45 flag burnings between \n1777, when the flag was adopted, and 1989.''\n  Similarly, when the Judiciary Committee examined the issue last year, \nthe Congressional Research Service found 36 reported cases of flag \nburning or other physical acts of disrespect to the flag. And for that \nwe are going to amend, with unknown consequences, the most basic right \nof our citizens?\n  I respectfully disagree with the supporters of the amendment about \nthe effect that this issue has on children. We can send no better, no \nstronger, no more meaningful message to our children about the \nprinciples and the values of this country than to explain to them that \nthe beauty and the strength of this country is in its freedoms, not in \nits symbols. When we uphold first amendment freedoms despite the \nefforts of misguided and despicable people who want to provoke our \nwrath, we send a message to our children of what America is really \nabout. Our country is far too strong to be threatened by those who burn \nthe flag. We need to teach our children, and we should teach our \nchildren, and virtually all of us do teach our children, that it is \nwrong to burn the flag. We don't need to empower the government to put \npeople in jail for doing it in order to make that lesson plain and \npowerful.\n  Ironically, some supporters of the amendment have said that the \namendment was going to help create community in this country. As if a \nlaw that attempts to legislate patriotism can create community. As if \nbringing the full wrath of the criminal law and the power of the state \ndown on political dissenters is going to do anything other than \nencourage more people who want to grandstand their dissent and imagine \nthemselves ``martyrs for the cause.''\n  We all know that's what will happen the minute this amendment goes \ninto force. More flag burnings and other despicable acts of disrespect \nto the flag, not fewer. Will the amendment make these acts any more \ndespicable than they are today? Certainly not. Will it make us love the \nflag any more than we do today? No. Will the new law deter these acts? \nI doubt it.\n  I particularly doubt it in light of the testimony we heard before the \nJudiciary Committee that supporters of the amendment think that the \npunishment for violators of the statute that this amendment will allow \nCongress to pass ought to be a citation and a fine, or maybe some \ncommunity service or required classes, not jail time. So now it turns \nout we are going to amend the Bill of Rights, the very heart of the \nConstitution, in order to give the Congress of the United States the \npower to issue what the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Leahy, aptly called ``traffic tickets'' to people \nwho burn the flag. To me that makes no sense at all.\n\n  General Brady of the Citizens Flag Alliance told the Judiciary \nCommittee that the government ought to require flag burners to attend \nclasses on the meaning and importance of the flag. Frankly that \nsanction is even more troubling. As a sanction for expressing political \ndissent, the government is going to force people to take classes to \nunderstand the ``politically correct'' way to think about the flag. Are \n``reeducation'' programs to become the American way?\n  What this debate is really about is not whether flag burning is a \ngood idea, not whether we love and respect our flag, but whether the \nthreat to our country from those who would burn the flag is so great \nthat we must sacrifice the power and majesty of the first amendment to \nthe Constitution in order to prosecute them.\n\n\n                       is flag burning a problem?\n\n  Some argue that we must amend the Constitution in order to preserve \nthe symbolic value of the U.S. flag. They do so, however, in the \nabsence of any evidence that flag burning is rampant today, or that it \nmay be in the future. Perhaps more importantly, this amendment is \noffered in the absence of any evidence that the symbolic value of the \nflag has in any way been compromised.\n  No evidence has been offered to show that the handful of misguided \nindividuals who may burn a flag each year have any effect whatsoever on \nthis Nation's love of the flag or our democratic way of life. Respect \nof this Nation for the flag is unparalleled. The citizens of this \nNation love and respect the flag for varied and deeply personal \nreasons--not because the Constitution imposes this responsibility upon \nthem. As an editorial in the Lacrosse, Wisconsin, Tribune pointed out:\n\n       Allegiance that is voluntary is something beyond price. But \n     allegiance extracted by statute--or, worse yet, by \n     Constitutional fiat--wouldn't be worth the paper the \n     amendment was drafted on. It is the very fact that the flag \n     is voluntarily honored that makes it a great and powerful \n     symbol.\n\n  The suggestion that we can mandate, through an amendment to the \nConstitution, respect for the flag or any other symbol ignores the \npremise underlying patriotism. More importantly, it belies the \ntraditional notions of freedom found in our Constitution.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, the rights at the heart of this debate are far too \nfundamental and far too important to be subjected to the uncertainty \ncreated by this amendment. We must not abandon two centuries of free \nexpression in favor of an unwarranted and ill-defined standard which \nallows government to choose whose political message is worthy of \nprotection and whose is not. This is counter to the very freedoms the \nflag symbolizes.\n  The very idea that a handful of misguided people could cause this \nNation--a Nation which has, from its inception been a beacon of \nindividual liberty, a Nation which has defended, both at home and \nabroad, the right of individuals to be free--to retreat from the \nfundamental American principle that speech should not be regulated \nbased upon its content is cause for great concern.\n  We will be paying false tribute to the flag if in our zeal to protect \nit we diminish the very freedoms it represents. The true promise of \nthis great Nation is rooted in our Constitution. Ultimately, the \nfulfillment of this promise lies in preservation of this great \ncovenant, not just our symbols. If we sacrifice our principles, \nultimately our symbols will represent something less than they should.\n  The Capitol dome is not our Constitution. The national anthem is not \nour form of government. And the flag, by itself, is not our Nation.\n  Yes, let us honor the ``broad stripes and bright stars * * * so \ngallantly streaming.'' But we best honor that for which our flag stands \nwhen we protect the Constitution and its Bill of Rights. In that way, \nwe will best ensure that our Star Spangled Banner shall yet wave over a \nland that is still free.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution Subcommittee. He \nhas been a leader on this issue and so many other constitutional issues \nthat protect the rights of all of us. He has done that ever since he \ncame to the Senate. I applaud him, not only for what he said here but \nfor his active work in the committee.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator, and my friend, from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I know \nthis letter has been referenced previously, but I want to re-reference \nit in light of what the Senator read from General Schwarzkopf. No less \na distinguished general, Gen. Colin Powell, has written a letter to \nSenator Leahy:\n\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n\n  I am skipping down a paragraph:\n\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we found outrageous.\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record this \nletter from Gen. Colin Powell.\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret),\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking \n     my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.\n       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a \n     love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as \n     a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.\n       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation. \n     Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is \n     under consideration. Few countries in the world would think \n     of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting \n     such a symbol.\n       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or \n     desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when \n     they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of \n     their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of \n     cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which \n     tolerates such desecration.\n       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else, \n     that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I \n     really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute \n     someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We \n     should condemn them and pity them instead.\n       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and \n     citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful \n     sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel \n     the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the \n     Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment \n     exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression \n     applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but \n     also that which we find outrageous.\n       I would not amend the great shield of democracy to hammer a \n     few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long \n     after they have slunk away.\n       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will \n     create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge \n     from such an amendment.\n       If I were a member of Congress, I would not vote for the \n     proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the \n     views of those who would. For or against, we all love our \n     flag with equal devotion.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Colin L. Powell.\n       P.S. The attached 1989 article by a Vietnam POW gave me \n     further inspiration for my position.\n\n     When They Burned The Flag Back Home: Thoughts of a Former POW\n\n                          (By James H. Warner)\n\n       In March of 1973, when we were released from a prisoner of \n     war camp in North Vietnam, we were flown to Clark Air Force \n     base in the Philippines. As I stepped out of the aircraft I \n     looked up and saw the flag. I caught my breath, then, as \n     tears filled my eyes, I saluted it. I never loved my country \n     more than at that moment. Although I have received the Silver \n     Star Medal and two Purple Hearts, they were nothing compared \n     with the gratitude I felt then for having been allowed to \n     serve the cause of freedom.\n       Because the mere sight of the flag meant so much to me when \n     I saw it for the first time after 5\\1/2\\ years, it hurts me \n     to see other Americans willfully desecrate it. But I have \n     been in a Communist prison where I looked into the pit of \n     hell. I cannot compromise on freedom. It hurts to see the \n     flag burned, but I part company with those who want to punish \n     the flag burners. Let me explain myself.\n       Early in the imprisonment the Communists told us that we \n     did not have to stay there. If we would only admit we were \n     wrong, if we would only apologize, we could be released \n     early. If we did not, we would be punished. A handful \n     accepted, most did not. In our minds, early release under \n     those conditions would amount to a betrayal, of our comrades \n     of our country and of our flag.\n       Because we would not say the words they wanted us to say, \n     they made our lives wretched. Most of us were tortured, and \n     some of my comrades died. I was tortured for most of the \n     summer of 1969. I developed beriberi from malnutrition. I had \n     long bouts of dysentery. I was infested with intestinal \n     parasites. I spent 13 months in solitary confinement. Was our \n     cause worth all of this. Yes, it was worth all this and more.\n       Rose Wilder Lane, in her magnificent book ``The Discovery \n     of Freedom,'' said there are two fundamental truths that men \n     must know in order to be free. They must know that all men \n     are brothers, and they must know that all men are born free. \n     Once men accept these two ideas, they will never accept \n     bondage. The power of these ideas explains why it was illegal \n     to teach slaves to read.\n       One can teach these ideas, even in a Communist prison camp. \n     Marxists believe that ideas are merely the product of \n     material conditions; change those material conditions, and \n     one will change the ideas they produce. They tried to ``re-\n     educate'' us. If we could show them that we would not abandon \n     our belief in fundamental principles, then we could prove the \n     falseness of their doctrine. We could subvert them by \n     teaching them about freedom through our example. We could \n     show them the power of ideas.\n       I did not appreciate this power before I was a prisoner of \n     war. I remember one interrogation when I was shown a \n     photograph of some Americans protesting the war by burning a \n     flag. ``There,'' the officer said, ``People in your country \n     protest against your cause. That proves that you are wrong.''\n       ``No,'' I said, ``That proves that I am right. In my \n     country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that \n     people disagree with us.'' The officer was on his feet in an \n     instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto \n     the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting \n     I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his \n     eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten \n     the satisfaction I felt at using his tool, the picture of the \n     burning flag, against him.\n       Aneurin Bevan, former official of the British Labor Party, \n     was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how the British \n     definition of democracy differed from the Soviet view. Bevan \n     responded, forcefully, that if Khrushchev really wanted to \n     know the difference, he should read the funeral oration of \n     Pericles.\n       In that speech, recorded in the Second Book of Thucydides' \n     ``History of the Peloponnesian War,'' Pericles contrasted \n     democratic Athens with totalitarian Sparta. Unlike, the \n     Spartans, he said, the Athenians did not fear freedom. \n     Rather, they viewed freedom as the very source of their \n     strength. As it was for Athens, so it is for America--our \n     freedom is not to be feared, but our freedom is our strength.\n       We don't need to amend the Constitution in order to punish \n     those who burn our flag. They burn the flag because they hate \n     America and they are afraid of freedom. What better way to \n     hurt them than with the subversive idea of freedom? Spread \n     freedom. The flag in Dallas was burned to protest the \n     nomination of Ronald Reagan, and he told us how to spread the \n     idea of freedom when he said that we should turn America into \n     ``a city shining on a hill, a light to all nations.'' Don't \n     be afraid of freedom, it is the best weapon we have.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for the patriotism \nand the passion which so many of my fellow veterans bring to the effort \nto protect the flag of our country. Many of them are my friends, and it \nis never easy to disagree with friends on issues of conscience and \nemotion. While, obviously, out of approximately 250 million Americans \nthere are a few miscreants, as Gen. Colin Powell says, who might choose \nto desecrate the flag, the vast majority of Americans know better.\n  Americans rightfully love the Stars and Stripes for all it \nsymbolizes, for all the history, the glory, the promise, and the \npossibilities that are carried within its four corners. As most \nAmericans, I feel the long honor roll of battles won and lost when I \nsee Old Glory marched in for the presentation of colors. I feel \nunbridled pride watching her ripple in the breeze when we join together \nto sing the national anthem. I feel the cloak of patriotism draped over \nthe coffin of a veteran to whom we bid farewell. Our flag is a stunning \nsymbol of all that has made us who we are.\n  In the end, it is a symbol. It is not who we are. Who we are is \nembodied in the rights and obligations in the Constitution itself. A \ndesecrated flag is replaceable. Desecrated rights are lost forever to \nthose who experience the loss. What makes the United States different \nand, in many ways, stronger than any other nation is our aspiration for \ntolerance and diversity. Thanks to our Constitution, we are the leading \nproponent on the face of this planet for the greatest experiment in \nfreedom that is set forth in words and in practice.\n  At the close of our national anthem, we sing, ``land of the free and \nhome of the brave.'' Were this amendment to pass, make no mistake about \nit, we would certainly be a little less free and a lot less brave.\n  In the final analysis, there are eight powerful reasons for anyone, \nbut I think particularly for a veteran, to vote against this \nconstitutional retreat. They are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, \nChina, Cuba, Syria, and Sudan. These are the nations of the world that \nhave laws banning flag desecration. They used to be joined by the South \nAfrica of apartheid and Nazi Germany.\n  I ask my fellow Senators: Is that what we want to do with the freedom \nof the United States of America? Is this in keeping with all that our \ngreat Stars and Stripes stands for? Is this for what soldiers fought \nand died, so we could join this list of discredited, dictatorial \nregimes?\n  Does the United States of America, in response to an occasional act \nof defiance, ignorance, stupidity, and insolence, want to tremble and, \nfor the first time in an extraordinary 224 years\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\nof challenges, alter the Constitution to diminish someone's right to be \nstupid?\n  Our flag is stronger than any of those individual acts will ever be, \nquite simply because our country is bigger and stronger than any of \nthose acts, and our country is bigger and stronger because of our \nConstitution and particularly the Bill of Rights.\n  This vote is not a test of patriotism because patriotism is, after \nall, love of country and loyal support of one's country. Our country is \ndefined by the rights we protect, and my oath as a Senator is to defend \nthe Constitution which defines those rights. That is how I will vote, \nand that is how I think my colleagues should vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont has 3 minutes. The \nSenator from Utah has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I applaud the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts for his statement as a decorated war veteran. He does not \nhave to prove his courage or his commitment to our country or our \nsymbols. He has already done that. He has done that in combat, and he \nhas done it to honor himself but also the country.\n  Everybody is talking about when we will come to this vote and whether \nwe should cut off debate. That will be a nonissue. I urge all Senators \nto vote for cloture.\n  I also point out that if this is so important--we are going to set \naside all kinds of time today to do other things--we ought to spend \ntime on this. We are talking about amending the Constitution, and we \nare talking about amending the Bill of Rights, contrary to what has \nbeen said on this floor, to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time \nin our 200-year history. I hope we will not do it.\n  There has been reference to one of our first flags, a flag that was \ndesigned in my State of Vermont and flew in battles there. I have that \nsame flag in my office. As we all know, any flag, once used by the \nUnited States, can be used as a legitimate symbol of our country. I \nchose to fly the flag in Vermont.\n  Like all Vermonters, I revere the symbol. Every day when I am home in \nVermont, that flag flies bravely and safely because nobody would touch \nit. Nobody would seek to destroy it. Nobody would burn the flag that \nflies in my front yard. We revere it and we praise it, not because we \nare required by law to do so, but because we want to as Americans, as \nVermonters.\n  Every town hall in Vermont flies the American flag. Every one of our \npublic meetings shows the Vermont flag. But I point out to all \nSenators, that one of the first flags of the country came from the \nState of Vermont. I will also tell you, Vermont is the only State in \nthe Union that has not asked for a constitutional amendment on burning \nthe flag. Why? Because we Vermonters do not need to be told by law or \nConstitution that we should show respect for the symbols of our \ncountry. We do it because we want to. We do not do it because the law \nrequires us.\n  We are not like Cuba or China or Libya or Iraq or Iran or those \ncountries that require a law to make people respect their flags and \ntheir symbols. We do it from our heart and from our sense of \npatriotism. That is the way most Americans are. We do not need a law to \ntell us to be patriotic.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate finally began the debate on S.J. \nRes. 14, the proposal to amendment the First Amendment of the \nConstitution to cut back on political protest and expression for the \nfirst time in our history. Earlier this week, on Monday and Tuesday \nmorning, the debate was focused on the Hollings amendment and the \nMcConnell amendment in accordance with the Senate agreement governing \nthis matter.\n  Only Senator Hatch and I spoke for any length of time at all on the \nunderlying proposed amendment on Tuesday morning. The debate then \nresumed after the votes on Tuesday afternoon. By my estimate, the \nSenate has spent less than 3 hours debating the proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  Rather than continue that debate and conclude it, the majority is \ninsisting that we now divert ourselves with an unnecessary cloture \nvote. The interruption of debate for this vote is unfortunate. I have \nsaid to the Republican manager from the outset that I did not believe \nthe debate would be extended unnecessarily, but that I wanted to ensure \nthat Senators had their rights protected so that any Senator who wished \nto be heard on this proposal to amend the Constitution, could be heard.\n  On Monday, the Senate heard from Senators McConnell, Bennett, Dorgan, \nConrad, Hollings, Smith and Sessions. Yesterday, thoughtful statements \nwere made by Senators Feingold, Durbin, Wellstone, Kennedy, Kerrey, \nRobb and Moynihan articulating a number of reasons for opposing the \namendment. In addition, the Senate heard from Senators Hatch and \nFeinstein in favor of the amendment. Today, I expect to hear from \nSenators Byrd, Daschle, Kerry, Feingold, Chafee and perhaps others.\n  At the outset we were confronted by a demand that we agree to limit \nstatements in opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment to a \ntotal of 2 hours. Amending the Constitution is a serious matter, \nentitled to more time than the Senate spends on ceremonial resolutions. \nTwo hours seemed unnecessarily restrictive.\n  Had we so limited the debate we may not have had the benefit of the \nextraordinary moments on the Senate floor last night when Senator Bob \nKerrey, who was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his valor \nin Vietnam, spoke to us from his heart about our country, our values \nand our flag. We may not have heard a riveting address from Senator \nCharles Robb, himself a Marine highly-decorated for his service in \nVietnam, in which he demonstrated his strength and consistency as one \nwho fights for the Constitution and the values that make this country \ngreat.\n  We may have missed the opportunity to hear from Senator Daniel \nPatrick Moynihan, a veteran of World War II, and the most knowledgeable \nof Senators, whom we will sorely miss when he retires at the end of \nthis Congress after his extraordinary service to this nation. I urge \nthose who were not here to experience that debate to read their \nthoughts and wise counsel.\n  I have every expectation that we could conclude the debate today in \nan orderly fashion. I know of no Senator who has threatened a \nfilibuster on this matter. I know of no Senator who intends to engage \nin dilatory tactics. I know of no Senator who intends to offer any \nadditional amendments or series of amendments. I know of no Senator who \nis using the rules of the Senate to delay the final vote on this \nmatter. Accordingly, I know of no reason for the Republican leadership \nto have filed this petition for cloture and know of no reason for them \nto persist in insisting on this cloture vote this morning.\n  The Republican majority's timing of this debate has been strange for \na long time. Last Congress, there was a half-hearted attempt to have \nthe Senate consider the proposed constitutional amendment toward the \nend of a session when the majority knew that Senator Glenn was \nnecessarily absent in connection with his NASA mission. Last year there \nwas a rush to report the proposed constitutional amendment from the \nJudiciary Committee in April and then no effort to consider it before \nthe full Senate. Indeed, while the matter was voted out of the \nCommittee on April 29, 1999, the Committee Report was not filed until \n11 months later. The Republican leadership took almost a year to decide \nto turn to the matter, then filed a cloture petition on the first day \nof debate and now insists on a vote on cloture after just 3 hours of \ndebate on the merits of the proposed constitutional amendment.\n\n  In fact, this cloture vote and our debate on it only diverts us from \nfinishing the debate on the merits of the proposed constitutional \namendment. This cloture petition and vote say more about the lack of \nseriousness of the Republican leadership with regard to this debate \nthan anything else.\n  I have no doubt that the Senate will invoke cloture this morning. I \nalso have no doubt that this hour would have been better spent debating \nthe merits of the proposal.\n  Does the Senate know what we will do after cloture is invoked this \nmorning? Lest anyone think that we will be staying on the proposed \nconstitutional amendment to conclude debate and proceed to vote on the \nmerits, let me\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\ndisabuse them of any such notion. No, following the cloture vote, the \nSenate is scheduled to proceed to two hours of unrelated debate and the \nintroduction of other matter in morning business.\n  We will not be resuming debate on the proposed constitutional \namendment until at least 12:30 this afternoon. At that time many of us \nin the Senate leadership are scheduled to be meeting with the President \nof Egypt. So this closing debate on the amendment will take place later \nthis afternoon and possibly into this evening.\n  Just as the Bill of Rights serves to protect the minority in the \ncountry and the First Amendment protects even unpopular speech, so it \nis the role of the minority manager to protect the rights of those who \nwish to be heard in opposition to a Senate proposal. The rules of the \nSenate accord us at least that right. I know of at least five Senators \nwho still wish to be heard in opposition to the amendment. As the \nminority manager of the bill, I am seeking to accommodate them and then \nto proceed to the final vote. I fully expect that we will reach the \nappropriate time for the vote long before the 30 hours of post-cloture \ndebate would be consumed. I look forward to cooperating with the \nDemocratic leader, the majority leader, and the Republican manager of \nthe proposed constitutional amendment to bring this matter to \nconclusion at the earliest appropriate time after the completion of \ndebate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been interested in these arguments \nbecause, if I recall it correctly, the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts has said that basically America is different from the \nlong list of repressive regimes or dictatorial regimes--from Cuba, to \nNorth Korea, to Nazi Germany--because we do not have a law prohibiting \nflag desecration.\n  But until 1989, we had State laws, in nearly all of the States, \nprohibiting flag desecration. If I recall it correctly, I believe the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts is saying we should not have a \nState law protecting the flag. If I recall it correctly, he voted for \nthe flag statute to protect the flag back in 1989, and just yesterday \nvoted for the McConnell amendment which would have done the same thing.\n  Now look, there is a certain ``elitism'' around here in this country \nthat literally is saying: We are above having to protect the flag of \nthe United States. If somebody defecates on it or urinates on it, we do \nnot want to give them any publicity for that.\n  It is kind of the ``high society'' approach to things. If you want to \nbe a member of the ``high society'' group, then don't do the \n``unintellectual'' thing to protect our flag. That is what is getting \nme about this.\n  We had, for 200 years, in 48 States, anti-flag-desecration statutes \nthat protected the flag. These very people who are saying we cannot do \nthis in a constitutional amendment, to give the Congress the power, the \ncoequal right, to protect our flag, and ignore the Supreme Court, that \nis wrong in these 5-4 decisions, these two decisions--they said we \ncannot do this in this constitutional amendment--yet many of them voted \nfor an anti-flag-desecration statute back in 1989, and yesterday many \nof them voted for the McConnell amendment.\n  Until the Supreme Court struck down these 48 States' statutes in \n1990, we had a Federal statute protecting the flag. I cannot believe \nthe distinguished Senator from Massachusetts was arguing that in those \ndays, when we had flag protection statutes in the States and the \nFederal Government, we were like Nazi Germany or Cuba or North Korea or \nIran or Iraq. That is something that really bothers me.\n  I look at those marines risking their lives in raising the flag on \nIwo Jima. They revered that flag, just as we do today. Eighty percent \nof the people in this country revere this flag--in fact, I hope \neverybody does--and want this constitutional amendment.\n  If we had any sense of proportion, we Members of Congress should want \nto overrule those two Supreme Court decisions. The only way we can do \nit is with a constitutional amendment. In that process, we prove we are \ncoequal to the judicial branch of Government and will protect our flag \nin the process. We will be a better Nation for it.\n  If we do it, we will create a debate on morals and values around this \ncountry in all 50 States that, sadly, is lacking at this particular \ntime. We will, for once in our lives, stand up and say to our children, \nthere are some values and some symbols--at least one symbol in our \ncountry that is extremely important to us, and that happens to be this \nflag of the United States of America.\n  I think there are very sincere people on the other side of this \nissue. I do not mean to malign them. But I have to say, I get \nparticularly upset when I hear these arguments, as I have heard this \nmorning, when, in fact, they vote for statutes that would protect the \nflag, the very thing they are arguing against. It seems a little \ninconsistent to me.\n\n  All we are saying is, give the Congress the power to do this, and \nthen we will enact a statute for which they voted.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of \nletters and other statements pertaining to this amendment be printed in \nthe Record at a cost of $1,300.00.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 22, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As you prepare for the introduction of \n     the flag protection amendment in the United States Senate, on \n     behalf of the Citizens Flag Alliance and our millions of \n     members and supporters, I want\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\n     to again extend our thanks and commend you for the commitment \n     you made, long ago, in support of the right of the people to \n     protect our flag. Thanks to the leadership of you and Senator \n     Max Cleland we are very close to victory.\n       Of all the horrors of combat, none is greater than the \n     loneliness. In death and near death experiences, the warrior \n     is ultimately alone with his fears and hopes. In their \n     loneliness, soldiers look to symbols for comfort--a letter, a \n     photo, a holy medal, a lock of hair. And they look to the \n     greatest conqueror of fear, the greatest symbol of hope, the \n     constant companion of our warriors and their supreme \n     inspiration--Old Glory. No other symbol, nothing, says \n     better, ``you are not alone.''\n       For many veterans much of what they have, their very \n     dignity, is based on their service and sacrifice under that \n     flag. It was the defining moment of their life. An attack on \n     Old Glory is an attack on their dignity. These great men and \n     women know how important speech is in a democracy, many have \n     died for it. What they do not understand is that defecating \n     on our flag is ``speech.'' And neither did the author of the \n     Bill of Rights, James Madison and his colleague, Thomas \n     Jefferson. Both denounced flag burning.\n       Abraham Lincoln warned, ``Don't interfere with anything in \n     the Constitution. That must be maintained, for it is the only \n     safeguard of our liberties.'' It is not the colored cloth \n     that is at the core of the flag amendment debate, it is our \n     sacred Constitution. All veterans once raised their hand and \n     swore to protect and defend the Constitution. Each of us does \n     the same when we pledge allegiance to the flag. The Supreme \n     Court has interfered with our Constitution and we have an \n     obligation to correct their error. The flag amendment does \n     not change the Constitution, it restores it.\n       To those of your colleagues who are yet to join in support \n     of the measure, we hope they would come to recognize as we \n     have, that there are good and learned people on both sides of \n     this issue, as well as varying opinions. There is, however, \n     only one fact and that is that the people of America want \n     returned to them the right to protect their flag.\n       In the final analysis this issue is truly about free \n     speech, the right of the people to speak, to be heard and to \n     be heeded.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Patrick H. Brady,\n\n                                          Major General (USA Ret),\n     Chairman of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Citizens Flag Alliance, Inc.,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 22, 1999.\n     Baltimore Sun,\n     Baltimore, MD.\n       To the Editor: This is in response to your editorial on \n     April 10 titled, ``Burning Issue; Constitutional Ban: Flag \n     Desecration Amendment Would Chip Away At Free-Speech \n     Rights.''\n       The scarcity of flag burning has nothing to do with the \n     evil of flag burning. People do not frequently shout, \n     ``fire'' in a crowded theater or burn crosses, but we still \n     should, and do, have laws against these evils. Laws in our \n     society have never been based on frequency but on right and \n     wrong.\n       Flag desecration is conduct not speech. One could make the \n     argument that defacing the Washington Monument or spray \n     painting graffiti on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is a form \n     of ``political demonstration or protest.'' That argument, \n     however, would not hold up in a court of law. And it's wrong \n     to hold that defacing the Flag of the United States is any \n     different.\n       If free speech is to truly flourish, we must protect the \n     bond that unites us, including the substantive parameters of \n     the right of free expression. We must strengthen the bonds \n     that hold us together, and so make it possible to engage in \n     robust disagreement with each other. Protecting the flag lays \n     the foundation for this objective.\n       The great strength of our democratic system is that we have \n     the ability to determine the laws that govern our society. \n     Our forefathers had the insight to create a document that \n     allowed for WE THE PEOPLE to determine the future of our \n     country. As George Washington admitted, ``The Constitution is \n     an imperfect document made more perfect by the amendment \n     process.'' Apparently the editors mistrust the good judgment \n     of the American people. And George Washington.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marty Justis,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Citizens Flag Alliance, Inc.,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 23, 1999.\n     Washington Post,\n     Letters to the Editor,\n     Washington, DC.\n       To the Editor: The Clinton Administration apparently was \n     miffed at the thought of a Justice Department official being \n     upstaged by a Harvard Law Professor and a Medal of Honor \n     Recipient (``In The Loop,'' April 21).\n       On Tuesday, April 20 I was seated in the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee hearing room, flanked by five Medal of Honor \n     Recipients from World War II and Korea. All were awarded our \n     nation's highest award for valor. In most cases, the Medal of \n     Honor is presented to its recipient by the President of the \n     United States of America in the name of Congress. So it is \n     ironic that the Administration would consider it \n     ``inappropriate'' to testify on the same panel as our \n     nation's Recipients.\n       But the irony does not stop there. At the same time our \n     President is sending men and women into Kosova to serve under \n     the flag, our Administration is testifying against protecting \n     the very same symbol that will drape the coffins of those \n     whose final earthly embrace will be in the folds of Old \n     Glory. If our flag is not deserving of protection, then it is \n     not worthy to be draped on the coffins of our dead soldiers.\n       Several months ago, the fate of our President resided in \n     the hands of Congress. But the American people ultimately had \n     the final voice in the debate. Polls show that the American \n     people consistently and overwhelmingly want to see their flag \n     protected. If polling figures saved the President, then they \n     can save our flag. Ultimately, the American people will \n     decide this issue. That is justice even the Justice \n     Department cannot ignore.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Daniel S. Wheeler,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Grand Lodge, Benevolent and\n\n\n                                     Protective Order of Elks,\n\n                                     Gainesville, FL, May 4, 1999.\n     Senator Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: It was a pleasure meeting you last week \n     just prior to the start of the hearing on the Flag Amendment. \n     You were most kind to make time in your busy schedule to \n     speak with me. As the National President of the Elks, I can \n     tell you that our million plus membership is fiercely \n     patriotic and hard at work seeking the passage of an \n     Amendment which would prohibit the desecration of our beloved \n     American Flag. In our Order's Ritual we refer to the flag as \n     follows:\n\n       ``This is the flag of our Country, the emblem of freedom \n     and the symbol of unity. As Americans and patriots we first \n     place it beside our Altar. And as the American Flag typifies \n     the glory of our nation we have adopted it as emblematic of \n     the cardinal principle of our Order--Charity.''\n\n       Please know that the Elks are among your greatest \n     supporters. We admire your even temperament and your \n     outstanding leadership and take comfort in knowing men of \n     your caliber are at the reins of our government.\n       Thank you and God bless you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               C. Valentine Bates,\n     Grand Exalted Ruler.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Knights of Columbus,\n\n                                    New Haven, CT, March 16, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: As Supreme Knight of the Knights of \n     Columbus, with approximately one million members--plus our \n     families--in the United States, and one of the 137 member \n     organizations of the Citizens Flag Alliance, Inc., I ask you \n     to support the Hatch Flag Protection Constitutional \n     Amendment. I urge you to follow the wisdom of the American \n     people who, in poll after poll, have indicated strong support \n     for protection of ``The Stars and Stripes.''\n       This issue is not about freedom of speech, nor is it about \n     protecting a piece of colored cloth. It is about the American \n     people reclaiming the right to protect their flag. This is a \n     right we enjoyed for 200 years prior to the 1989 Supreme \n     Court decision in Texas v. Johnson.\n       Nearly eveyone agrees that desecration of the flag is \n     wrong, but the lesson it teaches our children is worse. \n     Therefore, when you consider your vote, I ask that you think \n     about not just America's flag, but America's young people. \n     The support you give to this issue will determine the legacy \n     we leave for our children--a nation of respect and pride in \n     country, or a society void of responsibility and moral \n     compass.\n       With best wishes, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Virgil C. Dechant,\n     Supreme Knight.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Fraternal Order of Police,\n\n\n                                 National Legislative Program,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 13, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing this letter on behalf of \n     the more than 277,000 members of the Grand Lodge, Fraternal \n     Order of Police to advise you of the strong support of S.J. \n     Res. 14, which would amend the Constitution to give Congress \n     to power to prohibit the physical desecration of our nation's \n     flag.\n       Attempts by the Congress to protect the flag statutorily \n     have failed to withstand judicial review. The Supreme Court \n     has, in two narrow 5-4 decisions, overturned statutes \n     prohibiting physical desecration of the flag. Amending the \n     Constitution is the only way to return to the American people \n     the right to protect their flag.\n       Flag burning is not free speech; it is an act of \n     vandalism--a hate crime, pure and simple. What is the \n     difference in the political statement made by a vandal \n     torching the American flag and a terrorist who makes his \n     political statement by blowing up government buildings? Quite \n     simply, there is no difference. The American people recognize \n     that, and Congress ought to recognize it by passing this \n     amendment.\n       When we bury a hero, a brother or sister from the ranks of \n     our military or our police\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\n     departments, a flag is draped over the coffin. It is folded \n     solemnly and presented to the surviving members of the family \n     in remembrance of the one who gave his or her life. Whether a \n     soldier fighting a foreign enemy on a foreign shore, or a \n     police officer killed in the line of duty--the sacrifice of \n     each is symbolized by the flag. To desecrate this symbol is \n     to dishonor that sacrifice. To use freedom or liberty as a \n     shield to commit a crime is no more than base cynicism and a \n     very real miscomprehension of the American concept of \n     liberty.\n       I salute you, Mr. Chairman, for your sponsorship of Senate \n     Joint Resolution 14, and join you in urging all members of \n     the United States Senate to protect our flag from those who \n     would dishonor our nation and its heroes.\n       If we can be of any further assistance to you in moving \n     this bill forward, please do not hesitate to contact me or \n     Executive Director Jim Pasco at my Washington office, (202) \n     547-8189.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gilbert Gallegos,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                            Washington Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of the 4 million members of \n     the American Legion family, I want to personally thank you \n     for sponsoring S.J. Res. 14, the Flag Protection \n     Constitutional Amendment. We truly realize how important \n     passage of this amendment is to the future of our children. \n     It is imperative that we return to the American people the \n     right to protect the U.S. Flag. I can assure you that \n     Legionnaires and their families will do everything possible \n     throughout our great nation to assist you in getting S.J. \n     Res. 14 passed this year.\n       The majority of Americans support this amendment. Polling \n     during the past 10 years has consistently shown nearly 80 \n     percent of voters believe protecting the U.S. Flag through a \n     constitutional amendment is the right thing to do. They do \n     not believe such protection is a threat to freedom of speech.\n       I am certain you were as touched as I in reading the \n     reports of our stealth pilot rescued from Yugoslavia. He \n     carried an American flag, folded under his flight suit. The \n     flag was given to him by an airman before he took off from \n     Aviano Air Base in Italy. Following his rescue the pilot told \n     reporters, ``For me, it (the flag) was representative of all \n     the people who I knew were praying. It was a piece of \n     everyone and very comforting. It helped me not go of hope. \n     Hope gives you strength * * * it gives you endurance.''\n       My heart also swelled with pride when I saw an Associated \n     Press photo of a flyer from the 31st Air Expeditionary Wing \n     at Aviano waving an American flag to boost morale as U.S. war \n     planes prepared to launch another series of strikes in \n     support of NATO's Operation ALLIED FORCE.\n       The U.S. Flag is a powerful symbol. A living symbol of our \n     great nation. Providing a special place in the U.S. \n     Constitution that protects our flag is what Americans want \n     and deserve.\n       I stand ready to assist you in any way that will help \n     assure passage of this amendment. I know that your \n     encouragement of your fellow Senators will make the crucial \n     difference.\n       Thank you again for your sponsorship of S.J. Res. 14.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       Harold L. ``Butch'' Miller,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Air Force Sergeants Association,\n\n                                 Temple Hills, MD, April 14, 1999.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I respectfully request that you permit \n     consideration of and introduction into the record the \n     attached statement concerning Flag Protection. The statements \n     reflects the position of the 150,000 members of this \n     association which represents active and retired enlisted \n     members of the active and reserve components of the United \n     States Air Force.\n       The statement would coincide with the hearing scheduled \n     before your committee for April 20, 1999, concerning the same \n     project. Thank you for the opportunity to share the concerns \n     of our members with your committee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James D. Staton,\n                                               Executive Director.\n       Attachment.\n\n   Statement by James D. Staton, Chief Master Sergeant, USAF (Ret.), \n          Executive Director, Air Force Sergeants Association\n\n       Mr. Chairman and distinguished committee members, numerous \n     polls in recent times have shown that over 80 percent of the \n     American people say that they should have the right to decide \n     the question of flag protection through the constitutional \n     amendment process. In fact, all but one state have passed \n     memorializing resolutions asking Congress to send the flag \n     protection amendment question to the states. Senate Joint \n     Resolution 14 would give the American people the opportunity \n     they desire to protect their flag through law. S.J. Res. 14 \n     would send to the people a very simple article: ``The \n     Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.'' The 150,000 \n     members of the Air Force Sergeants Association urge you to \n     support this resolution. AFSA represents the millions of \n     active duty and retired enlisted Air Force, Air Force \n     Reserve, and Air National Guard members and their families. \n     These Americans, perhaps more than any others, have a vested \n     interest in that they put their lives on the line under the \n     banner of this sacred symbol of greatness and sovereignty.\n       All members of the 106th Congress should support this \n     resolution in order to put this important decision in the \n     hands of the people. If the congressional representatives \n     truly represent the will of the people, there should be no \n     delay in acting upon the wishes of the people by allowing \n     them to rule on this question. The personal feelings and \n     opinions of elected representatives on this issue should be \n     subordinated to opinions held by those to whom the elected \n     officials are responsible--those who own the process. Our \n     members have strongly communicated their concern over the \n     need to protect the flag and, at the same time, to have a \n     role in deciding the laws governing that protection.\n       For enlisted military members, whose work is characterized \n     by dedicated sacrifice, the flag is a reminder of why they \n     serve. For those stationed overseas, it is a symbol of \n     America, seen every day. For all military members, the flag \n     represents the principles for which they are prepared to \n     sacrifice. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens once \n     wrote:\n\n       ``A country's flag is a symbol of more than nationhood and \n     national unity. It also signifies the ideas that characterize \n     the society that has chosen that emblem as well as the \n     special history that has animated the growth and power of \n     those ideas. * * * So, too, the American flag is more than a \n     proud symbol of the courage, the determination, and the gifts \n     of a nation that transformed 13 fledgling colonies into a \n     world power. It is a symbol of freedom, of equal opportunity, \n     of religious tolerance, and of goodwill for other people who \n     share our aspirations.''\n\n       Military members serve so that they can protect this \n     country, putting their lives on the line if necessary, and \n     they revere our nation's most visible symbol--Old Glory. It \n     is the one hallowed symbol all patriots hold sacred. Most \n     importantly, the flag plays a central role in ceremonies that \n     honor those who have fought, suffered and died. They know \n     full well that this very flag may drape their coffins as a \n     result of their unselfish service. Denying protection and, \n     thereby allowing desecration, of this important symbol of \n     sacrifice insults the memories of those who are honored in \n     these ceremonies.\n       The American people, especially those in the military, \n     deserve the opportunity to make the decision if they want to \n     put flag protection into the law. Through their sacrifice and \n     dedication, those who have served have earned your support in \n     giving them the ability to make this decision.\n       Mr. Chairman and committee members, we urge your full \n     support of S.J. Res. 14. Some questions of governance and law \n     are of such importance to a people that they deserve the \n     opportunity to speak directly to those issues. This is one \n     such question. We thank you for this opportunity to present \n     our views on this important matter. As always, AFSA is ready \n     to support you on matters of mutual concern.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              The American Legion,\n\n\n                                        National Headquarters,\n\n                                     Indianapolis, April 23, 1999.\n     Hon.

In every year \n     since, the issue has been debated at every national \n     convention and at every meeting of the National Executive \n     Committee, and a new resolution authorizing continuation of \n     the campaign has been adopted. Each resolution supporting a \n     flag-protection amendment passed unanimously with all Past \n     National Commanders having a right to be heard. Past National \n     Commander Keith Kreul, who, as a PNC and delegate to the \n     National Conventions, has both a voice and a vote in the \n     making of Legion policy, has never publicly uttered a word in \n     opposition.\n       As National Commander, it is my duty, and privilege, to \n     serve a one-year term as the executive head of The American \n     Legion with full power to enforce the provisions of the \n     National Constitution and by-laws as well as the resolutions \n     of the National Convention. And this national commander \n     fervently supports the flag-protection amendment, as do all \n     living Past National Commanders of The American Legion, save \n     one.\n       In honor of their service, I would like to enter into the \n     record the 28 Past National Commanders of The American Legion \n     who have given of themselves for God and Country and who \n     stand with me in their support of an amendment which would \n     return to the American people the right to protect their \n     flag.

At no time, \n     should our flag be destroyed in any manner.\n       During my career, I was fortunate to be involved in many \n     exciting baseball games. Yet, one of the proudest moments \n     occurred in 1976 when Rick Monday saved the American flag \n     from being burned by a pair of protestors at Dodger Stadium. \n     This act was one of the most recognizable moments of the \n     Bicentennial Celebration and remains one of the great moments \n     in stadium history.\n       I tell this story to every patriotic group whenever the \n     subject of the American flag arises. Therefore, I lend my \n     full support to the SJR-14, The Hatch-Cleland Flag Protection \n     Constitutional Amendment, which will protect and defend our \n     flag as it was designed by the framers of the Constitution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tommy Lasorda,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Salon National La Boutique,\n\n                                   Washington, UT, March 13, 1999.\n     To: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n\n       Gentlemen: I am writing as the National Chapeau of the \n     Eight and Forty a subsidiary organization of the American \n     Legion Auxiliary, consisting of 17,144 Partners (members). We \n     are asking that when the measure to pass a constitutional \n     amendment to protect our flag comes before you that you \n     unanimously approve the bill.\n       I have just recently had the opportunity to help judge \n     girls who are in their Junior year of High School to attend \n     the American Legion Auxiliary Girls State. One of the \n     questions we asked each applicant was how they felt regarding \n     a bill to protect our flag and each and every girl said she \n     felt that there should be a law protecting our flag from \n     desecration.\n       So for both the young people of our country and the older \n     people who have fought to protect our country, we of the \n     Eight and Forty ask you to support this bill.\n       Yours in Service to our Country,\n                                                   Wanda S.

Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: The Noncommissioned Officers \n     Association of the USA (NCOA) has joined with the Citizens \n     Flag Alliance (CFA) to support the efforts of many in \n     Congress to pass a Flag protection amendment. NCOA's 148,000 \n     members are solidly committed to the passage of Flag \n     protection legislation and have placed the issue among their \n     very highest legislative priorities. In this regard NCOA is \n     delighted with the recent introduction of S.J. Res. 14 in the \n     U.S. Senate.\n       On behalf of NCOA's noncommissioned and petty officer \n     members, I fully expect the members of Senate Judiciary \n     Committee to approve legislation and pave the way for the \n     matter of Flag protection to be brought to the Senate floor \n     for vote in an expeditious manner. NCOA urges your support of \n     S.J. Res. 14.\n       In closing allow me to reiterate the importance of this \n     matter to NCOA members and their families. The will never \n     give up on this issue and look to you to support their \n     desires to see Flag protection legislation passed during the \n     1st Session of the 106th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Roger W. Putnam,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Retired Officers Association,\n\n                                   Alexandria, VA, March 23, 2000.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: On behalf of The Retired Officers \n     Association, I am writing to urge you to cosponsor and vote \n     for final passage of S.J. Res. 14, ``Proposing an amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States authorizing Congress \n     to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the \n     United States.''\n       The fundamental principle in supporting the Resolution is \n     that it will allow the people to exercise their will. This is \n     a very important distinction. We do not believe it's \n     appropriate that a minority in Congress, in this case 34 \n     Senators, should have the power to keep this important \n     decision from being considered by the people. Consistent with \n     the democratic principles that have governed this country for \n     more than two centuries, the Flag Amendment restores the \n     decision on flag desecration to the people and if ratified by \n     38 states, flag desecration could be prohibited.\n       That's a second important distinction. The proposed \n     amendment will not change the Constitution to prohibit flag \n     desecration. It would authorize Congress to pass a law \n     prohibiting physical desecration of the flag and as is the \n     case with any law, it would be subject to Presidential veto. \n     This language is a change from the 104th Congress when the \n     resolution said Congress, or the states, may pass laws \n     prohibiting flag desecration. That could have led to 50 \n     different laws resulting in consistent standards of respect \n     for the flag.\n       Based on the foregoing, I urge you to vote for passage of \n     S.J. Res. 14 to return control of the flag to the people \n     where it resided for more than 200 years before the United \n     States Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that flag desecration was \n     essentially freedom of speech.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael A. Nelson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2000.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: We appreciate your efforts in bringing \n     S.J. Res. 14 through the Senate Judiciary Committee and to \n     the Senate floor. We recognize the importance of this \n     important legislation to protect the flag of the United \n     States.\n       Many people are concerned that such an amendment would \n     limit our prized right of free speech. However, the right of \n     free speech is not an absolute right. The Supreme Court \n     unanimously ruled in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. \n     568 (1942):\n       ``Allowing the broadest scope to the language and purpose \n     of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is well understood that the \n     right of free speech is not absolute at all times and under \n     all circumstances. There are certain well-defined and \n     narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and \n     punishment of which have never been thought to raise any \n     Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, \n     the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or `fighting' \n     words--those which by their very utterance inflict injury or \n     tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been \n     well observed that such utterances are no essential part of \n     any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value \n     as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from \n     them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order \n     and morality.''\n       Burning the Nation's flag is anything but a necessary part \n     of a political speech or exposition of ideas. It seems that \n     little can be gained by burning or spitting on a flag which \n     could not be accomplished through words, signs, newspapers, \n     rallies, buttons, bullhorns, or petitions. The act of burning \n     the nation's flag by its very nature antagonizes and incites \n     violent reaction. It is conduct, not speech.\n       This amendment authorizes legislative bodies to prohibit \n     physical desecration with regard to one object, and one \n     object only, our nation's flag. We can protect this one \n     unique object from physical desecration without damaging our \n     freedom of speech in any way.\n       In the words of Chief Justice Rehnquist, ``The American \n     flag . . . throughout more than 200 years of our history, has \n     come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\n     does not represent the views of any particular political \n     party, and it does not represent any particular political \n     philosophy. The flag is not simply another ``idea'' or \n     ``point of view'' competing for recognition in the \n     marketplace of ideas.'' Let us act now to protect the symbol \n     of our nation's liberty and freedom.\n           Sincerely,\n     James V. Hansen.\n     Chris Cannon.\n     Merrill J. Cook.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   George W.

One is to use our military power wisely, \n     remembering the costs of war. The other is to remember our \n     soldiers who have paid those costs.\n       The American Legion helps us to carry out those \n     obligations. You defend and recall America's history of \n     sacrifice. You stand as a friend to the families of our \n     fallen soldiers. You serve America's communities in countless \n     ways--an example of true service in a comfortable age.\n       One of the most enduring symbols of your sacrifice and \n     service is our nation's flag. Brave Americans have fought and \n     died to protect the ideals of democracy that it represents. \n     That is why I strongly support a constitutional amendment \n     protecting the flag from desecration--to honor our courageous \n     veterans and to send the unmistakable message that Old Glory \n     is a sacred symbol of freedom to all Americans.\n       I believe our government should honor our commitments to \n     our veterans as you have honored yours.\n       Laura joins me in sending our best wishes to each and every \n     one of you.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W.

Res. 14), which I understand \n     may come before the Senate for a vote in the near future. \n     Like you, I regard legal protections for our flag as an \n     absolute necessity and a matter of critical importance to our \n     nation. The American flag, far from a mere symbol or a piece \n     of cloth, is an embodiment of our hopes, freedoms and unity. \n     The flag is our national identity.\n       I am honored to have commanded our troops in the Persian \n     Gulf War and humbled by the bravery, sacrifice and ``love of \n     country'' so many great Americans exhibited in that conflict. \n     These men and women fought and died for the freedoms \n     contained in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and for \n     the flag that represents these freedoms, and their service \n     and valor are worthy of our eternal respect. Most of these \n     great heroes share my view that there is no threat to any \n     right or freedom in protecting the flag for which they \n     fought. Perhaps as much as any American, they embrace the \n     right to free speech. Indeed, they risked death to protect \n     it.\n       I do see a very real threat in the defilement of our flag. \n     We are a diverse people, living in a complicated, fragmented \n     society. And I believe we are imperiled by a growing cynicism \n     toward certain traditions that bind us, particularly service \n     to our nation. The flag remains the single, preeminent \n     connection among all Americans. It represents our basic \n     commitment to each other and to our country. Legally \n     sanctioned flag desecration can only serve to further \n     undermine this national unity and identity that must be \n     preserved.\n       I am proud to lend my voice to those of a vast majority of \n     Americans who support returning legal protections for the \n     flag. This is an effort inspired by our nation's history and \n     our common traditions and understanding, under which, until a \n     very recent and controversial Supreme Court decision, the \n     American flag was afforded legal protection from acts of \n     desecration. The flag protection constitutional amendment is \n     the only means of returning to the people the right to \n     protect their flag, and your leadership will undoubtedly help \n     to ensure the success of this important campaign.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            H. Norman Schwarzkopf,\n     General, U.S. Army, Retired.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Citizens Flag Alliance, Inc.,\n\n                                 Indianapolis, IN, April 22, 1999.\n     USA Today,\n     Arlington, VA.\n       To the Editor: To say that to, ``ban flag burning gains \n     ground by hiding risks,'' (``Don't Amend Bill Of Rights,'' \n     editorial, April 21, 1999) hides the truth. You also hide the \n     truth by saying the First Amendment has never been amended. \n     The truth is Americans had the right to protect their flag \n     from our birth until 1989 when the Supreme Court amended the \n     First Amendment by calling flag burning ``speech.'' What were \n     the risks? You denigrate the ``political opportunists who \n     want to rewrite the wisdom of James Madison.'' Those \n     political opportunists are the vast majority of the American \n     people, and James Madison agrees with them. He denounced flag \n     burning, as did another founding father, Thomas Jefferson.\n       This issue has nothing to do with ``feel-good politics.'' \n     Flag burning is wrong but what it teaches our children about \n     respect, about our values, about who owns the Constitution \n     and the demeaning of the will of the majority, is worse.\n       The majority of Americans understand the importance of free \n     speech; many have died for it. What they do not understand is \n     that defecating on the flag is ``speech.'' The only majority \n     in America who feel good about the freedom to burn the \n     American flag are the media and 5 out of 9 judges on the \n     Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady,\n\n                                                  U.S. Army, Ret.,\n     Chairman of the Board.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 26, 1999.\n     St. Louis Post Dispatch,\n     Attention: Letters to the Editor,\n     Reached via fax: (314) 340-3139.\n       Dear Editor: The recent editorial, ``Desecrating the \n     Constitution'' (April 21), is a clear example of the complete \n     disregard by a slim minority of the media to follow the good \n     judgement of the American people.\n       The editors of the Post Dispatch should undertake a more \n     studied analysis of the flag amendment before jumping to \n     conclusions. The first line of the editorial reads, ``Our \n     nation has made it through 208 years without amending the \n     First Amendment.'' The U.S. Flag, which predates the \n     Constitution, was protected under our nation's law and \n     traditions for 200 years. A razor thin, five-Justice majority \n     of the Supreme Court wrested this right from the American \n     people in 1989 when they invalidated flag-protection laws in \n     48 states and the District of Columbia.\n       This tradition and precedent has been recognized by \n     Justices on five previous Supreme Courts. In fact, Justice \n     Hugo Black, perhaps the staunchest defender of individual \n     rights ever to sit on the Supreme Court, stated, ``It passes \n     my belief that anything in the Federal Constitution bars . . \n     . making the deliberate burning of the American flag an \n     offense.''\n       In every sense, an amendment to return to the American \n     people the right to protect their flag would change nothing \n     in the Constitution. Nor would it infringe our precious First \n     Amendment rights. On the contrary, it would restore the \n     Constitution and the First Amendment to a time-honored \n     interpretation and understanding that existed for all but the \n     last ten years of our history.\n       The editors mention an invisible ``slippery slope'' if a \n     flag-protection amendment passes. Over 10,000 amendments have \n     been proposed and only twenty-seven have been ratified--the \n     first ten are the Bill of Rights. If there is any ``slope'' \n     in amending the Constitution, it is a steep incline.\n       Finally, for the record, burning a cross on anyone's lawn \n     is a hate crime punishable under law. Burning a flag is a \n     hate crime against all Americans and should also be \n     punishable under law.\n       If our flag is not deserving of protection, then it is not \n     worthy to be draped on the coffins of our dead soldiers. \n     Senator Ashcroft understands the intrinsic value of the flag. \n     Unfortunately, its meaning is lost on the editors of the \n     Post-Dispatch.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Joseph J.

GENERAL RULE OF VALIDITY.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--With respect to any contract, agreement, \n     or record entered into or provided in, or affecting, \n     interstate or foreign commerce, notwithstanding any statute, \n     regulation, or other rule of law, the legal effect, validity, \n     or enforceability of such contract, agreement, or record \n     shall not be denied--\n       (1) on the ground that the contract, agreement, or record \n     is not in writing if the contract, agreement, or record is an \n     electronic record; or\n       (2) on the ground that the contract, agreement, or record \n     is not signed or is not affirmed by a signature if the \n     contract, agreement, or\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\n     record is signed or affirmed by an electronic signature.\n       (b) Autonomy of Parties in Commerce.--\n       (1) In general.--With respect to any contract, agreement, \n     or record entered into or provided in, or affecting, \n     interstate or foreign commerce--\n       (A) the parties to such contract, agreement, or record may \n     establish procedures or requirements regarding the use and \n     acceptance of electronic records and electronic signatures \n     acceptable to such parties;\n       (B) the legal effect, validity, or enforceability of such \n     contract, agreement, or record shall not be denied because of \n     the type or method of electronic record or electronic \n     signature selected by the parties in establishing such \n     procedures or requirements; and\n       (C) nothing in this section requires any party to use or \n     accept electronic records or electronic signatures.\n       (2) Consent to electronic records.--Notwithstanding \n     subsection (a) and paragraph (1) of this subsection--\n       (A) if a statute, regulation, or other rule of law requires \n     that a record be provided or made available to a consumer in \n     writing, that requirement shall be satisfied by an electronic \n     record if--\n       (i) the consumer has affirmatively consented, by means of a \n     consent that is conspicuous and visually separate from other \n     terms, to the provision or availability (whichever is \n     required) of such record (or identified groups of records \n     that include such record) as an electronic record, and has \n     not withdrawn such consent;\n       (ii) prior to consenting, the consumer is provided with a \n     statement of the hardware and software requirements for \n     access to and retention of electronic records; and\n       (iii) the consumer affirmatively acknowledges, by means of \n     an acknowledgement that is conspicuous and visually separate \n     from other terms, that--\n\n       (I) the consumer has an obligation to notify the provider \n     of electronic records of any change in the consumer's \n     electronic mail address or other location to which the \n     electronic records may be provided; and\n       (II) if the consumer withdraws consent, the consumer has \n     the obligation to notify the provider to notify the provider \n     of electronic records of the electronic mail address or other \n     location to which the records may be provided; and\n\n       (B) the record is capable of review, retention, and \n     printing by the recipient if accessed using the hardware and \n     software specified in the statement under subparagraph \n     (A)(ii) at the time of the consumer's consent; and\n       (C) if such statute, regulation, or other rule of law \n     requires that a record be retained, that requirement shall be \n     satisfied if such record complies with the requirements of \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (c)(1).\n       (c) Retention of Contracts, Agreements, and Records.--\n       (1) Accuracy and accessibility.--If a statute, regulation, \n     or other rule of law requires that a contract, agreement, or \n     record be in writing or be retained, that requirement is met \n     by retaining an electronic record of the information in the \n     contract, agreement, or record that--\n       (A) accurately reflects the information set forth in the \n     contract, agreement, or record after it was first generated \n     in its final form as an electronic record; and\n       (B) remains accessible, for the period required by such \n     statute, regulation, or rule of law, for later reference, \n     transmission, and printing.\n       (2) Exception.--A requirement to retain a contract, \n     agreement, or record in accordance with paragraph (1) does \n     not apply to any information whose sole purpose is to enable \n     the contract, agreement, or record to be sent, communicated, \n     or received.\n       (3) Originals.--If a statute, regulation, or other rule of \n     law requires a contract, agreement, or record to be provided, \n     available, or retained in its original form, or provides \n     consequences if the contract, agreement, or record is not \n     provided, available, or retained in its original form, that \n     statute, regulation, or rule of law is satisfied by an \n     electronic record that complies with paragraph (1).\n       (4) Checks.--If a statute, regulation, or other rule of law \n     requires the retention of a check, that requirement is \n     satisfied by retention of an electronic record of all the \n     information on the front and back of the check in accordance \n     with paragraph (1).\n       (d) Ability to Contest Signatures and Charges.--Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed to limit or otherwise affect \n     the rights of any person to assert that an electronic \n     signature is a forgery, is used without authority, or \n     otherwise is invalid for reasons that would invalidate the \n     effect of a signature in written form. The use or acceptance \n     of an electronic record or electronic signature by a consumer \n     shall not constitute a waiver of any substantive protections \n     afforded consumers under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.\n       (e) Scope.--This Act is intended to clarify the legal \n     status of electronic records and electronic signatures in the \n     context of writing and signing requirements imposed by law. \n     Nothing in this Act affects the content or timing of any \n     disclosure required to be provided to any consumer under any \n     statute, regulation, or other rule of law.\n\n     SEC. 102. AUTHORITY TO ALTER OR SUPERSEDE GENERAL RULE.\n\n       (a) Procedure To Alter or Supersede.--Except as provided in \n     subsection (b), a State statute, regulation, or other rule of \n     law may modify, limit, or supersede the provisions of section \n     101 if such statute, regulation, or rule of law--\n       (1)(A) constitutes an enactment or adoption of the Uniform \n     Electronic Transactions Act as reported to the State \n     legislatures by the National Conference of Commissioners on \n     Uniform State Laws; or\n       (B) specifies the alternative procedures or requirements \n     for the use or acceptance (or both) of electronic records or \n     electronic signatures to establish the legal effect, \n     validity, or enforceability of contracts, agreements, or \n     records; and\n       (2) if enacted or adopted after the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, makes specific reference to this Act.\n       (b) Limitations on Alteration or Supersession.--A State \n     statute, regulation, or other rule of law (including an \n     insurance statute, regulation, or other rule of law), \n     regardless of its date of the enactment or adoption, that \n     modifies, limits, or supersedes section 101 shall not be \n     effective to the extent that such statute, regulation, or \n     rule--\n       (1) discriminates in favor of or against a specific \n     technology, process, or technique of creating, storing, \n     generating, receiving, communicating, or authenticating \n     electronic records or electronic signatures;\n       (2) discriminates in favor of or against a specific type or \n     size of entity engaged in the business of facilitating the \n     use of electronic records or electronic signatures;\n       (3) is based on procedures or requirements that are not \n     specific or that are not publicly available; or\n       (4) is otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this \n     title.\n       (c) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (b), a State \n     may, by statute, regulation, or rule of law enacted or \n     adopted after the date of the enactment of this Act, require \n     specific notices to be provided or made available in writing \n     if such notices are necessary for the protection of the \n     public health or safety of consumers.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letter, signed by 45 members of the Democratic Caucus, be \nprinted in the Record. Moreover, I would like to thank my colleagues, \nSenator Sarbanes, ranking member of the Banking Committee, and Senator \nLeahy, ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for their assistance \nin the preparation for the conference on S. 761, the digital signature \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2000.\n     Members of the Conference Committee on Electronic Signature \n       Legislation United States Congress.\n       Dear Conferee: We are writing to express our strong support \n     for legislation that will ensure the electronic marketplace \n     functions effectively for both businesses and consumers. We \n     all supported S. 761, the ``Millennium Digital Commerce \n     Act,'' as it passed the Senate on November 19, 1999. As that \n     bill proceeds to conference, we continue to believe that it \n     is important to remove unintended barriers to electronic \n     commerce. We must provide certainty regarding the legality of \n     electronic transactions which spur economic growth and \n     provide many benefits to consumers.\n       We also want to ensure that any new law would provide \n     consumer protections equivalent to those currently required \n     for paper transactions, and would not facilitate predatory or \n     unlawful practices. The electronic world should be no less \n     safe for American consumers than the paper world.\n       According to a recent Commerce Department report entitled \n     Falling Through the Net, more than 70 percent of American \n     households do not have access to the Internet. In enacting \n     legislation to facilitate electronic commerce, we must ensure \n     that we do not widen the ``digital divide,'' to the \n     disadvantage of the majority of Americans.\n       We must ensure that consumer protections established over \n     several decades are not inadvertently made ineffective by the \n     transition to electronic transactions. We believe that the \n     legislation produced by your conference committee must \n     incorporate the following principles in order for us to \n     support it:\n       Ensure effective consumer consent to the replacement of \n     paper notices with electronic notices.\n       Ensure that electronic records are accurate, and relevant \n     parties can retain and access them.\n       Enhance legal certainty for electronic signatures and \n     records and avoid unnecessary litigation by authorizing \n     regulators to provide interpretive guidance.\n       Avoid unintended consequences in areas outside the scope of \n     the bill by providing clear federal regulatory authority for \n     records not covered by the bill's ``consumer'' provisions.\n       Avoid facilitating predatory or unlawful practices.\n       Attached is a more detailed description of these \n     principles.\n       The conference committee has the opportunity to write the \n     ground rules for the transition of our economy from paper-\n     based transactions to electronic transactions. This \n     transition offers great potential benefits for both business \n     and consumers, but must be done in a way that preserves basic \n     consumer protections and ensures the confidentiality and \n     security of such transactions.\n           Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, Paul Sarbanes, Tom Daschle, Chris Dodd, \n           Max Cleland, John Edwards, Harry Reid, Daniel K.

Byrd.\n\n     Basic Consumer Protection Principles for Electronic Signature \n                              Legislation\n\n       1. Ensure Effective Consumer Consent to the Replacement of \n     Paper Notices with Electronic Notices.\n       The final bill must include effective consumer consent \n     provisions that provide the following protections:\n       Consumer consent must involve a demonstration that a \n     consumer will actually have the capacity to receive and read \n     electronic notices.\n       Consumers must be notified of their rights, including any \n     right to receive notices on paper, a description of the types \n     of records covered, and their right to revert to paper \n     records (or clear explanation that the option will not be \n     available because of the purely on-line nature of the \n     business).\n       Consumer consent must be reconfirmed if a change in \n     technology by business results in a material risk that a \n     consumer will be unable to receive electronic records.\n       Consumers must be ensured that electronic delivery of \n     notices will have substantially equivalent reliability as \n     paper delivery.\n       Consumer privacy must be protected by requiring that the \n     provider of the electronic record shall take reasonable steps \n     to ensure confidentiality and security.\n       2. Ensure that Electronic Records are Accurate, and That \n     Relevant Parties Can Access and Retain Them.\n       The legislation must require that, in order to meet record \n     delivery and retention requirements under existing consumer \n     protection laws, businesses must take reasonable precautions \n     to preserve the accuracy and integrity of electronic records. \n     In addition, all parties entitled to a copy of a notice or \n     disclosure by law or regulation should be able to access and \n     retain an accurate copy of that record for later reference \n     and settlement of disputes.\n       3. Enhance Legal Certainty for Electronic Signatures and \n     Records.\n       The legislation must provide clear interpretive authority \n     to the regulatory agencies responsible for implementing the \n     statutes modified by the legislation. Failure to provide such \n     authority will create significant business uncertainty about \n     the requirements for compliance with the law, which in turn \n     might lead to litigation. Agencies may also be unable to stop \n     abusive practices and preserve consumer confidence in on-line \n     transactions without such authority. This authority would not \n     give agencies the ability to override any of the bill's \n     requirements, only to clarify how they apply in specific \n     circumstances.\n       4. Avoid Unintended Consequences in Areas Outside the Scope \n     of the Bill.\n       The legislation must provide clear federal regulatory \n     authority for records not covered by the bill's consumer \n     provisions, including authority to exempt requirements from \n     the bill's provisions if necessary. The broad scope of the \n     legislation may have unintended consequences for laws and \n     regulations governing ``records'' outside its intended focus \n     on business-to-consumer and business-to-business \n     transactions. For example, the bill could affect rules on the \n     posting of workplace safety notices. Protections must be \n     provided against such unintended consequences of the \n     legislation.\n       5. Avoid Facilitating Predatory or Unlawful Practices.\n       The legislation must provide adequate protection against \n     predatory or unlawful practices.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have worked out their problems and enabled the \nSenate, at last, to appoint conferees on S. 761. I co-authored S. 761 \nas it passed the Senate, and I look forward to working as a conferee to \nensure that the final conference report respects the principles that \nthis body endorsed when it passed that legislation by unanimous consent \nlast year. The letter to conferees dated March 28, 2000, signed by all \n45 Democratic Senators, reminds us of those principles.\n  I am only one conferee among 17 but working with the other 6 \nDemocratic Senate conferees and the 10 Republican Senate conferees. I \nwill endeavor to encourage electronic commerce with balance, fairness, \nand due regard for consumer protection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to voice my deep \nconcern over the developing situation in Miami involving this young \nboy, Elian Gonzalez.\n  I do not rise today to make legal or policy arguments regarding the \nevents that have transpired thus far, although I have strongly held \nviews on those matters. Rather, I rise to implore--yes, implore--the \nJustice Department and the Clinton Administration to exercise restraint \nin how they proceed.\n  For reasons I fail to understand, this Administration yesterday \nsignificantly ratcheted up the stakes in this matter, and unnecessarily \nturned this into a crisis situation by threatening to involuntarily and \nforcibly remove this\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\nboy from the place he calls home and to forcibly remove him from the \nfamily that has cared and sheltered him for four months.\n  And why? The Justice Department had previously indicated a \nwillingness to allow the Miami family to pursue its legal avenues in \nfederal court. This family is appealing the recent decision of the \ndistrict court. That is not news, and should hardly come as a surprise \nto the Department. In fact, it is my understanding that the family has \nagreed to the Justice Department's request to try and expedite the \nappeal.\n  So why has the Administration manufactured this crisis and issued \nthese threats and ultimatums? Why make these threats regarding this \narbitrary, self-created and self-imposed deadline of Thursday morning \nat 9:00 a.m.?\n  I know that my colleagues have different views on the matter of \nwhether Elian Gonzalez should be returned to Cuba or allowed to stay in \nour country. But I do not stand before you today to debate that matter.\n  Rather, I would hope we could all join in calling upon the Department \nof Justice and the Clinton Administration to calm down, exercise \nrestraint, and stop acting to increase the tension of this delicate \nsituation unnecessarily through arbitrary deadlines or threats of \nforce.\n  I fail to see how these threats serve any useful purpose. Hasn't this \nyoung boy been through enough? Why does this Administration need to \nforcibly remove him from his home while the appeal process continues to \nrun? Has Elian become an enemy of the United States of America? If not, \nwhy is the Administration treating him like a dangerous drug lord or a \nmass murderer?\n  Again, I implore this Justice Department and this Administration to \ncalm down and exercise restraint. We need to find a way to diffuse this \nsituation, not to further inflame it. And, we need to act in accordance \nwith the values of our country--restraint, respect for law, and common \nsense. We should not be led to extremes merely to appease a foreign \ngovernment. We will be fair and deliberate. But, we should not engage \nin ridiculous, overwrought measures. After all, this is not Cuba. This \nis the United States of America, and we have a young boy here. He ought \nto be treated with dignity and with respect by a government that does \nnot act as a bully with no restraint whatsoever.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1847-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1847-S1849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nmarriage tax penalty. We are trying not so much to give a tax cut to \nmarried couples but to make a tax correction. It is not the business of \nGovernment to say that when you are married your taxes should be \nhigher. The Tax Code should be blind.\n  It should be fair to all. Any single person making $35,000 a year \nmarrying someone making $35,000 a year should not automatically go into \na higher tax bracket. In fact, under today's Tax Code, that is exactly \nwhat happens. It is one of the most egregious oversights of our tax \nsystem that we must address.\n  It is estimated that 21 million married couples pay a marriage \npenalty; about 48 percent of people in this country who are married pay \na penalty for being married. The question is, What can we do to correct \nthat inequity? This is not just a tax cut. It is a tax correction.\n  Yesterday, Senator Roth revealed his plan that will go to the Finance \nCommittee for markup, hopefully, tomorrow. It is a very solid \nbeginning. His plan, first and foremost, does something that will \naffect every single married couple: It doubles the standard deduction.\n  Today, the standard deduction is $7,350 for a married couple. It is \n$4,400 for singles. One would think a married couple would get $8,800. \nThat is not the case. They get $7,350. Regardless of the tax bracket, \nthere is a marriage tax penalty from the standard deduction. Senator \nRoth's bill doubles the standard deduction next year.\n  Second, the bill starts with the lowest tax bracket, the 15-percent \nbracket. Over a 6-year period, starting in 2000, that bracket will be \ndoubled for married couples. This is an $8,650 increase that allows \npeople to continue paying in the 15-percent level for $8,650 more. \nBasically, that means if someone today is making up to $43,000 as a \nmarried couple, they are in the 15-percent bracket. We raise that to \n$52,500. As a married couple making about $26,000 a year, they will \nstay in the 15-percent bracket and will not have that penalty.\n  It is important for people to know that everyone pays up to the \n$52,000 in the 15-percent bracket. Even if you go up to the 28-percent \nbracket or the 36-percent bracket, you will also get that 15-percent \nbracket relief.\n  It was my hope to double the 28-percent bracket, as well, because \nthis is where most people get hit the hardest. A policeman who marries \na schoolteacher gets hit in that 28-percent bracket. They are making \napproximately $30,000 each. They would not be fully covered under the \nbill that will go to markup.\n  There will be opportunities to increase that bracket to 28 percent, \nwhich is what we hope to do. We want to go up to about $120,000 in \njoint income to do away with that penalty for married couples. We will \ntake the 28-percent bracket up to about $126,000. A 28-percent tax \nbracket is almost a third of what a person makes, so with salaries of \n$40,000 or $50,000, it is a pretty big hit, especially if you have \nchildren and are trying to do the extras for their education.\n  We have the 15-percent bracket doubling, starting in 2000. We want to \nmake that 28 percent, but even if we can do the 15 percent, it is \ncertainly a step in the right direction, saying to people they should \nnot be penalized because they chose to get married. The penalty is not \nsmall. The average is about $1,400 more that people pay. If they are \nmaking $28,000 a year or $40,000 a year and have to pay $1,400 more in \ntaxes, that is a lot of money, money that could be saved for the first \ndownpayment on a house. It is money that could be put on car payments, \nmortgage payments, or a family vacation.\n  This is the time in people's lives when they need the money the most, \nwhen they are a young couple, just beginning. They do not have a nest \negg yet. To tax them $1,400 more a year is a heavy penalty. There is no \nreason for it. We should not make the choice for people that if they \nget married they must pay more taxes.\n  The alternative minimum tax is also reformed in Senator Roth's plan. \nThe alternative minimum tax is a tax that is levied on people. An \nalternative minimum tax is levied perhaps because too much of their \nincome is tax free. This has begun to hit more and more people.\n  The alternative minimum tax has begun to hit people who make $75,000 \na year as married couples. This keeps them from having the $500-per-\nchild tax credit fully given; it keeps them from getting the Hope \nscholarship money fully given; it keeps them from having an adoption \ncredit fully given. It takes away the value of those credits.\n  We say to people: You get a $500-per-child tax credit because we want \nyou to have more of the money you earn, but if you make over $75,000 a \nyear, we will take part of that credit away. We want to make those \ntypes of tax credits, the nonrefundable tax credits, whole for people, \nregardless of where they are in the system. We don't want the marriage \ntax penalty to encroach on that, as well. We are trying to exempt those \nnonrefundable tax credits from the AMT.\n  We also increase the earned-income tax credit for low-income couples, \nso if a person chooses to go to work and get off welfare, which is what \nwe are encouraging them to do, we don't want to punish them by taking \naway their earned-income tax credit.\n  It is ironic that today we say to a married couple: You will pay more \nin taxes than if you had stayed single. We have a higher tax burden in \nour country today in peacetime than any time since World War II. We are \ntrying to take away some of that tax burden on hard-working Americans. \nWe find with many couples that both work because the tax burden is so \nhigh. They are trying to do extra things for their children. In order \nto meet all of their needs and the extra requirements they have for \ngiving their children a good education, they are having to go to work. \nThat second income is penalizing that spouse who decides to leave the \nhome and go into the workplace.\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\n  This is wrong. It is time to end this unfair part of our Tax Code. We \nstarted trying to correct this inequity 3 years ago. We sent President \nClinton a bill that had marriage tax penalty relief in it and the \nPresident vetoed that bill.\n  It is very important that President Clinton look carefully at this \nparticular bill. It hits people at the lower and middle-income level. \nThe President has said he is for income tax relief for middle-income \npeople. He has said that in public statements. But, in fact, he has \nvetoed the marriage tax penalty relief we have sent him.\n  I hope this is going to be a clean bill. I hope it will be a bill \nthat is not amended with extraneous amendments that are not marriage \ntax penalty amendments. If we can send that clean bill, then I think \nthe President will have some explaining to do if he does not sign it to \ngive this relief to hard-working American couples.\n  We are about 20 days away from having to file the income taxes for \n1999. April 15 is the day. April 15 is Saturday, so we get a reprieve \nuntil April 17. But when people are filling out their income tax \nreturns in the next few weeks, I hope they will think of this marriage \npenalty that most people are paying in this country. I hope they will \nrealize Congress is trying to give people relief. Congress is trying to \ndouble the standard deduction, so when you are filling out your form in \nthe next 20 days, realize if you are married, your standard deduction \nis $7,350. Under our plan it would be $8,800 that would be totally \nexempt from taxation.\n  Furthermore, we would give you about $8,000 more over the next 6 \nyears in the 15-percent bracket. So whereas today you would start going \ninto that 28-percent bracket at $43,000, we are going to give you up to \n$52,000 over a 6-year period with the bill that is going into the \nFinance Committee tomorrow. We are hoping we can even expand that to \nthe 28-percent bracket so more people will pay at the lower bracket \nlevels. This will help every single tax-paying American who is married \nand paying this penalty.\n  I hope very much the President of the United States is listening. I \nhope we can pass this clean marriage penalty bill through the Senate. \nWe have a good start in the House bill. We have a good start from the \nSenate Finance Committee mark. I hope we can even make it better. With \na relatively small addition, I think we can. I think we can go from the \n15-percent to the 28-percent bracket--doubling. That will give \nsignificant relief to the most taxpayers in this country. Most people \npay in the 15- and 28-percent brackets. That is where I think we need \nthe relief.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with us on this marriage penalty relief. \nI urge the President to listen to the hard-working people of this \ncountry who are saying: We need relief, and most of all, we need \nfairness in our tax system. It is not fair to tax people because they \nare married.\n  I see my colleague from Georgia is on the floor. My colleague from \nGeorgia has been one of the early cosponsors of this marriage tax \npenalty relief. He has been a stalwart defender of fairness in our Tax \nCode and fairness in our tax system. I appreciate that he is here and I \nyield the floor to the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Georgia, Mr. Coverdell, or his designee, is recognized to \nspeak for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: It is my \nunderstanding the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Kansas had a \nperiod of approximately 30 minutes before the 30 minutes that was \nassigned to me. At the moment, I will be speaking on that time, if \nthere is any of that time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Then, if I might, with that clarification, at the \nconclusion of my remarks and the remarks of the Senator from Texas or \nothers on marriage penalty, then I will begin to implement the 30 \nminutes that was assigned to me.\n  Mr. President, first I thank the Senator from Texas for her \nperseverance in pursuing relief of the marriage tax penalty on so many \nmillions of Americans. I have several general comments to make about \nthis proposal at this time. Again, before she gets away, I thank the \nSenator from Texas for the drumbeat by which she has continued to \npursue this issue because it is an exceedingly important policy issue. \nThat is the first point I want to make.\n  The fact we would have ever come to the point in the United States, \ngiven all the problems we have been talking about over these last \nseveral years of destabilization in our society, that we would punish \npeople for creating families is unconscionable public policy. It is \nalmost unbelievable it could have ever come to this point. So, as a \nmatter of sound, intelligent, appropriate public policy, there should \nnot be a penalty for people creating families. We should be \nencouraging, not discouraging, that. We should be making available to \nthose families as many resources as possible to carry out the building \nof America upon which we have always relied. It is that family that we \nhave depended upon to get America up in the morning, to get it to \nschool and to work, to house it, to provide for the health needs and \neducation of the country.\n  The dreams of America are in the hands of these families. To punish \nthem, to financially punish them, as I said a moment ago, is absolutely \nunconscionable public policy. It raises all kinds of questions about \nwhat kind of thinking goes on in this Capital City, for Heaven's sake. \nThe punishment is not insignificant--about $1,400 a year on average. \nStart thinking of the things that would do: The home computers, tutors, \na new mortgage, transportation. The average American family's \ndisposable income, that which is left after the Government marches \nthrough their checking account and takes over half of it --in our \nState, that family is probably making about $45,000 to $50,000. By the \ntime you take that down by half--then think of all the things they have \nto do to raise America, to take care of America--we have not left \nenough there to get the job done. No wonder we see so many problems in \nour society.\n  If you were to put a graph behind me from 1950 to 1990 and show what \nthe Federal Government was taking out of that checking account in 1950, \nand then what it is taking out in 1990, you would faint. If you put up \na graph of every other problem--SAT scores, teenage suicide rates, you \nname it--as that graph went up, as we took more and more resources away \nfrom those families, bad things start to happen in our country. So \nthere is nothing more important than making a statement that we are not \ngoing to punish families and we are going to take steps to leave more \nvalue, more of what they work for in their checking accounts so they \ncan do what they need to do for America.\n  If every little family can take care of itself, the country is in \ngreat shape. Conversely, if we make it difficult for these families to \nget the job done, the country starts to wobble a bit. It has gotten \nright close to wobbling.\n  The other point I want to make is this: If we are going to talk about \neliminating the marriage tax penalty, then we ought to be bold about it \nand serious about it. This proposal that is coming from the Finance \nCommittee, and for which the Senator from Texas has fought, is just \nthat.\n  The President has used the name but no substance--the name, the sound \nbite--but it is not getting the job done. Clearly, if we are going to \ngo before the country and say we are going to eliminate the marriage \ntax penalty, it ought to virtually get the job done.\n  The proposal sponsored by the Senator from Texas, and which is likely \nto come out of the Finance Committee, will do that. The President's \nproposal does not.\n  I hope this ultimately passes the Senate, that we work out any \ndifferences with the House, and it goes to the President's desk and he \nacknowledges that a marriage tax penalty is a bad thing, it is bad \npolicy.\n  I have one other comment to make about this before I yield back the \nremainder of the time to the Senator from Texas. I have not heard \nanybody refer to this, but this proposal is across-the-board tax \nrelief. Why is that? Because it takes the bottom tax bracket where \npeople pay 15 percent and increases substantially the amount of income \nany family can earn and only be taxed on that income at 15 percent. \nEvery taxpayer will receive tax relief because they all pay 15 percent \non the\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nfirst bracket. The first bracket is being enlarged. Everybody will \nbenefit.\n  Admittedly, by focusing on these earlier tax brackets, the amount of \nrelief, while the same for everybody, is more meaningful to middle-\nincome families and lower-income families. This $1,500 is the \ndifference between, as I said, the house or not, the car or not, proper \neducation or not. For some of our wealthier citizens, it will not have \nthat great an impact. They would make a different kind of decision \nabout it. It is fair because it is across the board and it affects the \nentire 15-percent tax bracket. That is good. I want to see us do more \nof this where we are lowering the tax rates for all taxpayers.\n  One of the things about which I have been most encouraged, because \nAmericans pay vastly different percentages of income taxes--it has \nactually gotten to a very negative separation of our citizens. About 50 \npercent pay very few taxes, and the top 5 or 10 percent pay inordinate \ntaxes. That can lead into all kinds of problems.\n  The good thing is, the American people, our culture, demand fairness. \nThey really do. One can ask any American in our country, no matter the \nwalk of life, their gender, or their racial background: What is a fair \ntax? It is always about the same. It doesn't matter where they come \nfrom or what their economic status is. They will say it should be about \n25 percent. It should not be 50. Americans are essentially fair, and \nthat is good. That gives us the ground upon which to correct some of \nthese onerous bad policies that are in the Tax Code. This is one of \nthem. This is the right thing to do, as I said the other day, and it is \nthe right time to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \ntime remaining on my 30 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for his \nremarks. He laid out the fairness question very well. I thank him for \nthe leadership he has provided in trying to give tax relief to hard-\nworking American families on several fronts. Of course, he was the \nleader helping people give their children extra education benefits. \nUnfortunately, that bill was vetoed last year by the President, and \nhopefully, having passed it again this year, the President will give \nthat area of tax help to the hard-working families who want to send \ntheir children to college or who want to buy a computer for their child \nin elementary school. That has been led by Senator Coverdell.\n  Certainly, Senator Coverdell is now helping lead the effort on \nreduction of the marriage penalty tax because, of all the Tax Code \ninequities, this is the biggest. It affects the most people. It is the \nbiggest tax cut that should be given. It is a fairness question.\n  If one is a policeman and making $30,000 a year and marries a \nschoolteacher, why should they pay $1,400 more in taxes just because \nthey get married? There was no promotion, no bigger salary but the same \nsalaries, two people, and they got married. They pay $1,400 more a year \nin taxes. It hits the schoolteacher and the policeman the hardest.\n  It is the people making that $25,000 to $35,000 who get hit the \nhardest. Yet that is the couple trying to save to buy a home for their \nfamily or to upgrade a home or to buy the second car or to go on a \nfamily vacation. This is money that should not be spent by the Federal \nGovernment; it is money that should be spent by the people who earn it. \nThat is the question today.\n  We are going to continue to debate the issue of the marriage penalty \ntax, and we will be testing people to see what their priorities are. \nWhy would we continue to have this inequity in the Tax Code when we can \nfix it? We can fix it, and we are going to have the opportunity to do \nthat the week people are beginning to pay their taxes. We are going to \ntake this bill up the week of April 10, so that when people are filling \nout their tax forms, they can look at that standard deduction and say: \nMy goodness, I am a married person and my standard deduction is $7,350 \nand it should be $8,800. If the bill that will be before the Senate on \nApril 10 is passed, it will be $8,800 next year, and this year will be \nthe last year that a married couple has to pay more taxes because of \nthe standard deduction inequity.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I thank the Senator from Georgia. \nI urge my colleagues to look at this issue. Let's focus on doing away \nwith this inequity as soon as we possibly can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. It is my understanding, then, that there are 30 \nminutes now under the control of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1849-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1849-S1851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, before I left the Foreign Relations \nCommittee very recently and going to the Finance Committee, I was \nchairman of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere. I will address \nthe Senate this morning with regard to those responsibilities and to \nour hemisphere. I will suggest that we must reinvigorate our \npartnerships in this hemisphere as we begin a new century. If we work \nto nurture the political and the economic relationships among the \nnations of the Western Hemisphere, I am convinced that the next century \nwill be the century of the Americas--a time of unparalleled peace and \nprosperity.\n  The reason for my remarks, however, is that there are threats, \nserious threats, to the stability of the democracies in our hemisphere. \nWe need to confront them together--neighbor helping neighbor.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion recently on deciding what \nevent adequately defines the last century. Some would say victory over \nHitler in World War II, or the fall of the Berlin Wall, the first man \nto walk on the Moon, or the invention of computers. You would make a \ngood case for each one of these.\n  But I believe the history of the 20th century cannot be defined by \none of these singularly remarkable achievements. The greatest \ndevelopment was not an event at all but a slow and steady march over \ntime. For me, it was the spread of democracy around the world, a \nmovement in which the United States played a leading role.\n  Consider the following: According to the Freedom House, of the 192 \nsovereign states in existence today, 119 are considered true \ndemocracies. In 1950, a date I referred to in the earlier debate, only \n22 countries were democracies--22; today there are 119. This means that \nnearly 100 nations have made this incredible transition over this last \nhalf century. I witnessed much of this great transformation as Director \nof the U.S. Peace Corps under President Bush. Nowhere did I see more \ndramatic change than in our own backyard.\n  In 1981, 18 of the 33 nations in the hemisphere were under \nauthoritarian rule. By the beginning of the 1990s, all but one--Cuba--\nhad freely elected heads of state. It was the springtime of democracy.\n  In the new century ahead, we must nurture and protect this freedom \naround the world but with great attention on our own hemisphere. Our \nwelfare is inextricably tied to that of our neighbors in the region. We \nshare common geography, history, and culture. Together we possess \nunbound potential for regional economic prosperity.\n  To harness this potential, we must continue to extend political and \neconomic freedom to the entire hemisphere. The stakes are very high. If \nwe are successful, I am confident the 21st century will be remembered, \nas I said, as the century of the Americas. But if we neglect our \nresponsibilities, we could realistically witness a balkanization of \nLatin America and a stagnation in our own economy.\n  The task is daunting, and becoming more so by the day. Freedom in the \nhemisphere remains fragile and uncertain.\n  Under the Clinton administration, we have failed to respond to the \nnew challenges facing the region--allowing emerging threats to fester \nin places such as Colombia, Haiti, and Panama. As a result, some of the \nhard-fought victories for freedom in Latin America are weakened and in \njeopardy.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  Let me take a minute or two to focus on three core components of \nhealth in the Western Hemisphere. I mentioned a moment ago that there \nare serious threats to these new democracies. I also mentioned there is \nenormous potential in the hemisphere.\n  If you took the whole Western Hemisphere combined, it is the largest \nconsumer base in the world. There is enormous potential here. Most \npeople do not realize that trade in this hemisphere today is already \nlarger than all of our trade in Europe, almost double our trade with \nthe European Union. Trade in this hemisphere is significantly larger \nthan our trade with the Pacific rim. If you were to ask most Americans, \nthey would undoubtedly say our greatest trading partner would be \nEurope. It is third. The Western Hemisphere is first; the Pacific rim \nis second; and a long way back is the European Union.\n  That tells me where we have to be highly focused in the context of \nthe health of the hemisphere. As I said, in the early 1990s, we could \nlook across this area and see all these new democracies. But as we look \ntoday, after about 9 years of this wonderful achievement, there are \nsome pretty serious issues on which we need to be focused, and we are \nnot.\n  You see, for democracy to be successful, it has to be more than just \nan election of a head of state. For democracy to be successful, it has \nto have a sound judiciary; in other words, a way for disputes to be \nresolved peacefully and civilly.\n  This is incredibly important to trade and to relations between the \ncountries. I will give you an example. Who is going to make an \ninvestment in a country for which there is no appropriate judiciary to \nresolve differences? Not many because you have put it at too high a \nrisk. Investment does not go to high risk; it runs from it. Investment \ngoes to security; it seeks it. In too many of our new democracies, we \nhave not focused on helping build an appropriate judiciary.\n\n  Law enforcement: In many of these new countries, law enforcement had \npreviously been the responsibility of the military. In Nicaragua, \nHonduras, many of these countries, in Guatemala, it was the military \nthat established order. As we all know, that can be without due \nprocess. It can be orderly, but you better not cross it. You better not \nhave a disagreement. In other words, you have a condition in which \ncitizens or guests are not safe or could be threatened. Whenever that \nhappens, you have a deterioration of economic mobility and stability. \nInvestments move away from those kinds of situations, not to them.\n  Substantial progress has been made in each of the countries I \nmentioned to move to a civil form of law enforcement, but this is a \ndaunting task. Look at Haiti today; with the investment that has been \nmade, which is approaching $3 billion, and an attempt by the United \nNations to train a civil law enforcement--not a military, a civil law \nenforcement--it just does not exist. Do we really believe there is a \njudicial process that would allow an investor to come in and put a \nhigh-stake investment in the country and if there were a dispute of \nsome form between the government and that country or between two \nparties or a native Haitian and a foreign investor that there would be \na competent, capable way for that dispute to be resolved? No. \nTherefore, the investments don't flow. When the investments don't flow, \nyou have a deteriorating economy. When you have a deteriorating \neconomy, then you begin to destabilize everything you have talked about \nin terms of democracies. They begin to wobble; they can disappear.\n  Today we have a President of one of the more significant countries of \nLatin America, Peru, who is flouting the constitution. The constitution \nsays a President, as in the United States, may be elected President for \ntwo terms. That is not enough for Fujimori; he wants three. Push the \nconstitution to the side; push freedom of the press to the side; ignore \nthe fundamentals of fair elections. Does that remind you of democracy? \nDoes that suggest that the institutions of democracy--constitutional \nlaw, civil law enforcement, a fair and sound judiciary--are in order? \nYou would be hard-pressed to answer that question yes.\n  Venezuela has a new popular President who has essentially moved \neverything to the side and who shaped the government in his own view. \nThe question is still out there, but those are not very encouraging \nsigns. They are worrisome. Where is that all going to lead? Does that \nmake people who believe in constitutional law, civil authority, \ncomforted? Answer: No, it does not. I want to come back to this point, \nbut we must remember that about 13 percent of our oil energy today \ncomes from Venezuela.\n  Colombia: Colombia is in the middle of a raging war. CNN has not \nfound it. There are more refugees in Colombia than there were in \nKosovo. No one is speculating on the number of dead. It is 35,000 \npeople. And an insurgency driven by narcotics--not ideology, \nnarcotics--controls 30 to 40 percent of the country and is on the \noutskirts of Bogota. We and this administration have been talking about \nthis old traditional republic that has been a great ally, supplying \nover 5 percent of our energy, and we have yet to get the assistance \nthrough this Congress. We have sent Ambassador Pickering, we have sent \nGeneral McCaffrey, legislators, myself and others. We know we have to \nhelp protect that democracy that sits in the middle of Venezuela and \nEcuador and Peru and Panama, the entire Andean region.\n\n  This is a reflection of our inability--and it is not just this \nadministration, as a people--to understand how important our own \nbackyard is. We tend to get focused off someplace else. I am not saying \nthose are not significant priorities, but for Heaven's sake, if it is \nat your back door, you better be paying attention. Bogota is a 3-hour \nflight from Miami.\n  Talking about Mexico and the enormous problems they have had, I \nadmire their leadership. They are struggling. But as President Zedillo \nsaid to me: There is no threat to the security of the Republic of \nMexico that matches the corruption and the intrusion of narcotics. He \nis surrounded by it.\n  So we have Colombia, Mexico, then Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, then \nGeorgia and New York and Chicago, right at the back door. You have to \nopen the door.\n  In Paraguay--knock on wood--constitutional law was protected because \nit was an example of people in the hemisphere paying attention. The \nVice President of the country was assassinated, and it looked as if \nconstitutional law was gone. I have deep memories of this. The people \nof Paraguay overthrew a dictator, Stroessner. I was at the first \ninauguration of a freely elected President. If you had seen the faces \nof these people who had accomplished freedom, everybody ought to go \nthrough that. Everybody should have that opportunity. If you told me at \nthe time that within a handful of years it would come to the point \nwhere their Vice President was assassinated, and it looked as if it was \nall going to collapse, I wouldn't have believed you, but it almost \nhappened.\n  The institutions that make a democracy really be a democracy are not \nin place, and we have lost a lot of time--too much time. The nefarious, \nevil nature of narcotics has intruded the entire hemisphere--all of \nit--and it is marching. Its ultimate goal leaves nothing but ruins \nbehind it. It corrupts the institutions of democratic principle, and it \nis doing it in country after country--in our own backyard.\n  We have been celebrating--and this is my third point--enormous trade \nopportunities. In the nineties, we have experienced it all across the \ncountry, across the hemisphere; it is staggering. It helps build a new \nmiddle class; it brings economic prosperity to people who have never \nenjoyed it. As an example, I can remember years ago, in Guatemala, \nabout all that was being raised was corn and beans for self-sustenance. \nNow, they are truck gardening in fruits, with huge markets for them. \nWho do you see in the fields? You see 18- and 20-year-old young \nGuatemalans with a great job, and you know where that leads because we \nare from America. We know what happens. They start becoming \nindependent. They stop relying on government. They start thinking for \nthemselves. That needs to be nurtured.\n  The trade opportunities are boundless, but we have been knotted up; \nwe have been unable to expand these trade agreements. What is \nhappening? Did you read the newspapers yesterday?\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\n The European Union signed the treaty with Mexico, and Mexico is \nentering into treaties with Mercosur, the southern cone of South \nAmerica, and we are tied up in a knot here. So we are inviting this \nhuge economic base to become the customer of other regions of the world \nbecause we can't seem to get it together.\n  Now, I assume my time is nearing the end.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. My point is that a core component of new democracy in \nthe world occurred right in our hemisphere. There was a marvelous \nachievement--to survive the institutions that make democracy work have \nto be put in place, and we have not done a good job on this. It has \nbeen sporadic, it is destabilizing, and we can see it. We have to only \npick up a newspaper--Peru, Venezuela, Haiti, Colombia, and the list \ngoes on.\n  No. 2, we have an enormous and powerful adversary in the narcotic \ncartels. They don't care about a single child anywhere, they don't care \nabout any human life, and they do not care about any country. They are \nas evil a scourge as the world has ever seen. And they are fueling a \ncriminal syndicate in the United States that is more powerful than \nanything with which we have ever dealt. Undoubtedly, somebody listening \nto this saw Godfather I and Godfather II--amateurs, rank amateurs \ncompared to what we are dealing with. The economic opportunity is \nlimitless, boundless, sitting right in our backyard, as I have said. \nSimply open a door. And we have let it get all frayed; we have not \nstayed attentive.\n  So, as I say, we can get focused in our own home if we can create, I \ncall it a doctrine of the Americas, where all of us as neighbors demand \ncertain standards, that they be upheld, and that constitutional law is \na part of this hemisphere, that civil law enforcement is what we have \ngrown to expect, and a fair judiciary must be in place. The \nConstitution cannot be just thrown across the desk and into a trash \ncan. We all should be together demanding that kind of activity. If we \nwill pay attention to this evil force and respond to it--not simply \ncover our eyes, but respond to it--we can keep it from doing enormous \ndamage not only in the U.S. but across the hemisphere.\n  They are ruining governments. It will leave democracy in shambles. \nMark my word. It must be confronted vigorously. It is a huge threat to \nour security. If we will pay attention to the trade opportunities and \nbe vigorous about it, if we will do these three things, they will call \nthis century the century of the Americas, and all of us will be \nrewarded tenfold in every country, and we will be an enormous force for \nworld peace. Conversely, ignore all of these things and it will breed a \nproblem and a trouble that will haunt us throughout the century.\n  I am for a century of the Americas. I get excited about it. I think \nwe have to, as a nation, make a step forward; we have to be bold and we \nhave to pay attention.\n  Mr. President, I yield back whatever time remains. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee is today \nholding the second in a series of hearings on prescription drugs. It is \nthe 14th hearing on Medicare reform and how we will deal with the \nchallenges facing the Medicare system.\n  I had an opportunity to testify before the Finance Committee as did \nseveral of my colleagues. Both Republicans and Democrats are urging the \nSenate Finance Committee to take steps to provide important our senior \ncitizens relief from the cost of prescription drugs. It is a national \ncrisis. It affects seniors in New England, it affects seniors in the \nSouthwest, it affects seniors all across this Nation. We have a \nresponsibility to our seniors to address the issue this year. It would \nbe inexcusable for us to have an adjournment without addressing the \nprescription drug crisis that is affecting the health, well-being, and \nlivelihood of millions of senior citizens all across this Nation.\n  I want to take just a few moments of time to review exactly where we \nare in this challenge that is facing the Senate of the United States as \nan institution. The Budget Committee is meeting today to make \nrecommendations on the issue of prescription drugs, and the Finance \nCommittee has responsibility in examining why action is so important \nnow.\n  The drug crisis for seniors is reflected in two important ways:\n  One, coverage is going down.\n  Those seniors who currently have drug coverage are seeing it \nevaporate. The costs being paid by those senior citizens with coverage \nare going through the roof.\n  This chart is a clear indication of the situation facing our senior \ncitizens. There are approximately 35 million senior citizens receiving \nMedicare. Twelve million of these seniors have no prescription drug \ncoverage whatsoever. This is almost one third of all senior citizens.\n  Almost another third--11 million--have employer-sponsored coverage \nthrough their former employers. They have coverage.\n  Then we have Medicare HMOs, which cover 3 million seniors; 4 million \nseniors purchase Medigap coverage that includes a limited drug benefit; \n4 million seniors have coverage through Medicaid; and 3 million have \ncoverage through the VA and other means.\n  This chart really tells the story. We have 12 million seniors on \nMedicare with no prescription drug coverage.\n  What about those seniors with employer-sponsored coverage? How \nreliable is that coverage for our senior citizens?\n  Look at this chart. There has been a 25% drop in firms offering \nretiree health coverage between 1994 and 1997, a 3-year period. A \nquarter of all persons receiving employer-sponsored retiree coverage \nhave been dropped.\n  The rather ominous fact is that current coverage is declining in an \neven more dramatic way. More and more firms are unilaterally dropping \nprescription drug coverage from their retiree programs. The number of \nseniors who are in these employer-sponsored programs is going down \ndramatically.\n  Let's look at the 3 million who have coverage through Medicare HMOs. \nThis year alone, more than 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their \nHMO coverage. That is true in the western part of my State. It is true \nin Connecticut, it is true in many parts of New England and it is true \nin many other areas of the country.\n  We know the drug coverage is only an option under HMOs; Medicare HMOs \nare not required to provide drug coverage. Medicare HMOs are leaving \nthe market, and those remaining are drastically reducing the level of \ndrug coverage. Seventy-five percent of all seniors covered through \nMedicare HMOs have limited coverage--capped at less than $1,000 this \nyear. The number of plans with such limited coverage has doubled since \n1998. Thirty-two percent have imposed caps of less than $500, an \nincrease of 50 percent since 1998.\n  On the one hand, many HMOs are dropping coverage. Those maintaining \ncoverage are putting limitations on the dollar amounts they actually \ncover. In the last 2 years, 75 percent have unilaterally declared that \nthey won't provide any coverage in excess of $1,000, and 32 percent \nhave limited coverage to $500.\n  Here we have no coverage.\n  Here we have falling coverage.\n  Here we have collapsing coverage.\n  And now we look at the question of the Medigap.\n  Look at the situation with Medigap. To qualify for Medigap coverage \nthat includes a drug benefit, one must get that coverage at the time \nthey first enroll in Medicare.\n  This chart shows that drug coverage through Medigap is unaffordable. \nThis is the sample premium for a 75-year-old: In Delaware, $2,600; New \nYork, $1,900; in Iowa, $2,000; in Maine, $2,400; Mississippi, $2,400.\n  Individuals have to apply for Medigap plans with drug coverage at the \ntime they first qualify for Medicare; they\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nare effectively closed out from purchasing a Medigap plan that includes \ndrug coverage later.\n  What we are seeing here is an explosion of the Medigap premiums. As a \nresult, protection against the cost of prescription drugs through \nMedigap is also in free fall. The only seniors with reliable drug \ncoverage are the 4 million covered through Medicaid.\n  At the same time we are seeing this very significant decline in \ncoverage, drug costs are growing at double-digit rates. We go from \n1995, 9.7 percent; 10.1 percent in 1996; 14.2 percent in 1997; 15.7 \npercent in 1998; and 16.0 percent in 1999. This is against a background \nof a virtual flat rate of inflation. The inflation rate in 1995 was 2.5 \npercent; 1996, 3.3; 1997, 1.7; 1998, 1.6 and in 1999, 2.7. The \ninflation rate is virtually flat, yet we have seen dramatic increases \nin costs and reduction in coverage for drug benefits.\n  We have a situation where Congress is going to act. We need coverage \nfor all, universal coverage. We must include both basic and \ncatastrophic coverage. We should try to take care of those senior \ncitizens represented in this group here: the 57 percent with incomes \nunder $15,000 plus the 21 percent with incomes between $15,000 and \n$25,000--a total of close to 80 percent of all senior citizens have \nincomes below $25,000. We have to take care of these seniors. I believe \ncoverage ought to be universal. This is what we currently do in both \nMedicare and Social Security.\n  Close to 80 percent of our senior citizens have incomes below $25,000 \na year. This is extraordinary. Almost 60 percent have incomes below \n$15,000. Overall, their incomes are very modest indeed.\n  So coverage is collapsing at the same time costs are exploding. And \nwho is it impacting? It is impacting close to 80 percent of the elderly \npeople in this country with incomes below $25,000.\n  This chart gives an idea of typical patient profiles. These are the \ntypes of ailments that typically affect so many of our seniors: \nOsteoporosis, heart trouble, high blood pressure, enlarged prostate, \narthritis, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease and anemia.\n  Look at the typical cost per year. If 150 percent of poverty is \n$11,985, and we saw on the last chart about 60 percent of our seniors \nhave incomes in that range, look at the outlays these seniors have: 20 \npercent of their entire income, just to cover the of essential drugs \nneeded to treat osteoporosis and heart trouble. The costs only increase \nfor other typical conditions. These are their out-of-pocket \nexpenditures for drugs; this does not even deal with other health-\nrelated needs they might have. It is an extraordinary burden they have.\n  This is why we believe that Medicare drug coverage needs to be \nuniversal. It should cover all of our senior citizens. It should \nprovide basic coverage. It should also reach those with higher drug \ncosts through catastrophic coverage. We know only about 10 percent of \nthe seniors need catastrophic coverage today. But many of our seniors \nare very concerned that they may face catastrophic needs in the future.\n  I am a strong believer that the next century is going to be the life \nscience century, with major breakthroughs in medical treatment. For \nexample, in my State of Massachusetts, if we had a breakthrough in \nAlzheimer's disease, we would empty half of all the nursing home beds. \nThe savings would be astronomical. The cost of the prescription drugs \nmight be large, but the savings through keeping Medicare beneficiaries \nout of hospitals and nursing homes can be dramatic, significant. That \nis why I think we need both basic and catastrophic coverage.\n\n  We must be guided by these principles. We want coverage that is \naffordable for the individual senior citizen. It should also be \naffordable to the Federal Government. That is why Senator Rockefeller \nand I have advanced a Medicare drug program. A number of our colleagues \nhave advanced other programs. What is important is that we take action \nand take it now.\n  I have here before me what we call the chairman's mark. The Budget \nCommittee of the Senate of the United States is meeting even as I \nspeak. They have in their chairman's mark what they call a reserve fund \nfor Medicare. They are talking about reserving $20 billion for \nMedicare. In the chairman's mark they describe a reserve fund for \nMedicare:\n\n       Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or \n     the Finance Committee reports a bill or an amendment or a \n     conference report that implements the structural Medicare \n     reform--\n\n  In other words, nothing is available for prescription drugs without \ncomprehensive Medicare reform. I am all for Medicare reform. But I do \nnot know why we ought to hold a good, effective prescription drug \nbenefit program hostage until we get comprehensive Medicare reform. \nThis is what the program requires.\n  Then it says:\n\n     and improves the solvency of the Medicare Program without the \n     use of transfers or new subsidies from the general fund.\n\n  Therefore it prohibits any use of any of the surplus at a time where \nwe have an important and significant surplus projection. The surplus \nshould be used to assist the Medicare program in a modest way. They \nprohibit any use of that surplus. It also requires and ensures \nadditional reimbursement for Medicare providers. So we have to have a \ncomprehensive reform of the Medicare system and we have to also have \nthe major changes for Medicare providers before we can ever come to \nconsider the $20 billion that is going to be recommended as possible \nfunds that could be used for a prescription drug program. This is half \nof what the President of the United States has asked for, half of his \n$40 million request.\n  This is what it says. Under the budget:\n\n       Prescription drug benefit. The adjustments made pursuant to \n     the prescription drug benefit may be made to address the cost \n     of prescription drugs.\n\n  It is optional. It is optional. I do not think that is what the \nseniors or the American people--not just seniors, but all Americans are \nreally interested in. They want us to take action and they want us to \ntake action now. They do not want to set up an arbitrary barricade for \nus before we can take action.\n  I do not understand why our Budget Committee is effectively binding \nthe Senate of the United States and prohibiting it from being able to \ntake action on a prescription drug benefit this year unless it goes \nthrough the hoops which they have established in the committee. Even if \nyou were able to get through all those hoops, it provides woefully \ninadequate funding over the next 5 years.\n  Last year the Budget Committee had $100 billion over 10 years for \nMedicare, although in reality that money was not dedicated solely to \nMedicare and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Yet this year they \nare talking about $20 billion over 5 years. The problem has gotten \nworse, not better. As we have seen, even though they had their program \nlast year and said they are really all for prescription drug coverage, \nthey do not have any program.\n  That is a very unsatisfactory way to proceed when we are talking \nabout one of the central concerns for not only seniors but also for \ntheir families. Seniors do the best they can. So often, when the \nparents are unable to pay, the burden falls on other family members to \nchip in and help pay for mom or dad's necessary prescription drugs.\n  The fact is, when the Medicare system was adopted in 1965, it was to \nbe universal in nature and have the confidence of the American people. \nIt was a pledge to the American people--if they worked hard and played \nby the rules, when they retired these seniors who fought in this \ncountry's wars would be free from the dangers of absolute financial \nruin due solely to their health.\n  We passed Social Security to provide for them to live with some sense \nof dignity, and Medicare was passed to give assurance that they would \nbe able to live their golden years in with the peace, security, and \ndignity in knowing their health care would be covered.\n  At that time, only 3 percent of all private health insurance programs \nhad a prescription benefit, so the Medicare system did not put in a \nprescription drug benefit. Now almost every private employer-based \nhealth plan--99 percent of them--have a prescription drug benefit. But \nnot Medicare. This is a serious coverage gap that exists, and every \nsenior citizen has to be concerned about this gap in coverage. It \ndemands action.\n  We can develop a program this year with our current circumstances, \nwith the economic benefits under the existing surplus. We can enact a \nbenefit\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\npackage now that can benefit seniors. We ought to pass it this year. \nSure, we can phase it in, we can build it up, but we want it now. Not \nlike the Budget Committee saying maybe sometime off in the future and \ngiving us absolutely no assurance. That is a mistake. That is flawed \npolicy. That is, I think, a completely inadequate response to the \nchallenges our seniors face.\n  Next week, when we debate the budget, we will have the opportunity to \naddress this issue. I hope the overwhelming majority of the Members \nwill support an effort that will come from our side, from our leaders \nto commit this body to take action and take it now. We will have a \nchance to vote on that. It ought to be something to which every senior \ncitizen in this country pays attention. We will make every effort to \nfashion a program to provide assistance to our seniors. We are \ncommitted to that. We will not be discouraged from that opportunity by \nthese budget recommendations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1853-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1853]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENT HOSNI MUBARAK\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, I intend to introduce some legislation \ndealing with violent crime. Before I describe that legislation, I want \nto speak briefly about another piece of legislation that I previously \nintroduced called Jeanna's bill, named after an 11-year-old girl from \nFargo, ND, who was brutally murdered some while ago. I will speak about \nthat for a moment today because something has happened in the last \ncouple of days of which we ought to be aware.\n  This is a picture of a man named Kyle Bell. He is a child killer. He \nmolested children. He was sent to prison for 30 years. He was \neventually convicted of killing Jeanna North from Fargo, ND, and sent \noff to prison.\n  As is too often the case in this country, Kyle Bell was remanded to \nthe custody of a private company to transport him to a prison in some \nother part of America. That private transport company lost this child \nkiller along the way. He escaped. He was not wearing red clothing or an \norange jumpsuit that said: ``I am a prisoner.'' He was in civilian \nclothes. He was in a van with other prisoners.\n  One of the guards of the company that was transporting him apparently \nwent in to buy a hamburger or something at a gasoline stop, and the \nother was asleep in the van. Kyle Bell somehow got his shackles off, \nclimbed up through the roof of the van, and was gone. Tragically, the \nguards did not notice they had lost a convicted child killer for 9 \nhours--9 hours.\n  It concerned me when I saw what had happened to this child killer. \nThis newspaper piece describes what happened and the manhunt around the \ncountry for Kyle Bell, a very violent career criminal.\n  I put together a piece of legislation and was joined by Senator \nAshcroft, Senator Leahy, and others, to say that if state and local \nauthorities are going to contract with a private company to haul \nconvicted killers and violent offenders, at least the company ought to \nhave to meet some basic standards. That is just common sense to me. It \nis not now the case.\n  Any retired law enforcement officer and their brother-in-law and \ncousin can buy a van, show up at a prison someplace and say: We are \nhired to haul your prisoners. In fact, it has happened all too often. I \nwill give an example.\n  A husband and wife team showed up at an Iowa State prison to \ntransport six inmates, five of them convicted murderers. The warden \nlooked at the husband and wife team and said: You have to be kidding \nme. But the prisoners were given to the husband and wife to transport, \nand, of course, they escaped. There is story after story of this same \ncircumstance.\n  The reason I mention it today is earlier this week in Chula Vista, \nCA, convicted murderer James Prestridge was being transported. He is a \nperson convicted of murder and sentenced to life without parole. He was \napparently, according to the Los Angeles Times, being transported from \nNevada to North Dakota where he was going to be incarcerated under some \nkind of prisoner exchange. This is a convicted killer, to be \nincarcerated for the rest of his life.\n  Guess what. Mr. James Prestridge, a convicted killer, is no longer in \ncustody. The private company called Extradition International lost him. \nHe escaped. They stopped at a bathroom and he overpowered a guard. He \nwent back to the van, overpowered the other guard, and this guy was \ngone. He and another violent offender who was with him are on the loose \ntoday.\n  Why is this happening? It does not happen when the U.S. Marshal \nService transports violent offenders around the country. They are not \nlosing violent offenders. But private companies have no standards to \nmeet, none at all. Hire a couple of people, rent a van, get your \nbrother-in-law, and you are in business. Some States will turn \nconvicted murderers over to you to be transported to another part of \nthe country.\n  This makes no sense to me at all. Convicted killers are being \ntransported around our country without the precaution one would expect \nin the transport of violent offenders. Under these circumstances, the \nAmerican people are not safe.\n  Again, the bill I have introduced will require any private company \nthat transports a violent offender to meet basic standards established \nby the Department of Justice. That bill needs to be heard. We have \nasked for a hearing before the Judiciary Committee. It has bipartisan \nsupport. Congress needs to pass this legislation this year.\n\n  The escape in Chula Vista, CA, of a convicted murderer is just one \nmore example of many escapes from private prisoner transport companies. \nI could stand here for 20 minutes and describe the escapes that have \noccurred with private companies having access to violent offenders. \nThat is not in the public interest.\n  In my judgment, violent offenders probably ought to be transported \nonly by law enforcement. But if some States decide they are going to \ncontract with private companies to transport violent offenders around \nthis country, then those companies ought to have to meet basic \nstandards--standards on how you shackle a violent prisoner, standards \non what that violent prisoner shall wear when being transported, \nstandards on the experience and the training of the guards and the kind \nof equipment that is used.\n  But those standards do not exist now. There is none. That is why \npeople, such as James Prestridge, a convicted murderer, are on the \nloose. Let's hope no one else loses their life because of this kind of \nincompetence.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan and Mr. Durbin pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2317 and S. 2318 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1853-5", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1853-S1855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET RESOLUTION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I came to the floor to address an issue \nwhich is\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\npending before the Senate today, and that is the decision to write a \nbudget resolution for the next fiscal year, a blueprint for our \nspending.\n  Just a little over a week ago, Billy Crystal, the comedian, did the \nOscars presentation show, the Academy Awards. He was referring to a \nmovie called ``The Sixth Sense,'' where there was a little boy who had \nsome supernatural power to see dead people. Billy Crystal, in one of \nthe best jokes of the evening, said: I see dead people all the time. I \nwatch C-SPAN.\n  Of course, it was a joke at our expense, serving in the Congress. But \nit must be true for a lot of people that when they tune in and listen \nto our debates and, of course, watch the committee deliberations, they \nhave to wonder: Isn't it more exciting? Don't these people do something \nthat might be more entertaining?\n  It may not hit a high entertainment level, but I think the debate \ncurrently underway on the budget resolution is exciting in terms of \nspelling out America's priorities for its future because in a room just \na block or two away from here, there will be a decision made on \nspending for America that can literally affect every family in the \ncountry. It is an important decision.\n  Part of that decision comes down to the major issue in the \nPresidential campaign. Governor George W. Bush, who appears to be the \nlikely candidate on the Republican side, has made the cornerstone of \nhis campaign a massive tax cut. In my estimation, it is a very risky \ntax cut. He believes the surplus we are generating now, because of a \nstrong economy and a decision to cut back on the deficit, should go \ninto a massive tax cut.\n  On the other side of the equation, President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore believe, as I do, that is foolish and reckless and it \ncould endanger the economic growth we have seen over the last 7 years. \nDon't just take our word for it. Our colleague, Republican Senator John \nMcCain, a candidate in that same Republican Presidential primary, said \nof George W. Bush's tax cut that it was not the thing to do; it was, in \nfact, bad policy. He said it more artfully, but that was his \nconclusion.\n  Chairman Alan Greenspan--no partisan, a man who has led the Federal \nReserve and helped this economy to develop and prosper--has said it is \nthe wrong thing to do.\n  The George W. Bush tax cut approach really overlooks the most \nimportant thing, which is debt reduction in America. Two-thirds of the \nAmerican people agree with Mr. Greenspan, Senator McCain, and the \nDemocratic Party, that we should take our surplus and dedicate it to \ndebt reduction, strengthening Social Security and Medicare, have \ntargeted tax cuts--limited, but targeted where they are really needed--\nand then spend money on health care and education for the families \nacross America.\n  Well, the Budget Committee is now debating this. In an hour or two, \nwhen I return there as a member, I will allow my colleagues on the \ncommittee an opportunity to decide whether or not they want to vote for \nthe George W. Bush tax cut or they believe there is a better way. Now \nit may put some of my Republican colleagues on the spot. But politics \nis about choices. We make choices every day in the well when we cast \nvotes, when we announce whether we are for or against a bill or whether \nwe will sponsor it or vote for it. My colleagues on the Budget \nCommittee will have a choice.\n  I think, frankly, they ought to reflect for a moment on some \nrealities. Take a look at what has happened in America since 1992. From \nthe election of President Clinton up to the year 1999, in virtually \nevery income category in America, we have seen rising incomes. This \neconomy is moving forward. Take a look at unemployment. In 1992, it was \n7.5 percent. In America today, it is 4.2 percent. The No. 1 complaint \nof businesses across Illinois is: We can't find skilled workers. I am \nsorry for that situation; we are trying to address it. But what a \nwelcome change from the days when we had double-digit unemployment.\n  We have taken, under the Clinton-Gore administration, a step forward \nin putting Americans to work. Record home ownership: 64 percent of \nAmericans owned homes at the end of 1992. The number is up to 67 \npercent now. I don't have the chart to show it, but business creation \nis hitting record levels as well. Inflation is down. The economy is \nmoving forward.\n\n  Now the obvious question is: Shall we change things?\n  We believe the tax cuts that should be enacted are limited and \ntargeted, not massive tax cuts that would go to wealthy people. If we \nare going to have tax cuts, let's help families with an elderly parent. \nThe President proposed that. Let's expand education so if you have a \nchild in college, you can deduct all your college education expenses up \nto $10,000. That is going to help some families pay for the college \neducation expenses the kids face. A bipartisan proposal to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty--we need that. Let's help people prepare for \nretirement with new accounts for saving. Let's expand the earned-income \ntax credit. These things are consistent with bringing down the debt and \nstrengthening Social Security and Medicare.\n  Look at what the other side proposes in the George W. Bush tax cut, \nwhich is the cornerstone of his campaign; it goes to the wealthiest \npeople in America.\n  Fairness is an important question when it comes to Government policy. \nIf you happen to be earning over $300,000 a year--and you know who you \nare out there--George W. Bush thinks you need a $50,000-a-year tax cut. \nI think you can get by without it if you are making more than $300,000 \na year. Frankly, it troubles me that the bottom 60 percent of wage \nearners in America, people making less than $39,300 a year, get a \nmeasly $249 from the George W. Bush tax cut.\n  When you take a look at that, you have to ask yourself, why would we \njeopardize our economic growth, forswear an opportunity to bring down \nour debt and reduce the burden of paying interest on that debt for our \nchildren, why would we jeopardize our economy--in the estimation of \nChairman Greenspan--for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in this \ncountry?\n  This is a further illustration of people making incomes of $31,000 a \nyear--$501 in tax cuts, and 60 percent of the people are going to see \nvery little tax relief. Those with higher income figures will see \ndramatic increases.\n  When you look at the tax cut and what it means, the sad reality is \nthat you cannot reach the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans without \nraiding the Social Security trust fund. Oh, they say, of course you \ncan. All you have to do is freeze spending.\n  Does anyone really believe we will freeze spending on the military, \nthat we won't give the men and women in uniform a pay raise? Does \nanybody believe we should deny to everyone who works for the Federal \nGovernment any kind of cost-of-living adjustment for the next 5 or 10 \nyears in order to pay for a tax cut that gives $30,000 or $50,000 in \ntax breaks to wealthy Americans? That is not going to happen.\n  Even under Republican Congresses, we have increased spending in \nbudgets by about 3 percent a year. It reflects inflation plus a little \nbit. But now they would have us believe that is no longer the case, \nthat we can somehow, in the next 5 or 10 years, not provide any \nadditional spending in a lot of key areas to pay for what I consider to \nbe a very risky tax plan.\n  It will, in fact, raid Social Security. Take a look at this chart, \nfor example. The Bush tax cut would raid Social Security trust funds to \nthe tune over 5 years of $483 billion; the Republican budget plan, $150 \nbillion. I thought we kind of reached an agreement around here, a \nbipartisan agreement, that the Social Security trust fund was off \nlimits, that we weren't going to get into it, we were going to protect \nit for future generations, and we were going to keep Social Security \nstrong. Sadly, that is not the case.\n  Mr. President, one last issue I want to raise, which I will offer as \nan amendment, is the question about violent crime and gun crime in this \ncountry. There is a breakdown in the debate. Some people believe, as I \ndo, that we should close loopholes so criminals, convicts, and children \ncannot get their hands on guns through gun shows and other means; that \nwe should have trigger locks to keep guns safe; that we should close \nthe loopholes. Others argue we should have more enforcement; that we \nhave plenty of laws, let's enforce them. I, frankly, believe we need \nboth--close the loopholes and better enforcement.\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n  Look at the Republican budget now being presented to the Senate. Hard \nas it may be to believe, this Republican budget is going to cut the 900 \nFBI agents proposed by President Clinton. It is going to reduce, as \nwell, the number of personnel in the Drug Enforcement Agency. It is \ngoing to reduce by over 400 the proposal by the President to put more \nguards at the borders to stop drugs. It completely eliminates the \nPresident's proposal for 500 new ATF agents to keep an eye on gun \ndealers who are selling to criminals. The President proposes 1,000 new \nprosecutors for enforcement, the same enforcement you heard Charlton \nHeston, Wayne LaPierre, and other folks on that side talk about. We \nneed more enforcement, and the Republican bill doesn't provide a penny \nfor this Presidential initiative for more enforcement.\n  You can't have it both ways. Your rhetoric has to catch up with \nreality. The Budget Committee room is a dance studio where we have the \nRepublican majority side-stepping the George W. Bush tax cut, saying, \nwe are not sure we want to go with that--a Texas two-step if I have \never seen one--and waltzing away from a commitment for more enforcement \nto stop gun crime in America.\n  That isn't going to wash, folks. People across America will look at \nthis and say that is not a recipe for America's future, it is a recipe \nfor disaster--on the economic front and when it comes to bringing peace \nto our neighborhoods and schools.\n  So I certainly hope those who watch C-SPAN will not be lulled to \nsleep, as Billy Crystal suggested, but will, rather, see there are some \npretty important issues being developed and debated. I hope before this \nall ends, we will stick with the economic plan that moves America \nforward, that provides opportunity for more and more Americans, for \nbusinesses and for home ownership, that we will dedicate ourselves to a \nsensible reduction in our debt rather than a risky, dangerous, and \nmassive tax cut, as Governor Bush has proposed.\n  I hope we will follow Chairman Greenspan's advice and keep this \neconomy moving in such a way that we create opportunity for everybody.\n  When it comes to gun safety, let's do both. Let's close the gun show \nloophole. Let's have trigger locks for the safety of guns. Let's not \nlet the Sunday morning talk show rhetoric about enforcement die by \nSunday evening. On Monday through Friday when we are in session, that \nrhetoric should be very much alive. I sincerely hope that during the \ncourse of this debate we can put together a bipartisan majority to \nachieve it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the resolution \nwhich will be before us later this afternoon dealing with the issue of \nflag burning. I will spend a few minutes to express to my colleagues \nand to others who may be interested at least my point of view on this. \nWe have debated it in this Chamber a number of times over the past \ndecade or more. We have it before us again today. I wish to take a few \nminutes to explain my views on this issue and how I intend to vote when \nthe matter comes before us.\n  This is no ordinary resolution. It is no ordinary debate. When we \nspeak of amending the Bill of Rights of our Constitution, we ought to \ndo so with great care.\n  Our Bill of Rights has existed now for more than 200 years, and, \ndespite literally thousands of proposals to amend it, our forebearers, \nand those who occupied this Chamber over the years, saw fit to not on a \nsingle occasion amend the Bill of Rights of the U.S. Constitution. It \nis a remarkable record when you consider the trials and tribulations \nthis Nation has been through--a great depression, great world wars, a \ngreat civil war which ravaged this Nation. Despite more than 11,000 \nattempts to amend the Constitution--many of them to amend the Bill of \nRights--none of our predecessors, and none of the Congresses that have \npreceded us, saw fit during all of those great trials and tribulations \nto amend the Bill of Rights of the United States.\n  Today, we are being asked to change that 209-year history and to \namend the Bill of Rights to deal with the outrageous, indefensible \nbehavior of those who would burn the symbol of our freedom, the symbol \nof our Constitution, the symbol of our democracy, the great flag of the \nUnited States. It goes without saying that every Member of this Chamber \nand the other body, and the overwhelming majority of Americans would \nfind flag burning offensive and abhorrent. As many of our colleagues, I \nbelieve it ought to be a crime--whether it is criminal intent to incite \nviolence or commit a theft. But to truly honor our Nation's history and \nthe veterans, we must not only protect our flag but, in my view, we \nmust also protect the Constitution and the freedoms promised by that \nflag.\n  Our former colleague, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, who served this \nNation as a combat pilot in Korea, as an astronaut, and as Senator, \nwell known to most Americans, well known by all of our colleagues, put \nit very well. I would like to quote it: ``There is one way to weaken \nthe fabric of your country, and it is not through a few misguided souls \nburning our flag. It is by retreating from the principles that the flag \nstands for. And that will do more damage to the fabric of our Nation \nthan 1,000 torched flags could ever do. . . . History and future \ngenerations will judge us harshly, as they should, if we permit those \nwho would defile our flag to hoodwink us into also defiling our \nConstitution. The Framers of the Constitution, in their boundless \nwisdom and notable humility, understood that succeeding generations may \nsee fit to amend this cornerstone document. But those amendments should \nbe limited, in James Madison's words, to ``great and extraordinary \noccasions.''\n\n  Regrettably, Madison's edict has not been heeded by many who have \ncome after him. In this Congress alone, more than 50 proposed \namendments to the Constitution have been introduced--including one to \nmake it easier to amend the Constitution in the future.\n  But collectively our Nation has paid heed to the caution urged by \nMadison and others of his day. It is reassuring to know that, of the \n11,000 amendments introduced since ratification of the Bill of Rights \n209 years ago, only 17 have been adopted.\n  Clearly, there is no great and extraordinary occasion warranting \nratification of the amendment proposed in the Senate today. Flag \nburning is rare, thank God. It is despicable. It is reprehensible. But \nit does not present a constitutional crisis for our Nation.\n  Indeed, in the entire history of our Nation, there have been only \nabout 200 reported incidents of flag burning, an average of less than \none a year for each of our Nation's history--one a year, 200 cases in a \nnation of 260 million people today. And we have less than roughly one \ncase a year for the 200-year history of our Nation.\n  I would submit that the despicable acts of a few misguided miscreants \ndo not cry out for this Congress to be the first in history to restrict \nthe liberties of all Americans by narrowing the Bill of Rights.\n  Some argue that even one flag burned would be enough to warrant \nratification of this proposed amendment. They say that, without such an \namendment, we effectively sanction flag-burning. But toleration is not \napproval. We do not as a nation sanction everything which we do not \npunish. Indeed, I would submit that the heart of the greatness of our \ndemocracy is that we tolerate that which we disapprove of. We permit \nand protect that which we find most offensive and obnoxious. They will \ncontinue, and probably grow, unfortunately, in number in a disgraceful \neffort to attract attention to themselves. What will such a possibility \nportend for the respect we all have for our beloved Constitution?\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\n  I do not for a moment question the intentions of those who support \nthe resolution before us. I respect most, if not all, of the people who \nare advocating this change. But, in my view, let us be clear. No \namendment and no amount of amendments to the Constitution will in and \nof themselves result in greater respect for the flag and for the free \nand democratic nation that it symbolizes. You cannot mandate nor \nlegislate patriotism. You carry it in your heart and soul. But I cannot \nwrite it for you. I cannot force it down the throats of the citizens I \nrepresent. We can change laws but we cannot change hearts by changing \nlaws. We can only attempt to change conduct and to enshrine in our laws \nthe eternal principles that have guided our Nation from its earliest \ndays--principles such as liberty and equality.\n  Let us leave to statutory law--those already on the books, and those \nalong the lines proposed by several of our colleagues--to sanction \nthose who would with criminal intent burn our beloved flag. But let us \nleave the Constitution unsullied by a proposal such as this that would \nneedlessly, in my view, restrict our liberties as a people.\n  The great genius of our Constitution is that it enshrines in word the \neternal aspirations of humanity. We may try to amend it, but if we do \nso in a manner at odds with those aspirations, then we act at our peril \nand in folly.\n  As Alexander Hamilton said:\n\n       The sacred rights of mankind are not to be rummaged for, \n     among old parchments, or musty records. They are written, as \n     with a sunbeam in the whole volume of human nature, by the \n     hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or \n     obscured by mortal power.\n\n  Let us not trifle with the Bill of Rights, a document that has never \nbeen changed, not one comma, not one semicolon, not one word, in 210 \nyears of history. Let us not change that today over this issue.\n  I urge the defeat of this resolution.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. L. Chafee). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.

I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Smith of New Hampshire pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2314 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1856-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1856-S1857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2314\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of \nintroducing another bill that I send to the desk and ask that it be \nread for the first time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill or title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2314) for the relief of Elian Gonzalez and other \n     family members.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I now ask for the second \nreading and, on behalf of the minority, I object to my own request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  The bill will be read for the second time on the next legislative \nday.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this bill refers to a \nmatter that is on everyone's mind. I know the Senator from Nebraska has \nhad some concerns on this. I rise to explain what this legislation \ndoes.\n  I think timeliness is important. This is an urgent matter. I \nintroduced this bill along with my colleagues from Florida, Senators \nMack and Graham. I am pleased to have their support in introducing the \nbill. I am doing it today to correct an injustice.\n  There is an injustice being committed, as we speak, by the Attorney \nGeneral and the Immigration and Naturalization Service against Elian \nGonzalez. I thank Senator Mack for his leadership in sponsoring a \nprivate relief bill to grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship. A grant of \ncitizenship to Elian Gonzalez has the practical effect of removing the \nElian Gonzalez controversy from the immigration law and places the \ncontroversy in the Florida courts for a custody proceeding.\n  This bill today does not grant Elian Gonzalez citizenship. Again, I \nam doing this with the full support of Senator Mack and Senator Graham. \nThis grants what is called family permanent residency to the family of \nElian Gonzalez--that would be Elian, Elian's father in Cuba, Elian's \nfather's current wife in Cuba, Elian's father's son in Cuba or child in \nCuba, Elian's two grandmothers and one grandfather, all of them--so \nthey can now come to America, sit down as a family and resolve this \nmatter. If they have to go to custody court, it takes it out of \nimmigration and puts it into the custody court. This does not grant \ncitizenship. It does not interfere in any way other than to say, let's \ndo it in a custody matter, the same way as any other 6-year-old boy \nwould have to do.\n\n  Permanent residency status will settle the status of Elian Gonzalez \nunder immigration and nationality law and leave the case to be resolved \nin the Florida State courts in a custody matter, not an immigration \nmatter.\n  Some ask: What is the difference between permanent residency and \ncitizenship? Why are they doing this as opposed to citizenship? \nFrankly, a lot of my colleagues have expressed concern about \ncitizenship. We want to make it palatable because of the confrontation \nthat is beginning to brew now and may come to a head as early as \ntomorrow morning where we have a deadline of 9 a.m., where literally \nthis boy could be dragged kicking and screaming from the arms of his \nuncle, put on a plane, and sent to Havana.\n  Do we want to see that in America tomorrow? Do we want to see that? \nThat is a confrontation I don't want to see. It is not called for. We \ndon't have to let it happen. This Senate could act today, but under the \nrules, we may have to act on Tuesday or Wednesday, if it is delayed. \nApparently, some have indicated they want to delay it.\n  I wish to make it clear, it could be acted on if there weren't delays \nbeing called for. Permanent residency status would make Elian Gonzalez \na resident alien. Resident aliens don't have the privileges of \ncitizenship. They are not allowed to vote and can be deported for \ncommitting a crime. Their status is as a resident alien, subject to \nFederal laws regarding deportation provisions. A citizenship bill would \ngrant the individual all the rights of citizenship: voting rights, no \ndeportation, and all other rights associated with being a citizen.\n  Do I support that? I happen to support that. I would be glad to give \nElian Gonzalez citizenship. I know a majority of my colleagues do not. \nI am looking out not for what Bob Smith wants to do but I want to do \nwhat is right for Elian Gonzalez. I want Elian to have his day in court \nas any other child would have in a custody matter where relatives were \ntrying to determine who should have custody.\n  At 4 p.m. today, Lazaro Gonzalez, his uncle, Elian's uncle in Miami, \nis going to meet with representatives of the INS. They are going to ask \nLazaro, in this meeting at 4 o'clock, to give up all rights to this \nboy, all rights to keep the boy in the country pending a possible \nappeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. If Lazaro Gonzalez says, ``No, I will \nnot give up those rights,'' then as early as 9 a.m. tomorrow, Elian \nGonzalez's parole status will be revoked and the boy could be sent back \nto Cuba without Elian's appeal being heard by the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  Very seldom do we come down on the floor with an issue as urgent as \nthis. This is an outrage. This is urgent. I have heard some people say: \nWe don't want to vote on this thing. We should not have to vote on \nthis. We don't want to deal with it. It is too hot to handle. We are \nnot going to vote on this.\n  Whatever way they vote, I am not trying to tell Senators how to vote. \nI am asking for a vote. I think the Senate should say to the United \nStates of America, to Fidel Castro, and to the Cuban American \ncommunity, that we don't want to see this confrontation--and frankly, \nto Janet Reno--at 9 a.m. tomorrow or 9 a.m. on Friday or 2 o'clock on \nSaturday or Sunday or next week or next month. I don't want to see on \nmy television screen pictures of Elian Gonzalez being dragged from his \nhome in Miami and placed on that airplane crying and screaming and \nkicking. I don't want to see that. Not only\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\ndo I not want it to happen, I don't want to see it happen, either.\n  It doesn't have to happen. We can stop it. But if we wait and we \ndelay and delay, and we don't send this message to the Attorney General \nthat we mean business, it will happen. She has backed the family into a \ncorner. Why, I will never know, but she has. We can stop it right here. \nWe can stop it. I want my colleagues to know that if we don't vote and \nthis happens, then it is on our conscience. We can stop this; we have \nthe capacity to do it.\n  The INS and Justice Department to this day have not spoken to Elian \nGonzalez.\n  Isn't it interesting? I spoke to him. I met with him for 2 hours. \nDiane Sawyer has spoken to him. She spoke to him. Senator Bob Smith \nspoke to him. He is available. But Janet Reno can't speak to him. Do \nyou know why? He doesn't have any rights. I say to anybody out there \nwho has a 6-year-old child--and I have had three in my time, but they \nare long past 6 now, and they were pretty smart--at 6 years old, you \nknow what is going on.\n  Do you know what happened to this little boy? I bet it didn't happen \nto too many boys anywhere in the world. He saw his mother die, slip \nunder the waves and drown. The last words that came out of her mouth to \nthe other survivors were: Please get Elian to America. That is my dying \nwish.\n  He didn't come here on a yacht. He wasn't escorted in some rich boat \nsomewhere and brought to the shores and kidnapped. He was found \ndrifting at sea for 3 days, surrounded by sharks. He survived, and his \nmother wanted him to be here. His mother had custody. She died. She \ncan't speak for him. Do you know what? If she had lived--this is the \nirony--this would not be before the Senate. It would not be before the \nINS. They would have 13 months to work this out. He would be allowed to \nstay. So because his mother died, Elian is now being punished. So Diane \nSawyer can talk to him, Bob Smith can talk to him, but the Attorney \nGeneral can't be bothered with it because Elian has no rights.\n  Are we in the Senate going to stand by and tolerate that? Do we want \nthat on our conscience? I hope not. We need a vote on Senator Mack's \nbill for citizenship, if you wish, or on my bill on permanent residency \nstatus, if you wish. It doesn't matter to me. I want to have the vote \non what we can get the most votes on so we can win, so that Elian wins, \nso that the process wins.\n  This is a little boy we are talking about, who endured more than most \nchildren would ever endure collectively throughout the world. I hear \nall the stuff about it is a family matter. Do you know what? It is a \nfamily matter, and we make it a family matter if we pass this \nresolution because then the family can come here from Cuba, if they \ncare about this little boy. No restraints, no restrictions. Just come \nand sit down with Elian's family here in America, with the Cuban \nfamily, and work it out. If you can't work it out, then go to custody \ncourt in Florida, where this matter should be played out.\n  Without this vote--and I will repeat it for clarity--if we don't take \na vote on this, Elian Gonzalez likely will be dragged kicking and \nscreaming from the arms of his Uncle Lazaro and sent off to Cuba. \nWithout this vote, that will happen, most likely. Or another \nalternative--perhaps worse--is violence, because people are up in arms \nabout this, and they have a right to be. They have been very \nrestrained.\n  I am proud of the Cuban American community for the way they have \nconducted themselves in this matter. But we don't need to let this kind \nof confrontation happen. Do you remember Waco? Janet Reno is doing the \nsame thing again. So we need a vote. Now, if we vote and we vote no, at \nleast you were heard; you are on record. The American people can say, \nSenator Smith, or Senator so and so, this is how you voted. We heard \nyou and you voted however you voted; we know how you felt about it.\n  At least have the courage to cast your vote on this matter.\n  My legislation grants Elian's family in Cuba permanent residency \nstatus. For the record, it includes Juan Miguel Gonzalez, Elian's \nfather, for permanent residency status in America; Nelsy Carmenate, \nJuan Miguel's wife; Jianny Gonzalez, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's son; \nMariella Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother; Raquel Rodriguez, \nElian's maternal grandmother; and Juan Gonzalez, Elian's grandfather. \nIt grants all of them permanent residency. Does it mean that if they \ncome to America, they have to stay? No. But it means if you care about \nElian, then you have to come to America and talk to the family here.\n  I have been told by members of Elian's extended family that Juan \nMiguel Gonzalez, Elian's father, had expressed an interest in coming to \nthe U.S. a few months before Elian was supposed to arrive.\n  The cold war is over, they say. It is over every place, I guess, but \nin the Senate because we want to say that Elian doesn't have any rights \nand we want to let Fidel Castro dictate what happens. Why would we want \nto let Fidel Castro determine the fate of Elian Gonzalez? Let Juan \nGonzalez come here. If Castro cares, let the Gonzalez family come here. \nWe are not going to keep them. They can stay if they want and they can \ngo home if they want. We just want them to come and meet with the \nfamily here in Miami.\n  I am deeply concerned about this arbitrary deadline. I repeat it \nagain for emphasis: I am very concerned about this 9 a.m. deadline. I \nam very concerned that such a deadline would be imposed because it is \ninflammatory to remove this parole status of Elian Gonzalez.\n  The goal in introducing this bill is to get the Justice Department \nand the INS out of the case and turn it over to the Florida courts and \nmake it a case for custody, so that any 6-year-old boy--if you think of \nAmerica today, there are custody cases going on right now as we speak. \nAnd to say this child doesn't have any rights--how about a child abuse \ncase? Children are interviewed by psychiatrists and psychologists all \nthe time under allegations of child abuse. In custody battles and \ndivorces, they hear from children in custody battles. They are heard \nevery day. Yet Elian can't be heard because of this decision--a \nregrettable decision--by the Attorney General.\n\n  I am going to end with a plea to the Attorney General: Please remove \nthe arbitrary 9 a.m. deadline. Let the courts hear Elian Gonzalez's \nappeal. This is America. We have courts to resolve custody issues. It \nis not an immigration issue. He didn't immigrate here. He didn't \nimmigrate into this country. He didn't emigrate from Cuba. He left \nCuba. He wanted to get out of there and so did his mother. His mother \ndied, and you are punishing him because she died. The other two people \nwho survived--and I met with them as well--are adults, and they are \nhere for 13 months. They are here. No problem. But Elian doesn't have \nany rights. Find a place in the law that says there is any age limit. \nAt what age does he have rights? Is it 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, or 14? Find it \nin the law, Madam Attorney General. It is not in there.\n  We have courts to resolve these matters. Let the Eleventh Circuit \nCourt of Appeals hear Elian's case before you attempt to send him back \nto Castro's open arms. Don't make the 6-year-old boy be paraded through \nthe streets of Havana by Fidel Castro. Please, remove the arbitrary \ndeadline. Let the Senate be heard. We will be heard, I hope, as early \nas Tuesday, perhaps Wednesday or Thursday--whenever we can work this \nthrough.\n  I appreciate the cooperation of the majority leader, who has been \nvery helpful in this matter. I am grateful for that. But there are \ncertain things he can't control. Senators have rights to delay, and \nthat is what is happening.

Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I \nask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding rule XXII, the following \nSenators be recognized for debate on the pending flag desecration \nlegislation for the designated times, and following the use for \nyielding back of time, the joint resolution be read the third time and \na vote on passage occur, all without any intervening action or debate. \nThose Senators are as follows: Senator Byrd\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\nfor up to 60 minutes; Senator Leahy for up to 60 minutes; Senator Hatch \nfor 60 minutes; Senator Daschle for up to 15 minutes; Senator Lott for \nthe final 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from West Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, we Americans are patriotic, and there are \nfew acts more deeply offensive to us than the willful destruction of \nour flag. The flag, after all, is a unique symbol of national unity and \na powerful source of national pride.\n  But the flag does not just represent the country and its history; in \na very real sense it is a part of that history. Like the Constitution, \nthe flag was handed down to us by the country's Founding Fathers, for \nit was the Second Continental Congress that, in 1777, established the \nStars and Stripes as the national flag. From Tripoli in 1805 to Iwo \nJima in 1945 to the Moon in 1969, the flag has been raised to \ncommemorate some of America's proudest moments.\n  Millions of American men and women have marched off to battle behind \nthat flag.\n  I see the flag there. It is just to the right of the Presiding \nOfficer here in the Chamber. What a beautiful sight--that flag!\n  Millions more have sworn allegiance to the flag and ``to the republic \nfor which it stands.'' And, while historians may dispute this point, \nschoolchildren to this day are taught to revere Betsy Ross for having \nsewn the first flag. Anyone who doubts either the flag's place in the \ncountry's history or the tremendous emotional ties that it inspires \nneeds only to listen to the words of our national anthem, in which \nFrancis Scott Key recalls with pride the sight of the Stars and Stripes \nflying proudly over Fort McHenry after a heavy bombing by British \nforces in 1814. Key's words are so familiar that we may scarcely think \nof them when we hear or sing them, but they are a deeply moving tribute \nto our flag.\n  In contemplation of the moment which is approaching when the Senate \nwould again be confronted with a constitutional amendment concerning \nthe desecration of the American flag, I have spent hours in discussions \nwith constitutional scholars, with members of my staff, and in \nresearching court decisions. I know of few subjects that have come \nbefore the Senate that have given me greater anguish. I know that the \nstrong sentiment in West Virginia and throughout the country supports \nthe amendment. I have voted for such a constitutional amendment in the \npast, but, based upon my deep and searching consideration of this \nmatter, I have changed my mind and I will vote against S. J. Res. 14. \nIn fact, it was my sad duty, on yesterday, to inform the members of The \nAmerican Legion, gathered together here in Washington, that I could not \nbe with them this time. I hated that I had to disappoint them. Some \nwill fault me for having changed my position, and I can understand \nthis, yet, as James Russell Lowell once said, ``The foolish and the \ndead alone never change their opinion.''\n  In fact, one of the greatest events of all time was brought about by \nthe changing of one man's opinion 2000 years ago. Before he became the \nGreat Apostle, Paul, who was then called Saul, was a persecutor of \nChristians. But after Saul was converted--he changed his opinion, his \nviewpoint, and his life. The Apostle Paul had a compelling influence on \nthe future course of history. In Paul's case, God spoke to him and \nlifted his literal and psychic blindness. I do not contend that my \nchange of viewpoint is in any way on the same scale of Paul's, or that \nsuch momentous results will follow, of course, but his story does \nremind us that one can be blinded to the truth by misplaced passion.\n  Mr. President, I yield to no-one in my respect, honor, and reverence \nfor Old Glory. Nor do I yield to anyone in my commitment to those \nveterans who, for the benefit of all Americans, have given so much in \ndefense of our country and in defense of our flag. Yet, despite my love \nfor the flag, and despite my commitment to our Nation's veterans, I \nregret that I cannot support this well-intended amendment. I cannot \nsupport it because I do not feel that it belongs in our Constitution; \nbecause I believe that many instances of flag desecration can be \nprosecuted under general laws protecting public or private property, \nlaws which do not require any constitutional amendment; I cannot \nsupport the amendment because flag burning, though loathsome, is hardly \npervasive enough to warrant amending the Constitution; I cannot support \nthe amendment because I fear that the primary effect of this amendment \nwould be more, not fewer, incidents of flag destruction; and because I \nfeel that, rather than rushing into a constitutional amendment, we \nmight be better served by allowing the Supreme Court the opportunity to \nrevisit this issue.\n  What do I mean, Mr. President, when I say that this measure does not \n``belong'' in the Constitution? Let me start by being clear about what \nI do not mean. I do not mean that protecting the flag is a trivial or \nunimportant goal of government. Nor do I mean that the flag deserves \nanything less than our complete reverence and our complete devotion. \nWhat I do mean, quite simply, is that a ban on flag desecration does \nnot fit into--would, in fact, be out of place in--the skeletal document \nwhich lays out the basic organization and structure of the national \ngovernment, determines federal-state relations, and protects the \nfundamental liberties of the people, all of us.\n  I think my meaning will be clearer if we take a closer look at the \npurposes that constitutional amendments are intended to serve. The \nFramers gave this matter some thought in their deliberations at \nPhiladelphia in 1787. They considered and they rejected resolve No. 13 \nof the Virginia Plan offered by Gov. Edmund Randolph of that State, \nresolve 13 which would have permitted ``amendment of the Articles of \nUnion whensoever it shall seem necessary,'' and which stated ``that the \nassent of the National Legislature ought not to be required thereto.'' \nThey rejected that. Indeed, several delegates to the Convention, among \nthem Charles Pinkney of South Carolina, opposed any provision for \nConstitutional amendments to the Constitution. Recognizing, however, \nthat occasional revisions might be necessary, the Convention finally \nagreed upon a compromise that deliberately made it difficult to amend \nthe Constitution by requiring successive supermajorities. Article V \nsets up a cumbersome two-step process to amend the Constitution. It is \ncumbersome because the framers intended it to be cumbersome. The first \nstep is approval either by two-thirds of Congress meaning both Houses \nor--and this has never been done--by a convention called for by two-\nthirds of the states. The second step is ratification by three-fourths \nof the states.\n\n  Given the hurdles set up by Article V, it should come as no surprise \nthat so few amendments to the Constitution have been approved. There \nare twenty-seven in all, and the first ten were ratified en bloc in \n1791--209 years ago. In the two hundred and nine years since \nratification of the Bill of Rights, there have been just 17 additional \namendments. Think of that. If we disregard the 18th and 21st \nAmendments, marking the beginning and end of Prohibition, we are left \nwith only 15 amendments in 209 years!\n  The 18th amendment was wiped out after 15 years by the 21st \namendment. These mark the beginning and end of Prohibition.\n  So, as I say, we are left with actually only 15 amendments in 209 \nyears. Just think of it. In 209 years, despite all of the political, \neconomic, and social changes this country has experienced over the \ncourse of more than two centuries; despite the advent of electricity, \nwhich lights this Chamber, and despite the advent of the internal \ncombustion engine; despite one civil war and two world wars and several \nsmaller wars; despite the discovery of modes of communication and \ntransportation beyond the wildest fancies of the most visionary \nframers, this document, the Constitution of the United States, has been \namended only 15 times. If you want to count the 21st amendment, 16 \ntimes would be the total number.\n  Truly, the Constitution is an extraordinary work of wisdom and \nforesight on the part of the framers. George Washington and James \nMadison may be forgiven for referring to the product of their labor as \n``little short of a miracle.'' Gladstone may well have gotten\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nit right when in 1887 he declared the Constitution to be the most \nwonderful work ever struck off at a given time by the brain and purpose \nof man.\n  As for those 15 amendments I have just mentioned, these can generally \nbe divided into two roughly equal categories. One category consists of \nthose amendments that deal with the structure and organization of the \nthree branches of Government, the laying out of the three separate \nbranches--the legislative, the executive, the judiciary. The checks and \nbalances, these include the 11th amendment. Of course, those were \nincluded in the original Constitution, the separation of powers, in the \nfirst, second, and third articles--the legislative, executive, and \njudicial.\n  As to the amendments, the 15 amendments plus the first 10, these \ninclude the 11th amendment, preventing the Federal courts from hearing \nsuits against States by citizens of other States; the 12th amendment, \nregarding the election of the President and the Vice President; the \n17th amendment, establishing the direct elections of Senators; the 20th \namendment, regulating Presidential terms and related matters; the 22nd \namendment, limiting a President to two terms; the 25th amendment, \nregarding Presidential succession; and the 27th amendment, deferring \ncongressional pay raises until after an intervening election.\n  There is very little need for me to attempt to justify the inclusion \nof these provisions in the Constitution. However we may feel about them \npersonally, their subject matter, the structure of the Federal \nGovernment, fits in perfectly with that of articles I through IV.\n  There is good reason to suspect the framers themselves thought that \nmost, if not all, amendments would address structural matters. In No. \n85 of the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton expressed it this way: \nA thorough conviction that any constitutional amendments which ``may, \nupon mature consideration, be thought useful, will be applicable to the \norganization of the government and not to the mass of its powers.''\n  Hear that again: Hamilton expressed a thorough conviction that any \nconstitutional amendments which ``may, upon mature consideration, be \nthought useful, will be applicable to the organization of the \ngovernment, and not to the mass of its powers.''\n  In Hamilton's mind, any amendments would deal with the structure, the \norganization, of the Government.\n  The second category consists of those constitutional amendments that \nnarrow the powers of government and expand or protect fundamental \npersonal rights. These include the 13th amendment banning slavery, the \n14th amendment, which extended citizenship to all persons ``born or \nnaturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction \nthereof'' and guaranteed all citizens certain basic protections, and \nthe 15th, 19th, 23th, 24th, and 26th amendments, each of which extended \nthe vote to new groups of citizens.\n  Clearly, the flag desecration amendment fits into neither category. \nFor constitutional purposes, it is neither fish nor fowl. It does not \naddress a structural concern; it does not deal with Federal relations \nbetween the National and State governments--in other words, the Federal \nsystem; it extends, rather than narrows, the powers of government; and \nit does not protect a basic civil right.\n  Look at your Constitution. Look at your Constitution and the \namendments thereto which, to all intents and purposes, are part of the \nConstitution. You will see that the Constitution overall narrows the \npowers of government; it does not extend those powers. Indeed, some \nopponents of this amendment that is before us argue that it restricts \npersonal liberty.\n  The 13th amendment forbidding slavery may be viewed as the only \namendment regulating the conduct of individuals. The 13th amendment was \nthe product of a bitter, fiercely contested Civil War, the War Between \nthe States, and it was necessary to end one of the most loathsome and \nshameful institutions in our Nation's history. This, the 13th \namendment, was an exceptional amendment. It was necessitated by \nexceptional circumstances.\n  There was, of course, one notable attempt to regulate individual \nconduct via a constitutional amendment. I have already referred to \nthat, the 18th amendment, instituting Prohibition, which also deviated \nfrom the model of constitutional amendments I have laid out--with \ndisastrous results. Like the flag desecration amendment, the 18th \namendment sought to restrict private conduct in the name of a greater \nsocial good. Like the flag desecration amendment, the 18th amendment \nhad a commendable goal. Nonetheless, the 18th amendment was a mistake \nand it took us 15 years to rectify it. True, the mistake was rectified \nin 1933, but the damage was already done. The 21st amendment ended \nProhibition, but it could not erase the preceding 15 years in which a \nconstitutional provision--not a statute, a constitutional provision, a \nportion of the highest law in the land--was routinely ignored and \nviolated. You see, once that 18th amendment was riveted into the \nConstitution, it took 15 years to unlock it, to undo it, to repeal it.\n  Prohibition not only made criminals and scofflaws of countless \nAmericans, it also placed them in violation of the Constitution. I can \nremember the revenue officers, when they came to the coal camps and \nwhen they scoured around the hills and the mountains looking for the \nmoonshine stills. I can remember those revenuers. That was a terrible \nmistake, and, while the blemish to the Constitution has since faded, \nthe lesson may not have been learned.\n  Thus, a constitutional amendment against flag burning may very well \nprove to be counterproductive, just as did the Prohibition amendment. \nIf this were to happen, our Constitution would be diminished and flag \nburning would continue--would continue.\n\n  In the final analysis, it is the Constitution--not the flag--that is \nthe foundation and guarantor of the people's liberties. Respect for \nthat Constitution should not be undermined by amendments, however well \nintentioned, that cannot be enforced. I fought the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget for the same reason. I said it could \nnot, would not--would not be enforced, and that as a result of lack of \nenforcement, the people's faith in the Constitution would be \nundermined. I say the same thing here. It will not be enforced.\n  It is like the Commandment that says: ``Thou shalt not kill,'' but \nkilling goes on every day right here in the Nation's Capital.\n  ``Thou shalt not steal,'' but stealing continues.\n  I have come to believe strongly that constitutional amendments, as \nMadison said, should be saved ``for certain and extraordinary \noccasions.'' I am not saying the Constitution should never be amended. \nI am not saying that. Madison was not saying that either. But Madison \nsaid that constitutional amendments should be saved for ``certain and \nextraordinary occasions.''\n  Critics may accuse me of being overly conservative, but I believe I \nam right. I have learned from study and from my own recent experience \nwith the proposed constitutional amendment to balance the budget that \ntinkering with the careful system of checks and balances and the \nseparation of powers contained in the Constitution, can have far-\nreaching and sometimes unexpected consequences. When it comes to \nrevising the most basic text in our Federal system, when it comes to \nimproving upon the handiwork of Washington and Madison and Hamilton and \nJames Wilson and Roger Sherman and Gouverneur Morris and Benjamin \nFranklin and others at the convention; when it comes to setting a pen \nto the sacred charter of our liberties that my colleagues and I have \nsworn at the desk to uphold and defend--then, yes, I am conservative.\n  While I do not rule out the possibility that I might offer an \namendment some day, as I have done in the past--I have learned a lot in \nthese last years in the Senate--they should be reserved, as Madison \nsaid, for compelling circumstances when alternatives are unavailable.\n  Polls are no substitute for reasoned analysis and independent \nthought. Polls were very much in evidence during the balanced budget \namendment debate, and we see the same thing here today. Who would \noppose a balanced budget? Those of us who voted against the balanced \nbudget amendment did not oppose a balanced budget. We were opposed to \nwhat that amendment would do to the Constitution of the United States; \nwhat it would do to the\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\nfaith and confidence of the American people in their Constitution.\n  Who would oppose protecting the flag? Nobody here certainly. But the \nSenate, in particular, was intended by the framers to be an oasis of \ncool, deliberate debate, free from the hasty and heated rhetoric that \ncharacterizes so many political exchanges.\n  The writers of the Constitution were remarkable men. Such a gathering \nprobably never before sat down within the four corners of the Earth. \nThat was the real miracle that took place in Philadelphia, that those \nminds, and many of them were young--Franklin was 81, but Pinckney was \n29; Gouverneur Morris was 35; Madison was 36; Hamilton was 30--that so \nmany brilliant minds sat down in one place at a given moment in time. \nThe clock of time had struck. Had it been 5 years earlier, they would \nnot have experienced to the full the flaws of the Articles of \nConfederation, so they would not have been ready. Had it been 5 years \nlater, they would have seen all of the ills, the extremes of the French \nRevolution, the deaths at the guillotine. They would have been repelled \nin horror by what happened there, the excesses. These were the \nmiracles: the right place, the right time, and the right men.\n  The framers of the Constitution were indeed remarkable men, and their \nwords are often as wise and relevant today as they were two centuries \nago. Thus, Madison wrote in Federalist 49 that ``a constitutional road \nto the decision of the people ought to be marked out and kept open, for \ncertain great and extraordinary occasions.''\n  Currently, there appears to be no such ``great and extraordinary'' \noccasion that calls for a 28th constitutional amendment.\n  Madison also warned against the reference of constitutional questions \nto the people too often. ``Do not do it too often,'' he said. ``Do not \nsend amendments to the American people too often.''\n  In the Federalist 49, he said:\n\n     . . . as every appeal to the people would carry an \n     implication of some defect in the government, frequent \n     appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of \n     that veneration which time bestows on everything, and without \n     which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not \n     possess the requisite stability.\n\n  Madison further said:\n\n       The danger of disturbing the public tranquility by \n     interesting too strongly the public passions is a still more \n     serious objection against a frequent reference of \n     constitutional questions to the decision of the whole \n     society. . . . But the greatest objection of all is that the \n     decisions which would probably result from such appeals would \n     not answer the purpose of maintaining constitutional \n     equilibrium of the government.\n\n  That was James Madison warning us against sending to the American \npeople constitutional amendments too often.\n  Flag destruction is, fortunately, only a rare occurrence. While our \nculture may have become increasingly coarse and vulgar at times--and it \ncertainly has, there is no question about that--most Americans respect \nthe flag and most Americans voluntarily refrain from abusing it.\n  I do not want to give the same attention-seekers who defile the flag \nthe opportunity to defy the Constitution as well. By one act, they \nwould then be able to desecrate and defy the flag and at the same time \nto defy--defy, defy--the Constitution of the United States. This is \nmore than a matter of symbolism; this is a question of respect for the \nfounding document of this Republic and the supreme law of the land.\n  Any disrespect for the Constitution is a repudiation of the most \nbasic principles and laws of the country. And now you say let's put \ninto the Constitution some verbiage that cannot be enforced, that will \nnot be enforced; cannot be. It will be defied by some.\n  Let me say that again. Any disrespect for the Constitution is a \nrepudiation of the most basic principles and laws of the country. We \nare talking about the supreme law of the land. The law here can be \nchanged--passed today and changed before the beginning of the next \nCongress next year. But not a constitutional amendment. Once it is \nwelded into the Constitution, it will take years to repeal it, to take \nit out, to remove it, as we saw in the case of amendment No. 18, the \nprohibition amendment.\n  I shrink from the possibility of providing a tiny minority of rabble-\nrousers with the ammunition to fire upon the most important and beloved \ndocument in the country.\n  As I suggested a bit earlier, we already made the mistake once before \nof inserting into the Constitution a restriction on private conduct \nthat could not be enforced. The Constitution suffered terribly under \nProhibition. It would also have suffered under a balanced budget \namendment, another unenforceable and litigation-inducing provision that \nmany of my colleagues wished to insert into the Constitution. Just as I \nopposed the balanced budget amendment out of a desire to protect the \nConstitution from further abasements, so, too, I must oppose a flag \ndesecration amendment. It, too, would be unenforceable.\n  If one provision of the Constitution proves to be unenforceable, what \nabout the other provisions?\n  Just as I am resolved to protect both the Constitution and the flag, \nI am determined that we not make martyrs of those villains who would \nsully--who would sully--the Stars and Stripes. Why should we let these \nmalefactors portray themselves as courageous iconoclasts, sacrificed at \nthe altar of public complacency and intolerance? It is possible, I \nbelieve, to craft statutory protection for the flag that can withstand \na court challenge. The amendment in the form of a substitute that was \noffered by Senator McConnell, the Flag Protection Act of 1999, could, \nin the opinion of the American Law Division of the Library of Congress, \nwithstand such scrutiny. In the words of that opinion, ``subsections \n(b) and (c) appear to present no constitutional difficulties, based on \njudicial precedents, either facially or as applied.'' Further, the \nopinion notes, ``Almost as evident from the Supreme Court's precedents, \nsubsection (a) is quite likely to pass constitutional muster.'' The \nopinion closes by noting, ``In conclusion, the judicial precedents \nestablish that the bill, if enacted, while not reversing Johnson and \nEichman, should survive constitutional attack on First Amendment \ngrounds.''\n  The first case to which I just referred, of Texas v. Johnson, arose \nfrom an incident during the 1984 Republican Convention in Dallas, \nTexas, in which Gregory Lee Johnson participated in a political \ndemonstration and burned an American flag while protestors chanted. \nJohnson was convicted of desecration of a venerated object in violation \nof a Texas statute, and a State Court of Appeals affirmed the decision. \nHowever, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals reversed the decision, \nholding that burning the flag was expressive conduct for which the \nState could not, under the First Amendment, punish Johnson in these \ncircumstances. The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, upheld the lower \ncourt's decision.\n  But in the dissent by Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice White, and \nJustice O'Connor, they noted, ``the Texas statute deprived Johnson of \nonly one rather inarticulate symbolic form of protest--a form of \nprotest that was profoundly offensive to many--and left him with a full \npanoply of other symbols and every conceivable form of verbal \nexpression to express his deep disapproval of national policy.'' The \nJustices also observed, ``Surely one of the high purposes of a \ndemocratic society is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as \nevil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people--whether it be \nmurder, embezzlement, pollution, or flag burning.''\n  After the Johnson decision, Congress passed the Flag Protection Act \nof 1989, criminalizing the conduct of anyone who ``knowingly mutilates, \ndefaces, physically defiles, burns, maintains on the floor or ground, \nor tramples upon'' a United States flag, except conduct related to the \ndisposal of a ``worn or soiled'' flag. Subsequently, several people, \namong them Shawn D. Eichman, were prosecuted in District Courts. In \neach case, the appellees moved to dismiss the charges on the ground \nthat the Act violated the First Amendment. The District Courts, \nfollowing the precedent set by the Johnson case, held the Act \nunconstitutional as applied and dismissed the charges. The Supreme \nCourt, again in a 5-4 decision, upheld the decision.\n  However, in the dissent authored by Justice Stevens, with whom the \nChief Justice, Justice White, and Justice O'Connor joined, the justices \nnoted\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nthat ``it is equally well settled that certain methods of expression \nmay be prohibited if (a) the prohibition is supported by a legitimate \nsocietal interest that is unrelated to the suppression of ideas the \nspeaker desires to express; (b) the prohibition does not entail any \ninterference with the speaker's freedom to express those ideas by other \nmeans; and (c) the interest in allowing the speaker complete freedom of \nchoice among alternative methods of expression is less important than \nthe societal interest supporting the prohibition.''\n  Given the closeness of the votes in Johnson and Eichman--given the \npresumption against amending the Constitution whenever other \nalternatives are available--and given the powerful arguments made by \nChief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Stevens in their dissents--perhaps \nthe better course of action is to allow the Court sufficient time to \nreconsider its views on this controversial topic.\n\n  The Court has already changed its composition since the Eichman \ndecision eight years ago. Four of the Justices who decided that case, \nincluding three who voted with the majority, have been replaced. Who \ncan say whether a new court will find itself swayed by the persuasive \narguments that Mssrs. Rehnquist and Stevens have put forth? Instead of \nour adding a new, 28th Amendment to the Constitution, would it not be \npreferable for the Court, on closer inspection of the issue, to realize \nthe error of its ways?\n  Like many Americans, I was shocked by the Johnson and Eichman \ndecisions overturning statutory protection for the flag. Now, that \nshock has subsided, and while I still question the correctness of those \ndecisions, I no longer believe that a constitutional amendment is the \nbest response to these horrific acts. The intervening years have \nallowed me to rethink my initial reaction to the Supreme Court's \ndecisions, and while my love for the flag has not waned, neither have \nmy respect for and devotion to the Constitution. If anything, the spate \nof proposed constitutional amendments in recent years--chief among them \nthe misguided balanced budget amendment--and my continued studies of \nconstitutional history have only increased my love for this magnificent \ndocument and my determination to prevent its abuse.\n  Every time I read it--as with every time I read the Bible--I find \nsomething, it seems, that is new and intriguing and awe-inspiring.\n  I have always promised my constituents that I will represent them to \nthe best of my ability and with an open mind and an honest heart. \nToday, head and heart have convinced me to reconsider my beliefs. As \nBenjamin Franklin, the oldest man at the Constitutional Convention, put \nit, in addressing his fellow conferees at Philadelphia as they prepared \nto sign the Constitution--this is what he said--``For having lived \nlong, I have experienced many instances of being obliged by better \ninformation or fuller consideration, to change opinions even on \nimportant subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be \notherwise.''\n  That has happened to me on several occasions. Certainly, it is true \nin the present instance.\n  While I salute the patriotism of those who support this measure--I \nsalute them--I hope that they will pause to consider its unintended but \ninevitable ramifications. Rather than inviting a surge in flag \ndestruction; rather than spurring years of legal wrangling; rather than \nadding to our Constitution a provision that addresses a problem that \noccurs only infrequently, let us step back.\n  Let us reconsider the matter. Let us rethink what we are proposing.\n  Our Founding Fathers intended that amending the Constitution should \nbe a difficult and laborious process--time consuming; cumbersome--not \nto be undertaken lightly. It sets a dangerous precedent, one that I \nhave come to appreciate fully in recent years, to tinker with the \ncareful checks and balances established by the Constitution. When it \ncomes to our founding charter, history demands our utmost prudence.\n  Every heart in this Chamber thrills at the sight of that flag, \nthrills at the rays of sunlight that play upon those stars and stripes, \nas we ride down or walk down a street on the Fourth of July. The flag! \nThere is no other flag like it! None.\n  But what gives each of us freedom of speech? What gives each of us \nthe right to say what we want to say? What gives us that right? Not \nthat flag--but the Constitution of the United States!\n  What gives the fourth estate that sits in those galleries up there--\nthe press--what gives the press freedom to print, to televise, to \nbroadcast? What gives this country freedom of the press? Not Old Glory, \nnot that flag--but the Constitution of the United States!\n  What gives my coal miners from West Virginia the right to come to \nthese Capitol steps and to speak out and to thunder their criticism of \nthe President of the United States or of the Congress of the United \nStates, while Old Glory floats above the dome in the blue sky? What \ngives those miners that right? Not the flag, not Old Glory, soaring in \nthe heavens--but the Constitution of the United States!\n  What gives the truckers, what gives the farmers, what gives any group \nthe right to come to Capitol Hill and to assemble and to petition the \nGovernment to obtain a redress of grievances? Not the flag--but the \nConstitution of the United States!\n  There is the source of the right--there is the source--not in the \ndear old flag. The flag is the symbol of the Republic, the symbol of \nwhat the Constitution provides, but it is not the flag that provides \nit. It is the Constitution of the United States. That is why today I \nspeak out against the amendment before the Senate, because it is that \nConstitution that provides us with the rights which all Americans \nenjoy, regardless of race, regardless of color, regardless of national \norigin, regardless of age or sex. It isn't that flag.\n  I love it. How many times do we go the last mile of the way with a \nfriend or a relative who sleeps beneath the closed lid of a steel \ncoffin draped with the American flag? It is something to remember. He \nmay have been a soldier, a sailor, a marine. He didn't die for that \nflag. He died for what that flag represents. And the instrument that \nprovides what that flag represents is the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  It is the real stuff!\n  I think I am right to have changed my mind. I want to say again that \nI changed my mind because of long and serious study, not only of the \nConstitution of the United States, but also of the Articles of \nConfederation which was the first Constitution of the U.S., my study of \nthe Federalist Papers, my study of the history of our country, the \nhistory of the colonies, the history of England, the struggles of \nEnglishmen, and my studies of the ancient Romans. Because of these \nstudies, in the beginning with the respect to the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget and then with respect to the line-item \nveto, which I hate with a passion, and which the Supreme Court of the \nU.S. overthrew, I came to know more about the Constitution, about \nAmerican constitutionalism, about the history of the Constitution, \nabout the ratifying conventions, than I ever knew before. And it is the \nresult of that long and assiduous study of constitutionalism in \nAmerica, constitutionalism that had its roots not just at the \nConstitutional Convention of 1787, but in the states before the \nConstitution, and in the colonies before the states, and in the \nBiblical covenants before the colonies; roots that go back 1,000-2,000 \nyears. I have come to this conclusion, and I believe that I can best \nserve my country today by voting against this amendment.\n  The flag lives because the Constitution lives, without which there \nwould be no American Republic, without which there would be no American \nSenate, without which there would be no United States of America, only \nthe balkanized States of America. Without that Constitution, there \nwould be no American liberty, no American flag.\n  That flag is the symbol of our Nation. In a way, we might say that \nthat flag is the symbol of all we hold near and dear. That flag is the \nsymbol of our Nation's history. That flag is the symbol of our Nation's \nvalues. We love that flag. But we must love the Constitution more. For \nthe Constitution is not just a symbol, it is the thing itself!\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of the privileges of serving in the \nSenate is the chance to hear debates--some good, some not so good. \nPeriodically, we hear greatness in speeches. The Senate just heard \ngreatness.\n  I think all Senators would agree, whether they are for or against \nthis constitutional amendment, that when the history of this debate is \nwritten, when the history books are written, the speech of the \ndistinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, will be in \nthat recounting. This is the type of speech that students of \nconstitutional history, students of the Constitution itself--and this \nSenator wishes there were more--will look to, and they will read and \nreread.\n  We sometimes forget that every 6 years, those of us who are fortunate \nto serve here, to serve more than once, take a very specific oath of \noffice. I can think of times when various people have administered this \noath, usually the Vice President of the United States. But I recall \nwatching the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia administer \nthat oath on a couple of occasions in his role as President pro tempore \nof the Senate.\n  There was one big difference when he administered it than when all \nthe various Vice Presidents, Republican or Democrat, administered it. \nThe difference is, they had a card before them and they read the oath. \nThe Senator from West Virginia didn't need a card before him to do it. \nThe Senator from West Virginia would stand there, tell them to raise \ntheir right hand, and he would administer the oath. There was no \nprompting. There was no teleprompter. There was no card. There was no \nbook. There was the mind that carries the history of the United States \nSenate there, when he would do it.\n  I mention that oath because we swear we will uphold the Constitution, \nwe will protect the Constitution. There could be no more solemn duty. \nIf we are protecting the Constitution of this country, we are \nprotecting the country itself. In this debate, that really is the \nissue.\n  I have said over and over again, I do not want to see the first \namending of the Bill of Rights in over 200 years. I think we know from \nour history there have been times when we have amended the \nConstitution. We did it to provide, after the tragedy of the death of \nPresident Kennedy--I was not serving here at that time; the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia was--a means of succession of \nVice President. And in this era of the nuclear age and all, it is good \nwe have that. But these are matters of enormous consequence. These are \nmatters that can go to the very survival of our Nation and that make it \npossible, actually necessary, to amend the Constitution.\n  Let us not amend it simply because it is a matter of passing \npolitical favor.\n  I have spoken too long, and I do not wish to embarrass my friend. I \nhave had the honor of serving with him for just over 25 years. There is \nhardly a day goes by that I do not learn something from the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia. Today the Nation learned from \nthe Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am happy to yield to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me briefly comment on the remarks made \nby the senior Senator from West Virginia. I know from having visited \nwith him about this subject over some long while that he found this to \nbe a difficult subject, not a simple subject, not an easy issue to \nresolve. I felt the same way about this issue. He spoke about the U.S. \nConstitution at great length today and all Members of the Senate will \nlearn from that speech.\n  I have told my colleagues previously that on the 200th birthday of \nthe writing of the Constitution I was one of the 55 Americans who went \ninto that room where the Constitution was written 200 years prior to \nthat, when 55 men went into that room and wrote a Constitution. Two-\nhundred years later, 55 people--men, women, minorities--went into that \nroom. I was privileged to have been selected to be one of them. I have \ntold the story before and people may get tired of hearing it, but I sat \nin that room--I come from a town of about 270 people, a small ranching \narea of Southwestern North Dakota. I sat in that room--the assembly \nroom in Constitution Hall--200 years after the Constitution was \nwritten, the document that begins, ``We the people.''\n  In that room, George Washington's chair is still in front of the \nroom, where he sat as he presided over the constitutional convention, \nand Ben Franklin sat over on this side, and there was Madison and \nMason; Thomas Jefferson was in Europe, but he contributed through his \nwritings to the Bill of Rights. I thought to myself that this is a \npretty remarkable country where a fellow from a town of about 270 \npeople can participate in a celebration of this sort.\n  From that moment, I have been troubled by the proposition that some \nconvey so easily of wanting to change the U.S. Constitution. I \nmentioned yesterday that we have had, I believe, 11,000 proposals to \nchange the Constitution, 11,000. Among those, for example, was a \nproposal to have a President from the North during one term and then \nthe requirement that the next term of the Presidency be filled by a \nPresident who comes from the southern part of the U.S. That was one \nidea.\n  Fortunately, the Constitution is hard to amend. Since the Bill of \nRights, only 17 times have we amended this document, and then in almost \nevery case, it was to expand freedom and liberty. So I have had great \ndifficulty with this issue. I love the flag and what it stands for. I \nam devoted to the flag and the Constitution and the principles on which \nthis country was founded. I know the Senator from West Virginia is as \nwell. I wanted to say how much I and my colleagues, I am sure, \nappreciate his presentations to the Senate not just today but on a \nrecurring basis, reminding us of the timeless truths about who we are \nand about who we have been, about the rich and majestic history of our \ncountry and the principles that have allowed us to progress to the \npoint now of the year 2000 as the oldest successful democracy in \nhistory.\n  So I want to say thank you. As I say, this is a very difficult issue. \nI came to the same conclusion, that I did not feel I could amend the \nU.S. Constitution in this manner. It doesn't mean that I don't believe \nwe ought to find a way, short of changing the Constitution, to provide \nsanctions for those who would desecrate America's flag. I just have not \nbeen able to make the leap of saying, yes, let's change the framework \nof the Constitution. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his \nenormous contribution today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the senior Senator from Vermont and \nthe senior Senator from North Dakota for their remarks. I also thank \nthem for the courage they have displayed time and time again in \nprotecting this founding document. I thank them for the inspiring \nleadership that the rest of us have had from watching them and \nlistening to them. They, indeed, have done a tremendous service to the \ncountry, to the Senate, and to the Constitution. I thank them both from \nthe bottom of my heart.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business, the time not charged under \ncloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, good health is one of life's greatest \nblessings. Over the last 25 years, there has been a tremendous change \nfor the better in the delivery of health care. New drugs help to \nprevent heart disease and provide better treatments for cancer, \nallergies, depression, and many other debilitating conditions. In \nshort, prescription drugs can help people live longer, lead healthier, \nhappier, more productive lives--and can help lower the overall cost of \nhealth care. We all applaud.\n  The United States leads the world in the development of new drugs. \nAlmost half of the new drugs developed in the last 25 years were \ncreated in the USA.\n  But new drugs are expensive to develop. Only one of every five \ncandidate medicines will turn out to be effective, be approved by the \nFDA and make it to\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\ndrug store shelves. Last year, the drug industry spent $24 billion on \nresearch and development. U.S. taxpayers also invest $18 billion every \nyear in the National Institutes of Health, which provides grants for \nbasic health research. Drug companies that are willing to take on the \nrisk of developing new treatments receive tax credits for their \nresearch and development costs.\n  Yet when American consumers pick up their prescription at the \ndrugstore they pay again for research and development in the form of \nhigher prices. Why? Every other developed country imposes some form of \nprice control. Those countries pay for the cost of manufacturing the \ndrug, which is normal, and maybe some profit; but they don't even come \nclose to paying a fair share of the research and development costs of \nnew drugs developed in the United States.\n  So when some Americans get sick, they can't afford the medicine they \nneed to stay healthy. Instead they go without or they ration medicine. \nIf they are able to travel, Americans cross the borders to Canada or \nMexico to buy for much less, the prescriptions they need to stay \nhealthy.\n  I was curious to know just how much my constituents were savings by \ntraveling to Canada. My office recently conducted an informal study \ncomparing the prices of the top ten most commonly prescribed \nprescription drugs in several Washington state retail drug stores to \nthe price paid in a typical Canadian pharmacy. I was astounded by the \nresults: on average prices are 64% lower in Canada.\n  Here are a few examples: The average cost of 30 pills of Zocor, which \nused to treat high cholesterol, is $76 in our state, in Canada it costs \n$38; Premerin, an estrogen replacement therapy used by many women, is \n$26 in our state and $10.50 just across the border; and a popular new \nallergy treatment, Claritin, is just $34 in Canada but almost $80 in \nWashington State.\n  During last week's break, I spent time talking with seniors, doctors, \nhospital administrators, and others about the cost of prescription \ndrugs. All expressed their concern about the growing amount spent on \nmedicine and the ability of people to continue to have access to the \nmedication that keeps them healthy.\n  While this debate has properly focused a lot of attention on \nuninsured seniors and their daily struggle to pay for needed \nmedications, the costs of prescription drugs affect every American--\neven those with health insurance coverage. Drug spending is a growing \npart of our overall health care costs. The rising cost of prescription \ndrugs is one of the biggest problems facing health plans, hospitals and \nothers in the health care field.\n  Obviously, American drug companies have to pay for this huge amount \nof research and development and the years that it takes to get these \ndrugs licensed. But, what I am outraged about is a set of foreign \npolicies that means that Americans who by drugs that were developed in \nAmerica pay substantially more for those drugs than the same \nmanufacturers sell--them for in Canada or Mexico. I think that is \nunconscionable. Those countries are riding on our research and \ndevelopment.\n  The cost issue is one important part of the debate as we talk about \nmodernizing the Medicare program to include a prescription drug \nbenefit. I do think that Medicare should be updated and that \nprescription drugs should be covered under the program. Expanding this \nbenefit, however, must be done responsibly--it must not jeopardize the \nsolvency of the current program and that benefits now available to \nseniors. It is also fairly contentious. Most agree that we should add a \ndrug benefit to Medicare, however, good people have honest \ndisagreements about the best way to do it. Addressing cost is something \nwe can do now.\n  It is no fair to the American consumer to let other countries get \naway with policies that make drug companies sell their products cheaper \nin their country because they don't want to pay for any of the \ndevelopment costs. It's not right, and I will work actively to see that \nAmericans are not overcharged.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in 1791, the State of Vermont, the State \nthat I am honored to represent, was admitted to the Union. Kentucky \nfollowed. Congress then saw fit to change the design of the American \nflag for a time to include 15 stars and 15 stripes, one for each State. \nIt was this flag, the one recognizing the addition of Vermont to the \nUnion, that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814, and inspired Francis Scott \nKey to write the Star Spangled Banner.\n  Along with Vermonters and many others I find that flag inspirational, \nas I do the American flag with 48 stars under which my family fought in \nWorld War II. I remember the great pride my wife and I felt seeing the \ncurrent American flag with 50 stars being carried in formation at Paris \nIsland when my youngest son became the newest member of the U.S. Marine \nCorps.\n  Fifty years after that famous battle that inspired our national \nanthem in Baltimore's harbor, President Abraham Lincoln visited that \ncity as this country confronted its greatest test. It was a time in \nwhich this nation faced grave peril from a civil war whose outcome \ncould not yet be determined. Many flags flew over various parts of the \nUnited States and our existence as a nation was in doubt. President \nLincoln used the occasion to reflect on a basic feature of American \ndemocracy.\n  As Professor James McPherson recently reminded us, Lincoln observed: \n``The world has never had a good definition of the word liberty. And \nthe American people just now are much in need of one. We all declare \nfor liberty, but using the same word we do not mean the same thing.''\n  Through the course of this debate, it has seemed to me that all of us \nhere in this chamber would champion liberty. If any of us were asked, \nwe would say: Of course we do. When I listen to the debate, I have to \nconclude that Lincoln's wish for a definition on which all of us would \nagree remains very elusive.\n  Ultimately, the debate over this amendment turns on the scope we \nthink proper to give to speech which deeply offends us. For Congress to \nlimit expression because of its offensive content is to strike at the \nheart of the First Amendment. Justice Holmes wrote that the most \nimperative principle of our Constitution was that it protects not just \nfreedom for the thought and expression we agree with, but ``freedom for \nthe thought that we hate.'' He also wrote, that ``we should be \neternally vigilant against attempts to check the expression of opinions \nthat we loathe.''\n  Justice Robert Jackson made this point with unsurpassed eloquence in \na 1943 decision, West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette. \nUnlike that small handful of wartime decisions upholding flag burning \nstatutes on which the proponents try to base their claim of an \nexpansive judicial tradition before the Johnson case, the Supreme \nCourt, even in 1943, during the difficult days of World War II, \nrecognized the fundamental tradition of tolerance that makes this \ncountry strong. The Supreme Court in a very difficult decision, at the \nheight of world War II held that State school boards may not compel \ntheir teachers and students to salute the flag. Justice Jackson wrote:\n\n       To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic \n     ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous instead of a \n     compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the \n     appeal of our institutions to free minds.\n       We can have intellectual individualism and the rich \n     cultural diversities that we owe to exceptional minds only at \n     the price of occasional eccentricity and abnormal attitudes. \n     When they are so harmless to others or to the State as those \n     we deal with here, the price is not too great. But freedom to \n     differ is not limited to things that do not matter much. That \n     would be a mere shadow of freedom. The test of its substance \n     is the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of \n     the existing order.\n       If there is any fixed star in our constitutional \n     constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can \n     prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, \n     religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to \n     confess by word or act their faith therein.\n\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\n\n  What unifies our country is the voluntary sharing of ideals and \ncommitments. We can do our share toward that end by responding to crude \ninsults with a responsible action that will justify respect and \nallegiance that has been freely given. Justice Brennan wrote in \nJohnson:\n\n       We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a \n     flag than waving one's own.\n\n  That is exactly how the American people respond.\n  Respect cannot be coerced. It can only be given voluntarily. Some may \nfind it more comfortable to silence dissenting voices, but coerced \nsilence can only create resentment, disrespect, and disunity. You don't \nstamp out a bad idea by repressing it; you stamp it out with a better \nidea.\n  My better idea is to fly the flag at home, not because the law tells \nme to; not because there is something that says this is what I have to \ndo to show respect; I do it because, as an American, I want to.\n  I am immensely proud of being one of the two Senators who has been \ngiven the opportunity to represent the State of Vermont. I fly that \nflag out of pride. Frankly, I am an ornery enough Vermonter that if \nthere were a law that said as a Senator I had to fly that flag, I would \nnot do it. I do it because I want to do it.\n  It is with the same sense of pride that I saw my son march in uniform \nwith that flag flying. It is the same sense of pride when I see that \nflag flying over this Capitol Building every day when I drive to work.\n  The French philosopher Voltaire once remarked that liberty is a guest \nwho plants both of his elbows on the table. I think what he meant by \nthat is that liberty is sometimes an unruly, even an unmannerly and \nvulgar guest. Liberty demands we be tolerant even when it is hard to do \nso.\n  Our freedoms in this country are protected by the constitutional \nguarantee that dissent must be tolerated whether it is expressed in \npolite and deferential tones or in a crude and repugnant manner. We are \na mature enough political community to know what every child knows: \nUnlike sticks and stones, words and expressions need not hurt us. It \ncertainly does not justify the loss of rights that protect the \nliberties of us all.\n  Especially despicable gestures are hard to tolerate, but we do so \nbecause political expression is so central to what makes America great \nand what protects the rights of each of us to speak, to worship as we \nchoose, and to petition our Government for redress.\n  As I have said before, I have taken such pride in going to countries \nwith dictators, countries that require a law to protect their flags and \ntheir symbols, and in saying: We do not need such a law in our country \nbecause in this great Nation of a quarter of a billion people, the \npeople protect our symbols, not because they are forced to do so but \nbecause they want to do so.\n  I was brought up to believe the first amendment is the most important \npart of our democracy. It allows us to practice any religion we want or \nno religion if we want. It allows us to say what we want, and the \nGovernment cannot stop us.\n  What does that mean? It means we are going to have diversity--\ndiversity in religion, diversity in thought, diversity in speech, \ndiversity that is guaranteed and protected in this Nation. And when you \nguarantee and protect diversity, then you guarantee and protect a \ndemocracy, because no real democracy exists without diversity. When you \nexclude and stamp out diversity, then I guarantee, you stamp out \ndemocracy, whether it is the Taliban or any of the totalitarian \ngovernments of history. If diversity, dissent, and free speech are \nstamped out, democracy goes with them.\n  American democracy has succeeded because we have found a way to live \nwith that unruly guest with his elbows on our table of which Voltaire \nspoke, and to acknowledge acts which are disrespectful and crude and \nmay, nonetheless, be lawful.\n  We protect dissent because we love liberty, not because we oppose \nliberty, but because we love it. The very impiety of these acts puts us \nto the test as votaries of liberty.\n  Wendell Phillips, the great New England abolitionist, wrote:\n\n       The community which dares not to protect its humblest and \n     most hated member in the free utterance of his opinion, no \n     matter how false and hateful, is only a gang of slaves.\n\n  No man disagreed more vehemently with Wendell Phillips on the burning \nissues of their day than Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina. Yet \nSenator Calhoun came to much the same conclusion in a speech on the \nSenate floor in 1848--more than 150 years ago. He said:\n\n       We have passed through so many difficulties and dangers \n     without the loss of liberty that we have begun to think that \n     we hold it by divine right from heaven itself. But it is \n     harder to preserve than it is to obtain liberty. After years \n     of prosperity, the tenure by which it is held is but too \n     often forgotten; and I fear, Senators, that such is the case \n     with us.\n\n  I represent a State that has a proud tradition of defending liberty, \na State that encourages open debate. We are the State of the town \nmeeting. You have never heard open debate, whether as a Member of this \ngreat body or the other legislative body, until you have been to a \nVermont town meeting. There is debate, there are expressions, there is \nheat, and there is often light.\n  I am proud that in 1995, the Vermont Legislature chose the first \namendment over the temptation to make a politically popular endorsement \nof a constitutional amendment regarding the flag. The Vermont House \npassed a resolution urging respect for the flag and also recognizing \nthe value of protecting free speech ``both benign and overtly \noffensive.'' Our Vermont Attorney General has urged that we trust the \nConstitution, not the passions of the times.\n  But Vermont's actions are consistent with our strong tradition of \nindependence and commitment to the Bill of Rights. Indeed, Vermont's \nown constitution is based on our commitment to freedom and our belief \nthat it is best protected by open debate. In fact, Vermont did not join \nthe Union until the Bill of Rights was ratified and part of this \ncountry's fundamental charter.\n  We are the 14th State in this Union. But we waited because we were so \nprotective of our own liberty. At one time, we declared ourselves an \nindependent republic. We wanted to make sure our people had their \nliberties protected. We in Vermont waited until the Bill of Rights was \npart of the Constitution.\n  Following that tradition, this Vermonter is not going to vote to \namend the Bill of Rights for the first time since it was adopted, and \ncertainly not going to be the first Vermonter to do that.\n  Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to Congress. He cast the decisive vote of \nVermont for the election of Thomas Jefferson when that election was \nthrown into the House of Representatives. He was the same House Member \nwho was the target of a shameful prosecution under the Sedition Act in \n1789 for comments made in a private letter. He was locked up.\n  Vermont showed what they thought of the Sedition Act. They showed \nwhat they thought of trying to stifle free speech. Vermont said: Fine, \nMatthew Lyon is in jail. We will still reelect him to Congress. And, by \nGod, we did. Why? Because we are saying: Do not trample on our right of \nfree speech.\n  Vermont served the Nation again in the dark days of McCarthyism when \nI think probably one of the most remarkable and praiseworthy actions of \nany Vermont Senator, certainly in the 20th century--the outstanding \nVermont Senator, Senator Ralph Flanders--he stood up for democracy in \nopposition to the repressive tactics of Joseph McCarthy. When so many \nothers ran for cover in both parties--both Republicans and Democrats--\nSenator Ralph Flanders of Vermont, the quintessential Republican, \nconservative, a businessman, came to the floor of the Senate and said \nenough is enough, and asked for the censure of Senator McCarthy.\n\n  Vermont's is a great tradition that we cherish. It is one that I \nintend to uphold.\n  The New York Times had it right earlier this week when it wrote in \nits editorial, on Monday:\n\n       If the Senate truly respected the Constitution it is sworn \n     to uphold, it would not be trifling with the Bill of Rights \n     and its precious guarantee of freedom of speech. Yet that is \n     exactly what the Senate is doing as it considers the so-\n     called flag desecration amendment--a mischievous addition to \n     the Constitution that would weaken the right of free \n     expression by allowing federal laws banning physical \n     desecration of the flag.\n\n  The Washington Post also opposed this amendment in a recent \neditorial.\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n It noted that flag burning is ``only one among many types of offensive \nexpression that the First Amendment has protected throughout American \nhistory.'' Then they added:\n\n       The principle that ``Congress shall make no law'' \n     restricting speech loses much of its power when exceptions \n     begin turning the ``no'' into ``only a few.'' The political \n     points senators win by supporting this amendment are not \n     worth the cost.\n\n  The first amendment says: ``Congress shall make no law.'' It does not \nsay: Congress shall not make a bunch of laws or Congress shall not make \nsome laws or Congress shall not make little laws versus big laws \nrestricting speech, or Congress should not make laws on Monday versus \nFriday restricting speech.\n  It says: ``Congress shall make no law.''\n  I remember being at an oral argument in the U.S. Supreme Court when I \nwas a young law student, and Hugo Black was saying: I read the \nConstitution, which says ``Congress shall make no laws'', to mean \n``Congress shall make no laws.'' I find it pretty clear.\n  The Chicago Tribune said this:\n\n       The amendment is a gross overreaction to a non-problem. \n     Incidents of flag burning are exceedingly rare, and they do \n     no harm beyond causing legitimate disgust among patriotic \n     Americans. Disgust, however, is not an adequate reason to \n     take the extraordinary step of altering the nation's founding \n     document--and altering it to curtail one of our most \n     fundamental liberties.\n\n  So many times I read editorials from the Washington Times, especially \nthose that say that Congress takes, too often, a liberal bend. The \nWashington Times today said this in their editorial--and they oppose \nthis amendment--they said they oppose it because ``it would be the only \nstanding constitutional amendment to expand--not curtail--the power of \nthe federal government.''\n  They went on to say:\n\n       Laws reflect a nation's culture and Constitution. Both \n     govern a people's relationship with the government. \n     Sometimes, however, the two collide and the nation's leaders \n     must decide between expressing the culture through law or \n     abiding by constitutional restraints that limit government \n     powers to do so. . . . The founders adopted the first 10 \n     amendments, now called the Bill of Rights, as more than \n     simply limits on Government's power, but rather an \n     enumeration of rights on which Government could not trample.\n\n  Think of that. They are not saying, here are some extra powers we \nhave in the Government. Rather, they are saying no to the Federal \nGovernment. These are rights you cannot step on. These are rights that \nbelong only to the American people. These are rights that do not belong \nto a government. They do not belong to the Congress, to the executive \nbranch, or the judicial branch. They belong to all of us, today a \nquarter of a billion proud Americans.\n  The Washington Times went on to say:\n\n       Conservatives in the Senate should take this opportunity to \n     burn a flag--the white flag the faint-of-heart seem to fly on \n     every tough issue. It is time to say, ``We trust the American \n     people with their flag''--with a vote against this \n     constitutional amendment.\n\n  That is what I say: Trust the American people. The vast majority of \nthe people in this great country are patriotic. They respect the \nsymbols of our Government. There isn't a rash of flag burning around \nthe Nation. You don't see people running out to do it because we \nrespect our flag, we respect our Nation, and we don't need a law to \ntell us to do that. In fact, that respect is diminished if we are told \nwe have to respect the symbols of our Government rather than doing it \nfrom our heart.\n  Through this debate this week, some proponents of the constitutional \namendment expressed their view that this is a nation in moral decline \nand that amending the Constitution to punish flag burning is thereby \njustified. I disagree. I would not put down the United States that way. \nI believe this Nation is strong. I believe there is far more civic \nvirtue to the American people than some credit. I know that is the case \nin my State of Vermont. I know it when I go on line each week with the \nchildren of our State in grade schools and high schools around Vermont \nanswering their questions. I sense a civic pride. I do not sense a \nmoral decline. I sense a great nation moving into an even greater \ncentury.\n  I am not a fan of what in some quarters passes for culture nowadays, \nbut let us not have a constitutional amendment to lash out at crude \ncultural influences. Let us discuss the issue of civic virtue. In fact, \nwe in the Senate play a role, an important one, in setting the level of \ncivic virtue in this Nation. So maybe a good place to start would be \nwith ourselves and with our institution. It is not just what we say \nhere that is important; it is what we do here.\n  Instead of telling the American people, the rest of the American \npeople beyond the 100 here, what they can and cannot do, maybe we \nshould talk about what we do and how we do it. We honor America when we \nin the Senate do our jobs, when we work on the matters that can improve \nthe lives of ordinary Americans.\n  I began this debate by urging the Senate to conclude action on the \njuvenile crime conference. I urged the Senate to vote on increasing the \nminimum wage, to confirm judges our courts and people need. We have 77 \nvacancies today. I urged the Senate to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights \nand privacy legislation and other legislation that can make a \ndifference today. Then we set an example for the Nation. As this debate \nconcludes and after we vote on this, let us return to that hope and \nmessage.\n  Ours is a time of relative peace and prosperity. We should praise \nthat. Because of that, it is certainly not the time, if there is any, \nto tinker with the fundamental framework that has helped make this \ncountry the land of opportunity and diversity and vitality it has been \nfor more than 200 years.\n  The proposed amendment to the Constitution would do harm to the first \namendment--protections that gird us all against oppression, especially \noppression of momentary majority thought. It violates the precept laid \ndown more than 200 years ago that ``he that would make his own liberty \nsecure must guard even his enemy from oppression.'' It undercuts the \nprinciple that a free society is a society where it is safe to be \nunpopular. A nation may lose its liberties in an instant of imposed \northodoxy.\n\n  I am sure many of us have read the letter written in 1787 by Thomas \nJefferson in which he observed:\n\n       If it were left to me to decide whether we should have a \n     government without newspapers, or newspapers without a \n     government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the \n     latter.\n\n  For me, presented with the stark choice between an undefiled flag and \nan undefiled Bill of Rights, I, too, must choose the latter.\n  If somebody were to cruelly desecrate the flag I proudly fly at my \nhome, then I would replace that flag. I would buy a new flag. But if \nsomebody misplaces, changes, or diminishes the Bill of Rights that \nprotects me, protects the other 99 Senators, that protects a quarter of \na billion Americans, I can't replace that. I can't go to the store and \nbuy a new Bill of Rights. I cannot start the process of 200 years ago \nover again. I cannot go back and say, because we have spent 200 years \ngrowing and maturing as a nation in protecting our rights under the \nBill of Rights, now we can ignore all that because we have changed the \nBill of Rights.\n  Don't diminish it. There are a lot of things that are unpopular, but \nwe protect them. I think of the debate when I was a young prosecutor. \nDecisions would come down saying you had to warn criminal suspects of \ntheir rights--first the Escobedo case and then the Miranda case. I \nremember people, both in law enforcement and outside, saying we have to \namend the Constitution. Some said we had to impeach the whole Supreme \nCourt. We have to amend the Constitution. How dare they say these \ncriminals must be warned of their rights? We want to be warned of our \nrights because we are not criminals. But the guilty accused have to be \nwarned of their rights? What a terrible idea.\n  We got through that. What happened? Training of law enforcement got a \nlot better. The police got a lot better, the courts got a lot better, \nthe prosecutors got a lot better, and our Nation got better. Today \nthere are still people who are arrested or stopped by the police who \nare totally innocent, and they have their rights. They can stand on \nthose rights. How many times have we said: I am an American; I have my \nrights? Well, it is true. We have wonderful rights in this country. \nThat is why we are the strongest democracy in the world. Let's not \ndiminish those rights.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  Ours is a powerful constitution, all the more inspiring because of \nwhat it allows and because we protect each other's liberty. Let us be \ngood stewards. Let us leave for our children and our children's \nchildren a constitution with freedoms as great as those bequeathed to \nus by the founders, patriots and hard-working Americans who preceded \nus. If we do that, successive generations will bless us, they will \npraise us, we will have a stronger nation.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention and courtesy and yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, we have had a productive and educational \ndebate concerning our proposed constitutional amendment to protect the \nflag. We have considered--and defeated by overwhelming votes--two \nsignificant amendments which were aimed at the heart of this amendment. \nA clear majority of the Senate has its mind made up on this resolution, \nand it is proper that we are now preceding to a vote.\n  The events of the last three days could cause one to question the \ndepth of feeling my colleagues have for their argument that this flag \nprotection constitutional amendment would erode free speech rights \nguaranteed by the first amendment. Many of these same Senators have \ndenounced flag desecration and voted for statutes which would allegedly \nprotect the flag. In 1989, the Congress responded to the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Texas v. Johnson, which held that State flag \nprotection statutes were unconstitutional, by enacting the Flag \nProtection Act. Ninety-one Senators--let me repeat, 91 Senators--voted \nin favor of that statute, which provided that:\n\n       Whoever knowingly mutilates, defaces, physically defiles, \n     burns, maintains on the ground, or tramples upon any flag of \n     the United States shall be fined under this title or \n     imprisoned for not more than one year, or both.\n\n  That was the statute that 91 Senators in this body in 1989 voted for.\n  Clearly, 91 Senators believed in 1989 that flag desecration should be \nstopped; that people who knowingly mutilate, deface, physically defile, \nburn, or trample upon any flag of the United States should be prevented \nfrom engaging in this sort of conduct. Clearly, 91 Senators believed in \n1989 that prohibiting flag desecration would in no way erode free \nspeech rights guaranteed by the first amendment, and voted for the bill \nin response to a Supreme Court decision that had said otherwise.\n  I remember those arguments. We can do this by statute. We have had \nthe same arguments in this debate, all of which are just as specious as \nthey were back then.\n  Yet, of those 91 Senators who voted to outlaw flag desecration in \n1989 to prohibit this form of expressive conduct, 18 who are still here \nwill vote against the flag protection constitutional amendment. In \nother words, of the more than 30 opponents of the proposed \nconstitutional amendment, 18 voted in 1989 to prohibit flag \ndesecration.\n  Let me read directly from the joint resolution, the constitutional \nresolution:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  In other words, we want to give them the power so that they can, \nagain, vote for their beloved statute. They can't vote for it now \nbecause it would be declared unconstitutional again. I think the \nlimited version presented here, the McConnell statute, which would not \ndo much to begin with, is likewise unconstitutional.\n  The point was that 18 of those who will vote against the flag \nprotection constitutional amendment today, at least 18 of the more than \n30 opponents of this proposed constitutional amendment, voted in 1989 \nto prohibit flag desecration.\n  Just yesterday we voted on whether to adopt the Flag Protection Act \nof 1999. That is a more narrow flag desecration statute offered by \nSenator McConnell. Now some Senators voted against Senator McConnell's \namendment because they do not believe flag desecration is a problem in \nour society, that it is too trivial of an issue for the Senate even to \nconsider. Other Senators, including myself, voted against the McConnell \namendment because we believe that under the Supreme Court precedents, \nand given the present composition of the Court, it would be struck down \nas the other statutes were. Yet 36 Senators voted in favor of the \nMcConnell amendment, a statute prohibiting flag desecration. Clearly, \nthese 36 Senators do not believe that prohibiting flag desecration will \nerode free speech rights guaranteed by the first amendment. Of these 36 \nSenators, 30 have indicated they will vote against the flag protection \nconstitutional amendment today.\n  I must ask these Senators: Do you believe in flag protection or not? \nOr are you just playing political games? If they do believe in flag \nprotection, they should vote for this constitutional amendment, which \nis the only constitutional way of protecting our flag. If not, they \nshould have the courage to repudiate the votes they cast yesterday, in \n1995, and in 1989, and to admit that they do not want to prohibit flag \ndesecration in any way. They can't have it both ways unless they are \njust playing politics. I would never accuse anybody in this body of \ndoing something as denigrating as playing politics.\n  Some of my colleagues contend our country has achieved greatness in \nits two centuries of existence because they say we value tolerance over \nall else. Yes, we are tolerant of everything that is rotten and we are \nintolerant of many things that are good. They say if we pass this \nconstitutional amendment and then adopt legislation prohibiting flag \ndesecration, we will become Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, Cuba, and a \nhost of other repressive and dictatorial regimes that do ban \ndesecration of their respective flags. They even suggest we will become \nlike South Africa during apartheid or like Nazi Germany if we protect \nour flag. This argument is not only specious, it is absolutely \nridiculous. It is insulting.\n  Indeed, I must say their argument is full of historical revisionism. \nThe United States of America prohibited desecration of the American \nflag during the first two centuries of its existence. If this \nconstitutional amendment is adopted and implementing legislation is \npassed, the United States of America will not somehow become an \nintolerant, repressive, dictatorial police state. No, the United States \nof America's laws will be just as they were for over 200 years before \nthis lousy decision by five people on the Supreme Court, versus four, \nshowing it was hotly contested. Even they weren't sure what they were \ndoing.\n  I find that a sense of elitism is creeping into the Senate. In fact, \nI don't fear it, I know that is the case. We have amongst us people who \nseem to think the Senate has more important things to do than to listen \nto, and act on, the views of the overwhelming majority of American \ncitizens who want the flag protection constitutional amendment. I find \nthis elitism profoundly troubling. As a matter of fact, all we are \nasking is for this body to give a two-thirds vote, as the House did, so \nwe can submit this to the people in the respective States and let them \ndecide once and for all whether or not they want to protect the flag.\n  The American people do not believe that the flag of the United States \nof America is just a piece of cloth or just another symbol. The \nAmerican people know that the flag is the embodiment of our heritage, \nour liberties, and indeed our sovereignty as a nation, as Madison \nindicated--the author of the Constitution. The American people are \ndeeply offended and morally outraged when they see the flag humiliated \nand the Government powerless to defend it.\n  I have heard both sides of this debate cite leaders in the military, \nand I am sure that some of these people who are opposed to our \namendment today are good people. But let me quote Gen. Norman \nSchwarzkopf, commander of U.S. and allied forces during the gulf war. \nHe wrote:\n\n       The flag remains the single, preeminent connection to each \n     other and to our country. Legally sanctioned flag desecration \n     can only serve to further undermine this national unity and \n     identity that must be preserved.\n\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\n\n  There are tens of thousands of veterans living in our country today \nwho have put their lives on the line to defend our flag and the \nprinciples for which it stands. Those are the fortunate ones who were \nnot required to make the ultimate sacrifice. For every one of those, \nthere is someone who has traded the life of a loved one in exchange for \na flag, folded at a funeral. Let's think about that trade--and about \nthe people who made that trade for us--before deciding whether the flag \nis important enough to be addressed by the Senate.\n  Let's think about the meaning of majority rule before we dismiss the \nfeelings of the American public. Would it really trivialize the \nConstitution, as some of these critics suggest, to pass an amendment \nthat is supported by the vast majority of Americans? The Constitution \nitself establishes the process for its own amendment. It says that the \nConstitution will be amended when two-thirds of the Congress and three-\nfourths of the States want to do so. It does not say that this \nprocedure is reserved for issues that some law professors, or even some \nSenators, think are important. If government by the people means \nanything, it means that the people can decide the fundamental questions \nconcerning the checks and balances in our government. It means the \npeople can choose whether flag desecration is against the law. The \npeople have said they want Congress to protect the American flag.\n  Because the flag amendment reflects the will of the people, I believe \npassage and ratification of this amendment is ultimately inevitable. It \nmay not pass the Senate today, but it will pass the Senate. The votes \nin the past few years demonstrate that momentum--as well as the \nfulfillment of duty--is on our side. In 1989, 51 Senators voted for the \namendment. That was it, 51. In 1990, there were 58 votes in favor. In \n1995, 63 Senators voted for the amendment. And, today, we hope we will \nat least get that many. We have had some reversals, as you have seen. \nBut the trend of support will continue until we get the 67 needed to \npass this resolution and send the constitutional amendment to the \nStates for ratification. I personally will not stop fighting for the \nflag amendment until it passes the Senate with the requisite two-thirds \nvote.\n  I came up the hard way. I had to earn everything I have, and I have \nearned it the hard way. I learned a trade as a young man. I worked as a \njanitor to get through school. I have never been part of the elite, and \nI wouldn't be there if I could be. I have to tell you, this place is \nfilled with elitism among those who are voting against this amendment \ntoday.\n  Frankly, I get a little tired of the elitism in this country. It is \nthroughout our country, and it is elitism that is allowing the savaging \nof our values to occur today in this country. It is the elite who are \nbasically upholding things that force us to be tolerant, as they say, \nof some of the very offensive acts that occur in our society. They say \nwe should be tolerant, not to do anything about people who defecate on \nour flag or urinate on our flag or burn our flag with contempt or \ntrample on it. They don't seem to see any real problem with that, \nalthough they condemn it vociferously without doing one doggone thing \nabout changing this culture and letting the American people know we are \ngoing to stand for something.\n\n  What better thing can you stand for, other than your families--and \nthis is part of standing for families in my book--what better thing to \nstand for than standing up for this national symbol that unites us and \nbrings us together? Just think about it.\n  In conclusion, the flag amendment is the very essence of government \nby the people because it reflects the people's decision to give \nCongress a power that the Supreme Court has taken away on a 5-4 vote. \nThe four who voted against the five--in other words voted to uphold the \nright of the Federal Government and the States to ban desecration of \nthe flag--those four fought very hard for their point of view. They \nhappen to be right.\n  I urge all my fellow Senators to do the right thing for the American \npeople. I urge everybody in America to hold us responsible for not \ndoing so. I am asking the folks out there in America to start getting \nexcited about this. If we could pass this amendment through the Senate, \nsince the House has already done it, I guarantee we would create the \nbiggest debate on values this country has seen in years in every one of \nour 50 States. If we did that, that alone would justify everything we \nare talking about today, let alone standing up for the greatest symbol \nof any country in the world today. I think we ought to do it. I hope my \nfellow Senators will do the right thing and vote for this resolution so \nthe people, through their State legislatures, can decide for themselves \nwhether or not they want their elected representatives to enact a law \nprohibiting the physical desecration of the American flag.\n  We know we do not have the votes today, but we are not going to stop \nuntil this amendment is approved. Sooner or later we will get enough \npeople here who feel strongly enough about this to get the \nconstitutional amendment passed. I venture to say, if we could pass \nthis constitutional amendment, at least 38 States--and, frankly, I \nthink all 50 States would ratify this amendment--I believe the people \nout there would ratify this amendment and we would have more than 80 \npercent in the end, and people would feel very good about it.\n  I know one thing, those seven Congressional Medal of Honor recipients \nwho were standing with us yesterday as we had a press conference on \nthis, it would make their lives, as it would for all these veterans \nthroughout this country who have sacrificed for you and me that we \nmight be free. I would like to see that happen. If it does not happen \ntoday, don't worry, we will be back because we are not going to quit \nuntil we win on this amendment. When we do, it will be a great thing \nfor this country.\n  I want to thank the dedicated staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfor their hard work on this important proposed constitutional \namendment--S.J. Res. 14. In particular, I would like to commend Alex \nDahl, Catherine Campbell, Kyle Sampson, and Ed Haden. These fine \nlawyers and professional staff spent countless hours getting us to this \npoint. I also want to thank the committee's chief counsel, Manus \nCooney, for his assistance and counsel. On the minority side, let me \nacknowledge Bruce Cohen for his professionalism and spirited \nopposition.\n  Many other staffers were helpful including Jim Hecht and Stewart \nVerdery of our leadership staff. I think these staffers know that this \ndebate was an important one and one of significance.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 14. It is with great honor and reverence that I speak in \nsupport of this resolution, a bipartisan constitutional amendment to \npermit Congress to enact legislation prohibiting the physical \ndesecration of the American flag.\n  Let me explain my support by recalling the sacrifice for flag and \ncountry of a prisoner of war I had the honor of serving with.\n  I spent 5\\1/2\\ years at the Hanoi Hilton. In the early years of our \nimprisonment, the North Vietnamese kept us in solitary confinement of \ntwo or three to a cell. In 1971, the North Vietnamese moved us from \nthese conditions of isolation into large rooms with as many as 30 to 40 \nmen to a room. This was, as you can imagine, a wonderful change. And it \nwas a direct result of the efforts of millions of Americans, led by \npeople like Ross Perot, and Nancy and Ronald Reagan, on behalf of a few \nhundred POW's, 10,000 miles from home.\n  One of the men who moved into my cell was Mike Christian. Mike came \nfrom Selma, Alabama. He didn't wear a pair of shoes until he was 13 \nyears old. At 17, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. He later earned a \ncommission. He became a Naval aviator, and was shot down and captured \nin 1967. Mike had a keen and deep appreciation for the opportunities \nthis country--and our military--provide for people who want to work and \nwant to succeed.\n\n[[Page S1868]]\n\n  The uniforms we wore in prison consisted of a blue short-sleeved \nshirt trousers that looked like pajamas and rubber sandals that were \nmade out of automobile tires.\n  As part of the change in treatment, the Vietnamese allowed some \nprisoners to receive packages from home. In some of these packages were \nhandkerchiefs, scarves and other items of clothing. Mike got himself a \npiece of white cloth and a piece of red cloth and fashioned himself a \nbamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he sewed the \nAmerican flag on the inside of his shirt.\n  Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's \nshirt on the wall of our cell, and say the Pledge of Allegiance. I know \nthat saying the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important or \nmeaningful part of our day now. But I can assure you that--for those \nmen in that stark prison cell--it was indeed the most important and \nmeaningful event of our day.\n  One day, the Vietnamese searched our cell and discovered Mike's shirt \nwith the flag sewn inside, and removed it. That evening they returned, \nopened the door of the cell, called for Mike Christian to come out, \nclosed the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat \nMike Christian severely.\n  Then they opened the door of the cell and threw him back inside. He \nwas not in good shape. We tried to comfort and take care of him as well \nas we could. The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the \nmiddle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of \nthe room.\n\n  After things quieted down, I went to lie down to go to sleep. As I \ndid, I happened to look in the corner of the room. Sitting there \nbeneath that dim light bulb, with a piece of white cloth, a piece of \nred cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend Mike \nChristian, sitting there, with his eyes almost shut from his beating, \nmaking another American flag. He was not making that flag because it \nmade Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he \nknew how important it was for us to be able to pledge our allegiance to \nour flag and our country.\n  I believe we have an inviolable duty to protect the right of free \nspeech--one of our most precious inalienable rights and the linchpin of \na healthy democracy. I do not believe, however, that guaranteeing \nrespect for our national symbol by prohibiting ``acts'' of desecration \nimpinges on political ``speech.''\n  As long as citizens are free to speak out on any matter and from \nwhatever point of view they wish, as our forefathers intended, it does \nnot seem burdensome to me that we accord some modicum of respect to the \nsymbol of those precious freedoms for which so many of our countrymen \nhave laid down their lives.\n  Some view these efforts to protect the flag as political demagoguery \nor empty symbolism. I see the issue differently. The flag represents \neach and every one of us, regardless of race, religion or political \ndiversity. Tolerating desecration of the flag is silent acquiescence to \nthe degeneration of the broader values which sustain us as a free and \ndemocratic nation--the ramifications of which are far more profound \nthan mere symbolism.\n  For these reasons, I support this constitutional amendment to ban \nflag desecration. I voted for such language in previous Congresses, but \nunfortunately, we have always fallen short of the 67 affirmative votes \nnecessary for approval.\n  Whenever we send our young men and women into harm's way, we must \nremember that these same men and women have taken a solemn oath which \nthis flag symbolizes. Let us honor their commitment and honor our great \nnation. I urge my colleagues to support the flag protection amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I cannot support the proposed \nconstitutional amendment.\n  The American flag is the premier icon of our national freedom. It is \nan irreplaceable reminder of liberty, sacrifice, and patriotism. To \ndeliberately desecrate or burn a flag is an insult to anyone who has \nfought to defend it. But to deliberately weaken the First Amendment \nrights of all Americans cannot be the answer to those who attack a \nsymbol of freedom.\n  We love our flag for obvious reasons, and true Americans treat it \nwith respect. A person who destroys such an important symbol should \nface the scorn of all decent women and men. But we should not allow the \nmisguided actions of a few individuals to jeopardize the rights and \nfreedoms of all Americans.\n  The Supreme Court has ruled that such an attack on the flag is a \nprotected form of speech under the First Amendment to the Constitution.\n  If we pass this amendment, and the States ratify it, we alter the \nBill of Rights for the first time in our nation's history. For more \nthan 210 years, the Bill of Rights--which protects our most basic \nfreedoms--has served us well. Although I love the flag, I also love the \nBill of Rights and the Constitution. When we pledge allegiance to the \nflag, in the same breath, we pledge allegiance to the Republic for \nwhich it stands.\n  Mr. President, Senator John Glenn, a true American hero, reflected \nthese concerns in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee. He \nsaid:\n\n       [I]t would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the \n     symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental \n     freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the \n     freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial, \n     watered-down version that alters its protections.\n       The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional \n     symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most \n     revered symbol. But is it a symbol. It symbolizes the \n     freedoms we have in this country, but it is not the freedoms \n     themselves.\n\n  General Colin Powell has said:\n\n       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer \n     a few miscreants. The flag will be flying proudly long after \n     they have slunk away.\n\n  We should not alter the basic charter of our liberties just to \naddress the few incidences of flag burning in this country. Despite the \nattention it receives, flag burning is relatively infrequent. According \nto one expert, there have been only 200 reported incidences of flag \nburning in the history of our nation. That amounts to less than one \ncase per year. The Congressional Research Service has listed 43 flag \nincidents between January 1995 and January 1999.\n\n  Even if this constitutional amendment were adopted, and the physical \ndesecration of the flag were prohibited, it would not necessarily yield \nthe intended results: the preservation of our glorious symbol.\n  As the Port Huron Times Herald suggested on June 26, 1999, flag \ndesecration may not necessarily be flag burning, but the trivialization \nof the flag:\n\n       How glorifying is it to see the Stars and Stripes \n     emblazoned on paper napkins destined to be smeared with \n     ketchup and barbecue sauce and tossed in a trash can?\n       How respectful is it to wrap ourselves in Old Glory beach \n     towels? Sip our coffee from red, white and blue mugs? Start \n     our car from a flag-emblazoned key chain?\n       We shouldn't worry about people burning the flag. It just \n     doesn't happen. We should worry about trivializing a glorious \n     symbol into something as meaningless as a paper napkin.\n\n  I oppose the proposed constitutional amendment because it would amend \nour Bill of Rights for the first time, but I do support a statutory \nprohibition on flag desecration. The McConnell-Conrad-Dorgan statutory \napproach is preferable because it provides protection of the flag \nthrough enactment of a statute, and subsequently, does not weaken our \nFirst Amendment freedoms.\n  If we love the flag, we will not only preserve the sanctity of the \ncloth, but the freedoms for which it stands. No matter how abhorrent \nthe action of flag burning may be, I see great danger in amending the \nBill of Rights and curtailing freedoms enumerated in the Constitution, \nthe very documents that give our flag its meaning.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as an original co-sponsor of \nS.J. Res. 14, a resolution proposing that the Constitution be amended \nto permit Congress to enact statutes to protect against the physical \ndesecration of the American flag. Although it is rare that I support \namending our Constitution, in this instance the Supreme Court has made \nclear that a federal statute is incapable of protecting the national \nsymbol of America.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that every single Member of the Senate \nabhors the idea that someone would desecrate the American flag. Yet the \nvote\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\non this amendment will be far from unanimous. That is because many of \nmy colleagues believe that adoption of this amendment somehow \nrepresents an attack on the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of \nspeech. In my view, this amendment in no way threatens the freedoms \nembodied in the First Amendment.\n  The freedom of speech that is guaranteed in the first amendment of \nthe Constitution is not unlimited. The Supreme Court has long \nrecognized that the law must strike a balance between society's and \ngovernment's interest and the interests of the individual. More often \nthan not, the Court has come down on the side of the individual. \nHowever, the Court has recognized that society's interest in public \nsafety outweighs an individual's right to freely shout ``Fire'' in a \ncrowded theater. The Court has balanced society's interest in national \nsecurity with a speaker's interest in disclosure of state secrets and \nhas upheld restrictions on such speech.\n  By this amendment, we are not challenging the first amendment's \nguarantee of freedom of speech. Anyone in America is guaranteed the \nright to criticize nearly every aspect of American society and American \ngovernment. Nothing in this amendment precludes such speech.\n  Instead, this amendment speaks to the issue of desecrating the symbol \nof this country. A symbol that is recognizable throughout the world as \nthe symbol of this 224 year old democracy. A democracy that has asked \nits men and women to fight all over the world to preserve democracy and \nfreedom against tyranny.\n  When in 1989 the Supreme Court by a 5-4 decision struck down a Texas \nFlag desecration statute, Justice Stevens dissented and eloquently \nstated why the Court had reached the wrong conclusion about the First \nAmendment in this case. Let me quote Justice Stevens:\n\n       The Court is . . . quite wrong in blandly asserting that \n     respondent ``was prosecuted for his expression of \n     dissatisfaction with the policies of this country, expression \n     situated at the core our First Amendment values.'' Respondent \n     was prosecuted because of the method he chose to express his \n     dissatisfaction [burning an American Flag] with those \n     policies. Had he chosen to spray-paint--or perhaps convey \n     with a motion picture projector--his message of \n     dissatisfaction on the facade of the Lincoln Memorial, there \n     would be no question about the power of the Government to \n     prohibit his means of expression. The prohibition would be \n     supported by the legitimate interest in preserving the \n     quality of an important national asset. Though the asset at \n     stake in this case is intangible, given its unique value, the \n     same interest supports a prohibition on the desecration of \n     the American flag.\n\n  Would anyone disagree with Justice Stevens' suggestion that the first \namendment does not permit an individual to desecrate the Lincoln \nMemorial by spray painting his political views on the Memorial? Surely \nthat would be a criminal act and no one would suggest that the spray \npainter's first amendment rights had somehow been invaded.\n  Yet, I ask the question: What is the difference between barring \nsomeone from desecrating the Lincoln Memorial and barring someone from \ndesecrating the American flag? Why are the marble and mortar of the \nMemorial more important than the intangible values represented by the \nAmerican Flag? Does it make a difference that the American taxpayer \npaid for the construction and upkeep of the Memorial and therefore as \npublic property an act of desecration is actionable?\n  I do not think that the payment of taxes to construct and maintain \nthe Memorial should make a difference. Are we to compare the payment of \ntaxes to construct a Memorial with the sacrifice of the hundreds of \nthousands of men and women who fought in wars over two centuries to \npreserve the democratic ideals embodied in our Constitution? I think \nnot.\n  As I said earlier, I am not a frequent supporter of amending the \nConstitution. I would prefer that we adopted a statute to prevent flag \ndesecration. But those who argue for a statute ignore the fact that 11 \nyears ago Congress adopted a statute--the Flag Protection Act--which \noutlawed desecration of the flag. That Act was adopted in response to \nthe Supreme Court's decision striking down the Texas statute and along \nwith that state law, the state flag protection laws of 47 other states. \nUnfortunately, one year later, the Supreme Court struck down the Flag \nProtection Act, again by a 5-4 vote.\n  So the only realistic way that we can outlaw flag desecration is by \nadopting a Constitutional Amendment. Let the people of the 50 states \ndecide whether our flag deserves such protection. I urge my colleagues \nto support S.J Res. 14.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President. I rise today to explain my vote on the \nFlag Amendment. This is one of the most difficult votes I will have to \ncast during my tenure in the United States Senate. Words cannot fully \nexpress the anger I feel towards those who desecrate the American Flag. \nThe Flag is a symbol of what is great about our country. It is the \nstandard we rally around in war and in peace, in mourning and in \ncelebration and, ultimately, in life and in death. It unites us in our \npast and in our future. When someone desecrates the Flag, they in a \nsense strike at all of those things.\n  It is because I find desecrating the Flag to be so abhorrent and \ndespicable an act, that I will, as I have in the past, support using \nany statutory means possible to prohibit Flag desecration. But after \nthinking long and hard about this issue, I have decided that I will \nagain vote against this constitutional amendment. Although I recognize \nthat a statute cannot do the whole job, I cannot vote to amend the \nConstitution's Bill of Rights for the first time ever in a manner that \nwould restrict, rather than expand, individual liberties. In my view, \nhowever great a symbol the Flag is, our Constitution and its Bill of \nRights are all that and more. More than a symbol of liberty, they are \nliberty's real guardian and its true protector. They are not only what \nunites us, but also what keeps our more than 200-year-old experiment in \nself-government working. They are the best the Founders of this great \nnation left to us--a lasting testament to the Framers' brilliant \ninsight that for any people to remain truly free and capable of self-\ngovernment, that there must be some limits to what the State can do to \nregulate the speech and political behavior of its citizens. The Flag is \nan important symbol, but the Bill of Rights is what the Flag \nsymbolizes. We must be extremely cautious in altering the freedoms that \nthis great document guarantees, lest we diminish the ideals for which \nour Flag stands.\n  My former colleague Senator John Glenn--an individual whose \npatriotism and love of country none could doubt--expressed this view \nwell when he submitted a statement to the Judiciary Committee last \nApril. He explained:\n\n       The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional \n     symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most \n     revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the \n     freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the \n     freedoms themselves. That is why this debate is not between \n     those who love the flag on the one hand and those we do not \n     on the other. No matter how often some try to indicate \n     otherwise, everyone on both sides of this debate loves and \n     respects the flag. The question is, how best to honor it and \n     at the same time not take a chance of defiling what it \n     represents.\n\n  As General Colin Powell also recently so well put it: ``I would not \namend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The \nflag will be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.''\n  Of course I do not believe that our Constitution or its Bill of \nRights must remain forever unaltered. But the importance of the Bill of \nRights requires us to establish an exceedingly high threshold for \nagreeing to any amendment. For me, that threshold lies at the point \nwhere an amendment is shown to be necessary to address some extreme \nthreat to the Republic or redress some outrageous wrong. In this case, \nabhorrent though Flag desecration may be, it simply does not meet that \nthreshold.\n  I know that this is an issue that many feel passionately about. Many \nof my constituents have brought their views on this issue to me, and I \nwould like to take just a couple of minutes to address some of the \narguments they have made.\n  I have heard it argued that a vote for this amendment is merely a \nvote to let the People--through their state legislatures--decide the \nissue. Those who make this argument point to polls showing that as much \nas 75 to 80 percent of the American public support\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\nthe amendment. It frankly is unclear whether support is all that high. \nI have seen polls showing that a majority of Americans opposed the \namendment when they knew that it would be the first in our nation's \nhistory to restrict our First Amendment freedoms of speech and \nexpression. But more importantly, a decision on an issue as important \nas this one should not be made on the basis of polling. It is precisely \nbecause of the caution the Framers meant us to use in amending the \nConstitution, that they required supermajorities of both Houses of \nCongress as well as of the State legislatures to give their assent \nbefore our nation's foundational document could be altered. The Senate \nwas never meant to serve as a rubber stamp in this process, and so I \nowe it to the People of Connecticut, who have elected me to use my best \njudgment, to carefully consider issues before me, and to vote the way I \nbelieve to be correct.\n  Some also have suggested that it is not this Amendment that would be \nchanging the Bill of Rights or the First Amendment--that it was instead \nthe Supreme Court that did that when, in 1989, it overturned 200 years \nof precedent and found Flag desecration to be protected by the First \nAmendment. The history of this issue is more complicated than that. \nMost importantly, it's just not correct to say that the Supreme Court \nreversed 200 years of precedent. The first state Flag statute \napparently was not enacted until the end of the 19th Century, and there \nwas no federal Flag statute until 1968. Moreover, it's not really fair \nto say that the Supreme Court reversed any of its precedents in 1989, \nbecause before the 1989 Texas v. Johnson case, the Supreme Court never \naddressed this issue head on. In fact, in a number of cases throughout \nthe 20th Century dealing with people who treated the Flag in a manner \nthat offended others, the Supreme Court repeatedly either held the \nconduct to be protected by the First Amendment or found other reasons \nto overturn the convictions. For that reason, despite dicta in some of \nthese cases distinguishing them from pure Flag desecration, the dissent \nin Johnson had to acknowledge that ``Our prior cases dealing with flag \ndesecration statutes have left open the question that the Court \nresolves today.'' 491 U.S. 397, 432.\n  I must conclude that, abhorrent and despicable as I find desecrating \nthe Flag to be, I cannot vote to support this amendment. In the end, \nFlag desecration is hateful and worthy of condemnation, but I just \ncannot conclude that it threatens the Republic. For that reason, \nalthough I stand ready to support any statutory means possible to \ncurtail desecration of the Flag, I just cannot support amending our \nnation's foundational document to address it.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I join in this debate with mixed feelings.\n  On one hand, I am very frustrated we are here yet again, as we have \nbeen year after year for so long, trying to secure approval for this \nvery important amendment so that it can be sent to the states for \nratification. Time after time, we have come within just a few votes of \nsuccess. But, for whatever reason, those few votes have eluded us, and \nwe have had to go back to square one and begin the legislative process \nagain.\n  So I cannot approach this debate without a good measure of \nfrustration.\n  But on the other hand, the very fact that we are here again debating \nthis measure is reassuring. It is proof positive of the American \npeople's continuing belief in the importance of flag protection.\n  Imagine that. In spite of all the editorials about the erosion of \nideals, in spite of all the speeches, some on this very Senate floor, \nabout the loss of values in America, in spite of the dire predictions \nabout moral decline--in spite of all that, there is a strong and \ngrowing grassroots movement demanding protection of our Nation's most \nimportant symbol: our flag.\n  Why would we even hesitate to answer that call?\n  Millions of our fellow citizens are telling us that the sight or \nmention of our flag still has the power to awaken the spirit of the \nAmerican patriot. State legislatures are clamoring for the opportunity \nto protect the symbol of our national aspirations and values.\n  To those of my colleagues who are searching for signs of spring in a \nwinter of moral decay, let me say: look no further. Here is the sign. \nThis is the call. Now is the time to take a stand and support this \namendment.\n  I do not minimize the fears of those on the other side of this \ndebate. However, it is worth remembering that the U.S. Supreme Court \nhas not hesitated to draw constitutional lines around the kinds of \nspeech that are protected or not protected by the First Amendment. They \nhave found that in some cases, certain interests may outweigh the \ncitizen's right to free expression. As a result, laws may be enacted to \nrestrict those kinds of speech, such as ``fighting words'' or \nobscenity.\n  The Court chose not to exempt the behavior that came under scrutiny \nin the flag case. Frankly, I think they could have, and should have, \nreached a different result. But my point is that the Congress need not \nshrink from applying its own judgment to balancing the interests \ninvolved. In my opinion, flag protection serves a number of compelling \ninterests but would not prevent the expression of a single idea or \nmessage. I do not think the First Amendment must be or would be \ncompromised by protecting the flag from desecration.\n  Even so, it is also worth noting that what we do here today is only \nthe first step in a long process. This amendment must be ratified by \nthe states, and only after that will Congress fashion an actual flag \nprotection statute. Even if some of my colleagues are uncertain about \nhow to go about crafting legislation to protect the flag, I hope they \nwill all agree that it is appropriate to pass this resolution and give \nthe American people the opportunity they have demanded to consider this \nissue in the legislatures and town halls and across the kitchen tables \nof this great country.\n\n  Yesterday morning, I had the honor of addressing our Nation's \nveterans. As I stood before them, I thought of the long line of \npatriots throughout our history who have defended our flag--some with \nthe supreme sacrifice. Suddenly, the legal hairsplitting and fear-\nmongering over this issue seemed both trivial and insulting.\n  Millions of Americans understand, as these veterans do, that the flag \nis more than a scrap of cloth. It weaves people of diverse cultures \ntogether to form our Nation, just as surely as its threads are woven \ninto a pattern that stands for freedom throughout the world. It \ndeserves protection and can be protected without endangering any of the \nfundamental ideals it symbolizes.\n  Today, we can send a signal that we understand, that we agree, that \nwe honor the values that the American people have attached to our flag. \nI hope all our colleagues will join in voting in favor of this \nresolution and moving the flag protection constitutional amendment to \nthe states for ratification.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly on S.J. Res. 14, \nan amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  As my colleagues know, I will vote against this resolution just as I \nhave voted against previous attempts to pass anti-flag desecration \namendments during my tenure in the Senate. However, I take a back seat \nto no one in my respect for the flag, for what it stands for and, most \nimportantly, for the hundreds of thousands of brave men and women of \nour armed services who sacrificed so much to defend this Nation, our \nConstitution, and, yes, or flag. I abhor the desecration of the flag as \na form of expressing views about America or a policy of our government. \nThat is why I supported an amendment by Senator McConnell that would \nprohibit most, if not all, incidents of flag desecration by statutorily \nbanning the desecration of a flag if it is done with the intent to \nincite or produce imminent violence or breach of the peace, or if the \nflag belongs to the United States Government or the act occurs on lands \nreserved for the use of the United States.\n  In the end, however, it is our Constitution and not the flag which \ngives us our freedoms. And chief among those freedoms, indeed the \nfundamental and most important freedom, is the right to speak freely \nagainst the government, against a government official or against a \ngovernment policy. The speech of an individual may be distasteful to \nthe majority, as is the case when someone burns a flag or when the KKK \nis allowed to march in our cities,\n\n[[Page S1871]]\n\nbut our Constitution was established to protect the rights of the \nminority. For when the majority is allowed to rule without a check and \nbalance, tyranny is not far behind.\n  I don't doubt that the vast majority of Americans oppose, as do I, \nthe desecration of our flag, but we were elected to preserve and \nprotect the Constitution of the United States and I simply do not see \nhow we defend the Constitution by chipping away at its very foundation.\n  Mr. President, there are many reasons to oppose amending the first \namendment for the first time in our Nation's history and for this \nparticular purpose. As several of our colleagues have pointed out, we \nare not experiencing an epidemic of flag burning in the country. But we \nlikely will, if this amendment passes and Congress goes on to ban acts \nof desecration.\n  I also share the concerns raised yesterday by my friend from Vermont, \nSenator Leahy, that while the Senate takes 3 or 4 days to debate this \namendment, we have not taken the time to address other issues that are \nextremely important, especially to our Nation's veterans and to our \nArmed Forces. One example is S. 2003, of which I am a cosponsor and \nthat begins to address the issue of the Federal Government keeping its \npromises to our veterans in the area of health care. I wish the Senate \nwould take up and pass S. 2003 but we can't seem to find time to do \nthat. Likewise, I recently introduced legislation that would compensate \nthe remaining survivors of the Bataan Death March for the incredible \nsuffering they endured on behalf of their country. I would like to see \nthe Senate take up and pass that legislation but we haven't.\n  Mr. President, I think our Constitution and Nation are strong enough \nto handle a few miscreants who want to burn a flag. I think the \ndrafters of the Constitution envisioned that it would survive speech \nwhich the majority finds offensive. I believe that a vote against this \namendment is a vote for the Constitution and for the most important \nprinciple embedded in that document, the right of every American to \nfree speech.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President. I oppose the burning of our Nation's \nflag. I oppose it today as I always have. I am deeply concerned about \nthe desecration of the United States flag because of what it says about \nour culture, our values and our patriotism.\n  Our flag is the lasting symbol of America. To me, every thread in \nevery American flag represents individuals who have laid down their \nlives in the name of freedom and democracy.\n  Yet I cannot support an Amendment to the United States Constitution \nwhich would, for the first time in our nation's history, narrow the \nreach of the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. Instead of \nexpanding the rights of Americans, this Amendment would constrict the \nfreedoms which we fought so hard to win.\n  Instead, we should enact legislation that accomplishes the same \ngoal--without trampling on our fundamental American rights. I have \nvoted several times for legislation that would have provided protection \nof the flag through a statute, rather than a Constitutional amendment.\n  Senator McConnell offered an alternative that sought to create a \nstatutory solution that could have passed the muster of the Supreme \nCourt. The McConnell amendment would have provided for fines or \nimprisonment for anyone who destroys a flag with the intent to incite \nviolence or breach of peace. This amendment would have protected both \nour flag and our Constitution. I'm disappointed that it did not pass.\n  Our flag is a symbol of the principles that have kept our country \nstrong and free. When we think of our flag, we think of everything that \nis good about this country--patriotism, courage, loyalty, duty and \nhonor. Our responsibility is to live up to these standards--and to \nfoster a new sense of citizenship and a new sense of duty.\n  We should honor our flag by rekindling these principles--not by \namending our Constitution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I intend to speak on another issue.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1871-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1871-S1872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IN SUPPORT OF A PRIVATE RELIEF BILL FOR ELIAN GONZALEZ-BROTONS\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come to the floor of the Senate to speak \nabout an incident that occurred just before Thanksgiving Day 1999, when \na mother who so loved her son that she tried to bring him to the shores \nof the United States of America from Cuba. Had she succeeded, she would \nhave joined her family members already in the United States. Instead, \nshe met with tragedy in the Florida straits. The mother died. The five-\nyear-old boy survived. Now, we are being forced to consider young \nElian's future.\n  Today, the freedom sought by a mother for her son is being mocked. \nElian Gonzalez finds himself in the middle of a struggle between his \nMiami family and the Department of Justice, an agency unwilling to \nconsider what is in the best interest of the child, an agency \ncontinually impairing a fair presentation of the merits of this case.\n  I ask my colleagues to open their minds and their hearts and listen \nto why the current process being used by the DOJ and the INS represents \na grave injustice and denies a decision that should be based upon \nElian's best interest. Remember when Elian first arrived, the INS \nstated that the matter was a custody decision for a Florida state \nfamily court. Forty-eight hours after Castro threatened the United \nStates, the decision flipped, and continues to bend to Castro's will. \nNow the administration wants to rush an appeals process to send him \nback to a country that Human Rights Watch states has ``highly developed \nmachinery of repression.''\n  In the past week, the Department of Justice has put unrealistic \ndemands on the family of Elian to expedite the appeal of the federal \ndistrict court decision. The Department of Justice has repeatedly \nthreatened to revoke Elian's parole and remove the child to Cuba if the \nfamily fails to agree to their demand that both sides have an appellate \nbrief prepared in one week. These unprecedented tactics short-circuit \nand dismantle the judicial process in which an appellate is typically \nallotted a minimum of 30-60 days to prepare a brief. This is plain and \nsimple--Elian's family's civil rights are being denied.\n  This past Monday, the family under great pressure filed a motion with \nthe Eleventh Circuit to expedite the appeals process, and still, the \ngovernment's threats have continued. In a letter sent to the family at \n10 p.m. on Monday night, the government demanded that the family's \nattorneys appear for a meeting on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. with INS \nofficials to discuss the revocation of Elian's parole. The government \nhas continually dictated the terms of all meetings and has bulldozed \nover the right of Elian and his Miami family.\n  Today, the Department of Justice has summoned Elian's great-uncle, \nLazaro Gonzalez, to a meeting where he is expected by the INS to sign a \nunilateral demand ``to comply with the instructions of the INS,'' yet \nthe INS has failed to provide the attorneys and the family with what \nthose instructions will be. After all this child has been through, is \nit too much to ask how the government plans on removing him from the \nonly home he now knows? Should his family agree to having INS agents \ncome to his Miami home and take him? Probably not. But one thing is for \nsure: they should know the details of what they are agreeing to.\n  Keep in mind that this same agreement, if signed, destroys any shred \nof dignity left in our judicial process. It demands that the family's \nattorneys have a brief prepared to submit to the Supreme Court within 5 \ndays of the appellate court decision, a time line virtually impossible \nto meet.\n  In its effort to dictate terms for the family's appeal, the \ngovernment has betrayed the very integrity for which the Attorney \nGeneral is charged with defending--equal protection under the law and \nthe right to pursue justice in a free America. In the past week, I've \nheard justice department officials say they are taking more aggressive \naction against the family because they want\n\n[[Page S1872]]\n\nto prevent them from invoking more ``legal maneuvers.'' These ``legal \nmaneuvers'' happen to be the legal rights of Americans--properly \nexercised in the middle of an appeals process. These ``legal \nmaneuvers'' are tools in which all Americans are empowered to seek a \nfair hearing in the United States of America. I find it unconscionable \nthat the justice department would so blatantly express their desire to \ndictate terms and influence the outcome of this case.\n  My reason for coming to the floor today is express my sheer \nfrustration and anger in the manner in which the DOJ and the INS has \nhandled this case. The recent acts of these two agencies demonstrate \nthat the administration is no longer interested in resolving this case \nin a fair, unbiased way. The offer by the Department of Justice is a \ndeeply flawed offer, one that no American would ever accept, one that \nno person in America should ever have to accept. Elian's mother \nsacrificed her life for the freedoms of America, freedoms she never had \nin Cuba, freedoms she never thought our country would deny her son in \nhis moment of need. We should all, despite our views on this issue, be \ndeeply ashamed at any attempt to short circuit justice in order to \nreach a resolution in the quickest possible way.\n  In the United States, we stand up to injustice in the world by \nzealously guarding our laws. We consistently and rightly argue that our \nstrength and power come from our commitment to America's principles: \nfreedom, justice, democracy and the protection of basic human rights. \nWe are a nation founded upon these principles and we remain strong \nbecause we defend them. Mr. President, today and throughout the course \nof Elian's stay in the United States the INS and our Attorney General \nhave not stood up for the one thing they are supposed to defend--\njustice for all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business for a period not to exceed 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will take whatever time may be required \nand use my leader time.\n  Mr. President, the debate over the last two days has been deeply \nmoving. When we began this debate, I thought to myself how much I would \nprefer it if we were talking about veterans' health care, prescription \ndrugs, or raising the minimum wage.\n  But, I stand corrected. This debate has proved meaningful and proved \nthat our reputation as the deliberative body is earned.\n  I thank especially the distinguished Senior Senator from Vermont, the \nRanking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy for his fine \nstewardship of this debate. As always Senator Leahy has offered much \nwisdom and demonstrated much skill as he managed this amendment.\n  This afternoon, as we close this debate I want to draw my colleagues' \nattention to the statements of Senator Robert Byrd and Senator Chuck \nRobb. Both men gave eloquent statements about how they came to their \ndecision to oppose this constitutional amendment. These statements \nmoved me and I dwell on them because they represent my views so well. \nFor neither of these men, was their decision easy. I have come to \nbelieve, however, that it is not in easy decisions that you find the \nmeasure of a Senator--it is the hard decisions that distinguish the men \nand women we remember long after they leave this place.\n  Senator Byrd, in his usual way, reminded us why the Bill of Rights \nhas never been amended in our history. Why? Because it was our \nfounders' design. They set the bar for passage of a constitutional \namendment high because they strongly believed that the Constitution \nshould be amended in only the rarest of circumstances. And that has \nbeen the case. As Senator Byrd points out, setting aside the amendments \ninvolving prohibition, the Constitution has been amended only 15 times \nin 209 years.\n  As Senator Byrd noted, ``In the final analysis, it is the \nConstitution--not the flag--that is the foundation and guarantor of the \npeople's liberties.'' Thus, Senator Byrd conceded that, as much as he \nloves the flag, and as much as he salutes the patriotism of those who \nsupport this measure, he must oppose the amendment. His sentiments \nreflect so well the struggle I have felt over the years when we have \nconsidered this amendment in the past.\n  I, like other veterans, love the flag that has united us at so many \ncritical times. I cannot understand why anyone would burn the flag \nsimply to call attention to a cause. But as Senator Robb reminded me--\nit was to protect the rights of such an unpopular dissenter that I once \nwore a military uniform. Senator Robb noted that there will always be \nanother flag to hold high, when one is defiled, but there will be no \nother Constitution--should we defile it.\n  Senator Robb held dying men in his arms in Southeast Asia. He \nunderstands the sacrifices men and women will make to save this \ndemocracy. This afternoon, as we cast this vote, I am proud to stand \nwith him, to stand with Senator Byrd, to stand with Senators Bob Kerrey \nand John Kerry, and others, to fight here--today--to preserve the \nprincipals and ideals these patriots fought for.\n  As Senator Byrd said today: ``From Tripoli in 1805 to Iwo Jima in \n1945 to the moon in 1969, the flag has been raised to commemorate some \nof America's proudest moments.'' By honoring and preserving the \nConstitution, we ensure that this symbol--our flag--continues to \nrepresent a country devoted to democracy and free speech.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I inquire about the time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is that the only time left before the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. Senator Leahy has 21 minutes. Senator \nHatch has 31 minutes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I yield to Senator Hatch for a request.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield the remainder of our \ntime, if the minority will yield the remainder of its time. Senator \nLott will be the last speaker.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe it was the plan for the leaders to \nyield the remainder of time. I believe Senator Daschle did that. After \nall time had been used on both sides, I would be the final speaker, and \nthen we would go to a recorded vote. We indicated we would vote \nsometime around 4:30.\n  I ask Senator Leahy, are we prepared to yield back time on both sides \nat the conclusion of my remarks?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Utah was going to yield back his time.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Has the Democratic leader yielded his time?\n  Mr. LOTT. He completed his remarks and has yielded the remainder of \nhis time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Of course, I understand that in the normal course the \ndistinguished leader would be given the right to make final remarks.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I commend those who have been involved in the debate \non this very important issue over the past 3 days. It is occasions such \nas this when I think the Senate quite often rises to the greatest \nheight, but it should, because we are debating very important issues \nhere, symbols of our freedom and our democracy, the Constitution, the \nflag.\n\n  I am pleased we have had this discussion. I think the American people \nwant the Senate to act in this area. Now we are prepared to vote.\n  I rise in support of Senate Joint Resolution 14, the constitutional \namendment to protect the flag of the United\n\n[[Page S1873]]\n\nStates. What we have before the Senate today is a very simple measure. \nI have had some discussion with some individuals from outside \nWashington who asked, how long and how complicated is it? It is not \nlong. It is very simple.\n  It reads in full:\n\n       The Congress shall have power to prohibit the physical \n     desecration of the flag of the United States.\n\n  That is the entire amendment.\n  During most of the history of our Republic, the provision expressed \nin this amendment would have been noncontroversial. Indeed, prior to \nthe Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in Texas v. Johnson in 1989, 48 States \nand the Federal Government had laws protecting our most basic national \nsymbol, the flag. The Supreme Court's decision in 1989 reflected a \nfundamental misunderstanding, a misunderstanding of the law, of our \nhistory, and of basic common sense.\n  Those who oppose this amendment argue that defacing the flag somehow \nrepresents speech that must be protected under the first amendment of \nthe Constitution. I think people have a pretty good understanding of \nwhat speech is--at least outside of Washington--and what type of \nactivity is protected under our Constitution. I imagine there are some \nclose situations where there is room for disagreement, obviously, but I \ndon't think that is the case here.\n  We live in a free society where individuals are free to express their \nviews. People can express dissatisfaction with their government, and \nthey do; with the laws, and they do; and even with the flag. They can \nexpress those disagreements. While the speech in which some of our \nfellow citizens choose to engage can at times be repulsive and \noffensive or even dangerous, we do respect the fundamental right of \nindividuals to express their ideas. No one is suggesting it should be \notherwise.\n  In my opinion, burning the flag is not speech, it is conduct of the \nmost offensive kind. Protecting the right of individuals to destroy \nproperty has no relation to the question of whether people are free to \nspeak or to write or to campaign or to petition against the leaders of \ntheir government. I strongly reject the notion that those who support \nthis amendment lack concern or respect for our traditions of free \nspeech or for the notion that people should be free to criticize their \ngovernment. This amendment simply will not hinder those basic freedoms.\n  Certainly, Senator Hatch, who has led the debate on this side, and \nmany other Senators who will vote for this have great respect for our \ntraditions of free speech and for the Constitution. But they think this \nis an issue that rises to the level of being considered as an \namendment.\n  This measure does not change the first amendment nor does it alter \nour historical respect of free speech. It merely restores the original \nunderstanding of our Constitution, an understanding that led nearly \nevery State and the Federal Government to maintain for decades laws \nprotecting the flag.\n\n  As we consider this amendment, it is essential to remind ourselves \nthat our rights, our constitutional guarantees, do not exist in a \nvacuum. They exist for a reason--namely, to further our great \nexperiment in self-government and a constitutional republic. They exist \nto help us thrive as individuals and as a nation.\n  The American flag is a sacred, basic, fundamental symbol of our \nNation's ideals--the symbol of those goals and values for which we have \nasked our young men and women to fight and die. It is a symbol that \ncauses citizens to rise in pride and to salute. It is a symbol men and \nwomen have followed. It is a symbol men have carried into battle. It \ndoes represent those basic tenets in which we believe in this country.\n  Some argue that allowing the desecration of this most vital symbol \nsomehow shows our strength and self-assurance as a nation. I disagree. \nI think it reflects a perversion of liberty and a misunderstanding of \nour system of government. Allowing the desecration of our national \nsymbol is not a sign of strength, it is a sign of self-indulgence, as \nwe have in so many areas of our society today, of a nation that does \nnot take seriously the obvious point that our rights coexist with \nresponsibilities and limitations.\n  The flag is unique. When we went to the Moon, we didn't take some \nother sign of military might, some billboard, some expression of our \ngreat wealth. No, instead we planted the flag, the same flag that was \nraised over Iwo Jima, the same flag we lower to half mast at times of \nnational tragedy, the same flag we drape over the coffin of our \nAmerican heroes and our veterans. Surely protecting such a symbol is \nnot only consistent with our deepest traditions but essential to \npreserve the society that has developed and fostered those traditions.\n  I sympathize with those who express concern that a constitutional \namendment is an extraordinary event and should not be taken lightly. It \nnever is. We have had some tremendous debates over the years on \nconstitutional amendments. Most of them were defeated, but, on \noccasion, some have passed and they have proven to be good for the \nadvancement of our country.\n  Had the Supreme Court interpreted the Constitution appropriately, we \nwould not be forced to take this serious and unusual step. However, the \nSupreme Court's failure to act responsibly on this issue leaves us no \nother means to protect this symbol for which so many Americans have \nsacrificed their lives and to which they have pledged their sacred \nhonor.\n  Some Members of this body claim that these goals can be accomplished \nthrough statute. I can say frankly that I wish it would be so but I \ndon't believe it can be so. Make no mistake, the Supreme Court has \nstated over and over and over again that its interpretation of the \nfirst amendment trumps any statute Congress may pass.\n  If we truly wish to protect the flag--and I know an overwhelming \nnumber of Americans do--we have no choice but to vote for a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  There are those who belittle this amendment and our effort to protect \nthe flag. They claim it is too narrow an issue, too small a problem, \nand that this is an issue not worthy of Congress' attention. I believe \nthis issue is more important than any appropriation or any new set of \nregulations for it goes to the heart of who we are as a people and what \nwe are as a nation.\n\n  The United States is different from almost every other nation on \nEarth. Those who come to America don't share the same language, the \nsame religion, the same ethnicity, the same history, or the same \ngeography. Instead of those tangible similarities, Americans are united \nby intangibles--by our commitment to certain ideals. One of those \nideals is the principle of free speech. But another is the devotion to \nour country and a commitment to work for its success. By asking \nAmericans to respect the flag, we simply ask them to demonstrate that \nany protest, criticism, or complaint they may have is made with the \nbest interests of the Nation at heart. The measure before the Senate \ntoday furthers that basic and essential principle upon which our Nation \nwas founded.\n  Once again, we are being told that the Senate should reject this, \nthat we know better. Yet look at what has happened. The States have \nvoted overwhelmingly to protect the flag. Forty-eight States had laws \nprotecting it before the Supreme Court decision.\n  Many State legislatures have called upon the Congress to send this \namendment to the States. In fact, I think every State legislature has \ndone that. The House of Representatives has passed a flag amendment by \na large, overwhelmingly bipartisan vote. Now it is up to the Senate to \ndo what we should. Are we saying we know better than the American \npeople? That we know better than every State legislature in the Nation? \nThat we know better than the House of Representatives? We know better? \nWhy not allow the people, through their State legislatures, to have the \nfinal say? Why not pass this amendment, send it to the people, and let \nthem make the final determination? I think they will make the right \ndecision.\n  I think we should work together today on both sides of the aisle to \npass this amendment and send it to the people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last fall I became the 21st or 22nd person \nin the history of this body to cast 10,000 votes. When somebody asked \nme about those votes, whether they were all important, I said: No, a \nlot of them were merely procedural votes that we all cast, but some \nwere important. Some of those 10,000 were.\n  Certainly this vote, whatever number of votes I might be privileged \nto cast on the floor of the Senate, will go down as one of the most \nimportant votes, as it will for all Senators. Whether they voted for or \nagainst the amendment, it will be one of the most important votes they \nwill cast in their career.\n  I take a moment to commend the Senate for its actions this afternoon. \nIt protected the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, in particular our \nfirst amendment freedoms. This has been an emotional debate, as one \nwould expect, about a highly charged political issue. I believe the \nSenate fulfilled its constitutional responsibility to both debate and \nthen vote on this proposed 28th amendment to the Constitution.\n  I thank Senators on both sides of the aisle, Democrats and \nRepublicans, and on both sides of this issue--those who voted, in my \nestimation, to protect the Constitution as it presently stands and \nthose who used their constitutional right to vote to amend the \nConstitution. There were thoughtful and heartfelt statements on both \nsides.\n  The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, who is \nranking Democrat on the Constitution subcommittee, spoke eloquently on \nthe floor, as he has in committee. He has been a leader on \nconstitutional issues since he arrived in the Senate. I thank him for \nall he has done.\n  We heard from Senator Kennedy. We heard from Senator Moynihan, one of \n11 Senators in this body who fought in World War II. We heard from \nSenator Dodd, Senator Dorgan, Senator Conrad, Senator Durbin, Senator \nWellstone, and so many others. All were thoughtful and constructive \ncontributors to the debate.\n  In particular, I commend my dear and very special friend, Tom \nDaschle, Democratic leader, for his remarks closing this debate and \nalso for his leadership throughout this debate.\n  Over the last 24 hours, we heard compelling statements--if I may \nsingle out a couple--from Senator Bob Kerrey, Senator Chuck Robb, and \nSenator John Kerry. Each of these men was an heroic veteran of the \nVietnam war. Each was decorated for his bravery, and one had the \nhighest decoration of this country, the Congressional Medal of Honor. \nEach of them rose to the defense of our freedoms. We have heeded their \ncounsel. We have heeded their service, as we have our former colleague, \nSenator John Glenn, another American hero; Gen. Colin Powell, another \nAmerican hero; our late colleague, Senator John Chafee; and the many \nveterans who testified and contacted us urging that we preserve, \nprotect, and defend the Constitution by not amending the first \namendment to the Bill of Rights for the first time in the history of \nour great Nation.\n  I recognize the courage shown by the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Mr. Byrd--Senator Byrd gave us a history lesson \nwhich will be studied long after all of us are gone--and the \ndistinguished Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, who, during the course of \nconsideration of this proposal, looked inside themselves, looked to the \nprinciples of this country and changed the position they had held \nbefore. I commend them for that. I thank them. Their legacy will \ninclude their dedication to the Constitution and their vote to uphold, \nprotect, and defend it.\n  I thank Prof. Gary May, Keith Kruel, James Warner, Rev. Nathan \nWilson, Prof. Robert Cole, the American Bar Association, People for the \nAmerican Way, and the ACLU for their views.\n  I thank Maj. Gen. Patrick Brady and Lt. Gen. Edward Baca for their \ntestimony opposed to the position I have taken today.\n  I commend Senate staff on both sides of the aisle, those for the \namendment and those opposed. I think in this case I may be allowed to \nthank Bruce Cohen and Julie Katzman of my staff, who spent far more \nhours than this Senator had any right to ask them to spend on this in \nanswering every question I ever asked, anticipating those I was not \nwise enough to ask, and always giving me good counsel. Bob Schiff, \nAndrea LaRue, Michaela Sims, and Barbara Riehle, they should be proud \nof their work and of the Senate's action today.\n  I would also like to thank my friend and Chairman, Orrin Hatch, who \nhas fought so hard for this amendment over the years.\n  Mr. President, I see other Senators seeking recognition. I will yield \nthe floor in one moment. Again, I thank all Senators on both sides of \nthe issue for their dedication to this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we respect the comments of our colleague \nfrom Vermont. Recognition should also go to Senator Hatch. I realize \nSenator Leahy also was about to speak on behalf of Senator Hatch. I \nwant to recognize his efforts in working with the Senator from Vermont \non this issue. The final vote was 63, and that is well beyond 50 \npercent of the Senate by which most issues are decided.\n  Mr. President, at this time, I notice the senior Senator from South \nCarolina on the floor. I ask unanimous consent that I be recognized \nfollowing his presentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1874-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my \nconcern about Andrei Babitsky, the accomplished Russian journalist who \nstill faces serious charges in Russia after being held captive first by \nRussian authorities, then by Chechens, and now again by Russian \nauthorities.\n\n[[Page S1875]]\n\n  Mr. Babitsky has worked for the last 10 years for the U.S. \ngovernment-funded broadcasting service, Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty. He is well-known as one of the most courageous reporters who \nhas covered the conflict in Chechnya. The skill and courage he \ndemonstrated in his coverage of the conflict are clearly the major \nreasons for his continuing plight.\n  Russian authorities repeatedly expressed displeasure with Mr. \nBabitsky's reporting of Russian troop casualties and Russian human \nrights violations against Chechen civilians in the weeks leading up to \nhis arrest. On January 8, his Moscow apartment was ransacked by members \nof the Federal Security Service, the FSB, which is the successor \norganization to the KGB. They confiscated film alleged to contain \nphotos of dead Russian soldiers in Chechnya.\n  On January 16, Mr. Babitsky was seized by Russian police in the \nChechen battle zone. After first denying that he was in their custody, \nRussian authorities claimed that Mr. Babitsky had been assisting the \nChechen forces and was to stand trial in Moscow.\n  On February 3, the Russian government announced that Mr. Babitsky had \nbeen handed over to Chechen units in exchange for Russian prisoners, a \nviolation of the Geneva Convention to which Russia is a party. \nSubsequently, Russian authorities claimed to have no knowledge of Mr. \nBabitsky's whereabouts. As it turns out, he was taken to a so-called \n``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators, then held at \nan undisclosed location by Chechen forces loyal to Moscow.\n  On February 25, Mr. Babitsky was taken to the Republic of Dagestan \nand told he was about to be freed. But authorities said he was carrying \nfalse identity papers, and they arrested and jailed him. Mr. Babitsky \nsays the papers were forced on him by his captors in Chechnya and used \nto smuggle him over the border.\n  Facing international pressure to account for Mr. Babitsky's \nwhereabouts since his disappearance, Russian authorities flew Mr. \nBabitsky to Moscow and released him on his own recognizance.\n  The allegations of assisting Chechen forces and carrying forged \nidentity papers still stand against Mr. Babitsky. If convicted, he \nfaces at least two years in prison on the identity papers charges \nalone. The State Department would like to see this case resolved. Radio \nFree Europe/Radio Liberty is seeking to have all charges against Mr. \nBabitsky dropped, and I strongly support this effort.\n  Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees \nthe right to seek and to impart information through the media, \nregardless of frontiers. Taking into custody any reporter, and \ntransferring him to the custody of hostile forces, is a serious human \nrights violation and behavior unbefitting a democracy.\n  I urge the newly-elected Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to \ndemonstrate his commitment to the principles of democracy and respect \nfor human rights and freedom of the press by seeing to it that the \ntrumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky are dropped.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1875-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the people \nof Senegal on their recent democratic presidential elections. On March \n19, the citizens of Senegal selected a new leader, Abdoulaye Wade of \nthe Senegalese Democratic Party, in run-off elections for the \npresidency. This election was not just for show. The Senegalese people \nwere not simply going through the motions of political participation. \nRather this was a remarkable moment in Senegalese and African history. \nAfter 40 years of Socialist Party rule, the Senegalese people \npeacefully and democratically took control of their country's destiny \nand chose to make a change.\n  I also want to acknowledge the behavior of incumbent President Abdou \nDiouf, who has held power for two decades. President Diouf lost the \nvote, but he won the respect of champions of democracy worldwide when \nhe accepted the choice of the voters and gracefully congratulated Mr. \nWade on his victory. The manner in which he leaves office will be one \nof the richest elements of his legacy.\n  Mr. President, so often the only news that Americans hear from Africa \nis news of war and oppression, of flood and famine, of disease and \ndrought. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \nSubcommittee on Africa, I have often come to this floor to speak about \nabuses and conflicts in the sub-Saharan region. But I have also spent \nenough time learning about Africa to know that small victories are won \neach day--in cities and villages across the continent, individuals, \nfamilies, and communities are making real progress in their quest for a \nbetter future. This month the people of Senegal won a truly great \nvictory, and it is my pleasure to call this Senate's attention to their \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1875-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1875-S1876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DEPOSIT INSURANCE FAIRNESS AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY ACT\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Senator John Edwards and I introduced S. \n2293, the Deposit Insurance Fairness and Economic Opportunity Act. Also \njoining in this effort are Senators Jesse Helms, Frank Murkowski, and \nKay Bailey Hutchison.\n  This bill is a continuation of an effort begun last year during \nconsideration of S. 900, the now Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I offered an \namendment on the Senate floor regarding the annual obligation that \nbanks and thrifts pay into their respective deposit insurance funds to \nretire the debt on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (FICO) in \nthe late 1980s. This annual assessment for banks and thrifts totals \nnearly $800 million. This money is used to support the federal deposit \ninsurance system consisting of the Bank Insurance Fund [BIF] and the \nSavings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF).\n  By law, banks and thrifts are required to contribute the equivalent \nof 1.25 percent of their deposits into the insurance funds for it to be \nconsidered capitalized. Presently, and for the last several years, \nthese funds have met--and exceeded--that statutory requirement. For \nexample, the SAIF steadily increased from 1.25 percent in 1996 to 1.45 \npercent in 1999. Similarly, the BIF rose from 1.34 percent in 1996 to \n1.37 percent in 1999.\n  Over time, this situation has evolved where banks and thrifts are \nrequired to meet the annual obligation despite an overcapitalization of \nthe insurance funds. In short, this is money that is leaving our \ncommunities that could be used for expanded lending in the areas of \nhome buying, small business start-ups, and educational expenses. \nAccording to a former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation [FDIC] \nCommissioner, every dollar available for capital can yield $10 in \nadditional community lending. Therefore, it is projected that this bill \ncould generate up to $8 billion in new loans each year.\n  To achieve the goals of requiring the banking community to meet their \nfinancial obligation to the funds; maintain the safety and soundness of \nthe deposit insurance funds; and allow needed dollars to remain in our \ncommunities,\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\nSenator Edwards and I have proposed the following in S. 2293: (1) Raise \nthe designated reserve ratio of the deposit insurance funds from the \ncurrent 1.25 percent of assets to 1.4 percent of assets. This will \nprovide an enhanced buffer in the deposit insurance funds to ensure \ntheir continued safety and soundness; (2) Allow funds in excess of the \n1.4 reserve ratio to be used to pay the annual FICO obligation; (3) \nAllow money to be returned to banks and thrifts on a pro-rata basis \nwhen the debt is retired on the FICO bonds in 2017. As mentioned \nbefore, the BIF and SAIF are overcapitalized, and continue to grow \nsince the funds are invested in government bonds and generate \ninvestment income. The legislation specifies that only when both BIF \nand SAIF exceed the 1.4 reserve ratio can the excess be used to pay the \nannual assessment.\n  I believe the approach set out in S. 2293 is one of common sense. \nCongress required the two deposit insurance funds to be capitalized at \na set level. The mandate was accepted and met by the bank and thrift \nindustries, and growth in the fund has led them to exceed the original \nrequirements. This legislation simply affirms that banks and thrifts \nmust continue to meet their statutorily-required financial obligation, \nand if the deposit insurance funds are healthy and sound, then such \nexcess dollars can be kept in their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1876-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUPREME COURT CASE OF DOE VERSUS SANTA FE INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, among the greatest traditions in my \nstate and in many parts of the country are high school football games \non Friday nights. These are very important events each fall in the \nlives of students and their families in countless communities.\n  These athletic activities often include a simple, non-denominational \nprayer to set the tone for the evening, and to promote good \nsportsmanship and safety for the students. These prayers are beneficial \nto students and spectators alike. Recently, prayer at high school \nfootball games in a Texas public school district was challenged as \nunconstitutional. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held in a divided \nopinion that this practice violated the establishment clause of the \nFirst Amendment. The case is being considered by the Supreme Court \ntoday, and it is my hope that the Court will reverse this misguided \ndecision.\n  I have long believed that non-denominational prayer should be \npermitted in public schools. I believe that our society for years has \nbeen going too far in trying to create a complete separation between \nchurch and state. The fact is that religion has always been a central \npart in the lives of Americans, and each generation seeks to pass these \nvalues on to their children. The courts should recognize the role of \nreligion, and not try to separate it from every aspect of public life. \nIndeed, the government should encourage the expression of religious \nbeliefs by our young people. We should not require them to check their \nreligion at the door when they enter the school house or any other \npublic building.\n  When I open the Senate each morning, we have our Chaplain deliver an \nopening prayer. I think it is vital that we start each day with this \nprayer. Yet, there is no more public building than the United States \nCapitol. Our children certainly should not be denied this same benefit \nat football games.\n  In the case the Supreme Court is considering, it is entirely clear \nthat the prayer is not controlled or sponsored by the state. The prayer \nis conducted during an extracurricular activity, not during school \nhours. Also, the prayer is not led or controlled by teachers or school \nadministrators. Rather, the students choose whether they wish to have \nprayer at their football game and, if so, which student will lead the \nprayer. The students make the decisions.\n  I hope that the Supreme Court will decide that the school's policy of \npermitting student-led, student-initiated prayer at football games does \nnot violate the establishment clause. Student prayers at these events \nare a vital part of these traditions, and I sincerely hope the Court \nwill agree.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1876-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDING SENATOR THURMOND FOR HIS REMARKS ON SCHOOL PRAYER\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, it is a pleasure to alert my \ncolleagues to the March 31 dedication of Willie Mays Plaza at the new \nPacific Bell Park in San Francisco. This dedication is the first in a \nseries of events leading to opening day on April 11, when the hometown \nGiants begin a new era against their old rivals the Los Angeles \nDodgers.\n  The opening of the new park is cause for great excitement among \nbaseball fans in San Francisco, in California and throughout the \ncountry. Situated a short distance from downtown and directly on the \nBay, Pacific Bell Park is both an architecturally stunning building and \na state-of-the-art baseball facility. Notably, it is the first \nprivately financed professional ballpark in the United States in 35 \nyears. And unlike the Giants former home at Candlestick Park, PacBell \nPark is for baseball only.\n  Willie Mays Plaza is located at the main entrance to the park at \nThird and King Streets. In recognition of Willie Mays' number, the \nofficial address of the stadium is 24 Willie Mays Plaza. In addition, \nthe plaza features 24 palm trees and a nine-foot bronze sculpture of \nthe hall of famer. This handsome public space is a fitting tribute to a \nliving legend.\n  It is very appropriate that the Giants have chosen to honor Willie \nMays in this way. Arguably the greatest all-around player to ever play \nthe game, if Willie Mays is not synonymous with baseball, he is \ncertainly synonymous with the Giants. He began his career with the team \nin 1951 and made the move to San Francisco with the club in 1957. All \ntold he played 20 years in a Giants uniform. Over the course of his \nfabled career, he hit 660 homeruns, had 3,283 hits and 1,903 runs \nbatted in. And if this were not enough, he scored 2,062 runs, stole 338 \nbases, earned 12 consecutive Gold Gloves and had a career batting \naverage of .302. A true student of the game, it is small wonder that \nWillie Mays remains a hero to countless fans the world over.\n  After a brief stint with the New York Mets at the very end of his \ncareer, Willie Mays soon returned to the Giants. Since his retirement \nin 1972, he has never strayed far from the game or the organization. He \nis currently Special Assistant to Giant's President Peter Magowan. In \nthis capacity, he is an ambassador for the team at all manner of civic \nand charitable events.\n  On the field and off it, Willie Mays has always embodied dedication, \nteamwork and the pursuit of excellence. In naming this prominent part \nof Pacific Bell Park in his honor, the San Francisco Giants are \nassuring that the Say Hey Kid's example will grace this city, this team \nand its loyal fans for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1876-4", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1876-S1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY AND DRAKE UNIVERSITY BASKETBALL TEAMS\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment to \nexpress my congratulations to and praise for the outstanding \nperformance of both the men's and women's basketball teams at Iowa \nState University and the women's basketball team at Drake University \nthis year. Drake concluded its season with a 23-7 record, while winning \nits fourth Missouri Valley Conference championship in the last six \nyears and another automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. Carla Bennet \nwas named to the MVC All-Tournament team along with junior guard \nKristin Santa. This year was Drake's seventh appearance in the \ntournament. The Bulldogs have advanced to the tournament four\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\ntimes in the last six years, with appearances in 1986, 1984, and 1982 \nas well so they continue a long, proud tradition.\n  Both Iowa State teams finished as regular season champions of the Big \nXII conference, then followed up that feat with convincing wins at the \nconference championship tournament, entitling each team to an automatic \nbid in the 2000 NCAA basketball tournaments. The men's championship was \nthe university's first since 1945, when the conference was still the \nBig 6, while it was the first women's conference title since varsity \nwomen's basketball started at Iowa State in 1973. So these are great \naccomplishments.\n  Their achievements are exemplified by the selections of Marcus Fizer \nas a first-team All-American from the men's program and Stacy Frese as \na second-team All-American from the women's program, but each team is \nmuch more than just its stars. Both All-Americans are complemented by \nstrong position players throughout their respective teams, and neither \nteam would have reached this pinnacle without the enthusiastic support \nof Iowa State's fans. On the weekend of the Big XII championships, held \nin Kansas City, a substantial portion of the city of Ames migrated \nsouth for that event, filling the arenas with loyal wearers of cardinal \nand gold, the team colors.\n  As an Iowa State graduate myself, I want to salute their \naccomplishments, including their fine performances in the NCAA \ntournaments. Both teams were active in the tournament through last \nweekend, the men losing in the regional finals and the women in the \nregional semifinals. We have a long, proud tradition of excellent \nbasketball teams in the state of Iowa at the high school and college \nlevel, and Iowa State's 1999-2000 men's and women's basketball teams \nand the Drake women's team have shown themselves worthy of joining that \npantheon. They're both great teams, and they did Iowa proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1877-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING GREEK INDEPENDENCE DAY\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the annual March 25th celebration \nof Greek Independence Day commemorates the independence of Greece from \n400 years of oppression under the Ottoman Empire. Greeks have made \ngreat contributions to the world in literature, philosophy, mathematics \nand government. The names of Homer, Socrates, Euclid and Alexander echo \nthrough the pages of world history. It was the Greek people who started \nthe Olympic Games saying there was more honor in peaceful competition \nthan in wars of conquest. The greatest gift Greek people have given the \nworld, though, is a simple yet powerful idea that was born over 2,000 \nyears ago. It is the idea that a nation's power lies in the hands of \nits people. The Athenian republic was the world's first democracy, a \nfact that all free nations must respect.\n  The bonds that join the United States and Greece are deep and long \nlasting. Our fore-fathers recognized the spirit and idealism of ancient \nGreece when drafting our Constitution. Forty-five years after our own \nrevolution for independence, Greece freed itself with its own \nrevolutionary struggle.\n  In every major international conflict of this century, Greece has \nbeen a proud ally of the United States. Honoring this day will pay \nspecial tribute to those Greek men and women who gave their lives for \nthe common cause of freedom. Greek-Americans can especially take pride \nin their ancestors' sacrifice. The many Greek sons and daughters who \nhave come to the United States have worked honorably in all areas of \nAmerican life, including public service. Greek culture flourishes in \nAmerican cities, adding to our country's rich diversity.\n  I hope Greece will resolve its differences with its Turkish neighbors \nover Cyprus. I hope all people in the region share in America's belief \nthat this can be achieved through diplomacy instead of violence. Let us \nbe mindful of the olive tree and the Olympic flame, the great symbols \nof Greece, and remember, too, that they are also symbols of \npeace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1877-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1877-S1880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PEACE CORPS' 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at a recent event at the John F. \nKennedy Library in Boston, the Chairman of the Library Foundation, Paul \nG. Kirk, Jr., and the new Director of the Peace Corps, Mark Schneider, \nspoke of the importance of the Peace Corps as it launched its year-\nlong, 40th anniversary celebration. Mr. Schneider announced a new \ninitiative to expand the role of Peace Corps volunteers in bringing \ninformation technology to the task of reducing poverty in developing \ncountries. He also outlined a plan to expand the Peace Corps' efforts \nto raise global awareness about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n  It is fitting that this occasion was held at President Kennedy's \nlibrary. In March 1961, President Kennedy launched the Peace Corps as a \nnew idea to demonstrate that a new generation of Americans was moving \ninto positions of leadership in the United States, and they intended to \nserve the cause of peace around the world.\n  The Peace Corps today continues its vital and thriving mission, with \n7,400 volunteers serving in 77 countries, including recent missions in \nSouth Africa, Jordan, Mozambique and Bangladesh. In the past four \ndecades, more than 150,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps \nvolunteers in 134 countries, promoting peace, education, economic \ndevelopment and international cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I commend the significant current role of the Peace \nCorps in involving U.S. citizens in world affairs, and making the world \na better place by their efforts. I ask consent that the addresses by \nMark Schneider and Paul Kirk be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                      Remarks of Paul G. Kirk, Jr.\n\n       Thank you, Jim. Good evening. I know this is a special \n     occasion for all of you, but I want you to know that it is an \n     equally special evening for those of us associated with the \n     Kennedy Library. Like each of you, I am also a volunteer in \n     an important cause. And in my responsibilities as Chairman of \n     the Board of Directors of the John F. Kennedy Library \n     Foundation, few privileges are as significant as having the \n     honor to welcome home so many Peace Corps Volunteers to the \n     nation's memorial to President Kennedy.\n       Senator Kennedy and Mark Schneider agreed that this \n     Library, whose mission it is to honor John Kennedy's public \n     life and career and to perpetuate his passion for service, is \n     the most appropriate site at which to begin the celebration \n     of the 40th Anniversary of the Peace Corps. And I \n     congratulate you and I am delighted to welcome you all on \n     behalf of the Kennedy Family, our Board of Directors and our \n     dedicated staff.\n       Here in New England, as you know, we enjoy many seasons. At \n     this time of year, we look forward to the springtime--a \n     season when nature's energy bursts forth, when promise and \n     hope are renewed--when opportunities seem limitless--and when \n     a spirit of confidence and optimism make all of us, \n     regardless of our age, feel younger than our years.\n       If it could be said that politics also has seasons, 40 \n     years ago there began a season in our history that proved to \n     be--and remains today--the height of America's political \n     springtime--as the nation, renewed in energy, hope and \n     idealism, responded to the patriotic call to service of the \n     newly elected, youthful 35th President of the United States.\n       If, as I believe, his 1000 days were ``the height of \n     America's political springtime'', then it must be said that \n     the planting and the subsequent flowering of the Peace Corps \n     epitomizes all that is the very best in the lasting legacy of \n     that season of service.\n       On March 1, 1961, 6 weeks after his inauguration, upon \n     signing the Executive Order establishing the Peace Corps, \n     President Kennedy said he was convinced that ``We have in \n     this country, an immense reservoir of men and women--anxious \n     to sacrifice their energies and time and toil to the cause of \n     world peace and human progress.''\n       He acknowledged that ``life in the Peace Corps will not be \n     easy,'' but he also promised it would be ``rich and \n     satisfying.''\n       ``. . . (E)very young American who participates in the \n     Peace Corps--who works in a foreign land''--he said, ``will \n     know that he or she is sharing in the great common task of \n     bringing to man that decent way of life which is the \n     foundation of freedom and a condition of peace.''\n       40 years later, thanks to your service and what you \n     continue to do, his words have a timeless quality.\n       Tonight, you begin your 40th Anniversary celebration at a \n     Library and Museum that celebrates scholarship and service in \n     John Kennedy's memory each day it opens its doors. His \n     history and yours are preserved here for scholastic research.\n       We seek to perpetuate his inspiration and yours by the \n     various activities and programs which take place here: the \n     Profile in Courage Award, the Distinguished Foreign Visitors \n     Programs, the forums and symposia promoting public discourse \n     on the issues of our time, the 1st Pres. Debate of general \n     election\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n     2000 which we will co-host with the University of \n     Massachusetts-Boston, the John F. Kennedy Library Corps a \n     youth based community service and leadership program modeled \n     after the Peace Corps itself.\n       Your own service in the Peace Corps and your presence here \n     tonight speak the mission of the Kennedy Library. At a time \n     when citizen participation, even voting, in the world's \n     greatest democracy, is embarrassingly low, reminding others \n     of the importance of service is at the core of our message.\n       No group can take greater pride in having lived President \n     Kennedy's mantra that ``each individual can make a \n     difference, and all of us must try'' than Peace Corps \n     Volunteers. We are honored by your presence, and the country \n     is honored by the difference you have made by your service, \n     and we hope you'll return next year to wind up your \n     anniversary celebration in the tone and spirit and at the \n     place where it begins tonight.\n       In addition to marking your 40th Anniversary, tonight could \n     also serve as the 30th Reunion of Mark Schneider and myself. \n     As you know, Mark is the second returned Peace Corps \n     Volunteer to head the agency. Upon his return from El \n     Salvador, 30 years ago Mark and I began working together in \n     the Washington office of Senator Ted Kennedy. Mark came to \n     Massachusetts for the Senator's 1970 campaign and tonight \n     could probably tell you as much about the issues and \n     demographics of this state as could the head of our Chamber \n     of Commerce.\n       From those days to this, Mark has demonstrated the \n     idealism, energy and leadership qualities reflecting the very \n     best in a career of public service. In key posts at the \n     Department of State, Pan American Health Organization, and at \n     USAID, Mark's values, his leadership and commitment made a \n     difference in the lives of hundreds of thousands of families \n     in other lands who will never know his name.\n       I can tell you that the Peace Corps is in the hands of the \n     best of individuals under the direction and leadership of a \n     man whose name and values I know well and respect greatly. \n     Please join me in a rousing New England Peace Corps welcome \n     for the Peace Corps' able Director, Mark Schneider.\n       Mark, as a way of sharing and renewing and celebrating all \n     that was begun by President Kennedy 40 years ago, on behalf \n     of all of us here who seek to remind future generations of \n     his inspiration and to perpetuate his challenge for sacrifice \n     and service, I present this bust of John Kennedy to you, as \n     Peace Corps Director, from the Kennedy Library and \n     Foundation.\n       It is our hope that this bust will be displayed in the \n     Director's Office not only commemorating this occasion and \n     this Anniversary year but also reminding those in years to \n     come that Peace Corps Volunteers will forever remain the best \n     products of ``the height of America's political springtime''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Remarks of Mark L. Schneider\n\n       I would like to begin by saying on behalf of all our \n     Volunteers serving around the world and all of the thousands \n     of returned Volunteers who continue to serve our communities \n     here at home that we are deeply honored to celebrate the \n     third annual Peace Corps Day at the John F. Kennedy Memorial \n     Library. I cannot think of a more appropriate place to \n     celebrate one of President Kennedy's most enduring legacies \n     than this wonderful library .\n       I would like to express our deep gratitude to Brad Gerratt \n     of the Kennedy Library, and Paul Kirk of the Kennedy Library \n     Foundation, for their generous invitation and co-sponsorship \n     of this event. Let me also thank Doane Perry and the Boston \n     Area Returned Peace Corps Volunteers for also cosponsoring \n     the activities planned for Peace Corps Day in Boston today \n     and tomorrow.\n       I also would like to say a special thanks to Senator Edward \n     Kennedy, who could not join us but sends his best wishes. As \n     some of you may know, I had the honor of working as a member \n     of Senator Kennedy, who could not join us but sends his best \n     wishes. As some of you may know, I had the honor of working \n     as a member of Senator Kennedy's staff some years ago. It is \n     a privilege for me to call him both a friend and a mentor. \n     Our country owes Senator Kennedy an enormous debt of \n     gratitude for his years of distinguished public service, his \n     enduring commitment to working people in our society, and his \n     continuing support for the Peace Corps. The work still goes \n     on. The hope has endured and the dream will never die.\n       Let me welcome all of the returned Volunteers in the \n     audience and thank you for helping us celebrate Peace Corps \n     Day. When President Kennedy signed the Executive Order \n     establishing the Peace Corps on March 1, 1961, he said, ``. . \n     . we have, in this country, an immense reservoir of [such] \n     men and women--anxious to sacrifice their energies and time \n     and toil to the cause of world peace and human progress.'' \n     And you have proved him right.\n       Over the years, more than 7,000 thousand Peace Corps \n     Volunteers have been recruited from Massachusetts and its \n     many institutions of higher education. Indeed, just a few \n     weeks ago, we released a list of the top 25 colleges and \n     universities that have produced the most Peace Corps \n     Volunteers currently serving overseas. Massachusetts can take \n     great pride in the fact that Boston University and UMASS/\n     Amherst were among those top 25 schools. Tufts, Williams and \n     Brandies were among the top ten of small colleges and \n     universities. Massachusetts also can take pride that it \n     elected the first former Peace Corps Volunteer to the United \n     States Senate in 1978, the late Sen. Paul Tsongas, who had \n     served in Ethiopia. His daughter, Ashley, is carrying on the \n     Peace Corps tradition, also serving in Africa.\n       I am delighted to be with you here at the Kennedy Library \n     to give you a brief update on what is happening at the Peace \n     Corps, to talk about Peace Corps, to talk about Peace Corps \n     Day, and to announced a special initiative for the Peace \n     Corps in the 21st century.\n       In my view, this is an exciting time to be associated with \n     the Peace Corps. Let me tell you just a few of the many \n     reasons why I say this.\n       Today, there are more than 7,000 Peace Corps Volunteers \n     serving in 77 countries. In the last month, I have had the \n     chance to visit with some Peace Corps Volunteers in \n     Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Guinea, Togo, Ghana and \n     Bulgaria. I am pleased to report that they are doing \n     outstanding development work to improve the lives of people \n     in their communities.\n       In Guinea, I met with Volunteers who had worked with an NGO \n     and the public health ministry helping to end female genital \n     mutilation, and who convinced an entire area to give up the \n     practice when the women excisers were given an alternative \n     way to earn income. Another Volunteer who had been stung by a \n     bee turned that experience into a women's micro enterprise \n     project that is exporting honey to neighboring countries. I \n     also saw teachers who were helping prepare the next \n     generation of leaders. In Togo, I saw a Peace Corps Volunteer \n     working with a local NGO where skits kept 300 high school \n     students mesmerized as they learned of the killing nature of \n     HIV/AIDS and how to prevent its transmission.\n       In Ghana, I met Melinda Patterson from Watertown, \n     Connecticut. She is helping her community, Mafia-Dove, build \n     a school. She has also organized a women's water and \n     sanitation committee to introduce clean water and latrines \n     into their community to break the transmission cycle of \n     water-borne diseases that needlessly kill thousands of \n     Ghanaian children under the age of five, each year. I had a \n     special introduction to that community when I was greeted by \n     a celebration there last week. A deputy chief from the EWE \n     tribe formally welcomed me, and as loin-clothed dancers \n     performed, the water-sanitation committee women placed a \n     beaded peace bracelet on my arm and sprinkled it with good \n     luck powder. They understand well the balance between \n     tradition and modern technology and were helpful that the new \n     electric power mainline nearby would reach their community \n     soon.\n       Across Ghana, Volunteers are working with small \n     businessmen, teaching thousands of high school students and \n     collaborating with their local communities to promote eco-\n     tourism and protect bio-diversity, from protecting the last \n     hippopotamus, to securing national park status for a unique \n     monkey preserve.\n       My pride in the work of Volunteers was matched by that of \n     the country's leaders. The Ghanaian Vice President--as did \n     almost all leaders I met--recalled the name of a volunteer \n     who had taught him math two decades earlier. He said that \n     Peace Corps Volunteers, then and now, go to the most distant \n     and difficult communities, places where some of his own \n     countrymen will not live. The Volunteers provide an example \n     of service, of sacrifice. He said we all need to learn that \n     you have to ``die a little bit'' to help the country \n     progress.\n       In Bulgaria, where the historic transition to democracy is \n     barely a decade old and where environmental awareness is just \n     awakening, I met Jeremy West, a forestry volunteer from North \n     Carolina working in the beautiful town of Etropole, nestled \n     against snow-capped mountains. In an open town meeting, the \n     mayor and council approved Jeremy's plans, developed with \n     local teenagers, to turn the former communist party \n     headquarters into an environmental resource center where \n     young people will help spotlight the area's bio-diversity and \n     the threat of pollution.\n       The Peace Corps is alive and well and keeping faith with \n     its legacy. That is why it remains one of the most effective, \n     best-known and widely accepted international volunteer \n     organizations in the world. Each year, we continue to receive \n     more than 100,000 inquiries from people interested in serving \n     in the Peace Corps. We have strong bipartisan support in \n     Congress, and earlier this year, President Clinton proposed a \n     $30 million increase for our budget.\n       Those funds are crucial if we are to keep pace with the bi-\n     partisan decision of the Congress, approved last May, to \n     support President Clinton's proposal to restore the Peace \n     Corps to 10,000 Volunteers.\n       We also are strengthening our ties to Returned Peace Corps \n     Volunteers. After their overseas service, many returned \n     Volunteers continue to serve their own communities through \n     countless volunteer activities. And we thank those of you who \n     help us recruit new Volunteers. Over the next 12 months, we \n     look forward to working with returned Volunteers here in \n     Boston and across the country, as well as with the National \n     Peace Corps Association and other friends of the agency, on \n     plans to celebrate our 40th anniversary in 2001.\n       Peace Corps Day was started three years ago to shine a \n     spotlight on the agency, the development work of our \n     Volunteers around the world, and the continuing service that \n     returned volunteers across the country bring\n\n[[Page S1879]]\n\n     to their communities here in the United States. And it's been \n     an extraordinary success.\n       I am pleased to report that tomorrow, according to our best \n     estimates, nearly 12,000 returned Peace Corps Volunteers and \n     educators will lead classroom presentations to more than \n     500,000 students in our nation's classrooms on Peace Corps \n     Day. These presentations enable young people to learn \n     about what it is like to live in another country, to learn \n     another language, and adapt to a new culture.\n       Tomorrow, I will visit Woodrow Wilson Elementary School in \n     Framingham, where State Senator David Magnani and I will talk \n     about our own Peace Corps experiences in Sierra Leone and El \n     Salvador. I also will make a trip to Maria Royston's \n     classroom at the Placentino Elementary School in Holliston. \n     Maria, who is here with us tonight, served as a Peace Corps \n     Volunteer in Cameroon. She, another returned Volunteer, Tasha \n     Ferraro, and I will speak with her students and then make an \n     international telephone call to a Peace Corps Volunteer who \n     is serving as a teacher in the west African nation of Burkina \n     Faso. This Volunteer, Molly Shabica, who hails form \n     Providence, helps bring the world back home throughout the \n     year by participating in the Peace Corps' outstanding \n     program, World Wise Schools, which links more than 7,000 \n     teachers here at home to Peace Corps Volunteers serving \n     overseas.\n       As returned Volunteers speak about their Peace Corps \n     experience, I think the visits they make to classrooms in \n     their communities tomorrow will promote an even larger \n     purpose for our nation's young people: these returned Peace \n     Corps Volunteers stand as examples of the ideal of service. \n     Over the years, virtually every American who has taken the \n     oath to become a Volunteer, and returned home after two \n     years, transforms that oath into a lifetime pledge of public \n     service. This ideal is at the heart of the Peace Corps, and \n     it is what has motivated more than 150,000 of our citizens to \n     answer President Kennedy's call to serve our country and the \n     world.\n       So I want to thank every returned Volunteer who is \n     participating in Peace Corps Day here in New England and in \n     cities and towns across our country. They are continuing that \n     legacy.\n       Since I became Director of the Peace Corps, I have thought \n     a lot about what our Volunteers have accomplished over the \n     last 39 years, and what they are doing today in this new and \n     exciting century. We have established a great legacy and \n     tradition of service. Our Volunteers do much to strengthen \n     the ties of friendship and international understanding \n     between Americans and the people of other countries.\n       If there has been a change over the past four decades, I \n     believe it may be the following. Today's Peace Corps \n     Volunteers have a unique capacity to produce an even greater \n     development impact than their predecessors. They possess new \n     skills and talents that can help the communities where they \n     serve, bridge the digital divide. Our Volunteers can bring \n     the power of information technology to enable hundreds of \n     thousands of people in developing countries learn more, live \n     healthier lives, and earn more income.\n       Most of our Volunteers who are serving in the Peace Corps \n     are comparative experts in information technology, and many \n     of them already are pioneering computer access in some of the \n     poorest communities in the world.\n       For instance, Peace Corps Volunteers are helping to set up \n     a cyber cafe in Senegal and a millennium computer literacy \n     project in Ghana for small businesses, that has won \n     international awards. One innovative education Volunteer in \n     Kenya powered his laptop with abandoned solar panels so he \n     could surf the Net in order to help prepare his lesson plans \n     for his students.\n       A few weeks ago during my trip to Central America, I met an \n     outstanding senior Volunteer who had spent 40 years as a \n     marketing executive at the Goodyear tire company. He served \n     two years as a business Volunteer in Ukraine. Today, he is in \n     his second tour as a business Volunteer in Guatemala, where \n     he is working with a small company that helps Mayan women's \n     cooperatives expand their markets and improve their products. \n     He taught them how to make a web page that now is advertising \n     their traditional fabrics in the E-commerce marketplace.\n       In Bulgaria, I met Allison Rainville, Angela Roe, and Heidi \n     Berbee. Allison from North Andover, Massachusetts, is \n     teaching English to students in the town of Bourgas. But she \n     also is working with the Bulgarian Red Cross to provide basic \n     computer training to Red Cross workers. Angela, from \n     Stockbridge, Georgia, is working on community economic \n     development and she is helping her business students link \n     into the Internet for the first time and teaching them how to \n     make their own web page. Heidi, from Minnetonka, Minnesota, \n     is teaching students to use the Internet for research and is \n     giving some of her female students an opportunity to learn \n     about government by e-mailing mayors to ask them about their \n     jobs.\n       These are just several examples of how Volunteers are using \n     technology to help their communities develop and prosper. But \n     I believe that more can be done. History has taught us that \n     whenever technological advances are made--whether it is \n     electricity, telephones, or modern modes of transportation--\n     the poor tend to benefit last. Globalization is having the \n     same impact. As the developed world moves forward every day \n     with even new advances in technology, the poorest countries \n     and the poorest communities in each country are left farther \n     behind, largely because of lower educational levels. Our \n     Volunteers, with their computer skills and presence in some \n     of the smallest towns can help alter that reality.\n       That is why I am announcing today a new initiative that \n     will expand the role that our Volunteers play in bringing the \n     power of information technology to the task of poverty \n     reduction. I am asking the Peace Corps' staff at our \n     headquarters and at our overseas posts to place a new and \n     more coordinated focus on technology and develop specific \n     Volunteer projects that will expand the use of information \n     technology, computers, and the Internet in developing \n     countries.\n       For instance, we will see what more our Volunteers can do \n     to help micro-entrepreneurs explore new markets through \n     technology. Volunteers can work with farmers to use \n     information technology for improving agricultural practices. \n     They can help local health workers use technology to monitor \n     immunization programs for children. Peace Corps Volunteers \n     and teachers can find new ways to bring the Internet into \n     more classrooms. They can work on a wider basis with \n     municipal governments, non-governmental organizations, \n     environmental groups, and youth organizations to bring the \n     power of technology to bear on local problems.\n       This technology initiative will, in my view, simply give \n     Volunteers the green light to innovate, in bridging the \n     digital divide, while remaining true to the core mission that \n     President Kennedy set out for the Peace Corps--to help the \n     people of the developing world help themselves.\n       Information technology is not a development panacea to \n     solve the many challenges that confront the world's poorest \n     countries. But it can contribute to new solutions. Nor am I \n     suggesting that the Peace Corps can or should become the \n     financier for computers. That is the task of others.\n       But the technology skills of Peace Corps Volunteers can, \n     where appropriate, play a significant role in introducing \n     technology to their overseas communities. Our Volunteers can \n     serve as advisers, collaborators, and facilitators for their \n     communities and their counterparts. In that way, the many \n     technology projects that are financed by other organizations \n     can become accessible to students and businesses that are not \n     in the main square of capital cities, but at the end of the \n     road in distant villages.\n       I also would like to challenge America's information giants \n     to expand their cooperation to respond to computer projects \n     that Volunteers, in collaboration with their students, \n     communities and counterparts, are beginning to develop around \n     the world.\n       After my trip these last two weeks, I feel even more \n     strongly about two other issues that I also would like to \n     highlight today. Both are global in nature but each impacts \n     with greatest urgency in Africa.\n       First, I come here with a great sadness, concern and \n     determination to do something more about the horrendous \n     destruction being caused by HIV/AIDS in Africa. The spread of \n     AIDS is inflicting a terrible and devastating toll on \n     millions of innocent people and preventing many countries \n     from consolidating their gains in economic and social \n     development. Last year, ten times as many people died of AIDS \n     in Africa as were killed in all the continent's wars \n     combined. It will soon double child mortality and reduce life \n     expectancy by 20 years.\n       The magnitude of the HIV/AIDS devastation is hard to \n     comprehend fully. UNAIDS and other international health \n     organizations report that of the 33.4 million cases of HIV/\n     AIDS reported worldwide; 23.5 million of them are in Africa. \n     There are 7.8 million AIDS orphans, and while the average \n     infection rate in sub-Saharan Africa among adults is 8%, it \n     ranges in some countries up to 26%. Africa has 10% of the \n     world's population and 70% of the world's HIV/AIDS. Already, \n     an estimated 13.7 million Africans have lost their lives to \n     AIDS.\n       There is no greater humanitarian crisis. There is no \n     greater development obstacle. There is no greater political \n     challenge than adopting effective HIV/AIDS prevention and \n     control strategies in Africa.\n       For that reason, I was pleased that the country directors \n     in Africa all agreed to explore how to incorporate a health \n     education component on HIV/AIDS into every program. Almost \n     all of our programs in health do. Now we must take the next \n     step. We simply have to find additional ways to assist the \n     countries where we serve to do even more in their efforts to \n     reduce the spread of AIDS.\n       Secondly, three decades ago, Peace Corps Volunteers played \n     an important role in the successful international effort to \n     eradicate smallpox. More recently, they have made significant \n     contributions to the world's efforts to eradicate Guinea \n     worm.\n       Today, the World Health Organization, UNICEF, and Rotary \n     International are embarked on a major project to eradicate \n     polio by the year 2005. Given that many of our Volunteers \n     serve in remote areas of their countries, Peace Corps will \n     seek to become part of this international effort to eradicate \n     polio. Some of our Volunteers already help organize \n     immunization campaigns in their villages. We will be \n     expanding these immunization efforts in countries where the \n     threat of polio still exists, collaborating with national \n     immunization efforts that are part of the global campaign. \n     The Peace Corps would be making yet another enormous \n     contribution to protecting children from the devastating \n     impact of a preventable disease.\n\n[[Page S1880]]\n\n       President Kennedy said in his second State of the Union, \n     ``I sometimes think that we are too much impressed by the \n     clamor of daily events. . . . Yet it is the profound \n     tendencies of history and not the passing excitement that \n     will shape our future.'' The Peace Corps has been addressing \n     those profound tendencies of history over the past four \n     decades. With your help, I have no doubt that Volunteers will \n     continue to do so as we enter this 21st century.\n       So as I said a few moments ago, this is an exciting time to \n     be a part of the Peace Corps. I am thrilled to be its \n     Director and I am delighted that so many of you could be here \n     with us to celebrate Peace Corps Day.\n       Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1880-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HOPE NETWORK, S.E. FIFTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Hope \nNetwork, S.E., an organization which will hold its Fifth Anniversary \nCelebration on April 9, 2000. Since it opened in 1994, Hope Network, \nS.E. has provided disabled and disadvantaged individuals of Oakland, \nMacomb, and Wayne Counties not only with places to live, but, more \nimportantly, with communities to live in.\n  Hope Network, S.E. is a member organization of the Hope Network, \nwhich employs more than 2000 people and operates from more than 130 \ndifferent locations throughout the state of Michigan. The mission of \nHope Network is to enhance the dignity and independence of people who \nhave disabilities and/or are disadvantaged. The foundation of its \nefforts is the belief that every individual is created in the image of \nGod and therefore has intrinsic worth and dignity.\n  The primary goal of Hope Network, S.E. is to provide the highest \nquality of living for people with disabilities. This is done by \nrespecting the dignity and independence of these individuals, by giving \nthem the opportunity to offer input and make decisions about their own \npersonalized plan of service. The success of Hope Network, S.E. lies in \nthis process, for it is a process which encourages disabled individuals \nto become involved in community and social activities.\n  Part of the Fifth Anniversary Celebration is an art show and auction. \nThe pieces of art on display were created at The Art Experience, a \ngallery in Oakland County which offers art therapy for mentally ill \nindividuals. Its biggest client, not surprisingly, is Hope Network, \nS.E. Employees of Hope Network, S.E. transport individuals, men and \nwomen who usually do not like to stray far from their homes, twenty-\nfive miles to The Art Experience. I am told that it is a place where \ndisabilities, though they do not disappear, are briefly forgotten.\n  Mr. President, I applaud Hope Network, S.E. Executive Director Pat \nCrandall, and her many employees and volunteers, for five years of \nsuccessful service to Oakland, Macomb and Wayne Counties. Their \ndedication and selfless efforts have touched numerous lives and \nindelibly left their mark on these communities. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I wish Hope Network, S.E. a happy fifth \nanniversary. I hope that the coming years are as successful as the \nfirst five have been.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1880-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nWAYNE METRO DIVISION OF THE OFFICE OF JUVENILE JUSTICE HONORS MS.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Ms. Diane \nRansom-McGhee, who on March 31, 2000, will be honored by the Wayne \nMetro Division of the Office of Juvenile Justice for twenty-seven years \nof service to the families and children of the State of Michigan. Early \nin her life, Ms. Ransom-McGhee decided that she wished to work in the \nfield of Human Services, and over the past twenty-seven years she has \ncontinually demonstrated not only a love for helping people, but also \nimpressive leadership capabilities.\n  Ms. Ransom-McGhee has worked at a number of organizations in the \nDetroit metropolitan area: from 1972 to 1979 she worked at the Wayne \nCounty Department of Social Services, from 1979 to 1986 she worked as a \nChild Welfare Specialist at the State of Michigan Children Youth and \nServices, from 1988 to 1989 she worked as the Director of the Monte \nVista Reception Center, from 1989 to 1994 she worked as a Clinical \nDirector in the State of Michigan Burton Youth Reception Center, from \n1994 to 1997 she worked as the Administrative Director of Wayne Metro \nDay Treatment Services for juvenile delinquents, and in 1997 she \nreturned to Burton Youth Reception Center to serve as its Director.\n  In addition to her work in the Human Services field, Ms. Ransom-\nMcGhee has a number of outside interests. She is a board member of the \nState of Michigan Judiciary Detention Association; she is a Youth \nCounselor Consultant of the Girl Scouts of America; she is an Advisor \nConsultant of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople Youth Council, she is a sponsor of the N.A.A.C.P. Black College \nTour and Mentorship program; and she is a Youth Minister and Sunday \nSchool teacher at the New Hope Missionary Baptist Church.\n  Ms. Ransom-McGhee has received several awards for her dedication to \nher work and to her community. In 1996, she received the Pastoral \nCommunity Service Award. In 1997, she received the Director of the Year \nAward from the State of Michigan Office of Juvenile Justice. And in \n1998, the city of Southfield, Michigan, awarded her with its Community \nPride Award.\n  On April 1, 2000, Ms. Ransom-McGhee will assume new duties as \nAssistant Division Director at the Wayne County Juvenile Detention \nCenter. Mr. President, I applaud Ms. Ransom-McGhee for her dedication \nto her job and her tireless work over the past twenty-seven years. She \nis a role model for us all. On behalf of the entire United States \nSenate, I wish her the best of luck in her new position.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1880-3", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1880-S1881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSOUTHEASTERN MICHIGAN CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS SEVENTH ANNUAL \n                    RHAPSODY IN RED MASQUERADE BALL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, on April 1, 2000, the Southeastern \nMichigan Chapter of the American Red Cross will hold its seventh annual \nRhapsody in Red Masquerade Ball, a celebration which allows its patrons \nto enjoy themselves and to support one of the most noble causes our \ncountry has ever known at the same time. I rise today not only to honor \nthis occasion, but also to bestow praise and thanks upon an \norganization that truly deserves both.\n  Since 1994, this annual gala has raised over one million dollars for \nthe Southeastern Michigan Chapter. The Rhapsody in Red Masquerade Ball \nplays a significant role in allowing this chapter to continue its \ndisaster relief efforts in Macomb, Oakland, and Wayne counties. The \nannual event also provides members of the community with an opportunity \nto recognize the tireless efforts of the administrative staff and the \nvolunteers of the Southeastern Michigan Chapter, and to appropriately \nthank them for these efforts.\n  In 1999 alone, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter provided disaster \nrelief to more than 6,000 individuals. More than 14,000 volunteers \noffered their time to the chapter, collectively working more than \n500,000 hours. I am proud to say that, of the fifty states, Michigan \nranks fourth in the nation for exporting volunteers into emergency \nzones, and the efforts and organization of the Southeastern Michigan \nChapter undoubtedly play a role in this success. In addition, through \nits Blanket Days for the Homeless Campaign, an operation spearheaded by \nfourteen volunteers, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter collected over \n13,000 blankets, which were then distributed to seventy homeless \nshelters in Wayne, Oakland and Macomb counties. Recently, in response \nto an increase in residential fires, the Southeastern Michigan Chapter \nmaintained 24-hour Disaster Action Teams, formed from a pool of sixty-\nfour trained volunteers.\n  Mr. President, as I was preparing this statement I was reminded once \nagain of the essential role the American Red Cross plays in our \ncommunities. Born from the mythic efforts of Clara Barton during the \nCivil War, the organization currently has more than 1.3 million \nvolunteers working underneath its banner, providing disaster relief \nservices for victims of more than 66,000 disasters per year. More \nimportantly, the American Red Cross still holds firm to the principles \nit was founded upon. Its mission remains to prevent and alleviate human \nsuffering wherever it may\n\n[[Page S1881]]\n\nbe found. That is why, when things are at their worst, it continues to \nbe the American Red Cross and its volunteers that are there to make \nthem better.\n  Mr. President, I applaud the administrative staff and volunteers of \nthe Southeastern Michigan Chapter of the American Red Cross for their \nremarkable efforts. Every day they remind the people of Michigan that \nthe spirit of Clara Barton is alive and well. On behalf of the entire \nUnited States Senate, I hope that the Red Rhapsody Masquerade Ball is a \nsuccess for a seventh time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1881-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN RECOGNITION OF YOUTH CONNECTION, DETROIT, MICHIGAN\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Youth \nConnection, a strategic, non-profit prevention campaign with a ten-year \ngoal of reducing youth violence, substance abuse and early sexual \nactivity in Detroit, Michigan. The organization was founded to provide \nthe youth of metropolitan Detroit with a sense of belonging to the \npresent, and also with a sense of hope and inspiration for the future.\n  Presently, in coordination with Detroit Public Schools, Mt. Clemens \nCommunity Schools and the School District of Pontiac, Youth Connection \nis promoting an activity called Free 4 the Weekend, which encourages \nstudents within these districts to remain drug free during a designated \nweekend in April.\n  Mr. President, statistics tell us that eighty-seven percent of high \nschool seniors report using alcohol. In addition, middle and high \nschool students drink nearly thirty-five percent of all wine coolers \nconsumed in the United States. These patterns have devastating \nconsequences. Research shows that most youth misconduct and violence \ntakes place after school between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. It is \nmy belief that by supporting and enhancing after school programs, \nexpanding the ``Safe Night'' initiatives in partner communities, and \nexpanding youth leadership programs and activities, we can enhance the \nquality of life for all metropolitan Detroit youth.\n  Mr. President, with Alcohol Awareness Month just a few days away, I \napplaud Youth Connection for encouraging the youth of metropolitan \nDetroit to remain sober. On behalf of the entire United States Senate, \nand also the State of Michigan, I would like to thank them for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1881-2", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:41 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, once of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 910.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nwith respect to penalties for licensed firearms dealers; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            firearms dealer penalty flexibility act of 2000\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \nfirst in a series of several bills I will be proposing to provide law \nenforcement with the tools they need to enforce our current gun laws.\n\n  Let me be clear--I do believe that our current laws need to be \nenhanced. Too many loopholes allow too many criminals to circumvent the \nlaws already in place. To that end, I will continue to work on \nlegislation to further restrict criminals' access to deadly firearms.\n  But it is also clear that we can do better in enforcing the laws \nalready on the books. As a result, today I am proposing legislation \nthat will tighten up the enforcement of our current laws. The \nlegislation I have sent to the desk, the Firearms Dealer Penalty \nFlexibility Act of 2000, will provide the Treasury Department, and the \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the ability to punish dealers \naccording to the severity of their crimes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort, and I hope the \nNational Rifle Association is listening, too. It is time for that \norganization to stop just talking about enforcing our current gun laws, \nand to start supporting legislation to help in that process. So today I \nchallenge the NRA to support this bill and others like it. For too \nlong, opponents of gun control have talked about enforcement, while at \nthe same time working to tie the hands of those that enforce the laws. \nIt is time to move forward.\n  Now let me describe just what this legislation would accomplish.\n  Mr. President, under current law there exists only one penalty for \nfirearms dealers who violate the law--revocation of their license. If a \ndealer violates the law, the ATF is left with only two options--\npermanently revoke the dealer's license, or do nothing.\n  The problem, of course, is that not every violation merits the \npermanent revocation of a dealer's license. The current law is like \nhaving the death penalty for every crime--from jaywalking to murder. We \nhave graduated sanctions in the criminal law because different crimes \nmerit different punishment.\n  In most instances, the ATF is understandably reluctant to destroy a \ndealer's livelihood--and the dealers know this. As a result, thousands \nof violations every year go unpunished.\n  Last year, ATF conducted 11,234 examinations, and reported 3,863 \nviolations.\n  Yet only 20 licenses were actually revoked.\n  Almost 4,000 violations, just 20 revocations.\n  And this may have actually been the appropriate response. Again, not \nevery violation is deserving of revocation. Many of these dealers are \nsimply businessmen, who may have made one or two simple mistakes. \nTaking away their livelihood would be inappropriately harsh.\n  But at the same time, ATF has informed me that there are other \ndealers out there who are taking advantage of the current system. These \ndealers know that if they commit a violation, they probably won't even \nget caught--after all, with more than 100,000 dealers and only a few \nhundred inspectors, the odds of catching a dealer in the act are slim. \nAnd even worse than that, these dealers know that even if they are \ncaught, and even if ATF does discover a violation or even a pattern of \nviolations, it is very unlikely that anything will be done.\n  According to ATF, only the most egregious or repeat offenders are \npunished.\n  Mr. President, it was clearly not the intent of Congress when passing \nlaws to regulate firearms dealers in this country that dealers would be \neffectively immune from those laws.\n  The current situation leaves law enforcement with little choice--if \nATF revokes the license of every dealer that commits a minor violation, \nthe NRA would be up in arms. But if they do the right thing under \ncurrent law and allow dealers to stay in business, they are criticized \nfor failing to enforce the current law.\n  Well the bill I propose today would put an end to this quandary, and \nallow\n\n[[Page S1885]]\n\nthe Treasury Department to impose the proper, proportionate penalties \nfor the variety of violations currently on the books.\n\n  Specifically, this legislation, supported by the Administration, \nwould do the following:\n  For willful violations of the law, this legislation would allow the \nTreasury Department to suspend or revoke a dealer's license, or to \nassess a fine of up to $10,000 per violation;\n  Those same penalties would be available for any dealer who willfully \ntransfers armor piercing ammunition;\n  The legislation allows the Treasury Department to negotiate a \ncompromise with a dealer at any time;\n  And the legislation outlines some clear, procedural protections for \ndealers--\n  A right to notice and opportunity for a hearing before any action is \ntaken, so that the dealer may be made aware of the charges and seek to \navert the action;\n  A right to written notice of any action taken, including the grounds \nupon which the action was based;\n  A right to a prompt hearing after a penalty is assessed, during which \ntime the dealer can contest the outcome. This hearing must even be held \nat a location convenient to the dealer;\n  If the second hearing is not fruitful, the dealer has an additional \nright to appeal the decision of the Department to federal court, during \nwhich time any action is stayed.\n  Mr. President, these procedural safeguards prevent an aggressive \nagent from pursuing unfair penalties. There are at least three clear \nopportunities for an aggrieved dealer to make his or her case, \nincluding the right to appeal any decision to federal court.\n  As a result, I believe that this bill gives law abiding firearms \ndealers every opportunity necessary to protect themselves against \nunwarranted claims.\n  At the same time, this bill provides law enforcement with the variety \nof sanctions necessary to force true compliance with the laws already \non the books. No more will rogue dealers flout the law knowing that no \nviable recourse is available to law enforcement.\n  Once this legislation passes, the punishment will finally fit the \ncrime.\n  Mr. President, again I challenge the NRA and my colleagues to join me \nin moving this bill forward. We cannot continue to allow miscreant gun \ndealers to ignore the laws passed by this Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Frist, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Reed and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 2311. A bill to revise and extend the Ryan White CARE Act programs \nunder title XXVI of the Public Health Service Act, to improve access to \nhealth care and the quality of health care under such programs, and to \nprovide for the development of increased capacity to provide health \ncare and related support services to individuals and families with HIV \ndisease, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 ryan white care act amendments of 2000\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to join my \ncolleagues today in introducing the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS \nResources and Emergency Act Amendments of 2000; a measure that will \nreauthorize a national program of providing primary health care \nservices for people living with HIV and AIDS. I especially want to \ncommend Senators Hatch and Kennedy for the leadership they have \nprovided since the inauguration of the legislation establishing the \nRyan White programs over a decade ago. I also want to commend Senator \nFrist whose medical expertise played a critical role in key provisions \nof the bill and continues to be an invaluable resource to our efforts \non the range of health issues that come before the Senate. Finally, I \nwant to acknowledge Senator Enzi's recognition of the growing burden \nthat AIDS and HIV is having on rural communities throughout the country \nand the need to address those gaps in services.\n\n  Since its inception in 1990, the Ryan White program has enjoyed broad \nbipartisan support. When I looked back to the last time the Ryan White \nCARE Act was reauthorized in 1996, I was heartened to see that the \nmeasure had garnered a vote of 97 to 3 on its final passage. I urge my \ncolleagues to examine this bill we are introducing today and to join me \nin working toward its passage.\n  With this reauthorization, we mark the ten years through which the \nRyan White CARE Act has provided needed health care and support \nservices to HIV positive people around the country. Titles I and II \nhave provided much needed relief to cities and states hardest hit by \nthis disease, while Titles III and IV have had a direct role in \nproviding healthcare services to underserved communities. Ryan White \nprogram dollars provide the foundation of care so necessary in fighting \nthis epidemic.\n  Fortunately, we have experienced significant success over the last \ndecade, and especially over the last five years. The General Accounting \nOffice recently released a report that found that CARE Act funds are \nreaching the infected groups that have generally been found to be \nunderserved, including the poor, the uninsured, women, and ethnic \nminorities. In fact, these groups form a majority of CARE Act clients \nand are being served by the CARE Act in higher proportions than their \nrepresentation in the AIDS population. The GAO also found that CARE Act \nfunds support a wide array of primary care and support services, \nincluding the provision of powerful therapeutic regimens for people \nwith HIV/AIDS that have dramatically reduced AIDS diagnoses and deaths.\n  Mr. President, there have also been successes in the reduction of \nHIV/AIDS among women, infants and children. During the last \nreauthorization, Congressman Coburn and our colleague, Senator Frist, \nfocused our attention on the needs of women living with HIV/AIDS and \nthe problems associated with perinatal transmission of HIV. Since then, \nthe CARE Act has helped to dramatically reduce mother-to-child \ntransmission through more effective outreach, counseling, and \nvoluntary testing of mothers at risk for HIV infection. Between 1993 \nand 1998, perinatal-acquired AIDS cases declined 74% in the U.S. In \nthis bill, I have continued to support efforts to reach women in need \nof care for their HIV disease and have included provisions to ensure \nthat women, infants and children receive resources in accordance with \nthe prevalence of the infection among them.\n\n  Another key success has been the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. New \ntherapies and improved systems of care have led to impressive \nreductions in the AIDS death rate and the number of new AIDS cases. \nFrom 1996 to 1998, deaths from AIDS dropped 54% while new AIDS cases \nhave been reduced by 27%. However, these treatments are very expensive, \ndo not provide a cure, and do not work for everyone.\n  Much has occurred to change the course of the AIDS epidemic since the \nlast reauthorization. A whole new class of therapeutic drugs called \nanti-retrovirals have been developed and people are living longer and \nthe rate of increase of the number of new AIDS cases has begun to level \noff. AIDS, HIV, the people it infects and families that it has affected \nare not in the news today as often as they have been in the past. But \nfor too many of us, this lack of bad news has created a false sense of \ncomplacency. The epidemic of HIV continues to grow, to infect whole new \ngroups of people, and to expand both within our urban areas and beyond \nto our rural communities.\n  While the rate of decline in new AIDS cases and AIDS deaths is \nleveling off, HIV infection rates continue to rise in many areas; \nbecoming increasingly prevalent in rural and underserved urban areas; \nand also among women, youth, and minority communities. Local and state \nhealthcare systems face an increasing burden of disease, despite our \nsuccess in treating and caring for people living with HIV and AIDS. \nUnfortunately, rural and underserved urban areas are often unable to \naddress the complex medical and support services needs of people with \nHIV infection.\n  The bill being introduced today was developed on a bipartisan basis, \nworking with other Committee Members, community stakeholders and \nelected officials at the state and local levels from whom we sought \ninput to ensure that we addressed the most important\n\n[[Page S1886]]\n\nproblems facing communities of people with HIV infection. Earlier this \nmonth, I held a hearing before the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions to learn whether the program has been successful \nand whether it needed to be changed. We received testimony from Ryan \nWhite's mother, Jeanne White, from Surgeon General David Satcher, from \na person living with AIDS, as well as state and local officials \nfamiliar with the importance of this program. I especially want to \ncommend Dr. Chris Grace of Vermont who testified as to the particular \nchallenges of providing care to people living with HIV/AIDS in rural, \nand sometimes remote, parts of the country. It was clear from our \nwitnesses' statements that, despite the successes, challenges remain.\n  To address these challenges, we have developed a bill that will \nimprove access to care in underserved urban and rural areas. My bill \nwill double the minimum base funding available to states through the \nCARE Act to assist them in developing systems of care for people \nstruggling with HIV and AIDS. The bill also includes a new supplemental \nstate grant that will target assistance to rural and underserved areas \nto help them address the increasing number of people with HIV/AIDS \nliving outside of urban areas that receive assistance under Title I of \nthe Act. Furthermore, these areas will be given preference for direct \ncare grants and we have strengthened the AIDS Drug Assistance Program \nto supplement those states struggling to provide lifesaving drugs to \ntheir HIV/AIDS patients.\n  We have not changed the unique flexibility of CARE Act programs; it \nremains primarily a system of grants to State and local jurisdictions. \nStates and EMAs will still decide how to best prioritize and address \nthe healthcare needs of their HIV-positive citizens.\n  Today, there are few people who can say they have not been touched by \nthis epidemic. Recently, I had the opportunity to visit with Jeanne \nWhite. We talked about the impact of this disease; about the loved ones \nit has taken, and the damage to the lives of those it has left behind--\nabout the infected, and about the affected. We talked about her son \nRyan, and about my good friend David Curtis of Burlington, Vermont, who \ntestified before my committee in 1995, but who passed away just last \nyear. As an advocate of the program and as a person living with AIDS, \nDavid helped me to understand the terrible impact of this disease. Ryan \nWhite and David and countless others, worked long and hard to ensure \nthat all people affected by AIDS could receive both the care and \ncompassion they deserve.\n  The AIDS epidemic, despite our success in developing treatments and \nproviding systems of care, is still ravaging communities in this \ncountry. This program remains as vital to the public health of this \nnation as it was in 1990 and in 1996. As the AIDS epidemic reaches into \nrural areas and into underserved urban communities across the country, \nthis legislation being introduced today will allow us to adapt our care \nsystems to meet the most urgent needs in the communities hardest hit by \nthe epidemic.\n  I intend to see this bill become law this year so that the people \nstruggling to overcome the challenges of HIV and AIDS continue to \nbenefit from high quality medical care and access to lifesaving drugs. \nWe have made incredible progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS and I \nwant to be sure that every person in America that needs our assistance, \nbenefits from our tremendous advances.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that the text of this measure \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2311\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senators \nJeffords, Frist, Dodd, Hatch, Bingaman, and Wellstone in introducing \nthe Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act. I commend Senator Jeffords for \nhis leadership and commitment in making this legislation a top priority \nof the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for enactment \nthis year. I commend Senator Frist for his medical knowledge and \nexpertise in drafting this legislation. Senator Dodd has been strongly \ncommitted to this issue for many years and I am pleased that he \ncontinues his commitment this year. Senator Hatch joined me more than a \ndecade ago when we first introduced this legislation, and he has \nremained committed and involved ever since, and I commend his \nleadership. Senators Bingaman and Wellstone are members of our Senate \nCommittee, and they have shown a great deal of interest in making sure \nthat these resources reach rural Americans and other emerging \npopulations.\n  Over the past twenty years, the nation has made extraordinary \nprogress in responding to the AIDS epidemic. Medical advances, new and \neffective treatments, and the development of an HIV care infrastructure \nin every state have dramatically improved the access to care for \nindividuals and families with HIV who would otherwise not be able to \nafford such care. By providing life-sustaining health and related \nsupport services, we have reduced the spread of AIDS.\n  The CARE Act has contributed to the significant drop in new AIDS \ncases. AIDS-related deaths have decreased significantly, dropping 42% \nfrom 1996 to 1997, and 20% from 1997 to 1998. Persons with HIV/AIDS are \nliving longer and healthier lives because of the CARE Act.\n  Perinatal HIV transmission from mother to child has been reduced by \n75% from 1992 to 1997. We are closing the gap in health care \ndisparities in vulnerable populations such as communities of color, \nwomen, and persons with HIV who are uninsured and underinsured.\n  Medications have made a difference too. Highly active anti-retroviral\n\n[[Page S1891]]\n\ntherapies have given a second lease on life to many Americans with HIV/\nAIDS. An estimated 80% of persons in treatment have used one or more of \nthese new and effective drugs.\n  HIV health care and supportive services have also made a difference. \nAn estimated 600,000 persons have received HIV services through the \nRyan White CARE Act, including primary care, substance abuse treatment, \ndental care, hospice care, and other specialized HIV health care \nservices, and the availability of these services has enabled them to \nlead productive lives.\n  In Massachusetts, for example, we have seen an overall 77% decline in \nAIDS and HIV-related deaths since 1995. At the same time, however, like \nmany other states, we are concerned about the changing HIV/AIDS trends \nand profiles. AIDS and HIV cases increased in women by 11% from 1997 to \n1998, and 55% of persons living with AIDS in the state are persons of \ncolor.\n  Clearly, we have had significant successes in fighting AIDS. We have \ncome a long way from the days when ideology dictated care for people \nwith AIDS and not sound public health policy. Fortunately, with the \nleadership of Senator Hatch and Senator Jeffords and our bipartisan \ncoalition, we were able to enact the Ryan White CARE Act in memory of \nRyan White. He was a young man with hemophilia who contracted AIDS \nthrough blood transfusions, and touched the world's heart through his \nvaliant efforts to speak out against the ignorance and discrimination \nfaced by many persons living with AIDS. His mother, Jeanne White \ncarried on her son's message after Ryan's death in 1990. She was \ninstrumental in the passage of the Care Act in 1990 and then again in \n1996 and now in 2000.\n  The enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1900 provided an \nemergency response to the devastating effects of HIV on individuals, \nfamilies, communities, and state and local governments. The CARE Act \nsignaled a comprehensive approach by targeting funds to respond to the \nspecific needs of communities. Title I targets the hardest hit \nmetropolitan areas in the country. Local planning and priority setting \nrequirements under Title I assure that each of the Eligible \nMetropolitan Areas respond to the local HIV/AIDS demographics.\n  Title II of the Act funds emergency relief to the states. It helps \nthem to develop an HIV care infrastructure and provide effective and \nlife-sustaining HIV/AIDS drug therapies through the AIDS Drug \nAssistance Program to over 61,000 persons each month.\n  Title III funds community health centers and other primary health \ncare providers that serve communities with a significant and \ndisproportionate need for HIV care. Many of these community health \ncenters are located in the hardest hit areas, serving low income \ncommunities.\n  Finally, Title IV of the CARE Act is designed to meet the specific \nneeds of women, children and families.\n  While the CARE Act has benefited large numbers of Americans in need, \na number of critical areas remain where improvements are essential if \nwe are to meet the growing needs in our communities. We know that of \nthe estimated 750,000 persons living with HIV/AIDS in the United \nStates, over 215,000 know their HIV status, yet are not in care. New \nhealth care access points are needed to bring these persons into care. \nAt the same time, the CARE Act programs currently serving an estimated \n600,000 persons annually are challenged more than ever in meeting the \ngrowing need and demand for services. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention estimates that the need will continue to grow since we \nhave an estimated 40,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS annually in the United \nStates.\n  Also, not everyone is benefiting from the advances in the development \nof new and effective drug treatments. The skyrocketing costs of \nexpensive AIDS drugs, estimated at $15,000 annually per person, has led \n26% of the CARE Act's AIDS Drug Assistance Programs to cap enrollment, \nestablish waiting lists, or limit eligibility. Guaranteeing that \neffective drug treatments are available and affordable to all persons \nwith HIV/AIDS has always been a priority for the CARE Act. Reducing \nbarriers to access in communities of color and other vulnerable \npopulations is a priority for this reauthorization.\n\n  We are fortunate in Massachusetts to have a state budget that has \nalso been able to provide funding for primary care, prevention, and \noutreach efforts, but no state by itself can provide the significant \nfinancial resources to help persons living with HIV to obtain needed \nmedical and support access.\n  We still find serious disparities in access to HIV health care in \ncommunities of color, women, the uninsured and underinsured. The \ndemographics of the epidemic have been steadily changing. The majority \nof new AIDS cases reported are among racial and ethnic minority \npopulations and groups that traditionally have faced heavy barriers in \nobtaining adequate health care services. While African Americans make \nup 12% of the general population, they account for 45% of new AIDS \ncases. 80% of new AIDS cases are occurring in women of color. As many \nas half of all new infections are occurring in people under the age of \n25, and one quarter of all new infections are occurring in persons \nunder the age of 22. The CARE Act must be able to adjust to meet these \nchanging trends in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Geographic shifts in the \nepidemic as well as the availability of new sources of financing for \nHIV/AIDS care must be taken into account to assure equity in how the \nfederal government and states respond to the epidemic.\n  The CARE Act must continue to provide resources to help local \ncommunities to plan and to set priorities for CARE dollars. We must \ndevelop better ways to measure the severity of need and the health \ndisparities, and assure that these improvements are taken into account \nin HIV planning, in establishing priorities, and in allocating funds.\n  This bill addresses these new challenges in ensuring access to HIV \ndrug treatments for all, reducing health disparities in vulnerable \ncommunities, and improving the distribution and quality of services \nunder the CARE Act. Proposed changes will ensure greater access to care \nin low income, historically underserved urban and rural communities, by \nincreasing targeted funding to areas where the HIV care infrastructure \nmay not exist. This bill also focuses on quality and accountability of \nHIV service delivery by requiring effective quality management \nactivities that ensure their consistency with Public Health Service \nguidelines, and by making changes to ensure that CARE Act dollars are \nused for their intended purposes.\n  These improvements are intended to close the gap in health care \ndisparities and improve inequities in services and funding among \nstates. They will build capacity in underserved rural and urban areas, \nand focus state and local program priorities on underserved populations \nand persons not in care. They will develop new points of entry \nrelationships to improve coordination of care. They will increase early \naccess to care, in order to begin HIV treatment earlier and improve the \nquality of care that patients receive.\n  We know that the CARE Act has made a difference not only in the lives \nof persons with HIV/AIDS, but also in the lives of countless loved ones \nwho have seen despair turned to hope through support of CARE Act \nservices. The story of Lory in Massachusetts is a compelling example of \nyoung woman living with HIV, unable to work full-time, and unable to \nafford anti-retroviral medications without Ryan White CARE Act \nassistance. The support she has received from the caring staff at \nFenway Clinic in Boston is impressive. As Lory told us at our committee \nhearing on March 2nd on the reauthorization of the Act ``It is not an \nexaggeration when I tell you that without Fenway I would be dead. They \nhave saved my life.''\n  I'm sure that Lory's eloquent testimony is true of countless others \nacross the country who are living with this tragic disease. The Ryan \nWhite CARE Act has made an enormous difference in their lives. I look \nforward to early action by Congress on this important legislation, so \nthat we can continue to help as many people as possible.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention estimate that between 650,000 and 900,000 Americans are \ncurrently living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), of whom \n280,000 have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). As of June \n1999, there were 8,814 people in my home state of Tennessee living with \nHIV/AIDS. As a physician, I have seen first hand the deadly impact of\n\n[[Page S1892]]\n\nthis disease on patients, and have also seen first hand what can happen \nif the prevalence of AIDS goes unchecked. On February 24, 2000, as \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Africa, I held a \nhearing on the AIDS crisis in Africa. In Africa, this disease has \nreached truly pandemic proportions, causing cultural and economic \ndevastation. Every day, there are 16,000 new infections globally, \ndespite the great strides we have made in the treatment and prevention \nof this condition.\n  Ironically and unfortunately, the new advancements in treatment may \nhave caused many to become complacent. A survey co-authored by Yale \nrevealed that more than 80% of our youth do not believe they are at \nrisk for HIV infections. However, the fact is that the number of new \ninfections among adolescents continues to rise and it is rising \ndisproportionally among minorities. AIDS remains the leading cause of \ndeath among African-Americans 25-44 years of age and the second leading \ncause of death among Latinos in the same age range. Furthermore, in \n1998, African-American and Hispanic women accounted for 80% of the \ntotal AIDS cases reported for women nationwide. In my own state of \nTennessee, 59% of the new AIDS cases were among African-Americans, who \nmake up 45% of the total AIDS cases in the state. Since its original \ndiscovery, it is estimated that over 13.9 million have died worldwide \nand over 400,000 have died in the United States as a result of HIV/\nAIDS. Fortunately, over the last 15 years, we have doubled the life \nexpectancy of people with AIDS, developed new and powerful drugs for \nthe treatment of HIV infection, and made advances in the treatment and \nprevention of AIDS-related opportunistic infections.\n  Another important component in the struggle against HIV/AIDS has been \nthe Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act, which \nI am pleased to join with Senator Jeffords in supporting today. The \nRyan White CARE Act, a unique partnership between federal, local, and \nstate governments; non-profit community organizations, health care and \nsupportive service providers. For the last decade, this Act has \nsuccessfully provided much needed assistance in health care costs and \nsupport services for low-income, uninsured and underinsured individuals \nwith HIV/AIDS.\n  Through programs such as AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), which \nprovides access to pharmaceuticals, the CARE Act has helped extend and \neven save lives. Last year alone, nearly 100,000 people living with HIV \nand AIDS received access to drug therapy because of the CARE Act. Half \nthe people served by the CARE Act have family incomes of less than \n$10,000 annually, which is lower than the $12,000 annual average cost \nof new drug ``cocktails'' for treatment. The CARE Act is critical in \nensuring that the number of people living with AIDS continues to \nincrease, as effective new drug therapies are keeping HIV-infected \npersons healthy longer and dramatically reducing the death rate. \nInvestments in enabling patients with HIV to live healthier and more \nproductive lives have helped to reduce overall health costs. For \nexample, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that the \nnation has seen a 30% decline in HIV related hospitalizations, which \nresults in nearly one million fewer HIV related hospital days and a \nsavings of more than $1 billion.\n  During the 104th Congress, I had the pleasure of working with Senator \nKassebaum on the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 1996 to ensure this \nneeded law was extended. Today I am pleased to join Senator Jeffords as \nan original cosponsor to the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000, \nwhich will further improve and extend this law. Senator Jeffords, who \nhas done a terrific job in crafting this bill, has already outlined \nsome specifics of this legislation, however, I would like to conclude \nby discussing a specific provision which I am grateful Senator Jeffords \nincluded in this reauthorization.\n  This bill contains a provision, under Title II of this Act, to \naddress the fact that the face of this disease is changing and is \nmoving into and affecting more rural communities. A recent GAO audit \nfound that rural areas may offer more limited medical and social \nservices than cities because urban areas generally receive more money \nper AIDS case. To help address this concern, this new provision will \nprovide supplemental grants to States for additional HIV/AIDS services \nin underserved areas. One important aspect of this provision is the \ncreation of supplemental grants for emerging metropolitan communities, \nwhich do not qualify for Title I funding but have reported between \n1,000 and 2,000 AIDS cases in the last five years. Currently, this \nprovision would provide 7 cities, including Memphis and Nashville, a \ngeneral pot of money to divide of at least $5 million in new funding \neach year, or 25% of new monies under Title II, whichever is greater.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Jeffords for his \nleadership on this issue, and Sean Donohue and William Fleming of his \nstaff for all their expertise in drafting this bill. I would also like \nto thank Senator Kennedy and Stephanie Robinson of his staff for their \nwork and dedication to this issue. I would also like to thank Dr. Bill \nMoore of the Tennessee Department of Health and Mr. Joe Interrante of \nNashville CARES for their counsel and assistance on this legislation \nand for their efforts in helping Tennesseans with HIV/AIDS.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy, \nJeffords, Frist, Hatch, Bingaman, Harkin, Wellstone, Reed, Enzi, and \nMikulski in sponsoring the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act, \nlegislation which will provide for the continuation of critical support \nservices for those living with HIV and AIDS. I thank Senators Jeffords \nand Kennedy for their leadership and commitment to this important bill, \nand commend their efforts to ensure that the reauthorization \nlegislation addresses the new challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  Over the last two decades, our Nation has made tremendous advances in \nresponding to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. We've all been encouraged by the \nrecent reports that the number of AIDS cases dropped last year for the \nfirst time in the 16 year history of the epidemic. The new combination \ntherapies largely responsible for this change in course have brought \nnew hope to families devastated by this disease. Although it was \nunimaginable just a few years ago, it now appears possible that we may \nsoon view AIDS, if not as curable, than at least as a manageable, \nchronic illness.\n  But, despite these advances in treatment options, the HIV/AIDS \nepidemic remains an enormous health emergency in the United States, \nwith the number of AIDS cases in the U.S. nearly doubling during the \nlast five years. According to a study sponsored by the U.S. Public \nHealth Service, approximately 250,000 to 300,000 people living with HIV \nor AIDS currently receive no medical treatment. Therefore, while we \nmust sustain our efforts in the areas of research and education, it is \nalso critical that we continue to provide resources to help states and \ndisproportionately affected communities develop the necessary \ninfrastructure to provide HIV/AIDS care. One of the most important \nchanges made to the Ryan White programs by this Reauthorization Act is \nthe emphasis on the need for early diagnosis of the disease. This new \nemphasis is reflected in the bill's provisions relating to early \nintervention activities, which will support early diagnosis and \nencourage linkages into care for populations at high risk for HIV.\n  In the decade since the enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act we've \nseen a transformation in the face of AIDS. Since women and children are \ndisproportionately represented among the newly infected, I am \nespecially pleased that this bill provides for the coordination of Ryan \nWhite and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) funds, and \nincludes a set-aside for infants, children, and women proportionate to \nthe percentage each group represents in the eligible funding area's \nAIDS affected population.\n  During the decade of the Ryan White CARE Act, we've also seen a shift \nin the challenges facing providers. Ten years ago, Ryan White providers \nfocused primarily on helping people while they died. Now, more and \nmore, providers are moving into the business of helping individuals \ninfected with HIV live long and full lives. But, while the discovery of \npowerful drug therapies has improved the quality and length of life for \nmany who are HIV positive, access to these drugs and to\n\n[[Page S1893]]\n\nother critical health services is still difficult for many, since AIDS \nis fast becoming a disease of poverty. The CARE Act's AIDS Drug \nAssistance Programs remain a lifeline for low-income individuals who \ncannot afford the costs of regular care and expensive AIDS drug \nregimens (now estimated at $15,000 annually per person).\n  The CARE Act has made a difference to the lives of countless \nindividuals and families affected by a devastating disease. While there \nis hope for the future, the changing demographics of the disease \npresent new challenges. The Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 \naddress these challenges while maintaining those aspects of the Act \nthat demonstrate proven results. I look forward to working with \nCongress as we move forward with the reauthorization, so that the \nthousands of people who rely on the services of Ryan White programs can \ncontinue to maintain their dignity and quality of life.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues on the HELP \ncommittee to cosponsor the Ryan White Care Act Amendments of 2000. I do \nthis with pride in what has been accomplished since I last cosponsored \nthe reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act in 1996. This \nlegislation since 1991 has enabled the development of community driven \nsystems of care for low-income, uninsured, and underinsured individuals \nand families affected by HIV disease.\n  Last year alone, the Ryan White CARE Act served an estimated half \nmillion people living with HIV and AIDS and affected the lives of \nmillions more. Nearly 6 in 10 of these people were poor. Last year, \nthis legislation enabled approximately 100,000 people living with HIV \nand AIDS to receive drug therapy. This is particularly important \nbecause half of the people served by the Act have incomes less than \n$10,000 a year--and the new drug treatments cost more than $12,000 \nannually.\n  According to the National Center for Health Statistics, between 1995 \nand 1997, there has been a 30 percent decline in HIV related \nhospitalizations, representing a savings of more than $1 billion. Since \n1991, according to Sandra Thurman, Director of the Office of National \nAIDS Policy, the CARE Act has helped to reduce AIDS mortality by 70 \npercent; to reduce mother-child transmission of HIV by 75 percent; and \nto enhance both the length and quality of life for people living with \nHIV/AIDS.\n  The epidemic is far from over. Each year there are 40,000 new HIV \ninfections in the U.S., and the death rate is no longer dropping so \nquickly. Although people with HIV disease are living much longer, the \nhighly touted multi-drug therapies are beginning to fall short of their \nprayed for effectiveness, and they do not work for everyone.\n  In addition, the nature of the epidemic is changing. HIV/AIDS is \ndevastating communities of color. AIDS is the leading cause of death \nfor African-Americans aged 25 to 44, and the second leading cause of \ndeath among Latino Americans of the same age group. HIV/AIDS also \ndisproportionately affects younger Americans. Half of the 40,000 new \ninfections each year occur in individuals under age 25. AIDS is killing \nthe youngest, potentially most productive members of our society. \nWithout a renewed commitment to research, prevention, and culturally \nsensitive treatment, the rates of infection and death will continue to \nravage communities of color.\n  It is a testament to the success of this legislation that there is \nsuch unanimity among the committee members and all of the diverse group \nof stakeholders that the Ryan White Care Act needs to be reauthorized. \nThe amendments included in this legislation are designed to increase \nthe accountability of the overall program; to meet the challenges of \nthe changing nature of the epidemic; to improve the quality of care; \nand to reach those affected by this plague who have not been reached \nbefore. We often say ``Leave no child behind'' and everyone agrees. We \nmust also say, ``let's leave no one afflicted by this dread disease \nuntreated''.\n  Provisions for quality management around clinical practice will bring \nbest practices to patients. Holding grantees accountable for quality \nmanagement and relevance of programs means the money appropriated will \nbe well spent. This is good medicine and responsible lawmaking.\n  Allowing for flexibility in how the AIDS Drug Assistance Program \n(ADAP) funds are spent will provide more low-income individuals with \nlife-prolonging medications. Focusing on early intervention services to \nsupport early diagnosis will get patients into treatment faster and \nhopefully also slow the spread of the disease. Requiring grantees to \ndevelop and maintain linkages with key points of entry to the medical \nsystem, such as mental health and substance abuse treatment centers, \nwill dramatically improve treatment, slow the spread of the disease, \nand reach previously unserved people. This is good prevention.\n  In 1990, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was primarily limited to large cities; \nhence the majority of funds were granted to cities. Over the last \ndecade, unfortunately, the epidemic has spread to more rural areas and \nto different populations. This bill requires that funds be spent in \naccordance with local demographics. Several provisions in this bill \nwill allow more funds to go to less populated areas and to provide \nspecial grants for infants, youth and women. This is good allocation of \nresources based on needs.\n  This bill also contains fiscally responsible caps on administrative \ncosts, and requires all grantees to coordinate with Medicaid and the \nState Children's Health Insurance Program. This makes good fiscal \nsense.\n  Mr. President, the Ryan White CARE Act has saved lives and serves \nhundreds of thousands of needy people yearly. The Ryan White CARE Act \nhas a proven record of success; let's build on that success. This \nfederal legislation needs to be reauthorized now, as proposed, to meet \nthe continuing needs and new challenges presented by the changing \nnature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  That is why I urge all Senators to join in cosponsoring and passing \nthe Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000, and I urge the members of \nthe Appropriations Committee to provide the funds to fully implement \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n  S. 2312. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a moratorium on the mandatory delay of payment of claims \nsubmitted under part B of the Medicare Program and to establish an \nadvanced informational infrastructure for the administration of Federal \nhealth benefits programs; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Care \nInfrastructure Investment Act.\n  Formerly arcane statistics of interest only to economists, \nproductivity and innovation are now veritable buzz-words in today's \nmuch-heralded new economy. Recently released productivity figures drew \nfront page coverage from both the Washington Post and New York Times. \nMost economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, \nattribute the surge in productivity to technological improvements. A \nhost of new and improved technologies, including faster computers and \nrapid expansion of the Internet, have led to improved efficiencies. The \nresult: workers are more productive, companies continue to grow and \nwealth is created.\n  Today nearly every industrial sector is involved in a race to apply \nnew technology and management techniques to gain greater efficiencies. \nYet one sector that accounts for 13 percent of America's gross domestic \nproduct--health care--still uses a patchwork-quilt of outdated \ntechnology for the most basic of its transactions.\n  While individual components within the health industry are adopting \nadvanced communication, manufacturing and other technologies but the \ninner core of health care--a series of transactions between doctor, \npatient and insurance provider--remains largely untouched by \ntechnological advances that would decrease the administrative load \naccompanying every transaction.\n  At a time when America's growing population is seeking a higher \nquality of care; when the greying of America means that Medicare \nenrollment will double by 2040; when new medical procedures are being \ndeveloped that hold great promise for the treatment and cure of \ndiseases like cancer and AIDS; when prescription drugs are becoming \navailable that extend and improve the quality of life--we have every \nmotivation for adopting into health care some\n\n[[Page S1894]]\n\nof the same technologies and ideas responsible for transforming other \nsectors of the American economy.\n  A robust and modern infrastructure for American health care will \nenable resources to be shifted to where they are most needed and allow \nfor the dramatic increases in productivity necessary to treat \nincreasing numbers of people at a higher level of care. In this sense, \nefficiency is not double-speak for additional restrictions placed on \nthe doctor-patient relationship or further regulations on insurance \ncoverage. Instead, greater efficiency means that doctors are free to \nspend more time treating patients, insurance companies reduce the cost \nof claims processing and consumers are empowered with a better \nunderstanding of treatment and costs.\n  America's interstate highway system is a prime example of a wise \ninfrastructure investment. As a result of a sustained Federal \ncommitment, Americans enjoy an unprecedented degree of mobility while \nthe economy benefits from the low cost and ease of transportation. A \nsimilar approach should be applied to health care whose roads for \nprocessing information resemble the rutted cobblestone paths of \nmedieval times.\n  The Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act is designed to spur \nFederal and private sector investment so that a nationwide network of \nsystems is built for health care. A network of systems is a descriptive \nterm that refers to the conglomeration of hardware, software and secure \ninformation networks designed to speed the flow of information and \ncapital between doctors, patients and insurance providers.\n  The primary goal of the Health Care Infrastructure Investment Act is \nto build an advanced infrastructure to efficiently process and handle \nthe vast number of straightforward transactions that now clog the \npipeline and drain scarce health care resources. Among the targeted \ntransactions are immediate, point-of-service verification of insurance \ncoverage, point-of-service checking for incomplete or erroneous claim \nsubmission and point-of-service resolution of clean claims for doctor \noffice visits including the delivery of an explanation of benefits and \npayment.\n  When designing a complex system, a first step is to define \nperformance standards that the system must meet. As configured, the \nlegislation mandates broadly defined performance standards for the \nfederally administered Medicare program that will be phased-in over a \nten year period. To ensure that improvements in the infrastructure \nsupporting federally-financed health care are matched in the managed \ncare sector, insurers participating in the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits program will also be required to meet these same performance \nstandards.\n\n  Also critical will be harnessing the expertise of selection of the \nFederal agency responsible for the design and implementation of an \nadvanced health care infrastructure. Some of my colleagues have \nsuggested that the Department of Defense or even NASA, two agencies \nwith decades of experience with complex, distributed networks, be \nassigned a leadership role. Accordingly, the legislation forms a Health \nCare Infrastructure Commission, chaired by the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, and composed of senior officials from NASA, the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency, the National Science Foundation, the \nOffice of Science and Technology Policy and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. Officials named to the Health Care Infrastructure Commission \nare required to be expert in advanced information technology.\n  The legislation also strives to create a strong partnership with the \nprivate sector, as many of the advances in communication technology are \ndriven by companies, both large and small.\n  Many pieces of a truly advanced health care infrastructure already \nexist. But like a modern-day Tower of Babel, communication is hindered \nby differences in language and function. Sorely needed is a combination \nof vision and commitment: vision to design a system that is secure, \nefficient and flexible and the commitment to dedicate necessary \nintellectual and financial resources for its design and implementation.\n  America has put a man on the moon, designed advanced stealth fighters \nand is now enjoying a sustained period of economic expansion stimulated \nby electronic devices, telephone and Internet. We must now develop and \nbuild a health care infrastructure that checks insurance status with \nthe swipe of a card, provides speedy payment to doctors for their \nexpertise in healing and allows a patient to leave the doctor's office \nwith a single statement of treatment and cost. I am confident that we \nwill succeed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Health Care Infrastructure \nInvestment Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Reid, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2315. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to the safety of genetically engineered foods, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                 GENETICALLY ENGINEERED FOOD SAFETY ACT\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am joined with Senator \nReid and Senator Boxer to introduce the Genetically Engineered Food \nSafety Act (S. 2315), a bill to require food safety testing for \ngenetically engineered foods.\n  The ability to alter an organism by specifically transferring genetic \ncodes between plants and animals is a new realm of science that we have \nonly begun investigating. This technology has the promise to deliver \nreal public goods: increased crop yields and products which combat \ndisease and improve nutrition. But the technology also has the \npotential to pose a number of threats to the nation's public health, \nenvironment, and economy, and U.S. consumers are understandably \nconcerned.\n  The Federal Government has a duty to ensure that genetically \nengineered foods (GEFs) are safe to eat. The Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) currently requires rigorous pre-market review for \npharmaceutical drugs, biological products, and medical devices \nintroduced in the U.S. market. For GEFs, however, FDA only asks the \nindustry to submit safety data voluntarily. Even if industry fully \ncomplies, our concern is that a conflict of interest exists when an \nindustry determines its own level of safety review for products it \nwants to promote.\n  S. 2315 would simply give FDA discretion to conduct its own safety \ntesting of new GEFs and requires that certain factors are examined. \nGEFs on the market today will remain on the market as long as FDA also \nreviews these products for health safety. Much like the current \npractice, funding for these tests will come primarily from industry. A \nfee system will be developed that is modeled after FDA's current \nprogram for reviewing pharmaceuticals and supplemented by Federal \nfunding.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2315\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Genetically Engineered Food \n     Safety Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Genetic engineering is an artificial gene transfer \n     process different from traditional breeding.\n       (2) Genetic engineering can be used to produce new versions \n     of virtually all plant and animal foods. Thus, within a short \n     time, the food supply could consist almost entirely of \n     genetically engineered products.\n       (3) This conversion from a food supply based on \n     traditionally bred organisms to one based on organisms \n     produced through genetic engineering could be one of the most \n     important changes in the food supply in this century.\n       (4) Genetically engineered foods present new issues of \n     safety that have not been adequately studied.\n       (5) United States consumers are increasing concerned that \n     food safety issues regarding genetically engineered foods are \n     not being adequately addressed.\n       (6) Congress has previously required that food additives be \n     analyzed for their safety prior to their placement on the \n     market.\n       (7) Adding new genes, and the substances that the genes \n     code for, into a food should be considered adding a food \n     additive, thus requiring an analysis of safety factors.\n       (8) The food additive process gives the Food and Drug \n     Administration discretion in\n\n[[Page S1895]]\n\n     applying the safety factors that are generally recognized as \n     appropriate to evaluate the safety of food and food \n     ingredients.\n\n     SEC. 3. FEDERAL DETERMINATION OF SAFETY OF GENETICALLY \n                   ENGINEERED FOOD; REGULATION AS FOOD ADDITIVE.\n\n       (a) Inclusion in Definition of Food Additive.--Section 201 \n     of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (s), by adding after subparagraph (6) the \n     following:\n     ``Such term includes the different genetic constructs, \n     proteins of or other substances produced by such constructs, \n     vectors, promoters, marker systems, and other appropriate \n     terms that are used or created as a result of the creation of \n     a genetically engineered food, other than a genetic \n     construct, protein or other substance, vector, promoter, \n     marker system, or other appropriate term for which an \n     application has been filed under section 505 or 512.''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(kk)(1) The term `genetically engineered food' means food \n     that contains or was produced with a genetically engineered \n     material.\n       ``(2) The term `genetically engineered material' means \n     material derived from any part of a genetically engineered \n     organism.\n       ``(3) The term `genetically engineered organism' means--\n       ``(A) an organism that has been altered at the molecular or \n     cellular level by means that are not possible under natural \n     conditions or processes (including recombinant DNA and RNA \n     techniques, cell fusion, microencapsulation, \n     macroencapsulation, gene deletion and doubling, introduction \n     of a foreign gene, and a process that changes the positions \n     of genes), other than a means consisting exclusively of \n     breeding, conjugation, fermentation, hybridization, in vitro \n     fertilization, or tissue culture; and\n       ``(B) an organism made through sexual or asexual \n     reproduction (or both) involving an organism described in \n     clause (A), if possessing any of the altered molecular or \n     cellular characteristics of the organism so described.\n       ``(4) The term `genetic food additive' means a genetic \n     construct, protein or other substance, vector, promoter, \n     marker system, or other appropriate term that is a food \n     additive.''.\n       (b) Petition to Establish Safety.--\n       (1) Data in petition.--Section 409(b)(2) of the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 348(b)(2)) is \n     amended--\n       (A) in subparagraph (D), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) in subparagraph (E), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(F) in the case of a genetic food additive, all data that \n     was collected or developed pursuant to the investigations, \n     including data that does not support the claim of safety for \n     use.''.\n       (2) Notices; public availability of information.--Section \n     409(b)(5) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 \n     U.S.C. 348(b)(5)) is amended--\n       (A) by striking ``(5)'' and inserting ``(5)(A)''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following subparagraphs:\n       ``(B) In the case of a genetic food additive, the \n     Secretary, promptly after providing the notice under \n     subparagraph (A), shall make available to the public all \n     reports and data described in subparagraphs (E) and (F) of \n     paragraph (2) that are contained in the petition involved, \n     and all other information in the petition to the extent that \n     the information is relevant to a determination of safety for \n     use of the additive.

A bill to authorize the lease of real and personal property \nunder the jurisdiction of the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                    commercial space partnership act\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nCommercial Space Partnership Act--legislation to encourage the \ncommercial development of space through the long term lease of real and \npersonal property held by the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration (NASA).\n  The Cox Commission Report identified the need to expand domestic \nlaunch capacity to meet the rapidly growing demand for commercial U.S. \nlaunch services. It is vital that we increase our domestic launch \ncapacity, reduce our dependence on foreign launch providers and help \neliminate the transfer of critical U.S. technology. The Cox Report \nspecifically recommended that congressional committees ``report \nlegislation to encourage and stimulate further the expansion of such \ncapacity of competition.''\n  Mr. President, the Commercial Space Partnership Act is the third \npiece of legislation I have introduced with the goal of increasing our \ndomestic launch capacity. The first was the Commercial Space Act, which \nbecame law in 1998. The Act helped break the federal government's \nmonopoly on space travel by establishing a licensing framework for the \nprivate sector's reusable launch vehicles. It also provided for the \nconversion of excess ballistic missiles into space transportation \nvehicles, thus helping to reduce our nation's cost of access to space.\n  Last year, along with a similar bipartisan coalition, I introduced \nthe Spaceport Investment Act. This bill would allow spaceports to issue \ntax-free bonds to attract private sector investment dollars for launch \ninfrastructure. It achieves the dual purpose of reducing pressure on \nthe federal budget while stimulating this crucial industry.\n  Mr. President, the third leg of this effort is the Commercial Space \nPartnership Act. Presently, NASA holds real and personal property that \nwould be invaluable in developing new domestic launch resources. At the \nsame time, however, NASA has no appropriations with which to cover the \ncosts that result from integrating new commercial launch facilities \ninto its existing infrastructure. The Commercial Space Partnership Act \nis designed to resolve this problem by allowing public and private \ninterests with development money to lease property from NASA for the \npurpose of expanding commercial launch capacity, and by permitting NASA \nto make use of some of the lease proceeds to cover the resulting costs \nit incurs.\n  The Commercial Space Partnership Act will empower NASA to assist the \ncommercial space industry in expanding the domestic launch capacity at \nno cost to the taxpayer. Under this new lease authority, NASA will \nreceive fair market value for its property and will further be \nempowered to apply the lease proceeds to cover the full costs resulting \nfrom the integration of the new commercial launch facilities into \nNASA's existing infrastructure. The Act further provides that any lease \nproceeds in excess of NASA's full costs shall be forwarded to the U.S. \nTreasury as miscellaneous receipts.\n  The fair market value approach also ensures that NASA property will \nbe leased to industry at a price which is comparable to other similar \ncommercial properties. NASA's property will thereby be leased in a fair \nand equitable manner that will give in an unfair advantage to those \nwith preexisting launch facilities in commercial locations.\n  Mr. President, the Commercial Space Partnership Act can only \nencourage and stimulate the domestic launch capacity of our country. I \nurge my colleagues in the Senate to join us in this important effort by \nco-sponsoring this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2317.

Mr. President, I offer legislation today that I \nintroduced previously but on which I was not able to get action during \na previous Congress, and that is legislation dealing with truth in \nsentencing.\n  Let me talk about some folks who have committed violent acts in this \ncountry. Recently, I read in a local paper here that a man named \nKenneth Lodowski is walking around this metropolitan area. He was \nsentenced to die in 1984. He murdered two people--one\n\n[[Page S1898]]\n\nan off-duty police officer, and the other a clerk in a convenience \nstore. He was sentenced to die in 1984 for two murders. The prosecuting \nattorney called the murders ``as vicious a crime as I have experienced \nin my 24 years as State's attorney.''\n  That is the crime.\n  After a series of appeals, this man, who was sentenced to death for \ntwo murders, had the sentence changed to life imprisonment without \nparole, then changed again, then changed again. Finally, the sentence \nwas 25 years in prison. After 16 years in prison, this person is \nwalking around the streets of this metropolitan area--free.\n  Why? Here is the reason. If you commit murder in this country, on \naverage, you are going to be sentenced to about 21 years in prison. On \naverage, a murderer will be sentenced to about 21 years in prison but \nwill serve, on average, only 10 years behind bars.\n  Most people will be startled to hear that. But let me say that again. \nThe average sentence served by a murderer in this country is about 10 \nyears. Why? Because people are let out early. Murderers go to prison, \nand they get ``good time,'' time off for good behavior: If you want to \nget out early, just be good in prison, and we will put you back on the \nstreets.\n  What happens when you are put back on the streets? You read the \nstories. I have spoken a number of times about Bettina Pruckmayr, a \nyoung woman who moved to town with great expectations, a young lawyer. \nShe was abducted in a carjacking, then taken to an ATM machine to \nextract cash, and then stabbed 30 times in a horrible death. This \nyoung, 26-year-old attorney who was just beginning her career in this \ntown, was stabbed 30 times by a man who had previously been convicted \nof rape, armed robbery, and murder. That man was on the streets \nlegally, let out by a criminal justice system that does not keep people \nwho we know are violent behind bars--let out early.\n  Or Jonathan Hall, about whom I have spoken in this Chamber, 13 years \nold, stabbed by a man who moved into his neighborhood, stabbed 60 times \nwith a screwdriver, thrown down an embankment into a pond. When they \nfound young Jonathan, after being stabbed 60 times, they found dirt and \ngrass between his fingers because even though he had been stabbed 60 \ntimes, this 13-year-old boy had tried to crawl out of that pond into \nwhich this fellow had thrown him. His clenched fists described his will \nto survive. But he did not; he died.\n  Jonathan's murderer was a career criminal. He had been convicted \npreviously of kidnapping and murder, but let out, and was living in the \nneighborhood and able to murder this 13-year-old boy--paroled just 1 \nyear before he took Jonathan's life.\n  And Julie Schultz from ND, a woman whom I know fairly well, the \nmother of three, who stopped at a highway rest area one day on a \npleasant, tranquil afternoon in North Dakota. She was attacked by a man \nwho tried to rape her, slashed her throat, cutting her vocal cords, and \nleft her for dead at a rest area on Highway 2 in northern North Dakota.\n\n  She survived the attack. In fact, I saw Julie just 2 weeks ago at the \nMinneapolis Airport. She survived the attack but has lasting scars and \ndifficulties as a result of that attack.\n  Who attacked Julie? The same kind of person who attacked others \naround this country--people who we knew were violent, were put behind \nbars, and let out early because the criminal justice system says: You \nonly have to spend 10 years, on average, in jail if you commit a murder \nin this country. We will sentence you to 21 years, but you only have to \nspend 10 years behind bars because we will let you out early if you are \ngood.\n  The fellow who slashed the throat of Julie Schultz served 7 years of \na life sentence in the State of Washington before being released, \nbefore being on Highway 2, on an afternoon in North Dakota, able to do \nwhat he did to Julie Schultz.\n  Sara Paulson, 8 years old, went out for a bike ride one day and never \ncame back. Her body was found under a pine tree less than 200 yards \nfrom her home. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled to death. \nHer murderer had been previously sentenced to prison for rape but was \nparoled after serving less than half of his sentence.\n  I am introducing legislation today, cosponsored by Senator Craig of \nIdaho, and another piece of legislation cosponsored by Senator Craig of \nIdaho and Senator Robb of Virginia. The point of it is very simple. I \nbelieve in the criminal justice system we ought to have different \nstandards for those who commit acts of violence. Everyone in this \ncountry who commits acts of violence ought to understand: You go to \nprison, and your address is going to be your jail cell until the end of \nyour sentence.\n  Do you know what the prison folks say to us? We need mechanisms by \nwhich we can persuade inmates to behave in prison. The mechanism is to \ndangle before them an early-out, time off for good behavior. So if we \nare able to reward them for behaving in prison, we are able to manage \nthem.\n  I say to them, what about managing them on the streets?\n  As I stated, there is a fellow who is walking the streets in this \nmetropolitan area now, after 16 years, who killed a policeman and \nkilled a clerk in a store, because he was released early.\n  What about the people on the streets who are going to meet that \nfellow? What about their safety? Who is managing that violent offender \nnow? Who managed the violent offender who viciously attacked Julie \nSchultz? Who managed the behavior of the man who violently attacked \nJonathan Hall? Who was watching the fellow who violently attacked \nBettina Pruckmayr?\n  The answer is, nobody.\n  Let us segregate and separate those who commit violent acts in this \ncountry from those who are nonviolent offenders. Let's incarcerate them \nall. I do not mind early release for nonviolent offenders. But for \nviolent offenders, we ought to have a society in which everyone \nunderstands: If you commit an act of violence, the prison cell is your \naddress to the end of your sentence. No good time off for good \nbehavior, no getting back to the streets early. You are going to be in \nprison to serve your term.\n  It is the only way, it seems to me, to protect innocent folks, such \nas Bettina Pruckmayr and Jonathan Hall and Julie Schultz, and so many \nothers who have been victimized by people we know were violent and \nshould have been in a prison cell but, instead, were on the streets \nearly because prison authorities let them out early with ``good time'' \ncredits and ``good time'' releases.\n  Let's stop it. My legislation will do that. It says to the States: \nYou must do it. If you do not, you are going to lose certain grants \nunder the Criminal Justice Act. Is that tough? Yes. But we must, it \nseems to me, take these steps to change this.\n  Again, let me conclude. My colleague from Illinois, I know, wants the \nfloor. But early releases--these are State prisons, incidentally--\nsexual assault: Sentenced for 10 years, on average, and you are out in \n5; robbery: Sentenced for 8 years, on average, and you are out in 4; \nmurder: Sentenced for 21 years, on average, and you are out in 10.\n  Everyone in this Chamber knows the horrors of crime, if not \npersonally with them and their family, then a neighbor, a friend, a \nrelative.\n\n  We know the current system isn't working. Too many violent offenders \nare sent back to America's streets. There is a way to stop that. Yes, I \nknow we have too many people in prison; But the way to be smart about \nit is to segregate those who are violent offenders from those who are \nnonviolent. This piece of legislation would start us doing that.\n  If any of us, God forbid, would lose a loved one or relative because \nof a vicious crime committed by someone who should have been in prison \nbut was let out early, we would spend the rest of our days trying to \npass legislation like this. We ought to do it.\n  Let me again say, the piece of legislation I began to talk about \ntoday, because of the escape in Chula Vista, CA, has resulted in a \nconvicted murderer walking around on the loose, a man named Prestridge. \nA violent murderer supposed to be spending the rest of his life behind \nbars is now loose because he was being transported by a private company \nand incompetence allowed these violent offenders, two of them, to \nescape--if we pass Jeanna's bill, named after the young 11-year-old who \nwas violently murdered by Kyle Bell, if we pass that piece of \nlegislation, I won't\n\n[[Page S1899]]\n\nbe here speaking about those circumstances again because they won't \nhappen again. I hope we will be able to address both of those pieces of \nlegislation in the remaining months of this Congress.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois. I wanted to introduce this \nlegislation and talk about it at some length today. I know he is here \nto talk as well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to comment on the remarks made by \nmy friend and colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan. I know his \nfeelings are heartfelt about this issue. I know he speaks from the \nheart when he tells us about these terrible tragedies to which many \nfamilies in America have been subjected. I hope he feels, as I do, that \nwhen it comes to violent crime, crimes involving guns and weapons, \nsexual assault, and the like, we should have no tolerance for that \nconduct. And when it comes to sentencing those responsible for the \ncrimes, we should do it in a manner to protect American citizens and \nfamilies across the board. I agree with him on that score. I think if \nwe are ever going to stop the plague of violent crime in this country, \nwe have to deal with enforcement of the law in a realistic way to \nprotect families.\n  Two weeks ago, I was stuck in an airport in our State capital, my \nhometown of Springfield, which tends to be part of the job description \nof being a Senator. The director of the Department of Corrections, Don \nSnyder, came up and said hello, and we had a chance to chat about \nincarceration in my home State of Illinois.\n  There are currently, if I remember the figures off the top of my \nhead, about 45,000 people incarcerated in the State prison system in \nIllinois. He told me a couple of things that were interesting. Each \nyear, we release from the Illinois prison system over 20,000 inmates. \nWe have this false notion that once a person is incarcerated, they are \nthere forever.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota has indicated, even for the most \nviolent criminals, that is not the case. About half of them come out \neach year. When you consider all the crimes for which people are \nincarcerated, they are back on the street. The question we obviously \nhave to ask is whether they will commit another crime. Unfortunately, \nabout half of them do. Those crimes, when repeated, test our resolve to \nnot only have a system that involves punishment but, where appropriate, \nrehabilitation.\n\n  This director of our Department of Corrections gave me an \nillustration. He said, if you consider a crime involving drugs to be \nthe possession of a thimbleful of cocaine, in 1987, the Illinois prison \nsystem had 400 people incarcerated for the possession of a thimbleful \nof cocaine. In the year 2000, we have 9,100 inmates incarcerated for \nthe possession of a thimbleful of cocaine. He said: Conceding the fact \nthat we want to end the drug scourge in our country and we want to be \neffective in doing it, the average drug criminal in Illinois is \nincarcerated for 7\\1/2\\ months. It is hard to believe that we are going \nto teach many lessons in 7\\1/2\\ months, but that is the average.\n  Here is the thing that is troubling. During the period of that \nincarceration in prison for the commission of the drug crime, there is \nvirtually nothing done to deal with the underlying addiction of the \ninmate. So when they are released in 7\\1/2\\ months or a little longer, \nthey are back on the streets, still addicted, likely to run back into \nthe same drug culture and be exposed to the same forces that put them \nin prison in the first place.\n  He asked me a valid question: Why aren't we doing something, while we \nhave these people who have been convicted and incarcerated, to try to \nget them off drugs?\n  I think that is a reasonable suggestion. I am not for letting violent \ncriminals out early, but for those who are in for drug crimes, we ought \nto have a policy nationwide that deals with some effort to stop their \naddiction, to end their addiction, to try, when they are released, to \ngive them a chance to lead a normal life that doesn't include another \nvictim at some later point. I hope we address that.\n  He also indicated to me that over 80 percent of the women in the \nIllinois prison system have children. And while they are in prison \nseparated from those children, oftentimes those children are in \nterrible circumstances. We saw in the State of Michigan a few weeks ago \nwhen a 6-year-old boy took a gun to school and killed a little \nclassmate. Then we find his father was in prison. His mother is \naddicted. He was stuck in a home where he slept on a couch. No one paid \nattention to him. Frankly, a gun was left on a table where he could get \nhis hands on it and take it to school.\n  That kind of neglect occurs too often in America. It is invited in a \nsituation where mothers are incarcerated and no one is there to care \nfor their kids.\n  This Director of Corrections said: Can we keep the link between the \nmother and child alive? We find that the women who are inmates really \nwant to turn their lives around when they think their family can stay \ntogether and has a future. We know that the kids would like to keep a \nrelationship with the mother who may turn her life around.\n  These are troubling questions. In a nation where we incarcerate more \nper capita than any other country in the world, we have to face these \nrealities. People are coming out of prison. When they come out, we have \nto wonder whether there has been a part of their experience in prison \nthat will lead to a better life for them and a safer America and less \nrecidivism.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with what the Senator has said. Nearly half of \nthe people incarcerated in this country are violent offenders, half are \nnot. It seems to me we ought to be smarter in the way we incarcerate \nthem, those half whom we know are violent. For those we know are \nviolent, we should not be incentivizing them to move to the streets \nearlier. We ought to try to find ways to keep them in prison to the end \nof their term. Those who are nonviolent they have to be punished, serve \ntheir time. But they are not violent and are not a threat to people.\n  Senator John Glenn used to talk about this in the Senate. He used to \nbring with him a model of a Quonset hut, apparently made in Ohio. He \nsaid: This is the kind of place I lived in during the Korean war. My \nwife and I lived in one of these huts various places around the world. \nIt was Marine housing, among other things. He said, for nonviolent \noffenders, we could put up some barbed wire and build Quonset huts. It \ndoesn't take a fortune to create incarceration compounds for nonviolent \noffenders. We don't have to put them in lockups that are massively \nsecure, lockups that cost a fortune. Use those lockups for violent \noffenders; then give yourself enough space to keep violent offenders \nbehind bars to the end of their term.\n  That is the point I was making. I don't disagree with anything the \nSenator from Illinois said about the crime factor inside the prisons \nand about the circumstances these days of mandatory sentencing and \ncrimes that have been nonviolent that have crowded the prison system. I \nthank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota. I appreciate the \nimportance of the issue of incarceration and corrections.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2319. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan under which \neligible Medicare beneficiaries may elect to receive coverage under the \nRx Option for outpatient prescription drugs and a combined deductible; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         voluntary medicare prescription drug plan act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \na bill entitled the ``Voluntary Medicare Prescription Drug Plan Act of \n2000.'' This bill allows seniors to enroll in a new program under \nMedicare which will provide for prescription drug coverage. This is an \nissue about which, as you know, many seniors are very concerned.\n  Seniors who join this plan would have a combined Part A and Part B \ndeductible of $675, which would include all hospital, medical, and drug \nexpenses. After the deductible is met, seniors would receive 50-percent \ncoverage of their prescription drug costs\n\n[[Page S1900]]\n\nup to $5,000. If a senior has $2,000 in expenses for prescription \ndrugs, $1,000 of that would be paid for under this plan.\n  I have spoken to senior groups and health care providers, both in \nWashington as well as in my State over the past several weeks, about \nthis proposal. The response has been very enthusiastic. Seniors want a \nprescription drug benefit. Doctors and nurses understand the importance \nof providing coverage for seniors because of the expense of \nprescription drugs in this country. It would be a victory for seniors \nand for health care in this country if we could provide this coverage \nto them.\n  I have had discussions with many of my colleagues in the Senate who \nare working on this very issue. We have all heard from our constituents \nabout the importance of prescription drugs. Senators Breaux and Frist \nhave included prescription drugs in their overall Medicare reform \npackage. Senators Kennedy, Snowe, Wyden, Grams, and Jeffords all have \nproposed various plans that provide some level of prescription drug \ncoverage in Medicare, and many others are working on separate proposals \nof their own.\n  In a recent press conference, President Clinton and Senator Daschle \noutlined their goals for prescription drug coverage. Leaving the \npolitics aside, the fact that elected leaders from both parties are \nlooking at this issue of prescription drug coverage is good news for \nthe senior citizens of America. I have talked with several of my \nRepublican colleagues, and it is clear to me there is overwhelming \nsupport for allowing seniors to have this choice. The only question \namong us all is how we can responsibly structure such a program.\n  I have heard from seniors in my State about what they are looking for \nin a prescription drug plan.\n  First, they are concerned about the solvency of the Medicare program. \nThey want a program that does not add some huge financial burden to the \ntrust fund which will be passed on to their grandchildren. They do not \nwant to increase the national debt, either. Yes, seniors are concerned \nabout the national debt. Ask them the next time you speak to a seniors \ngroup.\n  The President's proposal, as it is written, blows a $168 billion hole \nin the trust fund, threatening its solvency.\n  Second, seniors do not want new premiums. My plan requires no premium \nhike for seniors. Zero. The President's plan requires a $51 annual \npremium increase.\n  I will repeat that. Seniors do not want to blow a hole in the \nnational debt. They do not want to inflate the debt. Yet the \nPresident's proposal adds $168 billion that is going to come out of \nthat trust fund, threatening its solvency. And seniors do not want more \npremiums. My plan has no increase in premiums; the President's plan, \n$51--just to start--annual premium increase.\n\n  The guiding principles of this plan, which may come as a shock to \nsome of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, are the same \nprinciples as those of the President and the distinguished minority \nleader for any prescription drug plan. I want to repeat the six \nprinciples the minority leader has introduced on behalf of the \nPresident. I am going to add three more to those six and make it even \nbetter. I do not know why we cannot have almost unanimous support for \nthis piece of legislation.\n  First of all, under the plan the Senate Democrats are committed to \npassing this year, there are six basic principles. I agree with them \nall.\n  No. 1, it is voluntary. Medicare beneficiaries who now have \ndependable, affordable prescription drug coverage should have the \noption of keeping that coverage.\n  No. 2, it is accessible to all beneficiaries. I agree with that. A \nhallmark of Medicare is that all beneficiaries, even those in rural or \nunderserved communities, have access to dependable health care. It \nshould be accessible to everybody. I agree with the second principle.\n  No. 3, it is designed to provide meaningful protection and bargaining \npower for seniors. A Medicare drug benefit should assist seniors with \nthe high cost of drugs and protect them against excessive, out-of-\npocket expenses. I agree with that.\n  No. 4, it should be affordable to all beneficiaries, and it should be \naffordable to the Medicare program itself.\n  Medicare should contribute enough toward the prescription drug \npremium to make it affordable and attractive for all beneficiaries and \nto ensure the viability of the benefit. I agree with that.\n  No. 5, administered using private-sector entities and competitive \npurchasing techniques. In other words, the program is administered by \nusing private sector entities and competitive purchasing techniques. \nThe management of the prescription drug benefit should mirror the \npractices employed by private insurers. Discounts should be achieved \nthrough competition, not through price controls or regulation.\n  I agree with that.\n  We are five for five.\n  No. 6, consistent with broader Medicare reform, the addition of a \nMedicare drug benefit should be consistent with an overall plan to \nstrengthen and modernize Medicare. Medicare will face the same \ndemographic strain as Social Security when the baby boomer generation \nretires. So it is consistent with broader Medicare reform.\n  I agree with that.\n  There are six principles I can support.\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join me \nnow with three more principles I would add:\n  No. 1, that the plan be revenue neutral to preserve and protect the \nfinancial integrity of the Medicare trust fund. In other words, it does \nnot cost the Government any more money.\n  No. 2, that the plan does not raise Medicare premiums. Their plan, \n$51 annually to seniors; my plan, zero. So no increase in premiums.\n  And No. 3, that full benefits be provided, not in 2009, as the \nadministration plan proposes, but in 2001, 8 years sooner.\n  So my three principles--revenue neutral, do not raise the premiums, \nprovide the benefits in 2001--those three principles enhance and \nstrengthen the other six principles put forth by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  My plan accomplishes all three of the principles I have outlined.\n  Let me briefly explain how it works.\n  A senior already enrolled in Medicare Parts A and B--already enrolled \nin Part A, hospital, and Part B, doctor--will have the option of \nchoosing my new voluntary prescription drug plan. It is their option. \nNobody is mandated; they choose. It will cover 50 percent of their \nprescription drug costs toward the first $5,000 worth of prescription \ndrugs. If they buy $4,000 worth of drugs--$2,000 for prescription \ndrugs; $2,000 is covered.\n  How do we do this? How do we make it work? Medicare Part A--under the \nold system, the current system--has a $776 deductible. Medicare Part B \nhas a $100 deductible. In other words, if you go to the doctor, the \nfirst $100 you pay for; if you go to the hospital, the first $776 you \npay for; the rest, Medicare pays. That is a total of $876 you will have \nto pay.\n  My new plan would create one new deductible, combining those two \ndeductibles of Part A and Part B into one deductible of $675, which \nwould apply to all hospital costs, all doctor visits, and prescription \ndrugs--50 cents on the dollar up to $5,000. And the prescription drug \ncosts apply to the deductible, so every dollar you pay for a \nprescription moves you forward to meet the deductible.\n  Once the $675 deductible is met by the Medicare recipient, Medicare \nthen will pay 50 percent of the cost toward the first $5,000 worth of \ndrugs the senior purchases.\n  However, the senior could not purchase a Medigap plan that would pay \nfor the $675 deductible. This must be paid for by the senior. But if \nyou have a Medigap plan now as a senior, you will not need it.\n  As a result, seniors would save about $550 under Medigap plans if \nthey traded their current Medigap plan for my new prescription drug \nplan. Again, it is their option. It is voluntary. Seniors could even \nuse their $550 in savings to pay the $675 deductible.\n  If you are a senior out there, and you have Part A, Part B, and you \nare paying $675 toward the deductible, and you have Medigap insurance \nof $550, you now can put the $550 toward the $675 to meet your \ndeductible. So you are going to have $550 in savings. You can put that \ntoward the $675, and you are already two-thirds of the way there.\n  But how do you get the cost savings?\n  As my colleagues are aware, according to the National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare, the\n\n[[Page S1901]]\n\nFederal Government pays about $1,400 more per senior if the senior owns \na Medigap plan that covers their Part A and Part B deductible. This, \ngenerally, is because of our overutilization of hospital and doctor \nvisits by the senior. The savings result because Medicare will not have \nto pay this $1,400 per person per year out of the trust fund.\n  As I mentioned, all hospital, physician, and prescription drug costs \nwould count toward this $675 deductible. Once it was met, the senior \nwould receive regular, above-the-deductible Medicare coverage, just as \nyou get now. Or if you worked out the numbers and decided against my \nplan, then you would not have to select it; it is your choice.\n  I believe the vast majority of seniors will benefit from this plan. \nIn fact, every senior with a Medigap plan will definitely benefit. Any \nsenior with a prescription drug expenditure of more than $15 a month \nwill benefit. Today, the Medicare Part A and Part B deductible totals \n$876, which most seniors cover by an average $1,611 Medigap insurance \npremium.\n  These estimates, as well as the estimate that the bill is budget \nneutral, come from Mr. Guy King, formerly chief actuary for the Health \nCare Financing Administration under President Clinton. I received a \nletter just this morning from Mr. King, from which I would like to \nquote:\n\n       Dear Senator Smith: This is in response to your letter of \n     March 9, 2000, asking for my analysis of legislation you \n     intend to introduce in the Senate. The proposed legislation \n     establishes a voluntary prescription drug benefit, the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, under the Medicare program.\n       Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the current Part \n     A and Part B deductibles would be replaced by a single \n     deductible of $675 which would also be applicable to the new \n     prescription drug benefit. The Medicare program would pay \n     fifty percent of the cost of prescription drugs, up to a \n     maximum of $2,500 after satisfaction of the deductible.\n\n  He goes on to describe it.\n  Quoting further:\n\n       As you requested, I performed an analysis of the proposed \n     legislation. This analysis is based on Medicare and \n     prescription drug data I obtained from the Health Care \n     Financing Administration. My analysis indicates that the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as described above, would be \n     cost-neutral to the Medicare program if it were made \n     available on a voluntary basis to all beneficiaries except \n     those also covered by Medicaid.\n\n  It is signed by Guy King.\n  Let me just conclude speaking on this bill by saying, the benefits in \nthis plan are delivered by private companies and regional entities, \nsuch as pharmaceutical benefit managers. These entities would negotiate \nwith large drug companies and provide the drugs to Medicare seniors.\n  Finally, according to the actuaries who reviewed the legislation, \nthere will be no adverse selection. Both the healthy and the sick will \nhave an incentive to choose this plan. Everybody is in.\n  There are many different methods of providing prescription drug \ncoverage for seniors, but I urge my colleagues--I plead with my \ncolleagues--to look to the revenue-neutral methods that fund this \nbenefit by the elimination of waste in the present system. I urge my \ncolleagues to resist the temptation to raise Medicare premiums on the \npeople who can least afford it.\n  I have vivid memories of seniors rocking Mr. Rostenkowski's car a few \nyears ago when he decided to raise Medicare premiums. Let's look at it \nmore specifically. The House's fiscal year 2001 budget--this is \nimportant--sets $40 billion aside for prescription drugs. In the \nSenate, we are expected to do a budget that is going to set aside $20 \nbillion.\n\n  We don't need either under my plan. We don't need any more money. We \ndon't need $20 billion. We don't need $40 billion. We don't need $2 \nbillion. We don't need any billions. Let's use the money for debt \nreduction or tax credits for the uninsured rather than providing for \nprescription drugs, when we could use my revenue-neutral prescription \nplan instead.\n  I must say, in all candor, some of the deflections I have had put in \nmy way on this issue by some in this body are disturbing. I will not \nget into details. I want people to listen and look at this plan. It is \na good plan. I would like to have the opportunity to be able to talk \nabout it in more detail with some of my colleagues, because it makes no \nsense to take $40 billion max, anywhere from $20 billion to $40 \nbillion, and put it into this prescription plan when we don't need to. \nLet's put it on the debt or let's buy something else with it that is \nworthwhile. We don't need it.\n  A neutral plan that does not raise premiums, that takes effect in \n2001 is a good plan. It is a good idea. We need to implement it.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. King be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              King Associates,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, March 28, 2000.\n     Hon. Bob Smith,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: This is in response to your letter of \n     March 9, 2000 asking for my analysis of legislation you \n     intend to introduce in the Senate. The proposed legislation \n     establishes a voluntary prescription drug benefit, the \n     Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, under the Medicare program.\n       Under the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, the current Part \n     A and Part B deductibles would be replaced by a single \n     deductible of $675 which would also be applicable to the new \n     prescription drug benefit. The Medicare program would pay \n     fifty percent of the cost of prescription drugs, up to a \n     maximum of $2,500 after satisfaction of the deductible. A \n     beneficiary who chooses the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan \n     would not be allowed to purchase a Medicare supplement policy \n     that fills in the $675 deductible, so special Medicare \n     supplement policies for those who choose the option would be \n     allowed.\n       The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan would be available, on \n     a voluntary basis, to any Medicare beneficiary not also \n     covered by Medicaid. The possibility of anti-selection is an \n     important consideration for a plan that is available to all \n     Medicare beneficiaries as an option. I believe that the \n     design features of the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as \n     outlined in your legislation, minimize the impact of anti-\n     selection.\n       As you requested, I performed an analysis of the proposed \n     legislation. This analysis is based on Medicare and \n     prescription drug data that I obtained from the Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA). My analysis indicates that \n     the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, as described above, \n     would be cost-neutral to the Medicare program if it were made \n     available on a voluntary basis to all beneficiaries except \n     those also covered by Medicaid.\n       If you should have any questions regarding my analysis, \n     please don't hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Roland E. (Guy) King,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Frist, Mrs. \n        Lincoln, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2320. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nrefundable tax credit for health insurance costs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         health coverage, access, relief, and equity (CARE) Act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues in introducing the Health Coverage, Access, Relief and \nEquity Act or Health CARE Act. This legislation will provide low-income \nAmericans with a refundable tax credit for the purchase of health \ninsurance coverage. This effort marks the first major bipartisan, \nbicameral, market-based initiative on behalf of the uninsured since \n1994.\n  I believe the issue of access to health coverage for the uninsured \nmust be a top national priority. The uninsured often go without needed \nhealth care or face unaffordable medical bills. Insurance coverage \nguarantees providers reimbursement for their services, and it helps \ncontain costs by encouraging more appropriate use of the health care \nsystem.\n  Unfortunately, the main source of coverage--employer-based \ninsurance--is simply not available to a significant number of working \nAmericans and their families. High health care cost increases have \ncaused more people to become uninsured.\n  New Census Bureau data indicate that there are now 44 million \nAmericans with no health coverage, an increase of one million from last \nyear. This number is unacceptable for a prosperous nation with a strong \neconomy.\n  A new poll indicates that our bill is consistent with the main health \ncare concern of average voters. When asked what they think is the most \nimportant problem about our health care system that the government \nshould address, the top choice--selected by 29 percent of those \nsampled--was universal coverage.\n\n[[Page S1902]]\n\n  I believe the legislation we're introducing today can provide the \nnecessary foundation for achieving the goal of expanded health \ncoverage. The Health CARE tax credit is targeted to those who are most \nin need of help, due to their lack of income, access to subsidized \nemployment-based coverage, and ineligibility for public programs.\n  About one-half of the full-time working poor were uninsured last \nyear. Many of these individuals work for small firms. In my own state \nof Vermont, only 27 percent of workers in firms employing fewer than 10 \npeople are offered health insurance.\n  These uninsured working Americans have one thing in common: they are \nlow wage workers--with nearly 70 percent making less than two times the \nminimum wage. Without additional resources, health insurance coverage \nis either beyond their reach or only purchased by giving up other basic \nnecessities of life.\n  The Health CARE Act will provide a refundable tax credit to help low \nand moderate-income individuals and families purchase health insurance.\n  The legislation will provide a refundable tax credit of $1,000 for \nthe purchase of individual coverage to those with adjusted gross \nincomes of up to $35,000 and it will provide a $2,000 credit for the \npurchase of family coverage for those with AGI of up to $55,000.\n  The initial estimates show that this proposal will help almost 9 \nmillion Americans. It will provide health coverage for 3.2 million \nAmericans who are presently uninsured and give needed financial relief \nto another 5.5 million low-income Americans who are using their scarce \ndollars to buy individual health insurance policies.\n  Realizing that insurance coverage is not the single answer for our \nnation's health access problems, we are also developing additional \ncomponents to the Health CARE Act which will focus on improving access \nto health care services and safety net providers, such as community \nhealth centers and rural health clinics.\n  We must do whatever we can to ensure that the Safety Net already in \nplace becomes stronger and more reliable. Just last week, the \nSubcommittee on Public Health held a hearing on three of our nation's \nsafety provider programs--the Consolidated Health Centers program, the \nNational Health Service Corps, and the Community Access program.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Frist on shoring up the Safety \nNet, and together we plan to introduce an additional component to the \nCARE Act on Safety Net providers that will become part of the larger \nhealth CARE Package.\n  Our goal for this legislation is to maximize health coverage, tax \nequity, and cost efficiency, and we believe it should be included as an \nimportant element in any tax package that Congress enacts this year.\n  The Health CARE Act will increase the number of Americans who have \nhealth insurance coverage by filling key gaps in the current system and \nsupporting a system of health care financial and delivery that \ncomplements the employment-based system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will take a look at this. I hope \nthey will join me in making sure we do what must be done to make sure \nthe people who need it the most gets it.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2320\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues \ntoday and be part of the first bipartisan, bicameral group to address \nthe growing number of individuals and families without health insurance \ncoverage in this country.\n  The problem has been made clear. America's uninsured population \ncontinues to rise. Despite the fact that we are enjoying strong \neconomic times, the nation's uninsured population has grown to 44 \nmillion over the past decade. We know that the majority of the \nuninsured--32 of the 44 million--earn an annual income of under \n$50,000. We also know that the rising cost of health insurance is the \nsingle most important reason for not purchasing health care coverage. \nMany Americans simply cannot afford to buy health insurance.\n  The solutions are becoming clearer as well. A one-size fits all \napproach to expand health coverage and access to health care does not \nmeet the various needs of the uninsured population. As a result, our \nproposal will take a multi-pronged approach that meets the needs of the \nuninsured and looks at innovative approaches to provide individuals \ngreater ability to purchase coverage. We will seek to build upon the \ncurrent employer-based system which continues to be the main source of \nhealth care coverage for most Americans.\n  Our goal is to fill the coverage gaps that exist in the current \nsystem. A central piece of our proposal is to provide a refundable tax \ncredit for low-income Americans who are not offered a contribution for \ntheir insurance through their employer and do not receive coverage \nthrough federal programs such as Medicaid or Medicare. The legislation \nintroduced today will help hard working Americans who cannot afford to \nbuy coverage on their own. For example, the part-time worker who is not \noffered employer-sponsored health insurance will be offered a $1,000 \ntax credit to purchase health care coverage. The single mother with two \nchildren earning less than $50,000 a year, will be offered a $2,000 \ncredit to purchase health insurance.\n  The legislation introduced today is the first of many steps that we \nwill take to address the varying needs of the uninsured. Over the next \nseveral months, we will also explore a variety of options to assist \nindividuals and their families in purchasing health coverage either \nthrough existing employer plans, the individual market, or through \npurchasing pools; seek ways to improve enrollment in existing federal \nprograms, where approximately 5 million adults and 8 million children \nare eligible for Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance \nProgram (S-CHIP) yet are not enrolled; and finally, as the Chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Public Health, I will work closely with my \ncolleagues to explore ways to expand and sustain our safety net system \nto improve access to critical primary care services to the uninsured \nand medically underserved populations.\n  I especially wish to thank the American Academy of Family Physicians, \nthe American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, \nthe Americans for Tax Reform, the BlueCross BlueShield Association, the \nChamber of Commerce of the USA, the Citizens Against Government Waste, \nthe Galen Institute, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Health \nInsurance Association of America, the Hispanic Business Roundtable, the \nNational Center for Policy Analysis, the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, and the Small Business Survival Committee for \ntheir support of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 2321. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ntax credit for development costs of telecommunications facilities in \nrural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n           rural telecommunications modernization act of 2000\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nRural Telecommunications Modernization Act. This Act would create a tax \ncredit for companies that invest in providing broadband \ntelecommunications services available in rural areas. The convergence \nof computing and communications has changed the way America interacts \nand does business. Individuals, businesses, schools, libraries, \nhospitals, and many others, reap the benefits of networked \ncommunications more and more each year. However, where in the past \naccess to low bandwidth telephone facilities met our communications \nneeds, today many people and organizations need the ability to transmit \nand receive large amounts of data quickly--as part of electronic \ncommerce, distance learning, telemedicine, and even for mere access to \nmany web sites.\n  In some areas of the country companies are building networks that \nmeet this broadband need as fast as they can. Technology companies are \nfighting to roll out broadband facilities as quickly as they can in \nurban and suburban areas. They are tearing up streets to instal fiber \noptics, converting cable TV facilities to broadband telecom \napplications, developing incredible new DSL technologies that convert \nregular copper telephone wires into broadband powerhouses.\n  Other areas are not as fortunate. In rural areas access to broadband \ncommunications is harder to come by. In fact, there are only a few \nbroadband providers outside big cities and suburban areas nationwide. \nThis is because in many cases rural areas are more expensive to serve. \nTerrain is difficult. Populations are widely dispersed. Importantly, \nmany of our broadband technologies cannot serve people who live more \nthan eighteen thousand feet from a phone company's central office--\nwhich is the case for most rural Americans.\n  The implications for the country if we allow this broadband disparity \nto continue are alarming. Organizations in traditional robust \ncommunications and computing regions, often located in prosperous urban \nand suburban communities, will be able to reap the rewards of the so-\ncalled ``New Economy.'' Organizations in other areas, often in rural \nareas, including many areas in my State of West Virginia, will suffer \nthe consequences of being unable to take advantage of the astounding \npower of broadband networked computing.\n  Just as companies that employ technological advances are decimating \ntheir less technologically savvy competitors, businesses in \ninfrastructure-rich areas may soon decimate competitors in \ninfrastructure-poor areas. This is just as true for rural students and \nworkers trying to gain new skills who are competing against their non-\nrural peers in the New Economy. The result of this digital divide could \nbe disastrous for rural Americans: job loss, tax revenue loss, brain \ndrain, and business failure concentrated in rural areas.\n  Denying rural Americans a chance to participate in the New Economy is \nalso bad for the national economy. Businesses will be forced to locate \ntheir operations and hire their employees in urban locations that have \nadequate broadband infrastructure, rather than in rural locations that \nare otherwise more efficient due to the location of\n\n[[Page S1905]]\n\ntheir customers or suppliers, a stable or better workforce, and cheaper \nproduction environments. Additionally, without adequate infrastructure, \nthe businesses and individuals in these communications infrastructure \npoor areas are less likely to be integrated into the national \nelectronic marketplace. Their absence would put a damper on the growth \nof the digital economy for everyone--not just for those in rural areas.\n  Therefore, we must do everything we can to ensure that broadband \ncommunications are available to all areas of the country--rural as well \nas urban. The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act addresses this \nproblem.\n  The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act would give companies \nthe incentive to build broadband facilities in rural areas by using a \nvery focused tax credit. It would offer any company that invests in \nbroadband facilities in rural areas a tax credit over the next three \nyears. This tax credit will help fight the growing disparity in \ntechnology I just described.\n  The credit is only available for certain investments. First, \ninvestments must be for ``broadband local access facilities.'' Second, \ninvestments must support ``high-speed broadband telecommunications \nservices.'' And third, investments must serve only ``rural counties.''\n  The Rural Telecommunications Modernization Act is part of the \nsolution to the critically important digital divide problem. Rural \nAmericans deserve the chance to participate in the New Economy. Without \naccess to broadband services they will not have this chance. I hope \nthat the Members of this body will support this important bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 37, United States Code, to establish a \nspecial subsistence allowance for certain members of the uniformed \nservices who are eligible to receive food stamp assistance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n           remove servicemembers from food stamps act of 2000\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nremove thousands of our servicemembers from the food stamp rolls.\n  The Remove Servicemembers from Food Stamps Act of 2000 provides \njunior enlisted servicemembers who are eligible for food stamps in the \npay grade E-1 through E-5 an additional allowance of $180 a month. A \nnot-yet-published Department of Defense report estimates that 6,300 \nservicemembers receive food stamps, while the General Accounting Office \nand Congressional Research Service place this number at around 13,500. \nRegardless of this disparity, the fact that just one servicemember is \non food stamps is a national disgrace. This bill will end the ``food \nstamp Army'' once and for all.\n  This legislative proposal is estimated to cost only $6 million \nannually. Interestingly, the Congressional Budget Office determined \nthat it would represent an overall savings to taxpayers since it would \nsave the Department of Agriculture more than $6 million by removing \nservicemembers from the food stamp rolls for good.\n  Last year, this legislation was included in S. 4, the Soldiers', \nSailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Relief Act of 1999. Although the \nSenate approved this legislation as part of S. 4, I was greatly \ndisappointed when food stamp relief was rejected by conferees from the \nHouse of Representatives despite the strong support of Admiral Jay \nJohnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and General Jim Jones, the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps. With over 13,500 military families on \nfood stamps, and possibly thousands more eligible for the program, I \ncannot understand the Congress' refusal to rectify this problem in last \nyear's National Defense Authorization Act.\n  It is outrageous that Admirals and Generals received a 17 percent pay\n\n[[Page S1906]]\n\nraise last year while our enlisted families continue to line up for \nfree food and furniture. Last year, we poured hundreds of millions of \ndollars into programs the military did not request, like the C-130J. We \nspent $375 million as a down payment on a $1.5 billion amphibious \nassault ship that the Navy did not want and that the Secretary of \nDefense said diverts dollars from higher priority programs. We added \n$5.1 million to build a gymnasium at the Naval Post-Graduate School and \n$15 million to build a Reserve Center in Oregon--neither was in the \nPresident's budget request or identified by the Joint Chiefs as a \npriority item.\n  It is difficult to reconcile how Congress could waste $7.4 billion on \npork barrel spending in the defense budget, while we ignore the basic \nneeds of our military families. I have been open to all suggestions for \nsolutions to this problem and am willing to work toward a bipartisan \nplan that would satisfy the administration, Congress, and the \nDepartment of Defense. Sadly, politics, not military necessity, remains \nthe rule, not the exception.\n  It is unconscionable that the men and women who are willing to \nsacrifice their lives for their country have to rely on food stamps to \nmake ends meet, and it is an abrogation of our responsibilities as \nSenators to let this reality go on without some sort of legislative \nremedy.\n  I will not stand by and watch as our military is permitted to erode \nto the breaking point due to the President's lack of foresight and the \nCongress' lack of compassion. These military men and women on food \nstamps--our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines--are the very same \nAmericans that the President and Congress have sent into harm's way in \nrecent years in Somalia, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo, and East Timor. They \ndeserve our continuing respect, our unwavering support, and a living \nwage.\n  The legislation is supported by every enlisted association or \norganization that specifically supports enlisted servicemember issues \nin the Military Coalition and in the National Military/Veterans \nAlliance. Associations include the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Non-\nCommissioned Officers Association, the American Legion, the Retired \nEnlisted Association, the National Association for Uniformed Services, \nthe Fleet Reserve Association, the Air Force Sergeants Association, the \nU.S. Coast Guard Chief Petty Officers Association, the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of \nthe U.S., and the Naval Enlisted Reserve Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and to act swiftly. It is a \nstep in the right direction toward improving the lives of our \nservicemembers and their families who are struggling to feed their \nfamilies. There is no reason not to pass this bill immediately. We have \nwaited too long already. We must end the days of a ``food stamp Army'' \nonce and for all. Our military personnel and their families deserve \nbetter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2322\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \nclarify the treatment of stock options under the act; read the first \ntime.\n\n\n                    worker economic opportunity act\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nWorker Economic Opportunity Act. Senator Dodd and I have worked closely \nwith Senators Jeffords and Enzi, as well as Senators Abraham, Bennett, \nLieberman, and others to develop this important bill. This important \nbipartisan bill will ensure that American workers can receive lucrative \nstock options from their employers--once considered the exclusive perk \nof corporate executives.\n  In recent years our country's innovative new workplaces and creative \nemployers have offered new financial opportunities--such as stock \noptions--for hourly employees. The Department of Labor recently issued \nan interpretation of the decades-old labor and employment laws that \ncould keep normal employees from reaping the benefits of these perks. \nWhen I realized this, I decided we needed to fix this problem--it would \nhave been a travesty for us to let old laws steal this chance for the \naverage employee to share in his or her company's economic growth.\n  This law simply says: it makes no difference if you work in the \ncorporate boardroom or on the factory floor--everyone should be able to \nshare in the success of the company.\n\n[[Page S1907]]\n\n  Our bill changes the outdated laws so they don't stand in the way of \neconomic opportunity for American workers. In sum, the bill would amend \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act to ensure that employer-provided stock \noption programs are allowed just like employee bonuses already are. \nAlso, this legislation includes a broad ``safe harbor'' that specifies \nthat employers have no liability because of any stock options or \nsimilar programs that they have given to employees in the past. The \nbill I am introducing today is what I hope will be the first of many \ncommon-sense efforts to drag old labor and employment laws into the new \nmillennium.\n  I am very pleased that Secretary Herman and the Department of Labor \nhave worked with us on this legislation. The Worker Economic \nOpportunity Act is also supported by a broad range of high tech and \nbusiness groups who have joined together to form the Coalition to \nPromote Employee Stock Ownership. This group has been of great \nassistance throughout the development of this bill.\n  An identical companion bill to the Worker Economic Opportunity Act is \nbeing introduced in the House today. As a result, I am optimistic that \nwe can work to ensure that this much-needed fix to the FLSA becomes law \nin the near future.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague Senator \nMcConnell in introducing the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. This \ncommon sense bill will allow companies to continue to offer stock \noption programs to their hourly employees without violating the Fair \nLabor Standards Act with respect to overtime. We are joined today by \nSenators Jeffords, Enzi, Robb, Murray, Lieberman, Bingaman, Reed, \nKerry, Abraham, Bennett, Gorton, Hutchinson, and Warner.\n  Sotck options, stock appreciation rights, and employee stock purchase \nprograms are tools used by some companies to give employees a stake in \na company's success and to retain employees in a tight labor market. \nThese programs are used by well-known companies such as Xerox, GTE, and \nPepsiCo. as well as hi-tech startups. In more and more situations, non-\nexempt and exempt employees are able to participate. For example, it \nhas been GTE's practice to give stock options to all 110,000 employees, \nof which 53,000 are non-exempt. Xerox corporation employs approximately \n52,000 employees in the United States, and offers stock options to all \nemployees who have completed one year of service. It employs 93,000 \npeople worldwide and 57 percent of them are non-exempt.\n  Clearly, the trend in our economy is that more and more companies are \nproviding this type of compensation package. Not surprisingly, then, my \noffice was beset with letters and phone calls recently concerning a \n1999 Department of Labor advisory letter regarding one company's \nproposed stock option plan for non-exempt employees. The opinion \nletter, which does not carry the weight of law, states that the value \nof the options would have to be included in the non-exempt workers base \nwages when calculating their overtime rates. The Fair Labor Standards \nAct (FLSA) exempts some employee benefits from overtime calculations \nincluding health insurance, thrift savings plans, and discretionary \nbonuses. When providing its opinion letter, the Department of Labor \ndetermined that stock option plans did not fall within any of the \ncurrent exemptions. While the Department did point out that their \nopinion was based on only one company's proposed plan, it became clear \nthat legislation was needed to exempt these programs, lest businesses \nbegin to exclude non-exempt employees from receiving stock options. I \ncommend the Department for calling for a legislative fix and working \nclosely with us to craft this bipartisan bill.\n  Our legislation would amend the Fair Labor Standards Act to exclude \nfrom the regular rate stock options, stock appreciation rights or \nbonafide stock purchase programs that meet certain vesting, disclosure, \nand determination requirements. A safe harbor would be in effect to \nprotect companies that have already established stock option programs \nfor non-exempt workers, including those programs provided under a \ncollective bargaining agreement or requiring shareholder approval.\n  Just several years ago, stock option plans were only offered \ncorporate CEO's and other very senior executives. Today's flexible \nbenefit packages give that same opportunity throughout the corporate \nstructure. I don't believe that non-exempt employees who form the \nbackbone of most businesses should be excluded from this opportunity. \nThey deserve the right to share in the prosperity of the new economy.\n  Clearly, stock option programs have risk attached, so we wanted to be \nvery clear that our legislation requires that the terms and conditions \nof any program are communicated to employees and that the exercise of \nany grants is voluntary. Employees need to make informed choices.\n  I am pleased that this has been a bipartisan effort, and also one \nwhere we have worked very constructively with the Administration. I \nhope we can move it quickly for the benefit of all working families.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here today \nto introduce the Worker Economic Opportunity Act. Having worked with \ncolleagues from both sides of the aisle and the Department of Labor, I \nam extremely proud of this collaborative effort which has resulted in \nthis legislation which will encourage employers to provide equity \nownership opportunities to their hourly employees.\n  In the last 10 years, we have witnessed tremendous change in the \nstructure of our Nation's economy in large part due to the birth of the \ninternet and e-commerce. The vitality of our economy is a tribute to \nthe creative and entrepreneurial genius of thousands of individual \nbusiness people and the indispensable contribution of the American \nworkforce.\n  As legislators during this exciting time, we are challenged to \nmaintain an environment that will foster the continued growth of our \neconomy. We must work to ensure that our laws are in sync with the \nchanging environment. However, many of the laws and policies governing \nour workplace have fallen out of sync with the information age and \nthere has been particular resistance to changing our labor laws. As \nChairman of the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over workplace \nissues, I believe it is time to examine and modify these laws to meet \nthe rapidly involving needs of the American workforce.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), for example, was enacted in the \nlate 1930s, to establish basic standards for wages and overtime pay. \nWhile the principles behind the FLSA have not changed, its rigid \nprovisions make it difficult for employers to accommodate the needs of \ntoday's workforce. Most recently, we discovered that the FLSA actually \noperates to deter employers from offering stock option programs to \nhourly employees.\n  While stock option programs are most prevalent in the high tech \nindustry, increasingly employers across the whole spectrum of American \nindustry have begun to offer stock option programs to all of their \nemployees. Broad-based stock option programs prove valuable to both \nemployers and employees. For employers, stock options programs have \nbecome a key tool for employee recruitment, motivation and retention. \nEmployees seek out companies offering these programs because they \nenable workers to become owners and reap the benefits of their \ncompany's growth.\n  When I heard about the FLSA's application to stock options, I became \nvery concerned about its impact on our workforce. I was pleased to \ndiscover that Senators' McConnell, Dodd, and Enzi shared similar \nconcerns and that the Department of Labor also recognized that we had a \nproblem on our hands that would require a legislative solution. \nTogether we have crafted the Worker Economic Opportunity Act which will \ncreate a new exemption under the Fair Labor Standards Act for stock \noptions, stock appreciation rights and employee stock purchase \nplans.\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be part of the \nintroduction today of the Worker Economic Opportunity Act, a bipartisan \nbill to exclude stock options and stock option profits from overtime \npay calculations under the Fair Labor Standards Act. I want to \nacknowledge and commend my colleagues Senators McConnell, Dodd, and \nJeffords for their hard work on this issue.\n\n[[Page S1908]]\n\n  Earlier this year, the Department of Labor advised employers that \nthey would be required to include stock options in overtime \ncalculations. The advisory also prescribed an extremely complicated \nmethod of calculation that created a virtual administrative \nimpossibility for employers. We received overwhelmingly negative \nfeedback that this advisory would result in the end of stock options \nfor hourly employees and create a lose-lose situation for employees and \nemployers alike. The legislation we introduce today ensures that \ncompanies can continue to give stock options to hourly employees so \nthat these employees--and not just executives--can share in this \ncountry's economic boom. And employers will be able to continue to use \nstock options as a valuable tool for recruiting and retaining employees \nin a competitive labor market.\n  This bipartisan legislation also represents an important first step \ntowards reforming outdated labor statutes that no longer meet the needs \nof today's workforce. Most of the major labor statutes were drafted \nbetween 30 and 60 years ago and many of their heavy-handed restrictions \nare now more harmful than helpful to employees in the modern workplace. \nWe need to think about how to encourage--not discourage--employers' \ndevelopment of new and creative measures to benefit employees, such as \nstock option programs and telecommuting arrangements. Our legislation \nwill provide just such encouragement and ensure that stock option \nprograms do not fall prey to obsolete legislative prohibitions.\n  Finally, I am particularly proud that both Democrats and the \nDepartment of Labor have worked with us on this bill. As chairman of \nthe Employment, Safety and Training Subcommittee, I firmly believe that \ncooperation between lawmakers and agencies is the best way to develop \npractical solutions that benefit both employees and businesses. I \nsincerely hope that we can continue to work together on similar \nmeasures in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 2324. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto require ballistics testing of all firearms manufactured and all \nfirearms in custody of Federal agencies, and to add ballistics testing \nto existing firearms enforcement strategies; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n           BALLISTICS, LAW ASSISTANCE, SAFETY TECHNOLOGY ACT\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague \nSenator Feinstein to introduce ``BLAST''--the Ballistics, Law \nAssistance, and Safety Technology Act. The bill offers two \ncomplementary approaches to combating gun violence. The first supplies \nour Nation's police with a new technology to assist them in solving \ncrimes. The second expands ``Project Exile'' to 50 cities, giving \nfederal prosecutors the resources they need to put more felons behind \nbars. Let me explain how our measure is crucial to the fight against \ncrime.\n  Reducing crime requires a multifaceted approach. While we need \ntougher controls to keep guns away from kids in this country--including \nmandating that child safety locks be sold with every new handgun--all \nof us also recognize that the battle against senseless violence \nincludes prosecuting all criminals to the letter of the law.\n  Mr. President, just as every person has a unique fingerprint, each \ngun leaves unique markings on discharged bullets and shell casings. \nOver the past decade, new technology has allowed for the comparison of \nthose ``gun prints'' with bullets found at crime scenes. By keeping a \ncomputerized image of each new gun's fingerprint, police can compare \nthe microscopic differences in markings left by each gun until they \nfind a match. Once a match is found, law enforcement can begin tracing \nthat weapon from its original sale to the person who used it to commit \nthe crime.\n  Indeed, ballistics technology, though nascent, is already helping to \nsolve crimes. For example, in June 1997, an Oakland man was shot and \nkilled as he used a public telephone on a street corner. Without any \nleads or physical evidence other than a bullet casing left by the \ndischarged weapon, police were initially stymied in their search for \nthe killer.\n  A year passed without any progress in the investigation until police \nmade an ordinary arrest of two men for the unlawful possession of a \nfirearm. When the officers test-fired the confiscated gun and ran the \nimage through their ballistics database, they found a match within \nseconds. The seized gun was the same gun that fired the deadly bullet \nin the unsolved case the previous year. Police confronted the two men \nwith this evidence, and quickly received a confession to the murder.\n  In another case, police only found 9 millimeter cartridge casings at \nthe scene of a brutal homicide in Milwaukee--there were no other clues. \nBut four months later, when a teenage male was arrested on an unrelated \ncharge, he was found to be in possession of that firearm. Ballistics \nlinked the two cases. Prosecutors successfully prosecuted three adult \nsuspects for the homicide and convicted the teen in juvenile court.\n  Mr. President, since the early 1990's, more than 250 crime labs and \nlaw enforcement agencies in over 40 states have been operating \nindependent ballistics systems maintained by either the ATF or the FBI. \nTogether, ATF's Integrated Ballistics Identification System (``IBIS'') \nand the FBI's DRUGFIRE system have been responsible for linking 5,700 \nguns to two or more crimes where corroborating evidence was otherwise \nlacking.\n  My own state of Wisconsin employs the DRUGFIRE system for ballistics \ntesting and has already used it to solve crime and provide \nauthenticating evidence for ongoing criminal investigations. In 1998, \nthe Milwaukee police department alone analyzed almost 600 firearms and \nover 3200 fired cartridges. Even though Wisconsin's DRUGFIRE has a \nlimited number of guns in its database, ballistics testing helped solve \nseven homicides, 100 cases where the reckless use of a weapon \nendangered public safety, and numerous other gun crimes.\n  These statistics are heartening, but they also illustrate the \nuntapped potential of ballistics as a law enforcement weapon. Simply \nput, ballistics testing is only as good as the number of images in the \ndatabase. Unfortunately, not enough guns are test fired before they are \nsold, not enough communities have access to ballistics databases, and \nnot enough information is shared between law enforcement agencies of \ndifferent jurisdictions. Ironically, even the two primary agencies \nresponsible for investigating gun crimes--the ATF and the FBI--have \ncreated ballistics systems that cannot read each others data. Sadly, \nthis significant law enforcement tool is severely underutilized.\n  But that need not be the case. Title I of BLAST makes ballistics a \ncenterpiece of our anti-crime strategy by requiring federal firearms \nmanufacturers and importers to test fire all new firearms and make the \nballistics images available to federal law enforcement; requiring \nfederal law enforcement officials to test fire all firearms in their \ncustody; and providing financial support to communities that include \nballistics testing as a critical part of their comprehensive anti-crime \nstrategy, building on the model used by ATF in the Youth Crime Gun \nInterdiction Initiative.\n\n  The burden on manufacturers is minimal--we authorize funds to \nunderwrite the cost of testing--and the assistance to law enforcement \nis considerable. And don't take my word for it, ask the gun \nmanufacturers and the police. Listen to what Paul Januzzo, the vice-\npresident of the gun manufacturer Glock, said last month in reference \nto ballistics testing, ``our mantra has been that the issue is crime \ncontrol, not gun control . . . it would be two-faced of us not to want \nthis.'' In their agreement with HUD, Smith & Wesson agreed to perform \nballistics testing on all new handguns. And Ben Wilson, the chief of \nthe firearms section at ATF, emphasized the importance of ballistics \ntesting as a investigative device, ``This [ballistics] allows you \nliterally to find a needle in a haystack.''\n  Our approach is bipartisan as well. The Republican governor of New \nYork, George Pataki, prominently included a similar ballistics measure \nin his recently introduced anti-crime package. He clearly recognizes, \nas we do, that the more we can empower law enforcement, the more \neffectively we can put hard core criminals where they belong--behind \nbars.\n\n[[Page S1909]]\n\n  To be sure, we are sensitive to the notion that law abiding hunters \nand sportsmen need to be protected from any misuse of the ballistics \ndatabase by government. The BLAST bill explicitly prohibits ballistics \ninformation from being used for any purpose unless it is necessary for \nthe investigation of a gun crime.\n  Of course, to successfully combat crime, you also need to enhance the \narsenal of law enforcement. That is why Title II of BLAST expands the \nsuccessful ``Project Exile'' program. By authorizing $20 million over \nfour years, BLAST would fund gun prosecutors in 50 cities--prosecutors, \nwho will work in conjunction with state and local authorities, devoted \nsolely to the aggressive enforcement of the federal gun laws.\n  This program already enjoys widespread support--from the industry to \nleaders on both sides of the political aisle to the National Rifle \nAssociation, which has pointed to Project Exile as a model for fighting \ngun crime. Our hope is to expand the success of EXILE across the \ncountry and provide the resources to every city interested in \naggressively pursuing gun crimes. Felons will know that if they commit \na crime with a gun they will pay the price.\n  Mr. President, the BLAST bill will enhance a revolutionary new \ntechnology that helps solve crime while, at the same time, recognizing \nthat new crime solving instruments are worthless unless prosecutors are \nin place to punish violent offenders to the fullest extent of the law. \nBLAST is a worthwhile piece of crime control legislation. I hope that \nthe Senate will quickly move to pass it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2324\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to increase public safety by assisting law enforcement \n     in solving more gun-related crimes and offering prosecutors \n     evidence to link felons to gun crimes through ballistics \n     technology;\n       (2) to provide for ballistics testing of all new firearms \n     for sale to assist in the identification of firearms used in \n     crimes;\n       (3) to require ballistics testing of all firearms in \n     custody of Federal agencies to assist in the identification \n     of firearms used in crimes;\n       (4) to add ballistics testing to existing firearms \n     enforcement programs; and\n       (5) to provide for targeted enforcement of Federal firearms \n     laws.\n\n                             TITLE I--BLAST\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure \nequity in the provision of transportation by limousine services; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       contracted automobile regulatory relief act of 2000 (carr)\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will eliminate burdensome and unnecessary regulations which are \ndevastating the nation's limousine companies, 80 percent of which are \nsmall business owners.\n  Federal Highway Administration regulations grant limo operators the \nright to cross states lines ``without interference''. Yet local \nentities across the U.S. have taken it upon themselves to establish \nunnecessary bureaucracies for the purpose of placing excessive and \narbitrary requirements upon limo operators that enter their \njurisdictions.\n  Current law already requires limo operators to be certified and \nregistered at three different stages: the U.S. Department of \nTransportation; the state in which they principally operate; and the \nlocality in which the business is located. Therefore, company owners, \ndrivers, and vehicles must already comply with a myriad of safety and \nfinancial requirements that includes carrying at least $1.5 million in \nliability insurance. Public safety is clearly being upheld.\n  Yet, after satisfying these three stages of compliance, limo \noperators often find that there is a fourth, fifth, sixth and sometimes \neven more bureaucratic hoops to jump through to simply conduct their \nbusiness. This happens when a locality sets up a Local Taxi and \nLimousine Commission to place certification requirements not only on \ncompanies located in their jurisdiction, but on any other limo that \nenters their locality to pick up or drop off a customer. These \nadditional licenses can cost up to several hundred dollars annually--\nand that's just to enter one jurisdiction.\n  The purpose of the CARR ACT is simple. It says that if a limo \noperator has satisfied federal, state, and local requirements, no other \nstate or entity has the authority to establish additional requirements. \nThe bill will not lower the quality of service which the public expects \nfrom the limousine industry nor does it compromise public safety. In \nfact, my legislation does not affect any safety regulations or \nfinancial requirements on interstate operations required by the U.S. \nDOT nor does it affect the power of states to regulate safety or \nfinancial responsibility as they may do under current law.\n  The same protections were granted to the trucking industry in 1995, \nto the armor car industry in 1997, and to the chartered bus industry \nunder TEA-21. The time for these protections to be extended to the \nlimousine industry is long overdue. No small business should be faced \nwith the unfair and excessive bureaucracy faced by the nation's 9,000 \nlimousine operators.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this time that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2325\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to strengthen \nand clarify prohibitions on electronic eavesdropping, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           the wireless eavesdropping protection act of 2000\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Wireless \nEavesdropping Protection Act. This bill will enhance the privacy rights \nof wireless subscribers by strengthening the laws that prohibit \neavesdropping wireless communications. Since the early days of wireless \ncommunications, Congress has paid particular attention to the privacy \nrights of wireless subscribers. Unfortunately, despite our best \nefforts, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to find loopholes in \nthe law. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Senator from \nMontana, Senator Burns.\n  Using the loopholes, electronic eavesdroppers have been able to \ndevelop a ``gray market'' for modified and modifiable wireless \nscanners. Some of these individuals even advertise in magazines and on \nInternet websites that their products can be altered easily to pick up \ncellular communications. The information and equipment necessary to \nmake these modifications are also widely advertised, sometimes with \nblatant offers to unblock the cellular frequencies after the equipment \nis purchased.\n  The Wireless Eavesdropping Protection Act attacks these problems on \nseveral fronts. First, it would expand the definition of the \nfrequencies that may not be scanned to include digital Personal \nCommunications Service (PCS) frequencies as well as cellular ones. The \nlegislation recognizes that some frequencies are shared between \ncommercial mobile services and public safety users, and that the use of \nscanners to monitor public safety communications may assist in saving \nlives. As to those frequencies, the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC) may adopt such regulations as may be necessary to enhance \nprivacy.\n  Second, the bill would clarify that it is just as illegal to modify \nscanners for the purpose of eavesdropping as it is to manufacture or \nimport them for this purpose, and it would direct the FCC to modify its \nrules to reflect this change. The bill also would amend current law to \nprohibit either the intentional interception or the intentional \ndivulgence of wireless communications, so that either action on its own \nwould be prohibited. Finally, the bill would require the FCC to \ninvestigate and take action on wireless privacy violations, regardless \nof any other investigative or enforcement action by any other federal \nagency. This provision would help ensure that these newly strengthened \nprivacy protections are full enforced in the future.\n  The millions of Americans who use wireless communications deserve to \nhave their privacy protected. They should be able to enjoy the same \nprivacy protection as landline phone users. The Wireless Eavesdropping \nProtection Act will help provide those protections, and I urge my \ncolleagues to join Senator Burns and me in supporting this legislation. \nI ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2326\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission on Ocean Policy, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                           oceans act of 2000\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nOceans Act of 2000, a bill calling for a plan of action for the twenty-\nfirst century to explore, protect, and use our oceans and coasts \nthrough the coming millennium. I am pleased to be joined in this \nendeavor by my colleagues, Senators Stevens, Snowe, Kerry, Breaux, \nInouye, Cleland, Wyden, Akaka, Boxer, Murray, Lautenberg, Feinstein, \nLieberman, Moynihan, Reed, Sarbanes, and Schumer.\n  This is not the first time I have come before you to advocate \nlegislation to ensure our national ocean policy is coordinated, \neffective, and sustainable for future generations. In 1997, I \nintroduced an Oceans Act to create both an independent ocean commission \nand a federal interagency ocean council. While the Senate passed this \nbill unanimously, it was not enacted before the end of the 105th \nCongress. We continued the work we started in 1997 by introducing the \nSenate-passed bill as S. 959, cosponsored by 23 Senators from both \nsides of the aisle, in May of last year. I now introduce the Oceans Act \nof 2000, a new bill that reflects the lessons learned among state and \nfederal policymakers, ocean-related industries, and public interest \ngroups who worked together during and after the 1998 Year of the Ocean.\n  What we heard loud and clear from these groups was the need for a \nbalanced, high-level national commission to determine whether the \nUnited States is managing its oceans and coasts wisely, and how we can \nimprove or refocus our efforts. Thus, the Oceans Act of 2000 focuses \nexclusively on the appointment of an independent national Ocean \nCommission to recommend ways to ensure our nation's ocean policy is \ncoordinated, effective, and sustainable for future generations. I \nbelieve this is both improved and streamlined legislation that will \nenjoy wide support from industry, conservation groups, and States. \nAlready we have received letters of support from a cross-section of \nthese interests, all of whom believe we cannot wait any longer to enact \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is critical that we enact the Oceans Act of 2000 \nthis year. In 1966 Congress enacted legislation to establish a \nCommission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources (known as the \nStratton Commission for its chairman, Julius Stratton) that was to \nrecommend a comprehensive national program to explore the oceans, \ndevelop marine and coastal resources, and conserve the sea. The \nStratton Commission's report and recommendations have shaped U.S. ocean \npolicy for three decades. We have long needed to take a hard look at \nthis legacy, and a national Ocean Commission could comprehensively \nevaluate concerns that cannot be viewed effectively through current \nfederal processes or through privately-commissioned studies. For \nexample, an Ocean Commission could evaluate charges that the most \ncritical coastal management issues, such as fishery conservation and \ndata needs, are not given appropriate priority and funding. It could \nconsider whether ocean management regimes that have developed over the \nlast 30 years under a variety of agencies are duplicative and \nuncoordinated, resulting in costly or time-consuming requirements that \nmay provide little incremental environmental benefit. Finally, it could \naddress the argument that we lack a plan to evalute and plan for future \nresource needs or to derive benefits from discoveries made possible by \nadvances in ocean technology.\n\n  It would be difficult to coherently address all these concerns \nwithout the high-level comprehensive review provided by this \nlegislation. The Oceans Act of 2000 would establish a 16-member \nCommission, similar to the Stratton Commission, to examine ocean and \ncoastal activities and report within 18 months on recommendations for a \nnational policy. The Commission members would be selected from \nindividuals nominated by majority and minority representatives in both \nhouses of Congress. Eligible individuals include those representing \nstate and local governments, ocean-related industries and public \ninterest groups. I have included new provisions stating that the \nmembership should be balanced geographically to the extent consistent \nwith maintaining the highest level of expertise.\n  The Oceans Act of 2000 specifies that the Commission should examine \nconcerns that range from priority and planning issues to regulatory \nreform. The Commission is specifically charged with evaluating the \ncumulative regulatory effect of the myriad of ocean and coastal \nmanagement regimes, and crafting recommendations for resolving \ninconsistencies. To ensure we can meet future technical and funding \nchallenges and set our national priorities appropriately, the \nCommission is directed to review the known and anticipated supply of, \nand demand for, ocean and coastal resources, as well as review \nopportunities for development or investment in new products, \ntechnologies, or markets related to ocean and coastal activities. \nBecause I believe the Commission should focus on large-scale ocean and \ncoastal policy questions, the bill includes a provision clarifying that \nthe Commission recommendations shall not be specific to the lands and \nwaters within a single state.\n  Finally, once the Commission issues its recommendations, the \nPresident must report to Congress on how he will respond to or \nimplement Commission recommendations. We want to be sure that this body \nis fully informed of, and participates in, how the Nation proceeds once \nthe Commission has completed its work. Finally, the effective date of \nthe Act is at December 31, 2000 in order to enable the current \nAdministration to complete its interagency ocean initiative before the \nend of the current term, and allow the incoming Administration time to \nevaluate the Commission nominees and make appointments.\n  This version does not include a federal interagency Ocean Council--I \nbelieve that this function is now being filled by the sub-cabinet level \nOcean Policy Task Force process announced by the Administration last \nyear. Establishing a second interagency council now would be \nduplicative, and it is my firm belief that the independent Commission \nwill adequately assess whether the existing interagency process is \nappropriate or sufficient to address its recommendations. However, it \nis my hope that interagency coordination on oceans policy will remain \nan important priority for the next Administration. And I look forward \nto the day that ocean policy issues are given the highest priority \nwithin the federal government by a Cabinet-level entity, without the \ninfighting or discord that has impeded our progress on these issues.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is both appropriate and long overdue. \nBy the end of this decade about 60% of Americans will live along our \ncoasts, which account for less than 10% of our land area. I am amazed \nthat in this era, when we've invested billions of dollars in exploring \nother planets, we know so little about the ocean and coastal systems \nupon which we and other living\n\n[[Page S1913]]\n\nthings depend. Large storms events like Hurricanes Floyd and Hugo, \ndriven by ocean-circulation patterns, pose the ultimate risk to human \nhealth and safety. El Nino-related climate events have led to increased \nincidence of malaria in areas of Colombia and Venezuela. Harmful algal \nblooms have been linked to deaths of sea lions in California and \nmanatees in Florida, and we are still searching to understand their \neffects on humans. Mr. President, the oceans are integral to our lives \nbut we are not putting a priority on finding ways to learn more about \nthem, and what they may hold for our future. The oceans are home to 80% \nof all life forms on Earth, but only 1% of our biotechnology R budget \nwill focus on marine life forms. Of the 4 manned submersibles in the \nworld capable of descending to half of the ocean's maximum depth, not a \nsingle one of them is operated by the United States!\n  The Stratton Commission stated in 1969: ``How fully and wisely the \nUnited States uses the sea in the decades ahead will affect profoundly \nits security, its economy, its ability to meet increasing demands for \nfood and raw materials, its positions and influence in the World \ncommunity, and the quality of the environment in which its people \nlive.'' those words are as true today as they were 30 years ago.\n  Mr. President, it is time to look towards the next 30 years. This \nbill offers us the vision and understanding needed to establish sound \nocean and coastal policies for the 21st century, and I think the \ncosponsors of the legislation for joining with me in recognizing its \nsignificance. We look forward to working together in the bipartisan \nspirit of the Stratton Commission to enact legislation this year that \nensures the development of an integrated national ocean and coastal \npolicy well into the next millennium.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url":

Mr. President, I want to turn to the subject of the \ncloture vote that will be held tomorrow. It is scheduled on legislation \nto suspend 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax and then the possibility, \nat some point in time, of the suspension of the full 18.4-cent gasoline \ntax; the 4.3, of course, is included in that.\n  Now this proposal was laid before the Senate last night by our \ndistinguished majority leader, Senator Lott. Senator Lott is a man of \nprinciple. I rise with\n\n[[Page S1916]]\n\nconvictions of my own, and I hope he will accord me the same respect I \naccord him. He firmly believes it is in the best interest of the \ncountry--the measure he is bringing before the Senate. I believe it is \nmy duty to oppose that, and my remarks give the reasons for doing so.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several documents be printed at the end \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in this effort, I am joined by the \nfollowing organizations as of this moment. Within 3 hours this \nafternoon, they have come to my door in great numbers. I urge Senators \nto listen to the following. Opposing this measure--the substance of the \nbill--are the National Governors' Association. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer was a former Governor and was active in that \nassociation. Also, there is the National Association of Counties, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, National Conference of State Legislators, \nAssociation of Road and Transportation Builders, Associated General \nContractors, Building and Trades Unions, American Highway Users \nFederation, American Automobile Association. That list is growing by \nthe hour.\n  I believe the Senate, at this critical hour, should be directing its \nattention in a constructive way to point out the failures of the \nClinton energy policy. My colleague, the junior Senator from Alaska, \nhas been a tireless worker on this effort. I believe either today or \ntomorrow he will be addressing the Senate on this subject. We should be \nfocusing our attention on how, legislatively or otherwise, we can help \nthe American free enterprise system to increase production. That \nproduction has been stymied time and time again by a number of \nGovernment regulations, such that today America is dependent for 56 \npercent of its petroleum energy requirements--56 percent coming across \nthe ocean to our shores.\n  We are now finding ourselves in this great Chamber, watching intently \nas to what OPEC might do. A series of nations, the majority of whom--\ncertainly not Iraq and Iran and others--we have come to their defense \ntime and time again when their security and freedom have been \nchallenged. Yet, we are sitting here by the hour waiting to see how \nthey might provide this great Nation, the United States of America, an \nenergy program of imports combined with our own domestic production to \nmeet our needs, to continue to strengthen this economy, which is not \nonly helping to support our Nation and provide jobs but, indeed, is \nrelied on by economies throughout the world--all because of this \npetroleum.\n  We recognize that the price of gasoline has reached such a high level \nthat it is beginning to have tragic consequences on families, on small \nbusinesses, on truckers, and many others across this Nation. Indeed, \nthis Chamber is directing its attention to see what relief we may \ngive. But I say most respectfully to those who are proposing the \nsuspension of this 4.3-cent tax and the possibility of another trigger \nrequiring that to be subsumed into an 18.4-cent tax, that this is not a \nwise course, and I oppose it. I oppose it because the proposal is \nfraught with uncertainty. We could be taking an action which would not \ntranslate into relief for the drivers of our vehicles--those who are \nsuffering from this. There is simply too much uncertainty in this \ncourse of action. That is one reason.\n\n  The second reason is it would impact negatively on legislation which \nI and others fought for years for and finally got through in the form \nof new highway legislation. I will address that in detail.\n  I ask the question: Is the repeal or temporary suspension of the 4.3 \ncents going into the pockets of the drivers? Can we give them that \nassurance? That is the question each of you will have to answer if you \nwant to support this proposal.\n  What is the guarantee that this tax cut will be passed on to the \nconsumer? What is the likelihood it might go in part or in whole into \nthe pockets of the middlemen, the wholesalers, or the distributors? How \nare the drivers protected from the oil refiners and wholesale marketers \nfrom taking off some of this for their own reasons? Will the free \nmarketplace enable them to charge the same price at the gas pump even \nafter you achieve the rescinding of the 4.3? What is there to indicate \nthat the price at the gas pump is going to come down? I can find no \ncertainty.\n  I come back time and time again to one word-- ``uncertainty.''\n  If it is not to be passed on to the consumers and the high prices \ncontinue, I think Americans will feel betrayed. They are now mad. But \nthey could be more irate if they are betrayed by what could be \nperceived as a course of action. That could happen. But there is no \ncertainty 4.3 cents will be put into their pockets.\n  What is the impact of this hollow tax cut? Is it a significant impact \non our budget surplus? Very clearly--the way the bill is drawn, it will \nhave an impact on that surplus.\n  The Department of Transportation estimates that the 9-month \nsuspension--as proposed in this legislation--of this portion of the gas \ntax will result in approximately $6 billion less in the highway trust \nfund. That money, which by law in the context of the highway \nlegislation that I worked on, will be taken out. That means there will \nbe a shortfall in the next 9 months of $6 billion.\n  While the legislation as proposed by the distinguished leader has a \nunique provision--I am not sure I have ever seen one like it before--\ncalling on the surplus--that is the general revenues and surplus--to \nreplenish the lost revenue in the highway trust fund, there is some \ntrigger mechanism in there.\n  But I ask my colleagues in the Senate: Do we want to be spending a \nsignificant part of our limited surplus for this uncertainty? If we \nknew it was going into the consumers' pockets, that might be one thing. \nBut I have yet to find anybody who says it is absolutely going to \nbypass all the middle people and go into their pockets.\n  Do we want to take that surplus, which we are examining for debt \nreduction, tax reduction and other purposes, do we want to suddenly \nhave $6 billion with just the 4.3 cents go into this type of scheme? If \nwe go to 18.4, then it could well consume all the surplus. The question \nyou have to ask yourself is, Is that what we want to do with the \nsurplus? This Senator says no.\n  In other words, I would rather see such tax legislation as can pass \nthis Chamber, tax legislation which guarantees by law taxpayer relief--\nthe marriage penalty tax for one and the estate tax relief for another, \nspecifically--relief that they need. And there is certainty. That is \nthe word; there is certainty. But there is uncertainty with this \nproposal.\n  Do we want to use the on-budget surplus to give a tax cut to gasoline \nwholesalers? I don't. Do we want to use our surplus for other, more \ncertain tax legislation? Yes, I do. That is the position I take this \nevening.\n\n  Let's go back and look at the highway legislation that we worked on \nseveral years ago, called TEA-21. For over a decade in the Senate, I, \nalong with many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle with strong \nbipartisan support--the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, our \nformer colleague, Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, myself, and \nothers--teamed up in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I was \nthen chairman of the transportation subcommittee, a position now \noccupied by our distinguished Presiding Officer, who I believe is in \nconcert with me on the views with regard to this tax. Over a period of \nyears we worked towards several goals, and we achieved them.\n  We wanted to first restore faith with the drivers who were promised \nover the years that the gas taxes they paid at the pump would come back \nto their respective States to be used for new highways, improvements in \nsafety, and the like. But it never happened. We had the donor-donee \nsituation, where various States got higher than they sent to Washington \nfor taxes; others got less. And finally we struck a note of fairness in \nthat legislation. It was landmark legislation. It has worked in our \nStates. That is why the Governors in all 50 States are opposed to this. \nThat is why the highway administrators in all 50 States and their \norganizations are opposed to the legislation. They made it work.\n  Tens upon tens of thousands of contracts are operating today to \nmodernize and improve our highways and\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\nother transportation facilities. Millions of people are engaged in \nemployment and others in providing the supplies and engineering and \ndesign. The system is working as it was intended when this Senate \ntogether with the House of Representatives put this legislation into \nlaw.\n  TEA-21 guaranteed that all the taxes motorists paid at the pump would \nbe placed in the highway trust fund. It would go into the trust fund, \nand, indeed, 100 percent went for highways and highway safety.\n  Before TEA-21, the gas tax was increased by 4.3 cents. I voted \nagainst an increase in taxes of 4.3 cents. But it went into the general \nrevenues. As a part of the legislative process in devising TEA-21 right \non this floor, we voted--I believe the vote was 80-18--to take that 4.3 \ncents which was going into the general revenue and put it into the \nhighway trust fund. Now we are asked to suspend that source of income \ngoing into the highway trust fund. I am opposed to it.\n  As our Nation's transportation infrastructure aged and crumbled, it \nwas imperative that we transfer the 4.3 cents from general revenues to \nthe highway trust fund. Eventually, TEA-21 guaranteed spending reform \nwhich resulted in a 40-percent increase in funds for transportation \nover the past 2 years. Today, we are just beginning to see the benefits \nof TEA-21 with more projects under construction, jobs being created, \nproducts moving more efficiently across the country, and, most \nimportantly, improvement in highway safety.\n  Do we want to now turn back the clock and inject uncertainty--that is \nthe key word, uncertainty--into the funding profile needed for our \nhighway program?\n  While the legislation has an untested triggering mechanism to restore \ngeneral revenues to the highway trust fund, what happens if that \ntrigger is pulled and it doesn't work? Again, uncertainty will \njeopardize highway safety for the driving public and thousands of jobs \nonce created by TEA-21. In order to accomplish these significant budget \nreforms in TEA-21, adequate funding in the highway trust fund was \ncritical to meet the many demands for the highway dollars. The highway \ntrust fund is the sole source of revenue to improve our highways and \nbridges and maintain our bus and rail systems.\n\n  The consequences of a suspension of 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax \nare very significant if that triggered mechanism doesn't work. First, \nState and local transportation activities will lose approximately $6 \nbillion just from the 4.3. Second, there will be a tremendous loss of \nhigh-paying jobs. I have heard upwards of a quarter of a million jobs \nwould be lost. Certain representations have been made by some of my \ncolleagues, and I am not in a position to agree or disagree, that all \nthe contracts that are currently signed in an operation have adequate \nfunding. That could well be correct. However, I could not get the same \nrepresentation from those individuals regarding the 18.4. If that \nsuddenly comes in, it could jeopardize some of the contracts that are \noutstanding.\n  As Members come to the floor to vote tomorrow, they must have in mind \nan answer if the triggers go in effect--there are several triggers to \nthe 18.4--what happens to the current contracts out there now and the \npeople who are on the highways of this Nation working with trucks and \nall the other equipment to improve these roads. State and local \ntransportation activities, as I say, will lose significant funds.\n  Second, there will be a tremendous loss of the highway-paying jobs. I \nhave covered that.\n  Third, the safety of American drivers would be jeopardized. I am \ngoing to have printed in the Record the AAA letter which goes to the \nquestion of safety on the highways of America.\n  Fourth, there would be severe disruptions in maintaining the planning \nschedules. In other words, every week in my State the highway \ndepartments, as they do in other States, are analyzing the needs of \nthat State and beginning to project the work, contract for the work, \ndesign the work. Suddenly, they hear from Washington; wait a minute, \nthe funds that may not come in. We promised the transfer from the \ngeneral revenues. Try to explain the triggering mechanism, and what \nhappens. Uncertainty comes into the equation.\n  We all know it takes years, far too long for a highway or transit \nproject to make it from the drawing board to construction. Severe \nswings or even the uncertainty of the availability of funds in \ntransportation funding will make it nearly impossible for States to \neffectively manage their highway programs. Consistent funding levels \nare critical to the seamless steps of planning, designing, engineering, \nthe permitting process, contracting, and construction. A stable \nprogram--where States, local governments, and contractors have the \nbenefits of a long-term funding cycle--translates into a reliable \nsupply of new and improved highways. That is elementary.\n  Do we want to stop the modernization of our Nation's transportation \nsystem to give the gas middleman a few more pennies in his pocket? It \ncould well happen. Or do we keep on course to improve transportation \nand highway safety for all Americans while providing more meaningful \nand lasting tax relief with such limited surplus as we may have?\n  Those are the fundamental questions.\n  I read off the various organizations, and I will make a brief \nreference to the following from the American Association of State \nHighway and Transportation Officials:\n\n       Dear Senator Warner: I would like to express AASHTOs \n     profound concern with, and opposition to, bills recently \n     introduced in the House and the Senate that would repeal or \n     suspend all or a portion of the Federal motor fuel taxes.\n       We appreciate the economic hardships caused by the sharp \n     rise in the price of oil to the trucking industry, to the \n     motoring public and to other sectors of our committee. \n     However, we are concerned that the recently introduced \n     legislation, designed to relieve the current economic \n     distress, will inadvertently jeopardize the financial \n     stability of the federal program that supports the various \n     surface infrastructure on which motorists, the trucking \n     industry, and indeed the economy depend.\n\n  From the Small Business Legislative Council, addressed to Senator \nLott, with a copy came to me:\n\n       On behalf of the Small Business Legislative Counsel (SBLC), \n     I want to indicate that we must object to the initiative to \n     temporarily roll back the Federal gas tax. While small \n     businesses are clearly suffering as a result of the highway \n     gasoline prices, we are long time staunch supporters of \n     reserving the integrity of the highway trust fund and making \n     sure that we have the proper infrastructure to deliver our \n     goods and services.\n\n  From the American Automobile Association, one of the great hallmarks \nin our transportation system for many years, they write:\n\n       Even more troubling is the proposal to temporarily suspend \n     the 18.4 cents per gallon Federal tax prices if prices top $2 \n     per gallon this year.\n\n  That is an average; it is a complex formula. It could happen. I \nunderstand in California today the prices are over $2. It would not be \njust one State that triggered it. It would be a national average.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Despite assurances that revenues lost by the Highway Trust \n     Fund will be replaced with revenues in the budget surplus, \n     this action fundamentally alters the basic principle \n     governing surface transportation funding. The Federal excise \n     tax is a user fee. Motorists are paying for road and bridge \n     repairs and safety programs through the fees paid at the gas \n     pump.\n\n  Now, from the American Road and Transportation Builders Association. \nThey listed 10 points which will be printed.\n  Last, I did not know what a coincidence it would be that the \nPresiding Officer, the Senator from Ohio, would be in the Chair. I \nobtained the following editorials which appeared in his State today, \nagain, solidly supporting the distinguished Senator's stance on \nopposition to these taxes. It is very clear. I will read one editorial \nwhich appears in the Akron Beacon Journal:\n\n       And all that gas tax, the difference that 4.3 cents can \n     make.\n       George Voinovich doesn't like paying $1.60 or more for a \n     gallon of gas. In that sense, the Ohio Senator stands with \n     the majority of his fellow Republicans, heck, the majority of \n     Americans. Where he departs from the party line is \n     determining what to do about the increase.\n       Not surprisingly, Voinovich takes a practical approach. On \n     Thursday, he joined Sen. John Warner, a Virginia Republican, \n     and Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat, to voice their \n     bipartisan opposition to repealing the 4.3-cents-per-gallon \n     tax levied in 1993 for deficit reduction. All three \n     understand the cost if the tax is repealed.\n\n[[Page S1918]]\n\n       Cost? Old motorists might save a few cents. What they would \n     lose is money for highway repair and construction. In 1997, \n     Congress altered the purpose of the tax, dedicating the 4.3 \n     to the highway use only.\n       What would Ohio lose? If the repeal took effect in July, \n     the State would forfeit $650 million the next three years. \n     The State Department of transportation is already budgeted \n     $300 million in Federal money for new construction. That \n     would disappear.\n       In its place? The headaches of drivers as they navigate the \n     roads in desperate need of repair. Voinovich knows deficient \n     roads exact their own toll.\n\n  All across America today, tonight, people will be joining in \nnotifying their Members of Congress that this piece of legislation, no \nmatter how sincere, how principled in its presentation to this body, is \nnot in the best interests of the country for the reasons I have stated.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Akron Beacon Journal, Mar. 27, 2000]\n\n        All That Gas Tax--The Difference That 4.3 Cents Can Make\n\n       George Voinovich doesn't like paying $1.60 or more for a \n     gallon of gas.

John William Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to you on behalf of the \n     American Association of State Highway and Transportation \n     Officials (AASHTO) which represents the highway and \n     transportation departments of the 50 States as well as the \n     District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. I would like to express \n     AASHTO's profound concern with, and opposition to, bills \n     recently introduced in the House and Senate that would repeal \n     or suspend all or a portion of the federal motor fuel taxes.\n       We appreciate the economic hardships caused by the sharp \n     rise in the price of oil to the trucking industry, to the \n     motoring public, and other sectors of the economy. However, \n     we are concerned that the recently introduced legislation, \n     designed to relieve the current economic distress, will \n     inadvertently jeopardize the financial stability of the \n     federal program that supports the very surface infrastructure \n     on which motorists, the trucking industry, and indeed, the \n     economy depend.\n       Each penny of motor fuel tax currently generates almost \n     $1.7 billion per year in revenues to the Highway Trust Fund's \n     Highway and Mass Transit Accounts, with the funds dedicated \n     to highway and mass transportation improvements. The loss of \n     revenue from a repeal of federal motor fuel excise taxes \n     would have a devastating impact on the ability of states to \n     deliver, as promised to their citizens, critically needed \n     surface transportation improvement projects. Projects that \n     would be eliminated or delayed include those designed to \n     reduce accidents and fatalities and to improve the overall \n     operation and efficiency of the surface transportation \n     system.\n       While the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n     (TEA 21) established record levels of federal surface \n     transportation investment, the U.S. Department of \n     Transportation still estimates that the level of investment \n     needed to maintain current highway conditions alone is $211 \n     billion over the next four years. The U.S. Department of \n     Transportation maintains that poor road conditions are a \n     factor in an estimated 30 percent of traffic fatalities. A \n     repeal or suspension of a portion of the federal motor fuel \n     tax would virtually eliminate all of the gains we made with \n     TEA 21, and put us that much further behind in meeting our \n     surface transportation needs.\n       We respectfully urge you to examine the loss of revenues to \n     the Highway Trust Fund and the impact on highway and mass \n     transportation funding to your state resulting from a repeal \n     of the federal motor fuel tax. I have attached a table that \n     shows the state-by-state effect of a repeal of 4.3 cents of \n     the tax. We hope that you will consider alternatives to a \n     repeal or suspension of the federal motor fuel excise tax \n     that would not seriously impair the abilities of the states \n     to deliver much-needed projects that will maintain and \n     improve the safety, condition and performance of our surface \n     transportation system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Thomas R. Warne,\n     Executive Directors.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    American Road & Transportation\n\n\n                                         Builders Association,\n\n                         Washington, DC, Wednesday, Mar. 29, 2000.\n\nTop 10 Reasons Why Repealing Part of the Federal Gas Tax Is a Bad Idea!\n\n       On Thursday, March 30, the U.S. Senate is expected to take \n     up legislation--S. 2285--that would: (a) repeal 4.3 cents of \n     the 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal gasoline tax from April 15, \n     2000, to January 1, 2001; or (b) repeal the entire 18.4 \n     Federal gas tax during that time frame if the national \n     average price of gasoline exceeds $2.00 per gallon. The bill \n     proposes to use the ``on-budget surplus'' to ``reimburse'' \n     the more than $20 billion that could be lost to the Highway \n     Trust Fund under this scheme.\n       1. S. 2285 introduces uncertainty and risk into state \n     highway funding. Federal highway investment is already \n     guaranteed under the 1998 highway bill known as the \n     Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). \n     There is no need to risk this guarantee for a promise that \n     things will be taken care of using the ``on-budget surplus.'' \n     Uncertainty will slow down state highway and mass transit \n     improvement programs.\n       2. S. 2285 could utilize the entire FY 2000 ``On-Budget \n     Surplus.'' According to the Senate Budget Committee's \n     Informed Budgeteer of March 13, 2000, the Congressional \n     Budget Office has reestimated the FY 2000 ``on-budget \n     surplus'' to be $15 billion. Repealing the entire federal gas \n     tax from April 15 to September 30--a possibility under S. \n     2285--would cost the Highway Trust Fund approximately $15 \n     billion. This would leave no room for other Republican budget \n     priorities . . . or to protect Social Security and Medicare. \n     A $9 billion supplemental appropriation bill is currently \n     pending in the House.\n       3. Cutting highway investment jeopardizes lives. According \n     to the U.S. Department of Transportation, 12,000 Americans \n     die each year in auto crashes in which poor road conditions \n     or alignments are a factor. Traffic accidents are the leading \n     cause of death of young Americans 6 to 28 years of age and \n     result in more permanent disabling injuries than any other \n     type of accident. Cutting the federal highway user fee could \n     cut programs that are aimed at helping reduce that public \n     health crisis.\n       4. American jobs would be put at risk. Rolling back 4.3 \n     cents of the federal gas tax motor fuels tax would risk \n     eliminating over a quarter million American jobs that are \n     sustained by public investment in highway construction \n     programs--with concurrent losses of federal and state income \n     tax revenue and increases in unemployment-related government \n     expenses.\n       5. S. 2285 could negatively affect state bond ratings. The \n     perception of uncertainty about the flow of federal highway \n     funds to the states that S. 2285 would create could affect \n     the bond ratings of states that have borrowed funds for \n     highway projects against future federal-aid revenues. The \n     National Highway System Act allows federal-aid highway and \n     mass transit funds to be used to pay principle and interest \n     costs on bonds for highway and mass transit projects. Bonds \n     issued under this provision are called GARVEE bonds. Here are \n     a few examples:\n       Ohio: $90 million for the Spring-Sandusky project with a \n     moral obligation to seek gas tax or general revenues if there \n     is a shortfall in federal aid.\n       Mississippi: $921.7 million for a four-lane highway \n     program, with the state gas tax as back up.\n       New Mexico: $100.2 million for State Route 44, with no \n     back-up (a ``naked GARVEE'').\n       New Jersey: $151.5 million to purchase 500 new buses, \n     backed solely by anticipated funding from the Federal Transit \n     Administration.\n       States that have passed enabling legislation or are \n     planning to issue GARVEE Bonds in the near future include \n     Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, \n     Nevada and Virginia.\n       6. The uncertainty raised by S. 2285 will hurt publicly-\n     traded companies in the transportation construction sectors. \n     These companies have already taken a hit on Wall Street over \n     the past month with just the suggestion of a cut in federal \n     highway investment. Many of these companies have made very \n     substantial capital investments in anticipation of increased \n     highway work under TEA-21. S. 2285 could leave them hanging \n     in the wind!\n       7. S. 2285 would only save the average American motorist 46 \n     cents a week. The motorist driving 12,000 miles a year in a \n     car getting 20 miles per gallon would save $18.28 between \n     April 15 and January 1, 2001, with a 4.3 cents gas tax cut.\n       8. S. 2285 acknowledges consumers may not even benefit from \n     the proposed tax rollback at the pump. The bill would direct \n     the Comptroller General of the United States to ``conduct a \n     study of the reduction of taxes under this Act to determine \n     whether there has been a passthrough of such reduction'' with \n     details to the Congress ``not later than September 30, \n     2000.''\n       9. Gasoline prices can be expected to decline in the next \n     two to three months by between 5 cents and 21.25 cents per \n     gallon due\n\n[[Page S1919]]\n\n     to OPEC's quota increase. According to a Department of \n     Energy's Energy Information Agency (EIA) study released on \n     March 6, crude oil prices would drop to $25.50 per barrel by \n     August and $23 per barrel by the end of the year if OPEC \n     increased its quota by 1.7 million bpd starting in April. \n     Also according to EIA, for each $1 per barrel decrease in the \n     price of crude oil, gasoline prices drop approximately 2.5 \n     cents per gallon at the pumps. According to market analysts, \n     such price adjustments take between 6-8 weeks. However, if \n     current gasoline prices reflect the peak crude prices, then \n     the gasoline price decline will be closest to the higher \n     figure.\n       10. Greenspan says ``Save the Surplus''. Federal Reserve \n     Chairman Alan Greenspan told the Senate Special Committee on \n     the Aging March 27, ``Saving the surpluses--if politically \n     feasible--is, in my judgment, the most important fiscal \n     measure we can take at this time to foster continued \n     improvements in productivity.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          AAA,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 28, 2000.\n       AAA wishes to go on record in its opposition to measures \n     that seek to suspend all or portions of the federal excise \n     tax on gasoline. While attractive at first glance, this \n     course of action will do little to address the root cause of \n     our gasoline price problem today, which is a shortage of \n     supply caused by curtailed production of crude oil, by OPEC \n     states.\n       AAA recognizes that many motorists are suffering because of \n     high gas prices. But, the benefits to motorists from reducing \n     the gas tax are, at best, minimal. Temporarily suspending 4.3 \n     cents of the gas tax would translate to less than $1 per week \n     in possible savings to motorists. The resulting loss of \n     revenue to the Highway Trust Fund, however, would impede the \n     important work of rebuilding our nation's transportation \n     infrastructure and improving highway and motorist safety. \n     That is an unacceptable risk for AAA's 43 million members.\n       Even more troubling is the proposal to temporarily suspend \n     the entire 18.4 cents-per-gallon federal tax if prices top $2 \n     per gallon this year. Despite assurances that revenues lost \n     to the Highway Trust Fund will be replaced with revenues from \n     the budget surplus, this action fundamentally alters the \n     basic principle governing surface transportation funding. The \n     federal excise tax is a user fee. Motorists are paying for \n     road and bridge repairs and safety programs through the fees \n     paid at the gasoline pump.\n       Congress recognized the importance of fully investing in \n     the nation's infrastructure when it passed TEA-21 in 1998 and \n     ensured that federal gas tax dollars are dedicated for their \n     intended purpose. Because of this historic legislation, \n     motorists now trust that their taxes are invested exactly \n     where they belong--improved mobility across all surface \n     transportation modes--and safety.\n       Make no mistake about it. Lower receipts into the Highway \n     Trust Fund will compromise safety for the traveling public. \n     Is that truly what Congress wants to do? Reducing the federal \n     gasoline tax will do nothing to increase fuel supply. That is \n     where Congress and the Administration should focus their \n     attention. To focus legislative efforts on the federal gas \n     tax, rather than the real problem--supply--is a shortsighted \n     and regrettably expedient response to the problem.\n       In the meantime, AAA is doing its part to reduce demand by \n     issuing its ``Gas Watcher's Guide'', which details the many \n     ways in which motorists can conserve fuel. A copy is enclosed \n     for your review. The guide shows motorists that how a vehicle \n     is used can be just as important as which vehicle is used.\n       Thank you for your consideration of AAA's view.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Susan G.

Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader: On behalf of the Small Business \n     Legislative Council (SBLC), I want to indicate that we must \n     object to the initiative to temporarily roll back the Federal \n     gas tax. While small businesses are clearly suffering as a \n     result of the high gasoline prices, we are long time staunch \n     supporters of preserving the integrity of the highway trust \n     fund and making sure that we have the proper infrastructure \n     to deliver our goods and services.\n       We understand that you intend to pay for this roll back \n     using the ``surplus.'' Right now we have many priorities for \n     the use of that surplus. Repeal of the death tax, increasing \n     direct expensing, full deductibility for the self-employed's \n     health care costs, FUTA tax relief, repeal of the installment \n     sales repeal and national debt reduction to name just a few.\n       As you know, the SBLC is a permanent, independent coalition \n     of nearly 80 trade and professional associations that share a \n     common commitment to the future of small business. Our \n     members represent the interests of small businesses in such \n     diverse economic sectors as manufacturing, retailing, \n     distribution, professional and technical services, \n     construction, transportation, tourism and agriculture. Our \n     policies are developed through a consensus among our \n     membership. Individual associations may express their own \n     views.

Mr. President, before my friend from Virginia leaves the \nfloor, I want to say a couple of things in his presence.\n  When I came to the Senate, the Senator from Virginia was a Member of \nthe Senate. I had the good fortune of being assigned to the Environment \nand Public Works Committee, as was the Presiding Officer when he came \nto the Senate.\n  I worked putting myself through law school in the Capitol complex.\n  I never talked to a Senator during that period of time. I always had \na kind of a vision of what a Senator was like. I have to say, the \nSenator from Virginia fills what I think a Senator should be. If there \nwere ever a gentleman Senator, the Senator from Virginia fits that \nbill.\n  We have worked together on committees over the years. When we were in \nthe majority, I was the chairman of a subcommittee. I was a junior \nMember of the Senate at the time, but the respect shown as the chairman \nof that subcommittee was as it should be from the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  We are no longer in the majority, and the Senator from Virginia is \nnow the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Even though we have \nnot always worked together on issues, and we have voted differently on \noccasion, I have the greatest admiration for the way the Senator from \nVirginia handles himself as a person and as a Senator.\n\n[[Page S1920]]\n\n  I say with the deepest respect, the Senator's statement today \namplifies--and the people of Virginia should understand--the courage it \ntakes to be, in this instance, a minority in a majority who speaks out \nagainst what, at first glance, seems very popular--reducing taxes.\n  In short, I commend, applaud, and appreciate this Senator for the \ncourage he has shown. One of my jobs on this side of the aisle is to \nmake sure we have enough votes on issues or at least know where the \nvotes are. The Senator's statement today will allow the Senate to act \ntomorrow in a bipartisan fashion and defeat this motion to invoke \ncloture. We need to do more things in the Senate in a bipartisan \nfashion. We do not always need this line dividing us. We need to work \ntogether more often.\n  I hope this will be the beginning of this Senate working together on \nmore issues. I appreciate the example set by the gentleman Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the \nassistant leader of the minority, a great Senator in his own right. We \nhave worked together and will continue to work together. These are \nmatters of conscience. Bottom line, it is the fervent hope of all \nAmericans that a Senator, when he or she votes, votes what is in the \nbest interest of the United States and as a matter of their own \npersonal conscience. That I do, and I know my distinguished colleague \nfrom Nevada follows that credo. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the floor when I heard the Senator \nfrom Virginia beginning to speak on this issue and, of course, stayed \nto hear him complete his remarks. I underscore and underline what the \nSenator said.\n  It was maybe 10 or 12 years ago that every weekly publication in \nAmerica, and many newspapers, featured articles about the deteriorating \ninfrastructure of this country--highways, roads, bridges, dams. They \nwere falling apart. They still are, but we have made great progress. \nWhy? Because we dedicated money in a trust fund to be used for only one \npurpose, and that is highways.\n  When someone buys a gallon of gasoline in Ohio, Virginia, or Nevada, \nthey can rest assured that money is going to go toward our \ndeteriorating infrastructure. It is so badly needed.\n  I am going to Nevada on Friday, and we are going to have a \ncelebration. Why are we going to have a celebration? Because we are \ngoing to cut the ribbon to the largest highway public works project in \nthe history of Nevada. It was done with the help of the Senator from \nVirginia. It was a direct allocation to the people of the State of \nNevada to take care of a very serious traffic problem we had in \ndowntown Las Vegas. It is something known as the spaghetti bowl. That \nwill be completed on Friday. It is a project that cost over $100 \nmillion.\n  From where did that money come? From people all over the country, \nincluding the people in Nevada, buying gasoline and diesel fuel and \npaying the taxes on that gallon of fuel. It went into the fund. There \nare other spaghetti bowls around America to which this tax has gone.\n\n  No one is happy about the cost of a gallon of gasoline, and I am not \nhere to justify the cost of gas. I think it is too high. I wish it were \nlower. We, in America, should look at this as a glass being half full, \nnot half empty. The reason I say that is, in spite of the spiraling gas \nprices which none of us like, we have the lowest gas costs in the \nworld. Other countries buy gas by the liter, and they pay a lot for it.\n  I hope, with the OPEC nations going to produce 1.7 million barrels of \ngasoline a day extra and Norway and Mexico and other countries \nproducing more, we are going to get over 2 million barrels of gasoline \na day. It will take some time for the price of gas to drop. We cannot \nbe rushing forward on these issues. We have to be calm and deliberate.\n  This is a tax bill, and we should handle tax bills by having hearings \nin the Finance Committee. We have two very fine people there, some of \nthe most experienced legislators not only in the Senate today, but in \nthe history of the country--the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, the \nchairman of the committee, and the ranking member, the Senator from New \nYork, Mr. Moynihan. They have wide-ranging experience.\n  Senator Moynihan is not only a ranking Democrat on the Finance \nCommittee, he was chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. They should have a hearing on this and talk about--the good \nand the bad about lowering this gas tax. We have not had a single \nhearing. This bill is here as a result of what we call rule XIV. There \nis no companion bill in the House. If this bill is passed, it will \neither be held here at the desk indefinitely, or if we send it to the \nHouse, it will be blue slipped. It is a tax bill. It will go nowhere. I \nam sorry to say, this is for show.\n  We have a tax bill, H.R. 3081. This is what we need to do. There is \nno one in this body who does not want to see a decrease in the price of \ngasoline. This is not the way to go about it.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, has suggested maybe we \nshould direct the 300,000 barrels a day that flow from Alaska to \nplaces, other than the United States, to the United States. Use Alaska \noil for us, not them. That would help.\n  In fact, this legislative action that is going to take place tomorrow \nis a step in the wrong direction. I will not go into the details. The \nSenator from Virginia has done a good job of that. Let's be more \ncareful and more calculating in what we do.\n  Because my two colleagues from Virginia and Ohio are here, both \nmembers of the majority, I am only going to touch briefly--because I do \nnot think this should be a partisan issue--on George W. Bush's stand on \nthis issue. I am disappointed in Governor Bush. I hope he does not \nthink the solution to every problem is lowering taxes. I wish he would \nreassess his view on this. He has come out for lowering this gas tax. I \nam sorry he has done that.\n  That is enough on partisan issues. We have been very bipartisan and \nwill continue to do so.\n  Mr. President, do you know who would love this proposal? The oil \ncartel. Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister. You set these \nlimits as high as you want or as low as you want, and the oil prices \nare pushed up. You are afraid, the higher the price of gasoline, that \npeople will use less gasoline and heating oil and cut your exports. \nSuppose, however, you can count on the U.S. Government to reduce \ngasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. They have a great \ndeal going then. Then Americans are less likely to reduce their oil \nconsumption and conspire to drive prices up, which makes such a \nconspiracy considered more attractive.\n  This is directly from the New York Times. It is not original with me.\n\n  They further go on to state: This tax cutback would lead directly to \ncutbacks in necessary and popular Government services. This is one \ninstance where everyone agrees that if you cut taxes, it would lead \ndirectly to cutbacks in necessary and popular Government services.\n  We have talked about what those Government services are; namely, \ntaking care of the deteriorating bridges, roads, and highways we have \nin America.\n  Tax cuts are not the answer to this problem.\n  I hope people on this side of the aisle and people on that side of \nthe aisle will come here tomorrow and vote this down and, hopefully, \npave the way, in the ensuing weeks and months, so that we can do other \nthings in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I say to my friend, again, from Virginia, thank you very much for \nyour leadership on this issue. I say to the Presiding Officer, a member \nof our committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, thank you \nvery much for your courage and your leadership on this issue. \nObviously, from what has been read by the Senator from Virginia from \nthe newspapers at home, they see that you have your eye on the prize \nand know what you are doing. Congratulations.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, again, I thank my colleague for what I \nregard as a very moderate and tempered and sincere approach to this \nissue. There is always a temptation to lurch into what are the \npolitical unknowns or intentions here. But our distinguished assistant \nleader of the minority party, I think, just stated his case very \nfactually. I respect him for that.\n\n[[Page S1921]]\n\n  I say, before the distinguished leader leaves the floor, I think the \nPresiding Officer might have a perspective here. If you just wait a \nminute, I shall take the Chair and enable the Presiding Officer to \naddress the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. First of all, I thank the Senator from Virginia for \nrelieving me in my responsibility of presiding over the Senate, and \nthank him also for his very kind words about my involvement in this \nissue that I think is very important to our fellow Americans. I commend \nthe Senator from Virginia for his ability to stand up on an issue that \nis fairly controversial, and to speak from his heart. I also appreciate \nthe kind words from the Senator from Nevada.\n  I speak today as a Senator from Ohio, and also as a lucky freshman \nwho is chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee \nin the Environment and Public Works Committee of the Senate.\n  I also speak from a perspective as a former Governor of the State of \nOhio, and the former chairman of the National Governors' Association, \nthe chairman of the association when we negotiated TEA 21 with this \nCongress and the President; one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation that this Congress passed. As the Senator from Nevada has \npointed out, it was a piece of legislation that responded to the \ntremendous infrastructure needs that we have throughout this great \ncountry of ours. Even in spite of that wonderful piece of legislation, \nwe still have some great needs to fill in order to really have a \ntransportation system that will allow us to compete in this 21st \ncentury.\n  One of the things we were concerned about in that legislation was the \nissue of being able to depend upon a flow of money for a certain period \nof time so that we could properly plan for new highway construction in \nour States.\n  We needed something that was dependable and something that we could \nwork with our contractors and others that do work in our States, so we \ncould say we are going to be doing this program over a period of years \nand not have these peaks and valleys that so many States experience.\n  We were pleased Congress decided to take the 4.3-cent gas tax that \nhad been used for deficit reduction and use it for our highways. I \nmight say, in 1993 I was not in favor of Congress using the gas tax for \ndeficit reduction because it was a user's tax. From a federalism point \nof view, our feeling was that that was a tax that should be earmarked \nfor the user--the user being the people who use our highways--in order \nto repair and maintain and build new highways, to allow them to move \ngoods, and also to eliminate some of the traffic problems and the \npollution problems created by traffic jams that we have throughout the \ncountry.\n  I was pleased that Congress decided to take that and say: We are \ngoing to make it a user tax. We all felt good about that and we felt \nrelieved.\n  We now have before us the situation where our gas prices have \nincreased substantially. I am not going to go into all the reasons for \nit.\n  A 4.3-cent reduction in the gas tax, frankly, may have some short-\nterm political benefits. But when people consider the fact that if they \ndrive 15,000 miles per year, and they average 15 miles per gallon, that \nthey will save $43 with our 4.3-cent reduction in the gas tax. They \nwill be very cynical about Congress' response to a problem that they \nare confronting at the gas pump--particularly when they come to realize \nthat it will have, even on a short-term basis, an interruption in some \nof the highway projects that are underway throughout this country.\n  As the Senator from Virginia said, in the State of Ohio, we are \ntalking about, over 3 years, $650 million. That 4.3 cents is the \nconstruction money that Ohio needs to move forward with their new \nhighway construction. I would suspect in Nevada and Virginia it is the \nsame thing. Other money is used just for maintenance and repair. This \nis the money we are using for new construction.\n  In addition--this is something that has not been even spoken about--\nthat 4.3 cents, when Congress agreed to allow it to be used for the \nhighway trust fund, was the money that guaranteed donor States, such as \nOhio--and I do not know whether the Presiding Officer's State is a \ndonor State or not--but it was the thing that allowed us to be \nguaranteed 90.5 cents on every $1 we sent to Washington.\n  I want you to know this is a big deal because one of the first things \nI did when I became Governor of Ohio in 1990 was to say, we are a donor \nState. At that time, we were only getting back 79 cents per $1. So one \nof the first things I did was to try to lobby, through the National \nGovernors' Association, an increase for the donor States. You may \nremember, ISTEA brought up a lot of the donor States. I think we went \nfrom 79 cents up to 87 cents. With TEA 21, we are now at 90.5 cents. \nThat is very important in terms of our guaranteed funding. It is also \nvery important in terms of our new construction program.\n  I know there are some who suggest that we use the budget surplus to \nmake up for the money we would lose from reducing the highway gas tax.\n  But the fact of the matter is, if you want to look at the big \npicture, what we are saying is, we are going to use the budget surplus \nthat could be used to reduce taxes or reduce the national debt, or be \nused for prescription drug benefits in Medicare, and so many other \nthings--we're going to use that general pot of money to fund highways, \nwhich are used by a certain select group of people in this country, \nmainly, highway users.\n  We are basically saying to the highway users: You are having a \nproblem at the pump. Therefore, we are going to reduce your taxes by \n4.3 cents, and we are going to find the money from the general fund of \nthe United States. So we will make everybody in the United States \nsubsidize that 4.3 cents we are reducing on the gas tax.\n  In spite of the fact that I am not happy about the high cost of \ngasoline, I think the people who use the highways ought to be the ones \nwho pay for the new highways, and the repairs, and for new \nconstruction. This bill would say we are going to open up the general \nfund of the United States and use it to make up the difference. I think \nfrom an equitable point of view, that is not fair. I think this \nproposal, from a public policy point of view, is one that is not well \ntaken.\n  The passage of this reduction may take away from the fact that we \nhave a real problem in this country. The problem in this country is \nthat we have no energy policy. The reason we have the increase in the \nprice of gasoline in this country, in my humble opinion, is the fact \nthat this administration was asleep at the switch. They didn't do their \nhomework. As a result of that, the price of oil crept up.\n  Now they are cramming in every way possible to try to influence the \npeople who supply the oil to bring the price down. What we should be \ndoing is following the leadership of Senator Frank Murkowski and others \nwho have come to the floor of the Senate, and work conscientiously to \ndevelop an energy policy for the United States of America. We should be \nconcerned about the fact that we are relying too much upon foreign oil.\n  Last week, Senator Thompson had a hearing of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee which included people from the administration. I asked them: \nDo you believe we should be less reliant on foreign oil? Their answer \ncame back: Yes. I said: Statistics show we are going to become more \nreliant on foreign oil.\n  I then asked the question: Do you have a number where you want to be; \ni.e., 50-percent reliant, 45-percent reliant? They didn't have an \nanswer. They didn't have a number. Then I said to them: Logically, one \nwould say that if you wanted to reduce your dependence on foreign oil, \nyou would set a goal and say we are going to reduce it to 45 percent, \nand we are going to reduce it by X year, and here is the way we are \ngoing to achieve that goal. That would involve opening up more \nopportunities--ANWR, for example. That would also mean looking at \nalternative fuels. That would mean looking at our Tax Code to encourage \nour small oil strippers who can't afford to be in the business, to get \nback in the business. That would mean having a national policy, that \nputs all of these things on the table, and that looks at environmental \nconcerns.\n\n[[Page S1922]]\n\n  Yes, we want to protect the environment. Yes, we want to protect our \nnational defense, which is something we're not talking about. The \nnational defense of our country is in jeopardy. Reports have said that. \nWe can't be reliant on these other nations, particularly those who are \nour enemies. We have been at war with one of them for 10 years now.\n  I think this situation with these high gas prices should be an \nopportunity, on a bipartisan basis, to bring everybody to the table to \ndevelop and start talking about what should be the energy policy of the \nUnited States. It should not to be like so many instances around this \ncountry where, when something happens, we treat it like a barking dog. \nYou give it a bone, the price will go down, everybody will continue to \ndo the same thing they did before, and we will have another crisis. It \nis time to get this problem out of the drawer and onto the table, and \ndeal with it in a responsible fashion. We need to set out a plan we can \nfeel confident in that will reduce our reliance on foreign oil and \nprotect our national economy and our national defense.\n  We should not be participating in a short-term proposal to reduce the \ngas tax which will not make a whole lot of difference and may indeed \ntake the focus away from the real problem; that is, that the United \nStates of America does not have an energy policy.\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Oregon assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He has stood with me \nthroughout this battle, succeeding me as chairman. He fully \nunderstands. He brings a perspective to the Government. He understands \nthe problem of long-term stability in contracting on our highway \nprograms. Of course, that is predicated on this trigger mechanism \nworking. Perhaps the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee \nwill know.\n  This is so serious, but I wish to inject a little humor. One of our \ncolleagues today said this reminds him of pool. It is a three-bank \nshot. Picture the ball. That is the 4.3. You hit it off one bank, and \nsuddenly it gets stripped off and goes around the other balls, which is \nthe Budget Committee, so they don't have any voice in this. It goes off \nanother bank. When it hits that bank, it picks up funds from the \ngeneral revenue. Then it comes over and hits another bank to get around \nthe Appropriations Committee, which usually has some authority over \nappropriating around the surplus, and then slowly goes into the pocket \nof the highway trust fund. So this is a three-cornered bank shot. Maybe \nour distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee can throw a little \nlight on this triggering mechanism and how it works.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I think one of the significant things about this \nproposal is the number of people who are opposed to it.\n  The AAA--a very respected organization in this country which \nrepresents the folks who drive on America's highways--with the high gas \nprice, you would think they would be saying reduce the tax, or, get rid \nof the tax. But the AAA is saying: No, we don't want you to reduce the \ntax. We know it is not going to make a lot of difference in terms of \nthe price, and we are more concerned about having highways that are \nsafe and well-maintained and that are repaired. They are more \ninterested in seeing new construction projects undertaken.\n  Last but not least, I want to correct something that was said on the \nfloor. The Senator from Nevada indicated that Governor Bush supports \nthe repeal of the 4.3-cent gas tax. I talked with Governor Bush \nyesterday or the day before. He clearly said he did not support--how \ndid he put it? I want to be very careful about how I say this--he is \nnot in favor of reducing the 4.3-cent gas tax. That is what he said, \nand it was spoken as the Governor of the State of Texas who understands \nhow important highways are.\n  I also point out that the National Governors' Association has said \nthey are opposed to this proposal. The National Association of \nCounties, the National Council of State Legislators, all of the people \nwho have been dealing with highways and the users are saying this is \nnot going to make a real difference. Let's get on with dealing with \nthis problem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I yield to the Senator, my good friend from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I thank the Senator for his good remarks. He is \nright on. I think he should add to his arsenal of words and discussions \nabout the energy crisis the following: The United States of America has \nthe greatest intelligence organization. We spend so much on \nintelligence and information gathering. We have an agency within the \nDepartment of Energy that is independent. We put a lot of money in it. \nThey call themselves the ``analysts of energy.'' They are supposed to \nknow everything you can know about crude oil. Tonight, as the cartel \nand its member countries concluded a meeting and said, this is what we \nare going to do, the United States of America has no way of finding out \nwhether they have or have not. We do not know how much they are \nproducing, how much they are exporting. That may come as a shock to \nyou, but I can guarantee you what I am telling you is right. We don't \nknow.\n\n  Now isn't this something? We are now sending diplomats, such as my \nfriend and former colleague from New Mexico, to go over and kind of beg \nthese countries to consider our economy and worry about our future and \nthat we are in this together, we are bosom buddies, and we bailed you \nout of a few wars; don't do us in so bad; put a little more oil on the \nmarket so the price will go down. We don't know, unless they choose to \ntell us, day by day how much they are putting in the market, how much \nis being exported to the world communities. We sort of know how much \nthe world needs. Our chairman of the Energy Committee has reported over \nand over again what that number is. But if you ask the person from the \nenergy agency of the United States, Do you know how much they put on \nthe market months ago?--give us the month and tell us how much--they \nwill tell you: We don't know. As a matter of fact, they will tell you \nthey lost 500 million barrels somewhere. I don't mean that it sank \nunderground in a big hole and depleted away; they just lost it in \ntransit, didn't know what happened to it.\n  I submit that we ought to worry about all the things you are talking \nabout, but we had better get our heads together and find out who we are \ngoing to assign the responsibility of finding out how much of this \ninternational oil is being put on the market. After all, we ought to \nknow. We are paying the money for it. Our future is dependent upon it. \nIf they cut down the spigot and we don't know for 6 or 7 months what \nthey did, shame on us, don't you think? We have to know that.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. If the Senator will yield further. One of the concerns \nI have is, what kind of promises have we made to these people in order \nto get them to turn on the oil spigot? I just heard earlier today, for \nexample, that Iraq, who has been our enemy--\n  Mr. WARNER. And still is, I might add.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Still is. In consideration of their giving us more \noil, we are shipping them some technology they say they need in order \nto produce more oil. This is an awful position for the United States of \nAmerica to be in, that we are at the mercy of someone who has been an \nenemy of ours, whom we went to war against and lost American lives \nover, and we are negotiating with them. It underscores how vulnerable \nwe are because of a lack of an energy policy.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, this has been a great \nconcern to me in my responsibilities on the Armed Services Committee. \nAs the three of us are debating here in the spirit of the Senate, we \nhave aviators flying missions over Iraq, containing that nation from \nfurther aggression, further human rights violations, possible further \naggression from the very members of the OPEC cartel to which the \ndistinguished Senator just referred having this meeting. They are \nrisking their lives. What are we asking Americans to risk their lives \nfor, at the same time we are sending spare parts to Iraq to increase \noil production?\n  I asked in the Armed Services Committee the other day what, if any, \ncommitments we made. I was assured by administration officials there \nwas none. Iraq came up here the other day\n\n[[Page S1923]]\n\nand committed to the world market 700,000 barrels as part of the 1.7, \nwhich my distinguished colleague from New Mexico just addressed. Then, \nat the same time, we have naval units in the Persian Gulf, right off \nSaudi Arabia, off the Emirates, off Kuwait, right off the coast of \nthese nations, risking sailors' lives, and other nations have joined. \nGreat Britain is flying with us over Iraq. They are taking risks as \nthey try to enforce the embargo of the illegal export of oil from Iraq \nwhich, I understand from one of our colleagues, is coming now into the \nUnited States. How can we ask these young men and women flying these \nmissions to take the risk of life in the face of this flawed energy \npolicy?\n\n  I thank my colleagues. This has been a very good debate. I started \noff solo, and little did I know I would have the support of my two \ndistinguished colleagues. I thank them both.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before I conclude on this subject, after \nwhich time I want to make a short speech about Ted Stevens, my friend \nand everybody's friend here in the Senate, I want to talk about this \nadministration for a minute.\n  Nobody will deny that President Bill Clinton is about as articulate \nand as smart a President as we have ever had. He can get on television \nand tell us things, and people believe him. When in fact we are doing \nthings, it is good to have a President like that because people find \nout what we are doing.\n  As I look back on this administration now, I used to say there are \ntwo difficult things--because I am a budget man, a fiscal policy guy; \nthat is what I have been doing around here. I used to say there are two \nmajor problems left for America. If we solve them, we have our fiscal \npolicy house in order like we never thought we would. We are going to \nbe on the path of surpluses, of low taxation, which is when America \ndoes well, when we are taxed at low levels. That is one of the most \nsignificant differences between our country and its business success \nand production of jobs and employment and those who compete with us. We \ntax business low, not high. We let business pay money to employees, not \nto welfare programs. This is pretty exciting stuff.\n  One of the two things we never fixed is Medicare, which is in no \nbetter shape today than when the President walked into the office. In \nfact, it is closer to bankruptcy. No major reform. No prescription \ndrugs. I used to say that. Then I would say the other one that is major \nis Social Security--this gigantic program that has taken so many \nseniors out of poverty, and we all have to be proud of that. I used to \nsay, if this President would leave us a permanent solution to that, he \nwould leave a great legacy. But he has ignored the two big problems of \nthe country.\n  Tonight, as Senator Voinovich was on the floor talking, I was \nreminded that there is a third problem America has that this President \nhas not touched, which is America's dependence on crude oil from \nforeign countries to operate our cars and use in our daily lives, \nalmost to the point that we could not survive without it. What has \nhappened? Growing dependency. It used to be that I thought when we got \nto 50 percent, I would join Senator Bentsen, or someone, on the floor \nsaying put a program out. The prediction is that we will be at 65-\npercent dependency in the next 10, 15 years.\n  It is not so important that we are 65-percent dependent, but when you \nare that dependent, if somebody decides to cut your supply by just a \nmillion or two out of the 65, the prices go up. That is what is \nhappening right now. The world needs X amount, and they are producing \nabout X minus 2.5 or 2.7 million barrels a day. Look at what happens to \nthe prices.\n  So we became vulnerable during this administration, which kind of \nhappily moved along saying: Isn't it neat? We have cheap oil, and it's \nfeeding this magnificent economic growth, and, boy, aren't we on the \ngravy train?\n  Tonight, we are talking about the fact that that is not a gravy \ntrain. We are really in big trouble as the world's most powerful \nnation, and not a constructive thing has happened, unless one concludes \nit is constructive to have Secretary Richardson going to all these \nnations--some of them twice, some three times, I assume--urging that \nthey can't hurt their friend America by continuing to underproduce oil. \nWe have to produce more so the price will come down. That can't be an \nenergy policy--to go out to those big countries and rely on your \nfriendship to get some relief; that is not an energy policy.\n  How can we, as a great nation, say to our children and grandchildren: \nThat is the legacy we are leaving you? Boy, we hope we have a great \nSecretary of State and a great Secretary of Energy in about 8 or 10 \nyears, so they can meander around the world and know all these leaders \nand go there and have dinner with them and talk about being their great \nfriends. What if it turns out that in a few years they are up to here \nwith us?\n  Some are already saying it. We have been so inconsistent with Kuwait, \nour business friend, that they are asking publicly: What is it America \nwants of us?\n  They have been trying to be helpful. We saved them. Incidentally, \nwhile we saved them, they paid an awful price in terms of dollars to \npay for that war. America didn't pay much for that war. Between Kuwait, \nSaudi Arabia, Japan, and others, they paid almost every penny for the \ncost of that war. It was the slickest thing you ever saw. I was sitting \nwith the man who worked with the President and who set all of it out in \na formula for how these countries would pay. They paid it. We were \nthrilled to have those countries go out and pay for that war. They paid \nfor it. They went into hock and mortgage to pay for it.\n  They are wondering: What do you want of us, America? We are trying to \ndo everything you are asking of us. But we don't know what to do.\n  That is pretty tough stuff to come from one little country. It is \nlittle. But for a small country, it has more barrels of oil under each \nsquare piece of its earth than any other similar piece of soil in the \nworld. That is Kuwait. It is small but hugely laden with oil supplies.\n  I am delighted that the gas tax pumps Senator Voinovich up enough to \ncome to the floor and not only talk about that gasoline tax which pays \nfor our highways. No matter what it was for when it was passed, it is \nnow in our highway trust fund. It is part of the formula that we used.\n  I will tell you, if you temporarily repeal it for 1 year, it will not \nhurt the allocations for the year 2001. Everybody will get what they \ncurrently plan on getting. But that means we have to eventually put the \nmoney back in.\n  We are running around talking about trying to pay for future military \nneeds and trying to take care of some new Medicare needs, if we can get \nreform, and, frankly, we ought not to be cavalierly talking about these \nbillions that we are going to have to take out of the general fund.\n  I want to say for the record so everybody will know when they hear \nabout their gasoline tax that the rule of thumb is for every penny of \ntax for roads and the like, the U.S. Government gets $1 billion. That \nis a pretty rough calculus. If it is 4.3, it is about $4.3 billion. If \nit is 18 cents that is repealed temporarily, or otherwise, it is about \n$18 billion. That is per annum, per year. The rule of thumb still \napplies. It applied a few years ago. Nobody has changed it, to my \nknowledge right now. It might change as the price goes up. We may see \nsome change. But I don't think so because these are not percentages. \nThey are pennies per gallon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1923-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1923-S1924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ALASKA'S MAN OF THE CENTURY\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to make a few remarks about a \nfriend of mine. I will have been in the Senate at the end of this year \nfor 28 years. When I arrived, a Senator was already here named Ted \nStevens from the great State of Alaska. He was strong, articulate, and \nhe was tough. He was moving up in the ranks.\n  There are approximately 6 billion people alive on this Earth right \nnow, and only 619,000 of them are living in Alaska. After a long \nprocess, it was decided that Senator Stevens should be the ``Man of the \nCentury'' for Alaska.\n  We have all attended banquets and events for the ``Man of the Year'' \nor the ``Woman of the Year.'' But Alaska did it up right. They found \none of their own, and said: If you look at the century--for part of \nwhich they certainly were not in the United States--who is the man of \nthat century? And it was\n\n[[Page S1924]]\n\nour own Ted Stevens, currently the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  It is phenomenal how people more times than not find reality. They \nfind out what gold is, what is really important, and what is big, \nstrong, and sturdy. It is clear that when it comes to stature, he might \nnot be a tall or big man, but he matches Alaska's mountains; no doubt \nabout it. He is a mountain of a man. I am very grateful to be able to \ncall him my friend.\n  Other Senators have already put in the Record all of the things he \nhas done around here in his years as Senator and how many times he has \nhad to run. A few times he was Senator for only a couple of years, and \nthen he had to run again. He has run more times than the number of \nyears of service would directly yield for a 6-year term, as the \noccupant of the chair and I serve.\n  When you add it all up, Alaska has done it right. They have concluded \nthat when you look back on the people of Alaska, even long before there \nwas statehood, they are really saying there has not been a man like \nhim. Alaska hasn't had a man like Ted Stevens. He is unique.\n  I want to say on the floor tonight that I am a few days late. I had \nleft town when I found out about this last week. I am glad to have the \nopportunity tonight.\n  I want to say I am thrilled to have him as my friend. He has a tough \njob. So do I. I do the budget, and he helps me. He does appropriations, \nwhich has to be done every single year with the claims all the Senators \nput upon him, and with all of the claims others place in behalf of the \npeople of this country for new programs and new expenditures. He has an \nawful lot of that on his shoulders.\n  I say to him that we are lucky we have him here. We are thrilled that \nhe came from Alaska. If I were an Alaskan, I would have joined them in \nvoting for him as the ``Man of the Century.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/03/29/senate-section/article/S1924-1", "month": "03", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2323\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
