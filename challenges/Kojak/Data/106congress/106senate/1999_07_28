Mr. President, this morning as I came into the Senate \nChamber, the words to a song came to mind, ``O Happy Day.'' I almost \nfeel like singing. This is a happy day. This is when the American \npeople finally get to have a little bit more control over their lives, \ntheir own lives, based on decisions made in Chester County, PA, or in \nPascagoula, MS. This is a day when we are going to be talking about the \npeople being able to keep just a little bit more of their own hard-\nearned money. Too often in the Senate we are arguing over details; we \nare trying to figure out how we from Washington can spend more of the \npeople's money; we are thinking about how can we in Washington control \nmore of people's lives.\n  Well, finally we are going to get to have some fun; the people are \ngoing to get to have some fun. They can keep their own money to look \nafter their own children without the Government telling them how to do \nit, to put them in the school of their choice, to deal with their \nhealth needs, or maybe even to have a little fun. O Happy Day. They get \nto be with their family on their own money.\n  So I got up this morning feeling good because finally we are going to \nbe doing something that I feel good about, the kind of thing that I \ncame to Washington to do, and that was to try to control and reduce the \nsize of Washington Government, to go with what Thomas Jefferson had in \nmind, and that was to put those decisions back closest to the people, \nwith the people and the Government closest to the people. This is when \nwe begin to do it. I think back during Jefferson's term after a war, a \nconflict that the country had been involved in. They terminated the \ndeath tax. Yes. Go back and look at history. The only time death taxes \nwere put in place was during wars. When the wars were over, they were \nended. But then mistakenly, because he was not in good health, \nPresident Wilson, after World War I, did not take it off and we have \nbeen stuck with it ever since.\n  So this is a happy day, and I look forward to having a discussion \nabout the specifics of tax relief for working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9449-6", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9449-S9450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Before we get started with that, under a previous order, \nthe Senate will begin a cloture vote on the substitute amendment to the \njuvenile justice bill at 9:45. Following the vote, Senator Smith is \nexpected to make\n\n[[Page S9450]]\n\nsome remarks regarding his concerns with the juvenile justice \nlegislation. If cloture is invoked and following the remarks of Senator \nSmith, it is hoped the Senate will proceed to the various motions to \nsend the juvenile justice bill to conference.\n  I understand completely Senator Smith's concerns. He has been \ndetermined, but he has been reasonable and cooperative within the \nlimits of what he felt he had to do to the maximum degree. I thank him \nfor his approach. I certainly share a lot of his concerns. But I \nbelieve, all things considered, this is the right thing to do for the \nSenate and for the country.\n  The Senate will then begin consideration of the tax relief bill under \nthe reconciliation procedures. As a reminder, by statute, the \nreconciliation bill is limited to 20 hours of debate. I really would \nlike to have more time for discussion on this bill so that we could cut \nout some of the discussion on all these other bills that come up. \nTherefore, it is hoped that Senators will have their amendments ready \nand will offer their amendments during the 20 hours. Debate time on \namendments is included, but the actual vote time is not included in the \n20 hours.\n  So we can expect to go well into the evening today and again on \nThursday in order to finish. If we do not, we will go over until \nFriday. But we have enough time and we certainly should finish this \nbill no later than sometime during the day Friday.\n  We do expect opening statements this morning. It may be that there \nwill be several hours needed for the opening statements, but I hope we \ncan quickly turn to the amendment process and give Senators an \nopportunity to offer amendments about which they feel strongly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9450-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I see the minority leader \ncoming on the floor. I was just going to try to get about 3 minutes \nbefore the vote. Would that be agreeable with the minority leader?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it would be entirely agreeable. I would \njust ask that prior to the time we have a vote, I be able to use some \nof my leader time for a couple of comments. But I would be happy to \nyield the floor so that the Senator from New Hampshire can speak.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I very much appreciate the minority \nleader's consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I want to make a point on \nthe legislation before the cloture vote we are going to have shortly \nbecause, according to the rules, I am not going to be able to debate \nthis until after the vote, which is really not the best process in the \nworld. But I want my colleagues to know what we will be voting cloture \non in a very few moments is the Senate substitute for the underlying \nHouse bill. So when we go to cloture on that, what we are doing is \nsubstituting gun control for the House bill.\n  I want all of my colleagues to understand that H.R. 1501 is a return \nto traditional values.\n  This bill brings morals back into the school. It brings values back \ninto the school. It focuses on the cultural problems that are facing \nus. It allows a display of the Ten Commandments. It allows individual \nreligious expression. It allows prayer at school memorial services. It \nallows faith-based groups to compete for Government juvenile justice \ngrants. That is the underlying provision. That is what I wanted to vote \non, and that is what I did not have the opportunity to vote on.\n  What is being substituted is gun control. It imposes strict limits on \ngun shows. It requires the sale of trigger locks with guns, and it puts \nnew limits on juvenile gun possession, even juveniles who are law-\nabiding citizens who might like to have hunting licenses.\n  The bottom line is, the bill passed by the Senate is a good cultural \nbill. Gun control is being substituted. If my colleagues vote for \ncloture, they are voting to substitute gun control for a very good bill \nthat focuses on the cultural and moral problems in our schools.\n  I will close on this point. There is a fictitious story being \ncirculated on the Internet where a Columbine High School student writes \na letter to God and says:\n\n       Dear God: I'm very angry with you. I don't understand why \n     you allowed 13 of my fellow students to be killed by two of \n     my fellow students. Please answer me as soon as possible. \n     Columbine High School student.\n\n  A letter comes back from God:\n\n       Dear student: Let me remind you, I'm not allowed in your \n     high school.\n\n  We need to think seriously because this is a major decision we are \nmaking. If my colleagues vote for cloture, they are substituting gun \ncontrol for values, prayer in school, the Ten Commandments, religious \nexpression, and prayers at memorial services. That is what they are \nsubstituting, one for the other.\n  Let's make it clear: If you are for gun control, vote for cloture. If \nyou are for values and prayer and the Ten Commandments in school, vote \nagainst cloture.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the minority leader \nfor his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will use a few minutes of my leader \ntime to comment.\n  We intend to support the effort to move this legislation to \nconference. In fact, I endorse the actions taken by the majority leader \nin this case in so-called filling the tree.\n  For the purpose of record and drawing a distinction on this bill from \nother bills where our majority leader has filled the tree prior to the \ntime we have had any debate, this bill, S. 254, has been debated now \nfor 8 days, from May 11 through May 20. We conducted 32 rollcall votes. \nThe Senate considered 38 amendments--18 Democratic amendments, 20 \nRepublican amendments. We had 10 Democratic amendments agreed to, 17 \nRepublican amendments agreed to, and then we had 10 Democratic and \nRepublican amendments that were not agreed to, and 1 Republican \namendment was withdrawn.\n  The point I am making is that we have had a very good debate on S. \n254. We had that debate. We brought it to conclusion. We had a final \nvote. Now it is time to move it on to conference. I fully respect the \nSenator from New Hampshire and his determination to slow this process \ndown because he objects to some of the aspects in this bill, and that \nis his right. But I will say I support the effort made by the majority \nleader to move this bill to conference and the method he has employed \nto do so.\n  Again, this is not the same as laying a bill down for the first time, \nfilling the tree and precluding Democratic amendments. We have had a \nvery good debate on this bill. We have had an opportunity to offer \namendments. I cite S. 254 as the model I wish we would follow on all \nbills, a model that we historically and traditionally have always \nfollowed, which is to lay a bill down, allow it to be subject to \namendments, have a good debate on amendments, have the votes, have the \nfinal vote, and then go to conference.\n  I hope we can do more such of this in the future as we consider other \nauthorizing bills. I urge my Democratic colleagues and my Republican \ncolleagues to support the effort this morning to move this legislation \nforward to conference so we can resolve what differences there are with \nthe House--and there are many very important differences. I am hopeful \nwe can bring\n\n[[Page S9451]]\n\nthis bill back from conference in time and that we can be as supportive \nof it as we were of the bill when it passed on May 20.\n  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to be supportive this \nmorning. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     to Calendar No. 165, H.R. 1501, the juvenile justice bill:\n         Trent Lott, Frank H.

The question is now on amendment 1347. The \nSenator from New Hampshire is recognized for up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I yield whatever time he may consume to the \nSenator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. It is \nobvious from the Senate vote we just had that we could only have \ndelayed this process for several days, but we could not have stopped \nthe ultimate result, which would be sending a flawed Senate bill to a \nconference with the House. Since that is the case, I see no reason to \nburn up good will by forcing the Senate to vote again and again with \nthe same result on the various procedural steps that lie before us.\n  If this is where the Senate will ultimately make its stand, I am \nwilling to let the process move forward.\n  However, some may be asking why we even made the attempt to stop this \naction.\n  Sometimes it can be unclear why a Senator cast the vote he or she \ndid.\n  That's especially true for procedural votes like the cloture vote we \njust had.\n  So let me be clear why I voted the way I did--against cloture, \nagainst cutting off the debate on this measure, against moving this \nversion of S. 254 to a conference with the House.\n  It's not because I oppose the juvenile justice bill. Quite the \nopposite: it's because I support good juvenile justice reform.\n  I support the many provisions of this legislation that truly address \ncriminal violence, such as: Making sure violent juveniles are held \naccountable for their criminal actions; providing resources to states \nand localities to combat juvenile crime; toughening enforcement of the \nlaws already on the books; helping communities promote school safety; \nhelping parents and the media do more to limit the exposure of children \nto violence in the entertainment industry.\n  I support these reforms, and I could support the version of juvenile \njustice reform passed by the House.\n  However, the reason I opposed the Senate bill, and why I voted \nagainst cloture just now is because this is not a juvenile justice \nreform measure. It's also a gun control measure.\n  Gun control has nothing to do with stopping youth violence and crime.\n  Gun control of the kind proposed in this bill is not just \nineffective--it is counterproductive because it would cut off lawful \nand beneficial uses of firearms.\n  And what may be the most important thing for anyone watching this \ndebate to understand: gun control is something the House of \nRepresentatives has already said--with a bipartisan vote--it will not \naccept.\n  This is a set-up, folks. The House has said it will not accept gun \ncontrol, and the Clinton-Gore Administration, along with its cronies in \nCongress, have said they won't accept a juvenile justice bill without \ngun control.\n  Does anybody else see a problem here? The problem is obvious. I don't \nsee how the conference committee will fashion a version of juvenile \njustice that both the House and Senate can live with--but I can tell \nyou one thing: whatever comes out of this conference won't have enough \ngun control in it for the Clinton-Gore administration.\n  In fact, I'm going to make a prediction here and now that whatever \nemerges from the conference committee will instantly be criticized--and \nmaybe even threatened with a veto--because it doesn't have enough gun \ncontrol in it for Bill Clinton and Al Gore, and the folks who work with \nhim. That is because they need gun control as a political issue, and \nthey are not interested in juvenile crime unless they have their \npolitical issue along with it.\n\n  I said, folks, that is ``politics,'' and I mean it, plain and simple.\n  Since the day the Senate took its vote, and since the day the House \nhas taken its votes, we have watched the political maneuvering down at \nthe White House and with the Vice President on this issue. Their debate \nisn't about controlling violence and violent youth. It is about a \nnarrow political agenda of the far left.\n  It was a campaign kicked off by the President when he blamed the \nLittleton, Colorado killings on--and I quote from the speech that was \nlater released by the White House and printed on its web page--``the \nhuge hunting and sport shooting culture in America.''\n  What did the hunting culture and the sport-shooting culture in \nAmerica have to do with the killings in Littleton, CO? In the mind of \nthis President and this Vice President, it was politics. It was their \nentry once again into this debate.\n  That's right--the President wasn't talking about the cultural crisis \nthat distresses all of us on all sides of this issue and the breakdown \nof families, the powerlessness of communities, the alienation of young \npeople, the violence and brutality promoted by the entertainment \nindustry.\n  It was all politics narrowly focused. No, what the President chose to \nblame was American hunters and spot shooters.\n  According to the Clinton-Gore administration, those who lawfully \nexercise a right protected by the United States Constitution--those \npeople are responsible for the brutal, senseless killings at Columbine \nHigh School.\n\n[[Page S9452]]\n\n  Shame on you, Mr. President. If you are one of the tens of thousands \nof adult volunteers who have helped train Boy Scouts and other young \npeople in marksmanship, in one of the most successful youth sporting \nprograms in history--according to the President, you're part of the \nproblem.\n  If you take your family on an annual hunting trip, a ``bonding \nexperience'' for yourself and your kids--according to the Clinton-Gore \nadministration, you're part of the problem.\n  If you represented the United States of America in the Olympic \nshooting events, the gun control community wants you to know that \nyou're part of the problem.\n  If you hunt for food to put on your table for your family, according \nto the Clinton and Gore administration, because of Littleton, CO, you \nare part of the problem.\n  But it wasn't enough to insult millions of law-abiding Americans by \naccusing them of responsibility for what happened in Littleton. The \nPresident went a step further to suggest that if these law-abiding \ncitizens don't go along with his gun control agenda and give up more of \ntheir liberty, then they don't care about the lives of children.\n  I find that unbelievable. But that is what was implied very clearly \nby this President--the leader of the free world accusing those who \nuphold the law of being responsible for those who break the law, \naccusing those who would passionately defend their civil liberties as \nbeing bad citizens, accusing those who may have a firearm for the sole \npurpose of recreation or defending themselves and their families, \naccusing these people of not wanting to save children's lives.\n  And since that kickoff back in April, what have we seen?\n  We have seen an all-out public relations campaign headed by the White \nHouse against lawful firearm use.\n  We have seen political candidates of the left trying to outdo each \nother on gun control ideas. It is called have a gun control idea a week \nand somehow it may elect you in November of 2000.\n  Maybe this political campaign is scoring points with the gun control \ncommunity. But I can tell you the people who I have been hearing from--\nthe people outside the Capital Beltway who really have to deal with \nyouth violence in their communities and in their schools--are saying \ngun control misses the point entirely.\n  They are saying the solution to youth violence is far more \ncomplicated than adding one more layer to the 40,000 gun control laws--\n40,000, that is right--that are already on the books.\n\n  They are saying they need real help and real ideas from Washington, \nDC, and not a political placebo for the 2000 election.\n  They are saying it is time to stop pushing political agendas and \nstart pushing a law enforcement crime control agenda.\n  The Senate had a choice today between a bill that focused on juvenile \njustice reform and a bill that serves a political agenda.\n  I think the Senate's vote today has made the job of the conference \ncommittee harder and perhaps impossible.\n  My choice would have been a clean bill that prioritized law \nenforcement and focused on solving the problem of youth violence.\n  That is the kind of bill I hope to see coming out of the conference. \nThat is the kind of bill I will work for coming out of the conference--\nthe kind of bill that I could support and I believe that America wants.\n  They don't want politics in this issue. They want safer schools and \nsafer streets and they want to know their children are safe from \nviolent juveniles who would otherwise make these environments unsafe.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for yielding.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from \nIdaho for his remarks.\n  I say for the Record that I agree with everything he said.\n  Mr. President, we have had a very unusual set of circumstances this \nmorning.\n  We had a vote on an issue involving gun control, yet we don't get to \nspeak until after the vote. Knowing what the result is, it does take \nout a little bit of the steam.\n  As most of my colleagues know, and I think most American people know, \nI have filibustered this bill now for about a week by asking for this \ncloture vote. As Senator Craig said, to simply have dilatory motions \nbetween now and the time this goes to conference makes no sense because \nthe result of this bill going to conference has already been decided by \nthe vote of the Senate.\n  Under this rule, each Senator, myself now being the one on the floor, \nhas an hour to discuss the reason for their vote on this issue. I think \nit is important to discuss it, even though the vote has occurred, \nbecause the American people need to understand what we did. I tried in \na very few brief minutes, thanks to the consideration of the minority \nleader who was kind enough to allow me 3 minutes of his time to do this \nprior to 9:45 when we had the vote, to point out what we were about to \ndo. Apparently not too many people were listening. I will point out \nagain what we did.\n  The House passed H.R. 1501 and sent it here. That is a cultural bill \nthat allows the display of the Ten Commandments in schools. It allows \nindividual religious expression. It allows prayer in school memorial \nservices. It allows faith-based groups to compete for Government \njuvenile justice grants. A good bill.\n  The purpose of that bill was to make a statement about juveniles that \nperhaps the issue is not guns but, rather, a cultural problem in our \nschools that we need to address. It was a well-thought-out bill. When \nthat bill came to the Senate, I tried to get a vote up or down on it. \nBecause of procedures by those who felt the bill should not be passed, \nI could not do it. I was shut out by the so-called legislative tree, a \nparliamentary tree, so I could not offer the bill and get a vote on it.\n  Next comes gun control, the Senate provisions. We have a House bill \nand a Senate bill. The Senate bill imposes strict limits on gun shows. \nIt requires the sale of trigger locks with guns. It puts new limits on \njuvenile gun possession, the kinds of juveniles that Senator Craig \nspoke about, young teenagers who perhaps might go hunting or sports \nshooting. These are needless restrictions on law-abiding American \ncitizens, young and old.\n  I think it is important to understand what has happened. This was \nsubstituted for this as a result of the vote we just had. This bill \nwill go to conference. Someone said quite some time ago: If you saw how \nlaws and sausage were made, you would probably get sick and wouldn't \nwant a part of either.\n  There is a lot of truth to that. I have never had a lot of confidence \nin those who say: We will clean this up in conference, or we will get a \ngood bill out of conference, or let the conferees work their will.\n  We will see what kind of will is worked when this comes back. This is \ngun control, a violation of the second amendment. We voted by 77-22 to \nput more gun control on the American people. Call it what it is. When \nthis comes out of conference, it will have gun control.\n  During the Senate's consideration of S. 254, I was very upset that \nthe gun control lobby in this country took advantage of a terrible \ntragedy. They did a good job of it. This was a very emotional time, a \nhorrible tragedy, and the gun control people used it to the hilt and \nscared off a lot of people.\n  What happened at Littleton was a terrible tragedy. People used this \non the Senate floor and mounted an unprecedented assault on the second \namendment rights of law-abiding American gun owners. Not one law-\nabiding American citizen had anything to do with Columbine, not one. \nNot one law-abiding American citizen, not one gun owner or juvenile who \nis a law-abiding citizen had anything to do with Columbine. They were \nlaw breakers who did that at Columbine. They cast the blame, though, on \nthe law-abiding gun owner, while leaving the movie moguls and video \ngamemakers who promote violence to children unscathed, with no mention. \nThe problem is guns, they said, not the culture.\n  It is interesting that we take prayer and values out of the schools. \nWhat comes in? Violence, drugs, condoms. Hello, America, wake up.\n  It was well done; it was well orchestrated. It scared off enough \npeople. It\n\n[[Page S9453]]\n\nscared off the 19 or so votes we needed to block cloture on this bill. \nThe House did the right thing; we did the wrong thing.\n  We need to take a hard, introspective look at our Nation's culture. \nThat bill did that. This bill does not do that. We see video games \ndesigned for young people that glorify violence. I say to the American \npeople taking a few moments to listen, look at those video games your \nkids are watching. Take a look at what they are watching on the \nInternet. Take a look at some of the movies they are bringing home from \nErol's and watching after you go to bed. Parents might want to take a \nlook and see what is going on in their children's lives.\n  They glorify violence. They invite children to engage in fantasy \nkillings. They never show the opposite. When somebody is shot in one of \nthe video games, they don't mention the fact that the person who was \nkilled may have a family. They don't talk about that. The only thing \nshown is the glorification of violence.\n  We see unconscionably violent movies such as ``The Basketball \nDiaries'' in which killings bear a striking resemblance to the \nLittleton massacre. It doesn't mean every kid who watches that kind of \na movie would do that. Of course it doesn't. Some kids can handle it, \nbut some can't. Why expose children to this?\n  We see music such as that of the so-called Marilyn Manson character \nthat glorifies murder, suicide, sodomy. As a matter of fact, Platinum \nRecords has big sales on those records glorifying murder, suicide, and \nsodomy. Our kids are listening to this in America and we blame guns. We \nblame guns with this vote.\n  We see the marketing of violence in many forms over the Internet. As \nI said, every child is not going to go to school and murder his \nclassmates or his teacher because he watches or plays some video game \nor listens to violent music. Some will be influenced by that culture.\n  I had a shotgun next to my bed for as long as I can remember. At 8 or \n9 years old, I knew how to use it. I was trained to use it in the \nproper way. I never thought about going to school and using it on \nanybody, and neither did my classmates who also had shotguns. I \nremember hearing it said when I grew up that if you read good books, \ngood things might happen. By the same token, if a young person watches \na bad film or plays an evil video game, bad things may happen. Why take \na chance? But it is easier to blame the gun. Blame the gun; blame \nsomebody else. Don't look at what is going on in America. Wake up, \nAmerica, before it is too late.\n  This is the second amendment to the Constitution that we just \nviolated. It is not guns that caused this violence.\n  The first gun came over on a ship probably in 1607. Most likely \nsomebody had a gun coming into Jamestown. For 375 years we had no \nschool shootings, not one. Now we have gun control. In America, we have \n40,000 laws, according to Senator Craig, and now we have school \nshootings. Hello. Anybody listening? What is going on here? Is it guns? \nIf it is, how come we didn't have school shootings for 375 years when \neverybody had a gun?\n  I believe we should take a look at the news media. The news media has \na distressing tendency to engage in sensationalism, the mindless \npursuit of greater ratings. On April 20 this year when the children \ncame tumbling out of Columbine High School with blood on their clothes, \nsome children wounded and crying, what happened? With microphones in \ntheir face, they were asked: What was it like to witness your \nclassmate's death? Did he say anything as he died?\n  What they needed when they came out of that high school, my fellow \nAmericans, was a hug.\n  Do you know what would have really made me feel good? If one of those \nin the news media had laid down the microphone and laid down the camera \nand walked up to one of those kids and put his arms around them or her \narms around them and said, ``I'm sorry. We love you.''\n  But, oh, no, we cannot do that. We have to get right in the face with \nthe microphone and the camera and sensationalize this kind of violence. \nAnd then we blame guns.\n  When are we going to wake up, America, before it is too late? This \nbill addressed this--tried to. You cannot address these kinds of things \nwith laws, but you can at least make an attempt. You take these things \nout of the schools and the kids don't have any choice. They can't pray; \nthey can't talk about values. If somebody gets killed and the teachers \ntry to comfort their kids by saying a prayer, the teacher gets fired. \nAnd we take away guns and blame guns.\n  H.R. 1301 declares that State and local governments have the power to \ndisplay the Ten Commandments on public property. This would allow the \npublic schools to post those Ten Commandments. Does anyone seriously \nargue that the display of the Ten Commandments in a public school \nwouldn't help kids at least think a little bit? They do represent the \nmoral foundation of our entire civilization. Does anybody have a \nproblem with, ``Thou shall not kill?'' Does anybody have a problem \nwith, ``Thou shalt not steal?'' ``Thou shalt not bear false witness?'' \n``Honor thy father and mother?'' Does anybody have a problem with \nthose? Is that going to threaten Western civilization, to put those up \non the wall of the school? Really? Come on.\n  H.R. 1501, this bill, declares that the expression of religious faith \nby individual persons is protected by the Constitution of the United \nStates. This provision would allow greater freedom for individual \nstudents to express their religious faith, whatever it is, as well as \nto organize and participate in student-led religious activities in \npublic school.\n  Does anyone seriously believe that greater religious freedom in the \npublic schools would not improve the cultural environment in these \nschools? We spend more time trying to deny religion and values in our \nschools than we spend with our own kids. Think about it. If we spent as \nmuch time with our kids, loving our kids, as we do trying to deny them \nthese kinds of things, we might have a better America. But let's go \nback and blame guns. That is what we did here; we just blamed guns. We \nput in gun control and substituted it for this.\n  Faith-based organizations can compete for Government grants under \nthis bill. Does anyone doubt that involving faith-based organizations \nin juvenile justice would improve our Nation's juvenile justice system? \nThese cultural approaches to solving the problem of youth violence \noffer great promise. This bill offers great promise. This bill offers \ngun control. This is the coward's way out. This is the ostrich vote. \nPut your head in the sand. Blame the gun. Don't deal with this issue. \nWe wouldn't want to have to do anything as controversial as perhaps \nposting the Ten Commandments in a school.\n  I was disappointed during the Senate's consideration of this bill. I \nwas disappointed, frankly, in some of my conservative colleagues in the \nSenate, some of my pro-gun conservative colleagues in the Senate. I am \ndisappointed. We had a chance to stop this. I spent a great deal of \ntime over the past 2 weeks as we debated S. 254, arguing privately with \nthese colleagues, trying to persuade them to hold the line against this \nonslaught of more gun control.\n\n  Gun shows, do you know what the goal is here? It is not instant \nbackground checks. It is the elimination of gun shows--eliminate the \nshows, don't allow any gun shows. After all, punish the law-abiding \nAmerican who comes to a gun show, as millions do all across America \nevery year. Punish them. That is the easy thing to do. Do not deal with \nthis. Do not deal with the criminal. Punish the people who go to gun \nshows, the law-abiding American citizens.\n  You say, what if somebody, a bad person, gets a gun? Bad people are \nnot going to come and get a gun there; they can get it easier somewhere \nelse. Even if they do, if they commit a crime with it, we put them in \njail and put them away as we do anybody else who commits a crime.\n  I am very disappointed about what the Senate did with respect to \nthese gun shows. It seems evident to me, the practical effect of the \nLautenberg amendment, adopted when Vice President Gore sat in the chair \nand proudly cast the tie-breaking vote: This will ruin the gun shows, \nput them out of business. That is the aim of the amendment, and that is \nthe aim of this legislation that we just substituted in order\n\n[[Page S9454]]\n\nto send it to conference. Everybody says we will get it out in \nconference. We will see about that. Don't hold your breath.\n  I am very concerned about the effects of this so-called trigger lock \namendment. Even though the amendment appears only to require trigger \nlocks to be sold with guns, the legal effect may well do great damage \nto the second amendment rights of law-abiding gun owners because courts \nmay construe the amendment as creating a new civil negligence standard \nunder which gun owners will be seen as having a legal obligation to use \ntheir trigger locks or face legal liability if their gun is misused by \nsome third party. What are we going to create now, a trigger lock \ninspector? ``Knock, knock, knock. Hello, I'm the Government trigger \nlock inspector. I want to see if you have your trigger lock on your \nweapon.''\n  Some people say, no, it doesn't require they put it on their weapon; \nit just requires they buy it. Where is individual and personal \naccountability and responsibility? If you are dumb enough to leave a \nweapon without a trigger lock lying around where a kid can reach it, \nthen you ought not own the gun. But that is personal responsibility and \naccountability. It is not the Government's responsibility. It is \ncertainly not even workable. But maybe it will come to that. We have \nGovernment bureaucrats who do just about everything in America. We \nmight as well have 400,000 or 500,000 trigger lock inspectors, and they \ncan knock on the door, ``Mr. Smith, do you have a gun?'' ``Yes, but I'm \nnot going to give it to you.'' ``Well, I wanted to see whether you have \na trigger lock on your gun.'' It may come to that. Don't laugh.\n  If the law develops such that gun owners have a legal obligation to \nuse these trigger locks, they may be forced to put their safety and \nthat of their families at risk. It is not unreasonable to imagine a \nsingle mother of a small child, depending on her gun for safety, panic \nstricken, struggling unsuccessfully with her trigger lock, at night, \nafter hearing a burglar in the house. If she has no trigger lock, and \nshe has that thing up on a 10-foot shelf, that is her choice. \nThe Government tells her she has to use a trigger lock--or buy a \ntrigger lock she doesn't even need.\n\n  What in the world is happening to this country, to the second \namendment, to the Constitution? It is amazing how we pick some \namendments, such as the first amendment, and say we must protect that \namendment at all costs, but when it comes to the second amendment, no, \nwe can skip that one.\n  These are two examples of the grave harm gun control amendments \nadopted by the Senate would do to second amendment rights. When the \nheat of the moment is gone and the passions so shamelessly stirred up \nby the gun control lobby have subsided, many of those who have \nsupported these amendments will realize they have done the second \namendment serious and lasting harm. But I don't want to see any tears; \nI don't want to hear any whining; I don't want to hear any, ``I'm \nsorry''; I don't want to hear any, ``My gosh, why did I do that? What \nhappened? Where was I when they took the second amendment rights away? \nWhere was I when they took the Constitution?'' I don't want to hear it. \nIt is too late.\n  Great experts have repeatedly shown that criminals do not go to gun \nstores, complete the necessary forms, and leave with legally purchased \nweapons. ``Hello, I'm a criminal. I am going to use my gun tonight in \nan armed robbery. I would like to purchase it, please. Where do I fill \nout the forms?'' Criminals are going to buy their guns on the black \nmarket or they are going to steal them. I have had people tell me flat \nout: I might as well buy the guns on the black market. It is a lot \nsafer to me. The Government doesn't know I have it.\n  That is pretty scary. Gun control has not been shown to reduce crime. \nWashington, DC, where we are now, has the most crime in all America. \nThe only people who own guns in Washington are the criminals. They have \nthem. You cannot have one. You are an honest citizen. But they have \nthem. Crime has really gone down dramatically in Washington, hasn't it? \nGun control has really worked here. Gun control attacks a serious \nproblem from the wrong angle. Sixty million Americans own 200 million \nfirearms. That is a very interesting statistic. Sixty million Americans \nown 200 million firearms, including 60 million handguns.\n  Yet four-tenths of 1 percent of those handguns will be used to commit \na crime. So 99.6 percent of all handguns are used legally; 99.6 \npercent, the good folks; four-tenths of 1 percent, the bad guys. We \nsubstituted S. 254 for H.R. 1501, right here on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Some argue the crime problem is the result of too much personal \nfreedom. It is not personal freedom that is the problem. It is moral \ndecadence. This bill tries to at least help us deal with it. It is \nmoral decadence. It is a cultural, moral problem and it is getting \nworse by the day.\n  We look, in this body, for any excuse--guns, whatever--to look the \nother way. Maybe we will have a bill tomorrow to ban knives and then \nbaseball bats, maybe cars. They kill about 45 million people a year. \nMaybe we ought to ban them.\n  It is a revolving door criminal system. That is what the problem is, \nmoral decadence and a revolving door criminal justice system that puts \nthe average murderer on the street in 7 years. That is right. The \naverage murderer walks out of prison, if he goes to prison--some like \nMr. Simpson never go to prison when they should. Yes, that is right, \nsome like Mr. Simpson never go to prison when they should. But the \naverage murderer in this country, if he goes to jail, serves 7 years \nfor murder. But it is the gun's fault, isn't it? We cannot blame the \njudges, cannot blame the prosecutors, cannot blame the court system. We \nhave to blame guns; blame the peaceful citizen who has the right to own \na gun to protect himself.\n  I am proud I voted the way I did against cloture. I am proud I voted \nfor H.R. 1501 and against S. 254. I am proud to stand up for the second \namendment in the Chamber of the Senate, and I will stand up here again \nand again, year after year, month after month, whatever it takes to \nmake this case because I know I am right, and I am going to continue to \ndo it.\n  When this bill comes out of conference, I am going to filibuster it \nagain for as long as I can. I am going to do everything I can to kill \nit, whatever I can do. I am only one person.\n  In the movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' another Mr. Smith, \nJimmy Stewart, dropped on the floor of the Senate after several hours, \n23 I think. I think he even beat Strom Thurmond, if I am not mistaken, \nin the filibuster. He dropped on the floor of the Senate amongst a pile \nof newspapers. Maybe that is what I have to do. Maybe I will do that. I \ndon't know.\n  I know one thing, S. 254 is wrong and H.R. 1501 is right. I am going \nto fight to preserve, protect, and defend the constitutional right, all \nof the Constitution and all of the constitutional rights of Americans, \nincluding the right to keep and bear arms. Many of us who are veterans \nin the fight to protect the second amendment know the bold and clear \nwords of the second amendment by heart. We cannot say them often enough \nif we are to educate our fellow citizens about the unmistakable meaning \nand intent behind those words of that most besieged provision of the \nBill of Rights.\n  It is pretty clear:\n\n       A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     Arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  Tell me where there is anything in that amendment that allows us to \ndo this under the Constitution of the United States of America? I stood \nright there where the pages are sitting and took the oath twice when I \ncame to the Senate to protect and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates, and that is what I am doing now, and that is what I will \ncontinue to do.\n\n  There is nothing in those words about background checks. There is \nnothing in there about the people having a right to keep and bear \ncertain kinds of arms. There is nothing in there that says handguns can \nbe kept or not kept where shotguns can. Nothing. I sure do not see \nanything in there that gives Congress any leeway whatsoever to infringe \nsecond amendment rights whenever some group of anti-gun zealots think \nwhat they like to call the ``public interest'' requires it. The public \ninterest is to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United\n\n[[Page S9455]]\n\nStates of America. That is what the public interest is and nothing \nelse. You trample on the Constitution; you trample on the public \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 30 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, these \nsolemn words that all of us revere in the second amendment could not be \nmore clear. There is no discussion about what those words mean. I am \nfascinated as the days go by, the more I am in politics, the more I \nread about constitutional scholars making unconstitutional arguments. \nFrankly, I am sick of it. The more recognition these constitutional \nscholars get, the more unconstitutional their arguments get.\n  How can anybody read the second amendment to the Constitution of the \nUnited States and come up with gun control? It is just simply not \npossible to do in any rational way. Yet many of the self-appointed \nleading lights of constitutional law continue to try to throw the \nsecond amendment into oblivion, to throw it on the trash heap. Boy, \nthey are doing a good job.\n  There are 40,000 gun laws already. We can pass a few more and stop \nlaw-abiding Americans from going to gun shows. Let's just keep sitting \nback, America, keep sitting back on your hands--I might use another \nword if I were not on the Senate floor--and let it happen. Don't do \nanything. Don't stand up.\n  You need to start voting, my fellow Americans. You need to start \nlooking at who is doing this to you and to the Constitution of the \nUnited States of America, and you need to start throwing those people \nout of here. That is what you need to do. I do not care with what party \nthey are. It is irrelevant.\n  These are the same legal scholars who find a constitutional right to \nabortion, to solicitation, to contributions, to expression, to travel, \nto privacy, and to a wall of separation between church and state, none \nof which are mentioned anywhere in the text of that hallowed document. \nNowhere. But, oh, they find it. Abortion, where is that in the \nConstitution?\n  I do not know if the scholars have read what our founders have said, \nbut somehow I think it is reasonable to accept the premise that those \nwho wrote the Constitution might have known what they were talking \nabout; maybe they knew what they intended; maybe they knew what they \nintended since they wrote the document.\n  It is interesting to read some of their words on the second \namendment. I am not sure the scholars have read them. If they have, \nthey are not listening. I have read them. Let me quote a few.\n  The father of the Constitution, James Madison, made absolutely clear \nwhat the second amendment means. Mr. Madison declared that the \nConstitution preserves ``the advantage of being armed[,] which \nAmericans possess over the people of almost every other Nation. . . .''\n  Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence, put it \nthis way. Because of the second amendment, Jefferson proclaimed: ``No \nfree man shall ever be debarred the use of arms.''\n  Another Founding Father, George Mason of Virginia, upon whose \nVirginia Bill of Rights the Federal Bill of Rights was based, explained \nthat the second amendment means that the militia shall ``consist now of \nthe whole people, except a few public officials.''\n  The whole people will now have the right in the case of tyranny to go \nto their homes and pick up their arms and protect themselves. That is \nthe purpose of the second amendment. It is not about sport shooting. It \nis not about hunting. It is about protection, the right of a person to \nprotect himself or herself from tyranny, from enemies.\n  Sadly, the modern day enemies of the second amendment choose to \nignore what the founders said. I do not think they chose to ignore \nit. I think they deliberately ignored it. They knew exactly what they \nwere doing.\n\n  They are trampling on the Constitution--it is a design--and the \nAmerican people are going to sit back until it is too late--not if I \nhave anything to do about it; not as long as I have a voice; and as \nlong as I can stand on the Senate floor I am going to stop it.\n  Today they are unrelenting in their attacks on the second amendment, \nand they have a big advantage. They have a huge advantage because they \nhave the major news media solidly on their side.\n  I am not much on polls, but it would be interesting to take a little \npoll to find out how many of the news media pack a little sidearm \nsomewhere to protect themselves in their homes. Do you want to take any \nbets?\n  More than 6 years ago, I was driving to work, coming in here to \nWashington. I did not have a gun on my person because I am traveling in \nWashington, DC, where by law I am not allowed to have one. I did not \nthink it would look good for a Senator to break the law. I do not like \nthat law. I witnessed two people murdered in front of my eyes before \nthe CIA.\n  When I got back to Washington, the press found out I had witnessed \nthe murder, and the first question was not: Is your son OK? I just \ndropped him off at school 2 minutes before down the road. Not: How is \nyour son? Is he OK? Is he handling it all right? Not: How are you? Are \nyou OK? No. That was not the first question. That was not the second, \neither.\n  The first question was: Have you now changed your position on gun \ncontrol? I witnessed a murder 20 minutes, 30 minutes before. That was \nthe first question: Well, Senator, you're a conservative Republican, \npro-gun. Have you now changed your position on the second amendment? I \nsaid: No, I have not. I wish I had had a gun. I might have saved two \npeople from being killed by an individual standing in the middle of a \nhighway with an AK-47 weapon, shooting innocent people in their cars.\n  Time and time again, the media has asked me the same question about \nthat very incident. The obsessive focus of those questions on gun \ncontrol demonstrates how much the media is in the back pockets of the \nanti-gun zealots. And they are. They are working together. Frankly, \nthey are winning, if you want my honest opinion. They won here today. \nThey won again. Time and time again--again and again and again--we \ntrample on the Constitution of the United States of America.\n  You know what I said to the media? We ought to stop worrying about \nthe terrorist's gun and start worrying about tracking him down, trying \nhim, convicting him, and getting rid of him so he can never do it \nagain. Finally, after several years, he was tracked down. He was \nconvicted. He is now on death row.\n  The man who committed those murders outside the CIA was an alien \nterrorist who fled overseas. In thinking about the right to keep and \nbar arms in international terms, I find a certain irony. We live in a \ntime in which nearly all of the totalitarian communist regimes, which \nkept all of the guns in the hands of the government and out of the \nhands of the people they tyrannized, have collapsed--almost all but not \nall. Yet their utterly discredited philosophy of gun control still \nfinds a great number of sympathizers and supporters in the world's \noldest democracy.\n  Two of my close friends escaped Castro's Cuba in the late 1950s, \nearly 1960s. The first thing Castro did when he took over was go door \nto door, house to house, literally, confiscating every weapon he could \nget. Because once he did that, his people were defenseless, and he knew \nit.\n\n  It is interesting: Tyrannical governments taking our guns; Members of \nthe Senate and the media taking our guns. A bitter irony, isn't it?\n  Seen in the light of the second amendment's wording, and the meaning \nof that provision of the Constitution, as illuminated by the comments \nof our Nation's founders, it is clear to me that the gun control \namendments to S. 254 that were adopted by the Senate are a serious \nattack on the second amendment rights of all Americans.\n  The cloture vote we just took bringing debate on this bill to a \nclose--which is what cloture is--shows where the votes are in the \nSenate. The Senate has sided with gun control, and they went against \nthe cultural approach.\n  You are not going to cut down a big tree by snipping the leaves off \nof it. We are not going to solve this problem with gun control. We are \ngoing to solve this problem when we understand here in America that we \nhave some severe cultural and moral problems.\n  We need to put values back in schools. We need to put God back in\n\n[[Page S9456]]\n\nschools. We need to allow kids to have the right to pray and the right \nto talk about these things with their teachers so their teachers do not \nhave to worry about being fired for giving comfort.\n  A teacher in, I believe, New York was fired. When her children were \nagonizing over the fact that one of their classmates had died, and she \noffered to have them say a little prayer to comfort them, she was \nfired. The same people who advocated her firing support gun control.\n  I sought an opportunity to offer an amendment. I wanted to have a \nvote on H.R. 1501. I was not allowed to get it. All I wanted was a \nvote. I wanted the House bill. I wanted the Senate to be on record as \nto whether or not they supported this alternative, H.R. 1501, or this \nalternative, S. 254.\n  I stand right here at the desk of Daniel Webster. Webster was in many \ndebates at this desk in the Old Senate Chamber. He was born in New \nHampshire and represented New Hampshire in the Congress; and in a \nmoment, I guess, when he wasn't thinking properly he moved to \nMassachusetts, and he represented Massachusetts in the Senate. But this \ndesk now for evermore belongs to the senior Senator from New Hampshire.\n  I can imagine what Webster would think and say in the great eloquence \nthat he was able to deliver so many times on the floor of the Senate at \nthis desk. I think about it often. But I can imagine what he might have \nthought had he been here in this debate this morning, after a vote, \nwith a bunch of rules that nobody put in the Constitution, with us \ngetting a chance to say why it was a bad vote. I wonder what Webster \nwould have said. Those are the rules.\n  I wonder also what he would have said if he knew we took away part of \nthe second amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens--probably \nthe same thing he would have said if we tried to take the first \namendment rights away or any other rights away under the Constitution. \nHe would be appalled.\n  I am devastated by this vote personally because I have traveled all \nover America these past 2 years, and I know what is in the hearts of \nmost of the American people out there because I have talked to them \none-on-one, literally one-on-one, from California to Maine, to Florida, \nto Alabama. You name it, I have probably been in the State. And they \nare disgusted with what we do here. I am a Member of this body. I am \nnot criticizing colleagues, but they get so sick and tired of it, \nwatching the Constitution get trampled on, watching their taxes go up, \nwatching their rights being taken away, watching 35 million of their \nfellow citizens aborted and murdered.\n\n  When we talk about culture, what do we tell the shooters in Columbine \nand the kids who do these terrible things? We say, go to school today, \nbe good kids, and while you are gone, we will abort your brothers and \nyour sisters--35 million of them since 1973. We just can't continue to \ndo this. It will be business as usual. We will kill another 30 million \nover the next 25 years. It won't stop.\n  It is not going to stop, and this isn't going to stop, until the \nAmerican people understand fully what is happening. When they do, \nhopefully, they are going to change the Government and get us back to \nthe Constitution of the United States. That is what we swore to uphold, \nthat is what we took the oath to defend, and that is what we ought to \ndo: Defend it and support it. Anything less than that, I don't care if \nit is the 2nd amendment, the 4th amendment, the 16th amendment, the \n22nd amendment, or the body of the Constitution itself, we should \ndefend it all, because that is what we are here for.\n  It is with great sadness and regret that I have to say to the \nAmerican people, you lost today. The second amendment today took \nanother hit, and it will continue to take more until we finally realize \nthat enough is enough and we are going to change the people who do this \nto us time and time again. I hope it happens before it is too late \nbecause once we lose the Constitution and respect for it, we lose \nAmerica.\n  I had a citizen tell me--I will not mention the name, for obvious \nreasons--just recently, about a week ago, that he talked to a high-\nranking Member in the House of Representatives. I will leave it at \nthat. That high-ranking Member said, in a discussion with that \nindividual: ``The Constitution is nothing but a piece of paper.''\n  If that is true, there is not much hope. The last hope for America is \nthe American people. It is not the Senate; it is not the House; it is \nnot the White House; it is the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to claim time to speak on this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may speak up to 1 hour.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer my support to both the majority and \nthe minority leaders in their ongoing efforts to get the juvenile \njustice bill to conference. I believe it is about time. I was an \noriginal cosponsor of the juvenile justice bill and helped write the \ngang abatement provisions of that bill. These provisions are really \ndesigned to provide a helping Federal hand to State and local \ngovernments for those gangs, criminal gangs, who are now crossing State \nlines and illegally conducting criminal activities in various States \nall across this great country.\n  Both Houses of Congress passed this legislation weeks ago. There are \na few commonsense measures, targeted and precise, that provide some \nregulation of firearms in this country. They are not sweeping, they are \nactually rather small, yet they have become the focus of debate and \nstopped a good bill from moving further. The issue of the bill has \nremained essentially in legislative purgatory, and the will of the \nCongress and the American people has so far been denied.\n  I will speak for a moment about the few so-called gun pieces that are \nin this bill. The first is a bill by Senator Ashcroft in the Senate \nwhich essentially says that juveniles can't possess or buy an assault \nweapon, assault weapons which were created for military use to kill \nlarge numbers of people in close combat--that is the purpose of these \nweapons, clearly. They were not made for civilian defensive purposes. \nIt is a no-brainer to say that juveniles shouldn't be able to buy them \nor possess them.\n  Secondly, trigger locks should be put on weapons sold to the American \npublic. We know they can be. We know they are not costly, and we know \nthey will save lives in instances such as the one that happened a few \nweeks ago, when a youngster 8 years old picked up a gun, playing a war \ngame with a 7-year-old, and shot the 7-year-old, not knowing the gun \nwas loaded. Again, a no-brainer. Why not sell a gun with a trigger lock \nif it is going to save innocent lives?\n  Thirdly, we would close certain gun show loopholes. Does anyone in \nAmerica really believe that a juvenile should be able to go to a gun \nshow and, unidentified, surreptitiously, buy a gun and not even have a \nbackground check? I don't think so.\n  Finally, I authored a piece of legislation which to me was another \nno-brainer. We have in prior legislation prohibited American \nmanufacturers from making the big banana clips, large ammunition-\nfeeding devices, some of them as large as 250 rounds, which are used in \nthe so-called grievance killings, 9 of which have taken place in high \nschools all across this great country in recent years.\n  That is the law of the land. You can't make them domestically. You \ncan't sell those that are made domestically, and you can't possess \nthem, if they were made following the assault weapons legislation which \nbecame part of the crime bill in 1994.\n  There is a loophole. The loophole is that they can be imported to \nthis country. Last year alone, from almost 20 different countries, 11.4 \nmillion large-capacity, ammunition-feeding devices, over 50,000 of them \nof more than 250 rounds, came into this country. The President couldn't \nstop it by executive order; we had to legislate; and, in fact, we did. \nTwenty Republicans voted for this. We had 59 votes in the Senate. The \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee moved it as an amendment on \nthe floor, which was passed by unanimous consent in the House.\n\n[[Page S9457]]\n\n  I will talk more about that in a moment because something rather \ndastardly has happened to it.\n  At Columbine High School earlier this year, 13 innocent children died \nfrom gunshot wounds. We were all horrified. Since that time, dozens, if \nnot hundreds, of other children across this Nation have also died from \ngunshot wounds. Congress has done nothing to solve the problem, no \nmeasures to try to prevent this from happening in the future.\n  On August 16, the children of Columbine will return to the very \nschool that witnessed one of the worst incidents of gun violence this \nNation has ever seen. When they return, they are going to be asking \nthemselves, their parents, their teachers, and even us a lot of \nquestions:\n  What has been done to make our school safer?\n  Is it harder for kids to get guns today?\n  What has Congress done to help us?\n  And who is really trying to make a difference?\n  Many of those same children came here from Littleton this month, and \nthey asked us those same questions. I believe their questions went \nlargely unanswered.\n  The children received assurances from leadership on both sides of the \naisle that Congress is working hard to reduce or eliminate future \nschool shootings and that Members of Congress sympathized with them and \nwould do anything they could to help. But as one child from Littleton \nput it bluntly: ``It is one thing for them to say they sympathize with \nour pain; it is quite another to look down a gun barrel and think that \nmaybe you are going to die.''\n\n  This was from a girl just 17 years old, but a girl forced to grow up \nvery quickly after the events of this past year. This is what the issue \nis all about--the boys and girls out there who fear for their lives \nevery day because of gun violence.\n  I have asked fourth graders in California schools what is their \ngreatest fear. Do you know what it is? Getting shot on the way to \nschool.\n  Yet still we wait and we do nothing.\n  We spent more than a week in this body debating and voting on dozens \nof provisions to stem the tide of youth violence in this country, and--\nas much as some would still refuse to accept it--to curb the flood of \nguns reaching criminals and children.\n  This debate isn't all about just controlling guns. I think this \ndebate really has three pertinent parts to it: One, improving \nparenting. Parents need to spend more time with their children. They \nneed to set limits and they need to see that they are observed. They \nneed to spend a lot of time with the young people. This has become less \nand less in a world that requires two parents to work. That is one \nthing--better parenting.\n  There is a second thing. Youngsters left alone are more often more \ndependent on media than I was when I was raised. In my younger days, \nthere wasn't even television, believe it or not. Today, media is \nsurrounded by a culture of violence--even video games. So youngsters \nare much more exposed to violence today than I was when I was growing \nup in this country.\n  Third, the Nation is awash in guns. These three things make a very \ncombustible mix, and we need to deal with it.\n  But still we wait and we do nothing.\n  The delays have come in many forms, as I have said--political \nmaneuvering, parliamentary tactics, and others. Just recently, in a \nvirtually unprecedented move, anti-gun control forces in the House of \nRepresentatives raised a last-minute ``blue slip'' challenge to the \namendment I just spoke about, which would stop the importation of these \nbig clips--over 11 million of them last year.\n  It is my understanding this may have been the first time in history \nthat such a challenge was raised to an amendment under Title 18, the \ncriminal code. The first time in history--but that didn't stop the NRA \nor its supporters in this Congress.\n  The clear goal of this amendment, and of the overwhelming majority of \nMembers in both Houses of Congress who voted for it, is to keep those \nforeign-made, high-capacity ammunition clips off our streets and out of \nthe hands of children and criminals. That is the intent. You can't use \nthem for hunting. They are not good for defensive purposes. They are \noffensive in their use.\n  For most people, stopping these big clips from flowing into our \ncountry and into the hands of children and criminals is simply common \nsense. But not for the NRA. They have tried to kill this measure for \nyears. They supported the loophole in the first place. This most recent \nattempt, the blue slip challenge, popped up at the last minute--after \nthe amendment had passed the Senate, after it had passed the House \nunanimously, and after we had already waited for weeks for a conference \nto start the juvenile justice bill.\n  Essentially, the challenge raised to the bill involves the \nconstitutional prerogatives of the House of Representatives to \noriginate all revenue bills. Several Members of the House argue that \nbecause the importation of large-capacity, ammunition-feeding devices \ncreates some revenue for the Treasury, the prohibition of such \nimportation would cost us money, and thus the entire juvenile justice \nbill becomes a revenue bill. Because no similar measure was in the \nHouse bill, it was proclaimed that the Senate had illegally originated \na revenue bill. After little debate and much misinformation, the House \nvoted to send the juvenile justice bill back to the Senate so that we \ncould remove the clip provision.\n\n  I don't believe such action was warranted, and I would have liked an \nopportunity to make my case before the vote took place, but there \nwasn't time. In the end, I had little choice, and I picked up the \ntelephone and called the Speaker of the House of Representatives, who \nwas most gracious. He took my call. He said he did not want to kill the \nclip ban. He did not believe the House of Representatives--the \nmajority--wanted to kill the clip ban, and he would support its \nreinstitution. I then called the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthe very distinguished Henry Hyde of Illinois, and he had made the clip \nban amendment on the floor, which passed unanimously in separate \nlegislation. He said he was supportive of the clip ban. He said he \nwould move to put it back in conference and that he believed a \nconference committee that he would appoint on the House side would \nsupport its reinstitution into the bill.\n  Put plainly, we were sideswiped, and we were given no time to \nrecover. But make no mistake, the juvenile justice bill is not a \nrevenue bill, and this challenge, I believe, was simply an attempt to \nfurther delay the will of the American people.\n  I want to explain why I don't believe the clip import ban is a \nrevenue measure, as it is meant by the Constitution, despite what the \nHouse Parliamentarian has said. I want to put my views on the record in \nthe hope that this type of cynical maneuver won't happen again in the \nfuture.\n  I am not a constitutional scholar, but to me, this is simple common \nsense. In my view, the mere fact that a small part of a very large bill \nmay incidentally effect some revenue doesn't make the bill a revenue \nbill. The Constitution states that all bills for raising revenue shall \noriginate in the House. This has been interpreted to mean all bills \naffecting revenue, I guess, because although the clip ban does not \nraise revenue, it does affect revenue in a small way by causing the \nTreasury to lose the proceeds from a 4.2-percent tariff on ammunition \nclips that are used in certain types of firearms--I believe, handguns.\n  I don't believe the intent of this constitutional provision was to \nprevent the Senate from ever passing a bill that somehow affects \nrevenue. After all, almost everything we do, in some way, affects \nrevenue. We constantly pass bills establishing or eliminating fees. We \nput new requirements on the executive branch that will clearly lead to \nincreased costs. We establish programs that will bring extra money to \nthe Treasury in ways many people find hard to imagine. Our Founding \nFathers wanted the House to originate legislation that raises taxes, \nand that I understand and concur with. But I don't believe they meant \nfor the House to originate every bill in Congress, which would be the \nlogical extension of the arguments made during this very short debate.\n  The juvenile justice bill was clearly not a bill for raising revenue, \nand neither was the clip ban amendment\n\n[[Page S9458]]\n\nitself. The juvenile justice bill was a bill to stop crime. The clip \nban was an amendment to eliminate large-capacity, ammunition-feeding \ndevices from our streets. Any revenue affect was incidental, and any \nclaim to the contrary is simply mistaken.\n\n  In fact, the revenue effect of this bill was so incidental that \nnobody even realized that tariffs would be lost until a few short weeks \nago. Not when the amendment came to the Senate floor and passed. Not \nwhen the amendment came to the House floor and passed. Not during the \ndays and weeks that the juvenile justice bills sat on the calendar.\n  Only when the pressure was finally getting too great--only when the \nSenate Majority leader and the House Speaker promised conferees that \nweek--only then did this issue come up for the first time, at the very \nlast minute, before a rushed vote.\n  Mr. President, in at least two Supreme Court cases--U.S. versus Munoz \nin 1990 and another as far back as 1897--the Court has held that \n``revenue bills are those that levy taxes in the strict sense of the \nword, and are not bills for other purposes which may incidentally \ncreate revenue.''\n  Clearly, Mr. President, the juvenile justice bill is not a bill that \nlevies taxes ``in the strict sense of the word,'' but rather it is \nprecisely the type of bill the Supreme Court agrees is not a revenue \nbill--one that is, and I quote it again, ``for other purposes which may \nincidentally'' affect revenue.\n  Unfortunately, the House of Representatives never had a chance to \nreview those Court cases, because this issue came up so quickly.\n  In the end, whether or not a Senate bill is a revenue bill boils down \nto the opinion of a majority of House Members, and those Members have \nspoken by returning the juvenile justice bill to us for correction. But \nI firmly believe that if the House had been given an opportunity to \nstudy the facts and review the precedent, the outcome would have been \ndifferent. Instead, the issue was rushed, the debate cut off, and the \noutcome predetermined.\n  I can only hope that we have now overcome the remaining hurdles and \nwe can quickly move to conference on these bills, because we are \nrunning out of time.\n  With fewer than 8 legislative days left before the children of \nColumbine High go back to school, the future of this bill rests \nsquarely with the Republican leadership in both the House and Senate. \nThey have said they want to make progress with our gun laws, and they \nnow have it within their power to do so.\n  I am encouraged that it now appears that the logjam has been broken, \nbut the inventive and imaginative delays we have faced so far leave me \nwary of future shenanigans.\n  The question is, Will those who claim to support reasonable gun \ncontrol finally put their money where their mouths are, or will they \ncontinue to use unprecedented parliamentary maneuvering to avoid the \nissue and give the NRA its very own Christmas in July?\n  I, for one, certainly hope that the American people win out, and I \nthank the majority leader for getting this process moving.\n  I also would like to extend my thanks to the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives and the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for their \nsupport. Chairman Hyde was very supportive of the assault weapons \nlegislation, which was moved as an amendment to the crime bill in 1994, \nand his integrity has remained strong and unchallenged in that regard.\n  That is the one confidence that I have that this clip ban has a \nchance to fly once again. That rests on the integrity of the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, which I believe is unblemished, and also on \nthe Speaker of the House of Representatives, both of whom have given me \ntheir firm assurances.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we have another opportunity to \nproceed to conference on the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill. Or \ntoday we can be delayed, again, by those who prefer no action and no \nconference to moving forward on the issues of juvenile violence and \ncrime.\n  I came to the floor this Monday and last Wednesday to demonstrate the \nseriousness with which Senate Democrats take the matters included in S. \n254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.\n  On Monday the majority leader was able to vitiate the cloture vote \nthat had been scheduled and proceed to take up the House juvenile \njustice bill, H.R. 1501. He then offered amendment number 1344 to \ninsert the text of S. 254, the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill that \npassed the Senate after two weeks of open debate and after significant \nimprovements on May 20, by a strong bipartisan vote of 73-25. In so \ndoing, he struck Title VII of the Senate bill, which contained the \namendment on the import ban for high capacity ammunition clips.\n  It was this provision that the House used to justify its decision to \nreturn S. 254 to the Senate on the ground that it contains what they \nconsider a ``revenue provision'' that did not originate in the House. \nThis, too, is consistent with the unanimous consent request that I \nfirst propounded last Wednesday and that the Majority Leader sought \nlast Thursday.\n  I trust that once we obtain cloture on substituting the Senate bill \nfor the House text, which is standard practice before seeking a \nconference, that the Majority Leader will move to instruct the \nconferees to reinsert the language that has been omitted from the \nSenate text to cure the technical objection of the House. That, too, \nwould be consistent with the unanimous consents previously sought.\n  We will then be in position to have the Senate request the long-\ndelayed conference and appoint its conferees.\n  One week ago, I took the extraordinary step of propounding a \nunanimous consent request to move the Senate to a House-Senate \nconference. I talked to the Majority Leader and the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee in advance of making the unanimous consent request. \nI noted the history of this measure and the need to move to conference \nexpeditiously if we are to have these programs in place before school \nresumes in the fall in the course of my colloquy with the Majority \nLeader last week.\n  Two weeks ago, Republican leaders of the House and Senate were \ntalking about appointing conferees by the end of that week. Instead, \nthey took no action to move us toward a House-Senate conference but, \ninstead, were moving us away from one. By propounding the unanimous \nconsent last week, I was trying on behalf of congressional Democrats, \nto break the logjam. The unanimous consent would have cured the \nprocedural technicality and would have resulted in the Senate \nrequesting a conference and appointing conferees without further delay.\n  While I regret that Republican objection was made to my request last \nWednesday, I thank the majority leader for the steps he is taking. \nSenate Democrats have been ready to go to conference. Unfortunately, \nobjection from the other side of the aisle has extended the normal \nprocess from literally seconds into days and possibly weeks before we \ncan conference this important matter.\n  Today, the Senate takes the second step outlined in my unanimous \nrequest, moving toward substituting the Senate bill for the text sent \nto us by the House. Senators can cooperate in taking the additional \nsteps outlined in my consent request to get to a conference and the \nSenate could proceed to appoint its conferees and request a conference \nwithout further delay, even today.\n  Alternatively, Senators can exercise their procedural rights to \nobstruct each step of the way and require a series of cloture petitions \nand votes. I hope that in the interests of school safety and enacting \nthe many worthwhile programs in the Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill, \nthey will begin to cooperate. The delay is costing us valuable time to \nget this juvenile justice legislation enacted before school resumes \nthis fall.\n  I spoke to the Senate before the July 4th recess about the need to \npress forward without delay on this bill. I regret that it is beginning \nto look like I will be repeating that speech again as we approach the \nAugust recess and maybe even into September.\n  I have contrasted the inaction on the juvenile justice bill with the \nswift movement on providing special legal protections to certain \nbusiness interests. In just a few months, big business\n\n[[Page S9459]]\n\nsuccessfully lobbied for the passage of legislation to protect \nthemselves against any accountability for actions or losses their \nproducts may cause to consumers. This week the Senate is moving rather \nbriskly on corporate welfare and other proposals.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle are dragging their feet and now \nactively obstructing the House and Senate from moving to appoint \nconferees on the juvenile justice bill that can make a difference in \nthe lives of our children and families. New programs and protections \nfor school children could be in place when school resumes this fall. \nThe Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill is a firm and significant step in \nthe right direction. The passage of this bill shows that when this body \nrolls up its sleeves and gets to work, we can make significant \nprogress. But that progress will amount to naught if the House and \nSenate do not conference and proceed to final passage on a good bill.\n  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned this \nsummer about school violence over the last two years and worried about \nthe situation they will confront this fall. Each one of us wants to do \nsomething to stop this violence. There is no single cause and no single \nlegislative solution that will cure the ill of youth violence in our \nschools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do \nour part. It is unfortunate that the Senate is not moving full speed \nahead to seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile \njustice legislation.\n  I want to be assured that after the hard work we all put into \ncrafting a good juvenile justice bill, that we can go to a House-Senate \nconference that is fair, full, and productive. We have worked too hard \nin the Senate for a strong bipartisan juvenile justice bill to simply \nshrug our shoulders when a narrow minority in the Senate would rather \nwe do nothing. I urge all Senators to work to make today the day that \nwe finally can request the overdue House-Senate conference on the \nHatch-Leahy juvenile justice bill.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hope and expect that cloture will be \ninvoked shortly. It is my understanding that we will then proceed to \nthe appointment of conferees for the juvenile crime bill, which is \nsomething I have been working on with the majority leader for some \ntime. I commend the leader for his commitment to this bill, and I thank \nmy colleague from New Hampshire for allowing the Senate to work its \nwill.\n  I appreciate the arguments my colleagues have made and agree with \nmuch of what they said. But, in the end, the Senate and House have \npassed different juvenile crime bills, and it is a conference \ncommittee's task to reconcile those differences. It will be a difficult \nchallenge since the Senate has an obligation to advocate for its \nposition. Yet--at the same time--we must recognize that the House \npassed a bill which contains different cultural reform proposals, less \nspending, and no gun control provisions. In fact, the House defeated a \nseparate gun control bill.\n  We must do our best to reconcile these bills. In the end, I hope and \ntrust that this conference committee will produce a vehicle that the \nHouse, the Senate, and the President can support. If, however, some in \npositions of leadership and responsibility are unwilling to search for \ncommon ground and are content to simply politicize this issue, the \nchange to do something meaningful for our Nation's children may slip \nthrough our hands. I hope that does not happen and I hope that we can \ncome together for the sake of our children.\n  I want to say yet again that this is one of the most important bills \nthat Congress will consider this year. The Judiciary Committee has \nworked on juvenile crime legislation for more than two years. The \ncommittee marked up the predecessor to S. 254 for nearly two months \nlast Congress. And as you are aware, the Senate spend 2 full weeks this \nspring debating S. 254.\n  In 1997, juveniles accounted for nearly one-fifth of all criminal \narrests in the United States. Juveniles committed 13.5 percent of all \nmurders, more than 17 percent of all rapes, nearly 30 percent of all \nrobberies, and 50 percent of all arsons. In particular, schools are \nbecoming more and more dangerous. Fifteen percent of students have \nreported being victimized at school. Additionally, more than half of \nthe Nation's public schools have reported that a crime had been \ncommitted on the premises.\n  Sadly, the killings at Columbine High School last Spring are not an \nisolated event. Similar shootings have occurred in recent years at \nschools in Pearl, Mississippi, which left two dead, West Paducah, \nKentucky, which left three dead, Jonesboro, Arkansas, which left five \ndead, Edinboro, Pennsylvania, which left one dead, and Springfield, \nOregon, which left two dead.\n  S. 254 provides an infusion of funds to state and local authorities \nto combat juvenile crime and youth violence. While juvenile crime is \nlargely a state and local issue, the federal government can play a \nvaluable role in assisting the States fight juvenile crime and violence \nthrough flexible block grants. S. 254 provides $1 billion a year to the \nStates to fight juvenile crime and prevent juvenile delinquency. \nSpecifically, S. 254 includes a $450 million juvenile accountability \nincentive block grant to the States. States can use this grant to \nimplement graduated sentencing sanctions; build detention facilities \nfor juvenile offenders; drug test juvenile offenders upon arrest; and \nrequire juvenile offenders to complete school or vocational training, \namong other reforms. S. 254 also includes the ``juvenile Brady'' \nprovision, which prohibits the possession of a firearm by persons who \ncommit a violent felony as a juvenile and $75 million annually to help \nStates upgrade juvenile felony records and provide school officials \naccess to such juvenile felony records in appropriate circumstances. In \naddition, S. 254 provides more than $500 million annually to the States \nfor prevention programs, some of which are specifically targeted toward \ngangs in schools, and it extends the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund \nthrough 2005 to ensure adequate funding of administration of justice \nprograms.\n  In closing, I hope that we can proceed to the appointment of \nconferees. This will give us the opportunity to accomplish a great deal \nover the August recess, and I believe that it will allow us to approve \na conference report the week after Labor Day. It would be fitting for \nCongress to wrap up this historic juvenile crime legislation when \nAmerica's children are returning to school from the summer recess.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be agreed to, the remaining amendments be withdrawn, the bill \nbe advanced to third reading and passage occur, all without intervening \naction or debate.\n  I further ask consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, \nrequest a conference with the House, the conferees be instructed to \ninclude the above described amendment No. 343 in the conference report, \nand the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Amendment (No. 1344) was agreed to.\n  The Amendment (Nos. 1345, 1346, 1347, and 1348) were withdrawn.\n  The Amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1501), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  (The text of the amendment No. 1344 was printed in the Record of \nMonday, July 26, 1999.)\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Hutchinson) appointed Mr. Hatch, Mr. \nThurmond, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. Kennedy conferees on the \npart of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. Before I go to the next unanimous consent request, I again \nexpress my appreciation for the patience and for the cooperation of \nSenator Smith in working through this process.\n  Personally, I believe very strongly that we need to have a good \njuvenile justice bill, which includes a lot of very important \nprovisions with regard to how we try juveniles who commit crime, how we \nincarcerate them, how we deal with school security, including metal \ndetectors. It also has programs included for alcohol and drug abuse, \nand it has some values provisions in it.\n  The House has passed a good bill which did not include the gun \nprovisions. I hope this will be a juvenile justice bill when it comes \nback from conference.\n  I do think the right thing to do is to go to conference. I appreciate \ncooperation in making that happen.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9460-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S9460]]\n               DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate begin consideration of \nthe reconciliation bill, which is the Tax Relief Act, and that the \nfirst 3 hours of debate be equally divided in the usual form for \npurposes of opening statements only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1429) to provide for reconciliation pursuant to \n     section 104 of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2000.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 30 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I don't think there is any parent who hasn't had the \nexperience of sending a child into a store with a $20 bill to buy a \ncarton of milk, a loaf of bread, or perhaps a dozen eggs, and the child \nreturns with the few essentials. In a demonstration of maturity and \nresponsibility, the child returns the change to his or her parent. \nThere is no question who the change belongs to. After all, the parent \nearned the money; it is needed to support the family; the family will \ncertainly have important uses for it later. The child understands this. \nSo does the parent. Most often, the change is returned to the household \nbudget to take care of other important needs.\n  Washington needs to demonstrate the same responsibility when it comes \nto determining what to do with the change that is left over from \nrunning the government. There are surplus revenues in the Treasury. As \nwith a child emerging from the grocery store, there is change--big \nchange--left over after Congress has met the necessities of running \ngovernment.\n  In trying to balance the budget in 1997, Congress miscalculated the \nrevenues that would be generated by the economy. At the same time, the \nhard work, the thrift, investment, and risk-taking of Americans \ncombined to create an unexpected windfall of revenue. Now the question \nWashington seems to be grappling with concerns who rightly deserves the \nwindfall. It is a question any parent or child can answer. American \nfamilies, those who created the wealth in the first place, those who \nneed their precious resources to meet future basic needs at home, are \nrightly entitled to the revenues they have earned, revenues Washington \ndid not plan for to meet the expense of government, from which \nWashington had budgeted.\n  Now, as the child returning change for the $20, we must hand back the \nmoney. We must do it in a broad-based way that is fair to those who \nprovided the funds to Washington in the first place. We must do it \nthrough broad-based tax relief that helps individuals and families at \nall income levels meet real needs.\n  The broad-based tax relief plan that passed out of the Finance \nCommittee with bipartisan support will do just that. It will benefit \nnearly every working American. It will help restore equity to the Tax \nCode and provide American families with the resources they need to meet \npressing concerns. It will help individuals and families save for self-\nreliance and retirement. It will help parents prepare for educational \ncosts. It will give the self-employed and underinsured the boost they \nneed to pay for health insurance. It will begin to restore fairness to \nthe Tax Code by eliminating the marriage tax penalty.\n  Let me state exactly how the plan works and why it has received \nbipartisan support. This tax cut package will provide broad relief by \nreducing the 15-percent tax bracket that serves as the baseline for all \ntaxpayers to 14 percent. In other words, no matter which tax bracket a \nfamily may be in, by cutting the 15-percent bracket, everyone will \nbenefit as they will pay 14 percent on their first portion of taxable \nincome. At the same time, this plan expands the 14 percent bracket, \ndropping millions of Americans who are now paying taxes at 28 percent \ndown to the lower bracket.\n\n  For a middle-income family of four, these two changes will mean a tax \nsavings of over $450 a year. And these provisions have already found \nbipartisan support.\n  To restore equity to the Tax Code, this plan targets another \nbipartisan objective by eliminating the marriage tax penalty. For too \nlong, husbands and wives who have worked and paid taxes have been \npenalized by their dual incomes. I have heard of some couples who have \nactually chosen not to marry because of the tax penalties their \nmarriage would incur.\n  This plan will fix that by giving working married couples the option \nof filing combined returns, using separate schedules to take advantage \nof the single filer tax rates and the single filer standard deduction.\n  This is a change that is long overdue. American families have been \nsuffering under the unfair burden of the marriage tax penalty for too \nlong. A simple example shows us why:\n  Robert and Diane are two single Americans who have fallen in love and \nwant to marry. They are not considered wealthy. In fact, Robert is a \nhardworking foreman at an auto factory. Susan, his fiancee, is an \nexperienced nurse. Each makes roughly $50,000 a year. Now, under \ncurrent law--when the file their separate tax returns--they each take a \npersonal exemption and the standard deduction, giving them a taxable \nincome of $43,000. After applying the tax rates for singles, they each \nowe tax of about $8,745.\n  If, however, Robert and Diane follow their hearts--get married and \nstart a family--they realize that their total combined income would be \n$100,000. Should they marry, they would no longer be considered middle-\nclass individuals, but many would regard them as a wealthy family, and \nunder current law their combined income would be reduced by their two \npersonal exemptions and by the standard deduction for married couples.\n  And here is where they would hit their first marriage penalty \nproblem, discovering that their new standard deduction is significantly \nless than the combination of the two standard deductions they receive \nas singles.\n  But the marriage penalty does not end there. In fact, it gets worse. \nWith their combined income, Robert and Diane--now considered by many to \nbe wealthy--would have a taxable income of $87,400. This is where they \nwould hit their second marriage penalty problem.\n  The lowest tax rate bracket for married couples is less than twice as \nwide as the lowest tax rate bracket for singles. In other words, more \nof their income would now be taxable at higher rates. The result would \nbe a total tax bill of $18,967, almost $1,500 more than they would have \npaid as singles. That steep increase would come at a time when they \ncould least afford it, a time when just starting out as a married \ncouple they would be looking to buy a home, raise a family, and save \nfor education.\n  The legislation we introduce today--this broad-based tax relief--\ncompletely eliminates the marriage penalty for Robert and Diane. The \nSenate Finance Committee bill will allow Robert and Diane to file a \njoint return, but to calculate their tax liability as if they had \nremained single. They would each get the benefit of the more generous \nstandard deduction and of the more generous rate brackets. Under this \nnew approach, they would pay a total tax of $17,490 which is the \ncombination of what they had each paid before. This saves them almost \n$1,500.\n  But in restoring equity to the tax code, we do not stop with the \nmarriage penalty. Another important measure contained in this broad-\nbased tax relief plan is the elimination of the alternative minimum tax \nfor middle-income families--families like David and Margaret Klaassen. \nMost of us know their\n\n[[Page S9461]]\n\nstory. The Tenth Circuit recently affirmed that under the current law, \nthe Klaassens are required to pay the alternative minimum tax despite \nthe fact that it may not have been Congress' intent to impact families \nlike the Klaassens when Congress passed the AMT.\n  David and Margaret Klaassen are the parents of 10 dependent children. \nThey had an adjusted gross income of $83,000 and roughly $19,000 of \nitemized deductions relating to state and local taxes, medical \nexpenses, interest, and charitable contributions. Their reported \nadjusted gross income was $63,500, and with 12 personal exemptions \ntheir taxable income was $34,000, resulting in regular tax of $5,100.\n  That would seem fair. And the Klaassens paid the bill. However, the \nIRS flagged the return and determined that the family was liable for \nthe alternative minimum tax, a provision in the code that was passed to \nmake sure that wealthy individuals and families do not escape at least \nsome liability through tax shelters and other tools they might use to \nminimize their liability. The IRS determined an AMT deficiency of \n$1,100. For AMT purposes, the Klaassens were disallowed a $3,300 \ndeduction for State and local taxes.\n  In addition, $2,100 in medical expenses were disallowed because of \nthe 10-percent floor for AMT purposes. And finally, the Klaassens' \nentire $29,000 deduction for personal exemptions was disallowed because \nof the AMT. These adjustments resulted in alternative minimum taxable \nincome of $68,000--twice the taxable income that the Klaassens had \nwithout the AMT.\n  This simply is not fair. It is not what Congress intended. The \nFinance Committee bill will help return fairness to the tax code by \nallowing families to receive the full benefits from their personal \nexemptions. This will also restore taxpayers' ability to receive their \n$500 per child tax credits, and other benefits that were intended to be \navailable to middle-income families.\n  These are changes that are long overdue. Again, they have strong \nbipartisan support. But our broad-based Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 \ndoes so much more.\n  This plan will also help individuals and families find self-reliance \nand security in retirement through expanded individual retirement \naccounts, as well as through enhanced 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans and \n457 plans. These are critical programs--programs that along with Social \nSecurity and personal savings help individuals prepare for their golden \nyears.\n  For savings through the workplace, there are 401(k) plans, 403(b) \nplans and 457 plans, each of which can be sponsored by different types \nof employers. For individual savings, there is either the traditional \nIRA or the Roth IRA. And all these different savings vehicles have \ndifferent limits on how much individuals can save. However, our current \nsystem can do more, and the limitations that we placed on retirement \nsavings in times of budgetary restraints should be reexamined in light \nof the current surplus. For example, the IRA contribution limit has not \nchanged since 1982.\n  Had it simply been indexed for inflation, it would be almost $5,000 \ntoday. What an opportunity that would present middle-class families to \nprepare for their futures. And that's exactly who benefits from IRAs--\nmiddle- and lower-income Americans.\n  Fifty-two percent of all IRA owners earn less than $50,000. This same \ngroup makes about 65 percent of all IRA contributions, and right now \nthey are limited by the $2,000 cap on contributions. IRS statistics \nalso show that the average contribution level in 1993 for people with \nless than $20,000 in income was $1,500.\n  Clearly, if the average contribution of modest-income taxpayers is \n$1,500, this demonstrates that many of these Americans want to make \ncontributions of more than the $2,000 limit. This tax relief bill will \nincrementally increase the amount that people can contribute to IRAs \nfrom $2,000 to $5,000.\n  In the area of employer-provided savings vehicles, the current \nmaximum pre-tax contribution to a 401(k) plan or a 403(b) annuity is \n$10,000.\n  In addition, the maximum contribution to a 457(b) plan is $8,000. \nFinally, the maximum contribution to a SIMPLE plan is $6,000. These \nlimits are indexed for cost-of-living increases.\n  There has traditionally been a differential in contribution limits \namong the various types of plans: IRAs having the lowest limits; SIMPLE \nplans having a greater limit, but not as much as a 401(k) plan; and \n401(k) and 403(b) plans having the highest limits, but the greatest \nnumber of regulations.\n  Since the IRA limit will be raised to $5,000, the bill will increase \nlimits for 401(k) and 403(b) plans to $15,000 and for SIMPLE plans to \n$10,000; thereby continuing the differential. The limit for 457(b) \nplans for government employees will increase to $10,000.\n  There is no question, with rising concerns about security and self-\nreliance in retirement, that these changes are needed. They will go a \nlong way toward helping individuals and families achieve their economic \ngoals. But the benefits this legislation has for retirement planning do \nnot stop here.\n  There are other provisions that will add new retirement vehicles, \nprovide greater ability to transfer retirement savings between plans, \npromote retirement plans for small businesses, and simplify the \nretirement plan system for both employers and employees.\n  One provision will allow employees 50 years old or older to make \ncatch-up contributions to their retirement plans. This will be most \nimportant for women, benefiting those who may have started their \nretirement savings late or who may have taken time off to raise \nchildren.\n  Whatever the reason, once these individuals have reached 50, they \nwill be eligible to make additional contributions to their retirement \nplans that are equal to 50 percent of their plans' maximum allowable \ncontribution. In other words, their total annual contribution could be \n150 percent of the normal contribution.\n  Beyond restoring equity to the tax code and helping Americans prepare \nfor retirement, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 will also help \nindividuals and families gain access to health care--particularly those \nwho are self-employed, or who are not covered by their employers--this \nlegislation will enhance the tax deductibility of health insurance. It \ndoes this by accelerating the full deductibility for health insurance \nfor the self-employed and by providing the same benefit on a phased-in \nbasis to employees who are not covered by their employers.\n  In detail, the Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 will provide an above-the-\nline deduction for health insurance and for long-term care for which \nthe taxpayer pays at least 50 percent of the premium. It will allow \nlong-term care insurance to be offered in cafeteria plans and provide \nan additional dependency deduction to caretakers of elderly family \nmembers. To benefit small businesses, this legislation will accelerate \nthe 100 percent deduction for health insurance of self-employed \nindividuals beginning in 2000.\n  To help make education more affordable for families and students, the \nTaxpayer Refund Act of 1999 strengthens educational savings \nopportunities by making college tuition plans tax-free. In other words, \nfamilies--including grandparents, aunts, and uncles--can invest their \nafter-tax income into a child's educational future. And when that money \nis used by the child, it will be tax-free on buildup and withdrawal.\n  This legislation also increases student loan interest deduction \nincome limits for single taxpayers by $10,000 and adjusts the beginning \nincome limits for married couples filing joint returns to twice that of \na single taxpayer. Beyond these important changes, this tax relief plan \npromotes education by making deductions for employer provided \nassistance permanent, and by allowing employer assistance to be used \nfor graduate-level courses.\n  Again, these are necessary changes--changes that will help families \nmeet their priorities.\n  Another important component of this tax relief package involves its \ntreatment of estate and gift taxes. Here, our objective is to protect \nfamilies, farmers, and small business men and women who have worked \ntheir whole lives to build a future for their posterity. Members of the \nSenate Finance Committee can recall the heartrending testimony of Lee \nAnn Goddard Ferris whose 71-year-old father died in a tragic farming \naccident in Lost River Valley, Idaho. For more than 60 years, her \nfamily had worked the land.\n  They owned over 2,600 acres--2,600 acres that had been purchased \nthrough\n\n[[Page S9462]]\n\ndecades of toil. In Lee Ann's own words, ``My father's death was the \nmost devastating event that any of us has ever gone through. The second \nmost devastating event was sitting down with our estate attorney after \nhis death. I'll never forget his words. The estate attorney said, \n`There is no way you can keep this place, absolutely no way.' ''\n  Still suffering from her father's accidental death, Lee Ann couldn't \nbelieve what she was hearing. ``How can this be?'' she asked. ``We own \nthis land. We have no debt! We just lost my father, and now we are \ngoing to lose the ranch?'' According to Lee Ann, ``Our attorney \nproceeded to pencil out the estate taxes . . . and we all sat in total \nshock.''\n  Where is the fairness, Mr. President? Here a family works for more \nthan half a century to build a ranch, only to hear that estate taxes \nwould rob them of their legacy, their heritage, their home.\n  ``This tax situation has put a tremendous strain on my mother,'' Lee \nAnn testified. ``Mother worries constantly and has had many sleepless \nnights. I don't know if any of you could ever imagine how hard it has \nbeen on her. She doesn't have her husband anymore. She worked hard her \nwhole life and gave up a lot of material things to put her after-tax \ndollars back into the land to pay it off. Now, unless this tax law is \nchanged or abolished, she will have to leave her home, which she loves, \nand our family will not have a base from which to carry on.''\n  With this legislation, Congress will do something to protect these \nfamilies. The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 turns the unified estate tax \ncredit into a true exemption, and it increases the exemption from $1 \nmillion to $1.5 million. This legislation also significantly reduces \nthe actual estate tax rate, and it increases the annual gift tax \nexclusion from $10,000 to $20,000 by the year 2006.\n  Each of the measures I have outlined as part of the Taxpayer Refund \nAct of 1999 is vitally important to the well-being of all \nfamilies; each is a key component of this tax relief package. Again, \nour purpose is to be broad-based--to provide the most meaningful tax \nrelief possible--to do it in a way that families can meet their \nindividual needs--and to present a plan that can receive strong \nbipartisan support.\n\n  With this major tax relief package--$792 billion over 10 years--we \nmeet all of these criteria. And, in the process, we leave over $500 \nbillion to meet pressing concerns here in Washington, such as \npreserving and strengthening Medicare.\n  We are able to do all this and to keep the budget balanced for a \nsimple reason: the work, the investment, and the job creation achieved \nby Americans everywhere have succeeded in creating long-term economic \ngrowth.\n  It is not right that the reward for this success is that today our \ntaxes are the highest percent of our gross national product than at any \nother time in postwar history. These same Americans--the authors of \nthis success story--are rightful heirs to the wealth they are creating. \nAfter paying for the Government programs for which Congress has planned \nand budgeted, the change must now be returned to the taxpayer.\n  This legislation not only returns the change by cutting taxes, it \nincreases access to healthcare; it makes education more affordable; it \nhelps taxpayers prepare for self-reliance and retirement; it keeps \ntheir home, farm, and family business safe from death taxes. These are \nobjectives that are shared by everyone. They are objectives that can be \nembraced by Senators and Congressmen on both sides of the political \naisle. They are objectives that can be made realities by being passed \ninto law.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. First, I congratulate our revered chairman, Senator \nRoth, for the manner in which he has presented the Taxpayer Refund Act \nof 1999, for the manner in which he brought our committee together in \nconsultation and deliberation, and who, indeed, produced a measure \nwhich was bipartisan. It has many elements which would commend our \nsupport across the aisle--certainly mine. But it is not to that issue \nthat I will speak today, but to the question of the doctrine.\n  I would like to put this debate in a doctrinal perspective, which is \nto say, the development in the 1960s which holds that the only way to \nrestrain the growth of Government is to deliberately create a \nprotracted fiscal crisis.\n  This begins, of course, with a view of Government that is so very \ndifferent from what traditional conservatism would hold. It is a new \nand radical idea. I will discuss how it emerged.\n  But first I will cite an article from this morning's New York Times \nop-ed page by Gertrude Himmelfarb, one of our preeminent historians and \nan avowed conservative. She writes so much of what goes on. She says:\n\n       In their eagerness to do away with the nanny state, some \n     conservatives risk belittling, even delegitimizing, the state \n     itself. A delicate balancing act is required: to dismantle or \n     diminish the welfare state while retaining a healthy respect \n     for the state itself. For good government is the precondition \n     of civil society, providing a safe space within which \n     individuals, families, communities, churches and voluntary \n     associations can effectively function.\n\n  But, as I say, the debate on this tax bill is not just a debate about \ntax policy; for it is far less a debate on taxes than a debate on \neconomic and budget policy and the large understanding of the role of \nGovernment in our society, the role of Government in an advanced market \neconomy.\n  At the outset of this debate, we should be mindful of some painful \nmistakes we have made in the not too distant past and which we \nevidently mean to repeat.\n  In August of 1993, just 6 years ago, we began to correct a colossal \nbudget mistake. The President signed into law a deficit reduction act \nwithout precedent in size that dramatically changed the budget \noutlook--turning deficits of $290 billion a year, as far as the eye \ncould see--to anticipate my friend David Stockman--into the surpluses \nwe now project of $200 billion and more--surpluses on budget--leaving \naside the Social Security revenue stream.\n  At the time of its passage, it was estimated that the 1993 \nlegislation, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, would \nreduce the deficit by $505 billion over the 5 years, 1994 through 1998.\n  The Office of Management and Budget, in its fiscal year 2000 edition \nof ``Analytical Perspectives,'' estimated that the total deficit \nreduction has been more than twice this. I quote: ``The total deficit \nreduction has been more than twice this--$1.2 trillion.''\n  That suggests the extraordinary quality of that moment when we stood \non this floor and waited for the final vote that would allow the Vice \nPresident to cast the determining vote, 51-50. The act was passed \nwithout one Member of the Republican Party of either House of the \nCongress.\n  In 1997, we had a more bipartisan effort in the Balanced Budget Act \nof 1997. Again, we see larger revenue benefits than were originally \nanticipated.\n  As for the fiscal year that ends this September, the OMB projects a \nbudget surplus of $99 billion and the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects a surplus of $120 billion. With the end of the fiscal year \njust 2 months away, we can expect, with great confidence, a budget \nsurplus for the second consecutive year.\n  What explains this huge gap, this pleasant surprise between budget \nexpectations and outcomes in recent years? As is often the case in \neconomic analysis, there are interrelated factors which cannot always \neasily be disentangled but which provide clues.\n\n  To begin with, we appear to be in what has been described by our now-\nSecretary of the Treasury, Lawrence Summers, at his confirmation \nhearing as a ``virtuous cycle.'' I put a question to him, and he \nresponded:\n\n       Senator, I think it very important that, as you suggest, we \n     do reduce the national debt by the full amount of the Social \n     Security surpluses, which would continue this virtuous cycle \n     by reducing interest rates, which makes possible more growth, \n     which makes more tax collections, which makes larger \n     surpluses, which makes lower debt, which reduces interest \n     rates, which starts the cycle going again. That is an \n     enormously important process.\n\n  The Honorable Robert Rubin, who was Mr. Summers' distinguished \npredecessor, often spoke of a term which is not in ordinary usage, but \nit is a term\n\n[[Page S9463]]\n\nknown by Secretaries of State and by persons who deal in securities, in \nmarkets. Mr. Rubin would use the term the ``risk premium on interest \nrates.'' That is to say, the extra charge if a person is lending money, \nif they are not certain of the fiscal stability of the Federal \nGovernment, in this case, and, thence, of the economy at large.\n  It was, first of all, this risk premium that we broke in 1993, the \nfear that down the line, if these deficits of $290 billion in the \nprevious year went on and on--the debt had quadrupled over the previous \ntwelve years--that the day would come, again, to use an economist's \nterm, when we would ``monetize'' the debt through inflation. We would \nget rid of it by wiping out the value of the dollar. That is that \npremium, that risk premium on interest rates.\n  We began to see this effect. I was here on the Senate floor on \nFebruary 10, 1995. I remarked:\n\n       . . . the economy performed better than expected, in part, \n     because Congress adopted a credible deficit reduction plan. \n     In part, also, because, as Secretary of the Treasury Rubin \n     remarked to the Finance Committee this Wednesday [that is, \n     Wednesday, February 8, 1995], the deficit reduction program \n     squeezed the risk premium on interest rates out of real long-\n     term interest rates. If financial markets do not believe the \n     deficit is under control, they will levy a risk premium on \n     capital lending. In 1993 and 1994, we clearly persuaded the \n     markets that we were finally serious.\n\n  From a slightly different perspective, the Congressional Budget \nOffice also took note of the importance of reducing interest costs. For \nmost of the post-World War II period, interest costs have been the \nsecond or third largest item in the budget, behind Social Security and \nnational defense.\n  In commenting on this, the CBO said, of the effects of that 1993 \nlegislation:\n\n       Remarkably, the biggest single change lies in . . . \n     interest--now projected at 3.3 percent of GDP in 2003 \n     compared with 4.5 in the earlier report, a testimonial to the \n     efforts to rein-in the debt's growth [which had taken place].\n\n  For the record, CBO, in its latest budget update issued earlier this \nmonth, now projects interest costs at just 1.7 percent of GDP in the \nyear 2003, a reduction by half from its September 1993 projection when \nwe had just passed that legislation of that year.\n  Outlays for net interest peaked at $251 billion 2 fiscal years ago. \nThey are now projected to decrease to $222 billion, and if we can just \nkeep from squandering the surplus, we will repay the debt incurred in \nthose years and that interest cost will again go down, almost to \ndisappear.\n  Now, I do not mean to suggest that the budget outlook is solely due \nto changes in budget policies. Factors other than deficit reduction are \nat work, making for a strong, sustained economic expansion. The economy \nbrings higher receipts and lower outlays for unemployment and other \nsuch programs that automatically  expand in a recession.\n\n  Last week, in testimony before the House Committee on Banking and \nFinancial Services, Alan Greenspan, our world-renowned Chairman of the \nBoard of Governors at the Federal Reserve, provided some insights into \nwhat is sustaining this period of remarkable growth. Observing the \nabsence of production bottlenecks, shortages, and price pressures that \ninevitably occur in an expanding economy, he noted a number of the \npossible explanations for the good fortunes involved; notably, just-in-\ntime inventories and such like; but they have come about fortuitously \nat a time when the deficit was under control, deficits were declining, \nand the prospects were much better all around.\n  The question is, Can we not keep this? Can we not sustain the \nextraordinary economic expansion on which we have embarked?\n  Unemployment is now at 4.3 percent. May I say, as someone who in the \nKennedy administration was Assistant Secretary of Labor for Policy \nPlanning, we would have said, sir, that a 4.3-percent unemployment rate \nwas unsustainable. It would lead to an outbreak of inflation. Yet here \nwe have it, 4.3 percent, real economic growth at 4 percent. We are in \nthe ninth year of an expansion, and we have no inflation. This is \nsomething that is going to require that the economic textbooks be \nrewritten. But we have done it, and a lot of it comes about from what \nwe did on the Senate floor in August of 1993 and which our great hope \non this side of the aisle is that we not undo in this short time that \nhas passed.\n  Alan Greenspan, in that testimony, was very clear. He said tax cuts \nare to be reserved for recessions. That will be the most effective \nmeans we can have to regenerate the economy and keep the long-term \ngrowth path moving high.\n  The New York Times editorialized this past Sunday, on the Oracle of \nthe Fed:\n\n       Mr. Greenspan is treated reverently on Capitol Hill, but it \n     appears that the Republicans do not want to heed his advice \n     to run a surplus and pay down the national debt, while saving \n     a tax cut for when it is needed.\n\n  How come this sudden resurgence just now, when it would seem so clear \nthat a quite opposite policy has had such very desirable effects? Well, \nsir, I go back, as I said I would earlier, to matters of political \ndoctrine.\n  We don't talk much of doctrine on the Senate floor, but there are \ntimes for it. In 1995, for example, we debated a constitutional \namendment requiring a balanced budget. I presented a series of papers \nin which I tried to describe the idea of ``starving the beast,'' as the \nterm was; that is to say, depriving the Federal Government of the \nrevenues needed, putting it simply, to govern.\n  The argument is quite simple. It goes back to the 1970s when a number \nof theorists on the conservative wing of the Republican Party \ndetermined that it was not going to be possible for the Federal \nGovernment ever to be controlled in its size as long as it had the \nrevenues to sustain, or even to increase, that size. And so it came \nabout that a policy doctrine developed which argued that deficits, if \nsizable enough, had acquired a new utility--deficits that had \npresumably been the horror of conservative financial thought now became \nsomething attractive because they could be used to reduce the size of \nGovernment itself.\n  E.J. Dionne, Jr., in an op-ed article in yesterday's Washington Post, \nclearly recognizes this idea is still afoot. He writes:\n\n       The long-term goal, about which Republican leaders are \n     candid, is to put Government in a fiscal straitjacket for \n     years to come.\n\n  In fairness, I think this is more to be encountered on the House side \nthan in this body, but it still would be the cumulative effect, in \nfact, of the tax cuts that have been proposed in both bodies.\n  I can remember the onset of this. In the late 1970s, it was clear. \nOne could write about it, and one did. Then came the administration of \nPresident Reagan in which, in effect, the policies were carried out--or \nthey began to be carried out. In a television address, 16 days before \nhis inauguration, President Reagan said:\n\n       There will always be those who tell us that taxes could not \n     be cut until spending was reduced. Well, you know, we can \n     lecture our children about extravagance until we run out of \n     voice or breath, or we can cut their extravagance by simply \n     reducing their allowance.\n\n  There you have President Reagan in his most agreeable and heart-\nwarming quality. He thought this could be done because he thought there \nwould, in fact, be reductions in Government. There were none. Moreover, \nvery shortly, his economic advisers realized the economic analysis they \nhad used to project revenue increases from tax reductions weren't going \nto work, and they faced a prospect of deficits of, as David Stockman \nonce said, ``$200 billion as far as the eye can see.''\n  Haynes Johnson, in his superb book, ``Sleepwalking Through History: \nAmerica Through the Reagan Years,'' writes:\n\n       The Reagan team [not the President] saw the implicit \n     failure of supply side theory as an opportunity, not a \n     problem.\n\n  Now, this we have to absorb. They saw the failure of supply side \ntheory--which said that the more you cut taxes, the higher the revenues \nwill be--as an opportunity, not a problem. The secret solution was to \nlet the Federal budget deficits rise, thus leaving Congress no \nalternative but to cut domestic programs. But in the end, they were not \ncut. Some grew. There was a view, and certainly a respectable one, that \ndefense had to be increased. We now, incidentally, suggest there be a \n20-percent reduction in defense spending over the next 10 years.\n  The Reagan administration increased defense spending, and they had a \nperfectly good argument for doing that--\n\n[[Page S9464]]\n\nbut not simultaneously with huge tax cuts. There, very shortly \nthereafter, had to be tax increases. But the course was set for the \n1980s and the deficit doubled, from under a trillion dollars to about \n$3.7 trillion now in publicly held debt. So I rise again to say, as I \nhave done before, that what we did in 1981 with that tax cut--for which \nI voted because the Office of Management and Budget, seeing our huge \ninflation continuing, projected surpluses in the future--was so \nruinously wrong. We now have a debt that will level off at about $6 \ntrillion, while the debt held by the public will fall by $2 trillion, \nor more, depending on the size of this tax cut.\n\n  The other important reason, which I will close on, is that the 1997 \nbalanced budget amendment left us with what the Washington Post this \nmorning calls an ``accounting illusion,'' that we can reduce the \nspending on domestic programs by 20 percent in real terms over the next \n10 years. The illusion is coming apart already. Just the other day, the \nHouse of Representatives determined that the money to pay for the \ndecennial census in the year 2000 required an emergency appropriation \noutside of those limits. We have had that census for many years. That \ncensus is provided in the Constitution. It has taken place every decade \nsince 1790. All of a sudden, we have made it into an emergency.\n  In this morning's Washington Post, our former majority leader, our \nbeloved colleague, Robert C. Byrd, has an article called ``Time for \nTruth In Spending.'' He said:\n\n       What we need to jettison is the political rhetoric. What we \n     need to impose is truth in spending.\n\n  And he set down a few principles. He said:\n\n       First, watch our investments carefully and manage them \n     prudently. We should continue our best efforts to manage the \n     economy and watch out for inflation.\n       Second, do not spend our money before we make it. Before \n     the surplus is spent, whether on tax cuts or continuing \n     important priority programs, wait for the money to be in the \n     bank.\n\n  We are proposing to spend a surplus, sir, that does not exist.\n\n       Third, pay our debts. The United States should take \n     advantage of this opportunity to retire the national debt.\n       Fourth, cover the necessities. Congress should not \n     shortchange the Nation's core programs, such as education, \n     health care, veterans, and the like.\n       Fifth, put aside what we need for a rainy day. Congress \n     should take steps to reserve the Social Security and Medicare \n     surpluses exclusively for future costs of those programs.\n       Sixth, don't go on a spending spree. Resist the temptation \n     to create costly new government programs.\n       Finally, take prosperity in measured doses. Congress should \n     reduce taxes without pulling the rug out from under projected \n     surpluses.\n\n  I can think of no wiser counsel.\n  In that regard, and with great respect for the chairman of the \ncommittee, I would suggest that the budget reconciliation process was \ndevised to expedite consideration of deficit reduction measures.\n  The bill before us uses those same expedited procedures to secure \nenactment of a deficit-increasing measure.\n  Section 313(b)(E) of the Byrd rule provides that any provision in any \nreconciliation bill which would decrease revenues used beyond the \nbudget window--in this case beyond the year 2009--may be automatically \nstricken from the bill upon a point of order being raised.\n  Section 1502 of the bill before us provides for permanent \ncontinuation of tax cuts in the years beyond 2009, causing revenue \nlosses of hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Accordingly, sir, at the appropriate time, I intend to raise the Byrd \nrule point of order against section 1502 of the bill.\n  I thank the Chair for his cordial consideration of my remarks.\n  I see my friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, is on the \nfloor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee if he will yield up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield to the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before my friend, Senator Roth, leaves \nthe floor, let me say to the Senate that Senator Roth has come through \nagain for the Senate and for the people of this country.\n  His tax bill is clearly one that recognizes fairness, that puts the \nmoney where it ought to be put, gives back to the American people some \nof their money, and it does it in a way that clearly is prudent and \nresponsible.\n  It will be very difficult when we are finally finished explaining \nthis bill for the President of the United States to veto this bill.\n  We are going to talk about that a little later in the day. Since he \nhas challenged us, we will tell the American people loud and clear what \nhe is going to be doing when he vetoes this bill.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the budget blueprint that \nCongress has passed for the first decade of the 21st century. It \nembodies three major things: Social Security, first and foremost. Much \nwill be said about it. But nobody can deny that with this refund to the \nAmerican taxpayers, we have left intact every single penny of surplus \nthat belongs to the Social Security trust fund, and we will even debate \non the floor locking it up so it is very hard to spend.\n  The budget before us and that we adopted demanded that 100 percent of \nall the funding that Social Security recipients will need will be \nexclusively set aside for that purpose.\n  Second, it sets aside enough money to meet the demands of Medicare \nfor the next 10 years. Medicare is fully funded under the budget that \nwas adopted by the Congress this year. That means there are no cuts. \nThe program is fully funded for the decade. As a matter of fact, the \nPresident cut Medicare in the first 5 years of his budget. We did not \ndo that. Then we would have a rainy day fund to implement any Medicare \nreform that Congress might enact. I will allude to that soon.\n  Third, after all the bills of the decade have been paid, after Social \nSecurity recipients have their money set aside, after we have funded \nevery penny anticipated for Medicare, and have an ample rainy day fund \navailable, if we want to do something on prescription drugs, then we \nwould send back the excess to the American taxpayers--to the working \nfamilies--and those in middle- and low-income brackets will get a very \nsubstantial tax reduction.\n  The budget resolution recognized economic conditions now, and the \nprojected economics including the planning for an inevitable recession \nthat might occur in the future. It outlined a decade-long, phased-in \ntax cut. Only a very small tax cut was envisioned in the first 2 years \nof this budget timeframe because the economy is already operating above \noptimum capacity. We want to keep inflation subdued and interest rates \nlow. The budget expected Congress to pass a tax bill that was very \nsmall in the first 2 years and grew as the decade wound its way through \ninto the next millennium.\n  I congratulate again the chairman of the Finance Committee and the \nmembers of that committee for producing the kind of tax cut for our \nbudget for the 21st century. I think it is appropriate, prudent, and \nfair. Chairman Roth has produced a tax cut that starts small and ends \nup larger, reflecting economic conditions. He has produced a tax cut \nthat targets help to those who really need it--those with children in \nschool, those with elderly and ill parents who need long-term care, \nthose who are trying to save for their own retirement instead of \nGovernment reliance, and many more items of that nature and of that \nsignificance.\n  Yes. The same old class warfare arguments like tired, defeated \nsoldiers of past wars have begun to stagger across the Senate debate \nagain--and they will be here before us again--that we are only helping \nthe rich. We are told we must spend the surplus. That is essentially \nthe argument against our tax refunds--we must spend the surplus. We \nmust grow Government. It is the same old debate.\n\n  One party wants to give money to programs. And we want to give money \nto the people. That is exactly the way it has been, and that is exactly \nthe way it is on this floor.\n  I believe there is a degree of arrogance in those who argue against \ntax cuts. They say to working families: I\n\n[[Page S9465]]\n\nknow what to do with your money better than you do. Give it to me so I \ncan spend it.\n  Can you imagine the arrogance of that position? They have grand \nschemes now with the surpluses.\n  Republicans, through their dedicated efforts, and Dr. Greenspan and \nhis fantastic ability to manage the money supply in our country, and to \ncontrol interest rates, have given the Nation this enormous surplus. \nThe President of the United States thinks they have the money to \nimplement new, grand schemes and to grow government. That is the issue.\n  A government big enough to give you everything is a government that \ntakes everything away in the form of high taxes.\n  I didn't originate that quote. I can't imagine and I can't fathom \nanything more frightening to the average taxpayer than the sight of a \ngrand government schemer rushing toward a $1 trillion pile of extra \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Republicans say it is the best of times for tax cuts. Democrats say \nit is the worst of times. Everyone quotes Dr. Alan Greenspan.\n  The Taxpayers Refund Act before the Senate is the best of plans.\n  It lowers rates.\n  It encourages savings.\n  It eliminates the worst of a bad Tax Code. It eliminates the marriage \npenalty for many Americans. It begins the death of a death tax. It ends \nthe alternative minimum tax, to rescue the full benefit of child care, \nfoster care, education, and other needed tax credits for families who \notherwise unavoidably would end up in the alternative minimum tax \nbrackets. They are sick of this. They are worried about it.\n  You will get more mail on this issue because it is grossly unfair to \ngive credits and then take them away--to run across the land saying: We \nare delighted to have given you a credit for your children's education \nonly to find that middle-income Americans by the hundreds of thousands \nare falling into this alternative minimum tax trap.\n  I say: Tax cuts, if not now, when?\n  The Democrats say not now.\n  I say: If not tax cuts now, then what?\n  The President's answer is: Spend it all. It does not matter what he \nsays he wants to spend it for; he wants to spend it all.\n  Can you imagine if we did not have this surplus? What will the \nPresident be doing--asking for tax increases to pay for these programs \nhe thinks we need? I doubt that. I doubt that very much.\n  I support prudent tax relief, and I must say this is prudent tax \nrelief. It is synchronized to our business cycle and the condition of \nthe economy. It improves our tax policy and moves us toward a system \nthat taxes income that is consumed instead of income that is earned. It \nmoves America toward a tax system that allows business to deduct \ninvestments in the year they are made. It encourages investment in \nretirement, education, and health care.\n\n  Congress' budget allocates 75 percent of the projected surplus over \nthe next 10 years for paying down the debt and long-term priorities. If \nthe surplus were a dollar, two quarters would go for Social Security, \none quarter for high-priority spending--education, research, and \ndefense--and the remaining quarter for tax cuts.\n  Without tax cuts, who would spend the surplus?\n  Not the American people. The Government in Washington would spend it. \nWithout tax cuts, we will ``grow'' Government. There can be no denial \nof that. The President plans to grow Government substantially rather \nthan give back anything to the American people. He now says he would \nveto a $500 billion tax cut. What about $200, Mr. President? That means \ngiving the American people back about 6 cents of the surplus, at $200. \nCan we afford that? I believe we can afford 25 cents out of every $1 of \nsurplus.\n  Democrats say the question is: tax cuts versus Social Security. Tax \ncuts or Medicare. Tax cuts or domestic spending. Tax cut versus debt \nreduction.\n  The right answer: It is not ``this'' versus ``that.'' The correct \nanswer is, we can do all of the above. The size of the surplus lets us \ndo it all. That is the reality. Save Social Security, reform Medicare, \nprovide adequate funding for domestic and defense spending, pay down \nthe debt, and give the American people who earned the money a decent \ntax cut. Do that in a manner that phases in, which will probably be \nvery complimentary to the American economy.\n  Even with the tax cuts and refunds we are talking about, our surplus \nwill steadily climb as a share of GDP and our national debt will \nultimately be paid off, falling dramatically from 40 percent of GDP \nthis year to only 12 percent in 2009. Under the proposal we make, the \nexternal debt--the debt to the public--will go from 40 percent of the \ngross domestic product to only 12 percent by the end of the decade.\n  I am amazed the President's political advisers allege this budget is \nreckless. Nothing is reckless about steadily rising surpluses and \npaying down our debt by more than 50 percent over the next decade. In \nfact, our plan lowers the level of debt more than the President's plan. \nSome may wonder why. That is because the President spends heavily in \nthe first 5 years. We have tiny tax cuts. Thus, he incurs more debt \nthan we do at that time, and he cannot make it up in a decade.\n  I have been amazed by the administration and other opponents who \nclaim our tax cut will lead to higher interest rates because the \neconomy will overheat. That is just not true. The Fed is most concerned \nnot with the economy as it is today but what it will be in 18 months \nand thereafter. Our tax cut is slow, a total of $28 billion over the \nyears 2000 and 2001. I repeat, if they are worried about stimulus, it \nis $28 billion in tax cuts. It is almost unrecognizable in terms of \nimpact one way or the other on the American economy. It saves 92 \npercent of the projected surplus during these first 2 years. As a \nresult, our budget surpluses will rise sharply from 1.4 percent of the \ngross domestic product to 2 percent by 2001.\n  It is clear that the budget plan is not expansionary, which some \npeople now talk about. It truly is not. Ask any economist to look at it \nin its true sense, phased in as it is, and ask if it is an expansionary \nbudget. I cannot imagine this tax bill would be defeated on such a \npreposterous economic observation.\n  In House testimony last week, Chairman Greenspan cautioned against \nexpecting any rapid stimulus as a result of this tax relief package. I \ncan assure the American people that Congress' tax plan will not \noverheat the economy. As a matter of fact, Chairman Greenspan cautioned \nagainst expecting a rapid stimulus as a result of this package, given \nthe long phase-in of the tax cuts.\n\n  I can anticipate the response of my Democratic colleagues who are \nlikely to say: If your plan is so ideally suited for the economy, why \ndid Alan Greenspan argue we should let surpluses run for a while before \ncutting taxes?\n  Listen carefully. I have two responses. First, I believe the Congress \nis doing exactly what the Chairman advised. Our budget plan delivers \nonly $28 billion in tax cuts over the next 2 years. Most of that relief \nis scheduled to arrive only after surpluses have mounted on a \nconsistent basis. Second and more important, Chairman Greenspan is \nadvising what policies would be best in an ideal world. However, he is \nfully aware that ideal may not be politically feasible.\n  Let me read a quote he made last week which I think was insightful:\n\n       There is nothing that I can see that would be lost by \n     allowing the process to delay unless, as I have indicated \n     many times, it appears that the surplus is going to become a \n     lightning rod for major increases in outlays. That's the \n     worst of all possible worlds from a fiscal policy point of \n     view. That, under all conditions, should be avoided. I have \n     great sympathy for those who wish to cut taxes now, to \n     preempt the process. And indeed if it turns out they are \n     right, I would say moving on the tax front makes a good deal \n     of sense to me.\n\n  The worst of all fiscal policies will materialize if the President \ngets his way. The President proposes to increase spending by more than \n$1 trillion over the next 10 years. Most of this new spending would go \nto create 80 new, often repetitious, often local-government-\nprerogative-infringing Government programs, with services already being \nhandled at the local or private sector. The President's spending \nproposals are the worst of all proposals from the standpoint of what is \ngood for America during the next 2 years. That time horizon must \nconcern the Federal Reserve.\n  The President proposes to use $53 billion of the surplus for new \nspending. It\n\n[[Page S9466]]\n\nis nearly twice as large as our tax cut in the next 2 years. Thus, the \nPresident's plan would be far more stimulative than the Congress' \nmeasured tax cut. I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle if \nthey are worried about interest rates rising because the economy is \noverheating, why support the President's Government-growing agenda over \ntax cuts? The money is there. We have a surplus.\n  The last question is the $792 billion question: Who is going to spend \nit? When faced with the President, who wants to spend the surplus, \nCongress has no choice but to cut taxes. However, we have to be \ncareful. While we are still saving the majority of the surplus for \nshoring up our long-term fiscal health, we must be careful in that \nregard.\n  To sum up, I leave two messages today. Our budget is prudent, and it \nis synchronized for where we are in the business cycle. Be skeptical of \nthe administration's criticism of our tax plan. They want to grow \nGovernment well in excess of Congress' tax cut. Most of the spending \nhas nothing to do with Social Security or Medicare. This is what should \nmost concern the American people when faced with the surplus, excluding \nSocial Security funds, and I have already indicated what will happen to \nthem. The Republicans want to give it back to the people who earned it \nand worked so hard.\n  The big question then is, Who is going to spend the surplus?\n  With tax cuts, the answer is you; without tax cuts, the answer is big \ngovernment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the minority yields 10 minutes to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago, President Clinton visited \nsome of the poorest communities in our country and he spoke eloquently \nof our obligations to America's most disadvantaged children. Now, with \nour economy booming and record surpluses, we have a chance to do better \nfor all of our children. This budget fails America's children. I want \nto speak as loudly and boldly as I can about this reconciliation bill, \nfirst about the Republican proposal, and then about what we are \nproposing as Democrats.\n  If you look at the non-Social Security surplus, about three-quarters \nof it really assumes cuts in future domestic spending. The Republican \nproposal on the floor does not restore any of these cuts. In fact, they \nadd another cut of roughly $200 billion. The Republican plan would \nrequire a 38-percent cut in domestic spending in the year 2009, and the \nRepublican tax bills are loaded with corporate welfare for \nmultinational corporations, banks, insurance companies, Wall Street \nsecurities firms, and tax giveaways for the wealthy. That is a \ndisappointment. It is a very harsh budget.\n  But even the Democratic plan fails to fully fund or restore these \ncuts. Senate Democrats have reserved $290 billion of the surplus to \nsoften the blow on our discretionary priorities like education, but we \nstill allow cuts of several hundred billion dollars. In our plan, with \nour $300 billion of tax cuts, we do not make up the assumed cuts in our \ndomestic priorities either.\n  Since defense spending will go up, and there will be spending for \ntransportation which also will go up significantly over the next 10 \nyears, our other domestic priorities will be squeezed even more.\n  How can we, as Democrats, say we are for addressing the needs of \nAmerica's children, for fighting poverty, for fully funding Head Start, \nfor equal access to quality education, for helping working families \nafford the cost of health care and child care, for cleaning up the \nenvironment, for community policing, and for veterans' health care, \nwhen we are assuming domestic spending cuts of several hundred billion \ndollars? Something has to give. To use the old Yiddish proverb, you \ncan't dance at two weddings at the same time.\n  I do not understand this. There are 14 million children who are poor \nin our country--14 million. There are 6.5 million children who live in \nhouseholds with income of one-half the poverty level. Close to one out \nof every four children in our country under the age of 3 are growing up \npoor. Close to 50 percent of children of color under the age of 3 are \ngrowing up poor. And now we are being told by both parties--the \nRepublican Party much more so than the Democratic Party--but both \nparties, that we cannot afford to renew our national vow of equal \nopportunity for every child? Where in these proposals do we, as a \nSenate representing the United States of America, live up to our \nnational vow of equal opportunity for every child?\n  Right now, in Early Head Start, for children age 3 or younger, 1 \npercent of the children who could be helped and given a head start are \nable to get this assistance. We are funding this program at a 1 percent \nlevel.\n  For the Republicans, you have $800 billion of tax cuts. You make no \ninvestment in any of these areas. Your budget and your proposal will \nlead to Draconian, really brutal cuts in these programs. Not only will \nwe not be doing anything to make sure poor children have a chance in \nAmerica, to make sure that there is equal opportunity for every child, \nbut the proposal of the majority party will be making cuts in these \nprograms.\n  And to the Democratic Party, my party, we have a better proposal. It \nis less harsh. But there has to be some connection between the \nconvictions we profess and the budgets we propose, and a willingness to \nfight for them. At some point, the chasm between our words and our \nactions becomes too wide. If we do not fight hard enough for the things \nwe stand for at some point, we have to recognize we really do not stand \nfor them. We really do not stand for them.\n  I cannot believe with record economic performance, that the \nRepublican Party can come to the floor of the Senate with a proposal \nthat calls for $800 billion of tax cuts, most of them flowing to our \nwealthiest citizens, but with a proposed 38-percent cut in Head Start, \nchild care, community policing, and cleanup of the environment.\n  And to my party, I cannot believe the Democrats come out with a \nproposal where we, too, are essentially proposing cuts in some of these \nkey domestic priorities. Why did we become involved in politics? What \ndo we believe in? What are our values? Can we not at least make some \ninvestment to make sure every child, no matter the color of skin or \nincome of family, urban or rural, or boy or girl, will have a chance to \nreach her full potential and his full potential?\n  What ever happened to the Democratic Party's strong commitment to \nequal opportunity for every citizen? I do not see it in these \nproposals. We ought not to be talking about tax cuts that benefit the \nmost affluent citizens, when we cannot even live up to our national vow \nof equal opportunity for every child.\n  I hope we will do better as we move forward in this debate. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from West Virginia is yielded 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, recently both the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Congressional Budget Office released their so-called \n``Mid-Session Reviews'' on the state of the Federal budget. Both of \nthese new forecasts project even better performance for the nation's \neconomy in the coming ten years than they had predicted just a few \nmonths ago. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office projects unified \nbudget surpluses totaling just under $3 trillion over the next ten \nyears. Of the $3 trillion, approximately $2 trillion results from \nsurpluses being paid into the Social Security trust fund. The remaining \n$1 trillion--or $996 billion to be exact--is what is called the ``on \nbudget'' surplus. That is the non-Social Security trust fund surplus. \nThe question before Congress is what do we do with this good news--our \ngovernment is about to be awash in money, if these projections come \ntrue.\n  Before we get too far along with our grandiose plans for massive tax \ncuts, a dose of reality is in order. Sometimes a dose of castor oil is \nin order. We may not like it so much, but it has to be taken. So a dose \nof reality is in order.\n\n[[Page S9467]]\n\n  These future budget surpluses are, of course, based on ``pie in the \nsky'' projections. But I don't think ``pie in the sky'' is quite right. \nThe projections are so far out into the Stratosphere--more than a \ndecade away--that we would need the Hubble Telescope to track them \ndown.\n  Mr. President, the fact is that they have not yet occurred, the money \nis not yet in hand--and may well never occur--for a number of reasons. \nFirst, one needs to keep in mind that budget projections for even 1 \nyear are likely to be missed by a substantial margin over the normal 5-\nyear period of congressional budgets. Estimates of deficits and \nsurpluses have been off by billions of dollars. This year, for the \nfirst time, instead of 5-year budget projections, we have 10-year \nbudget projections upon which all of the surpluses are being forecast, \nand upon which tax cut proposals by Democrats, Republicans and the \nadministration are being based.\n  Does anyone really believe that these 10-year projections will be any \nmore accurate than the usual 5-year numbers? In looking at these \nincredible amounts of surpluses and tax cuts, I would think that one \nneeds more of an astrologer than an economist to read the tea leaves \nand to come up with these figures.\n  Mr. President, consider these facts: CBO's estimate of revenues over \nthe period 1980 through 1998 was off by an absolute average of $38 \nbillion per year. The estimates were off by an average of $38 billion \nper year during the period 1980 through 1998. That is a pretty fair \npiece of change! This isn't just chicken feed. Some years, the \nestimates were closer to the projection than other years, but, as I \nsay, the average difference one way or the other, was $38 billion per \nyear. Similarly, for outlays, the projections over the past two decades \nwere off the mark by an absolute average of $36 billion per year. The \nresulting deficit projections by the Congressional Budget Office over \nthe period 1980 through 1998 were off by an absolute average of $54 \nbillion per year. Extend that figure over 10 years, and that is what we \nare doing now in this bill, and we can see that $540 billion of the $1 \ntrillion projected surplus could melt away faster than last year's \nsnowball.\n  So what about these latest ``rosy'' forecasts of budgetary surpluses \nfor the next 10 years? It is obvious that we need to be very careful \nwhen relying on such projections to make decisions about whether and if \nwe can afford a tax cut.\n  CBO officials would be the first to tell you that they have widely \nmissed the mark in their budgetary forecasts, as would the folks at \nOMB. No one on the face of God's green Earth can predict accurately for \neven 1 year, much less for 5 or 10 years, what revenues will come into \nthe Treasury, or what expenditures will go out of the Treasury. That is \nbecause no one knows what the unemployment rate will be next year, or \nthe inflation rate, interest rates, whether there will be a recession \nor the duration or virility of such recession. In virtually every CBO \nreport, the following cautionary footnote can be found: ``Cyclical \ndisturbances could have a significant effect on the budget at any time \nduring the projection period. A recession would temporarily push down \ntaxable incomes, thus reducing federal revenues. A recession would also \ncause a boost in spending for unemployment insurance and other benefit \nprograms. CBO estimates that a relatively mild recession (similar to \nthe one in the early 1990s) that began this year could reduce the \nprojected surplus by $55 billion in 2000.''\n  Mr. President, there is no reason to believe that CBO's current \nforecast of the budgetary picture over the next 10 years will be any \nmore accurate than have been its previous forecasts over the past two \ndecades.\n  With that dose of reality in mind, let's now turn our attention to \nthe Republican tax cut proposal now before the Senate. Earlier in my \nremarks, I noted that the Congressional Budget Office projects an on-\nbudget surplus of $996 billion over the coming 10 years FY 2000-2009. \nThe on-budget surplus calculations, it should be noted, are the monies \nnot needed for Social Security or the Postal Service, and not otherwise \nspent. The Republican tax cut plan proposes to use virtually all of \nthese projected on-budget surpluses for tax cuts of $792 billion and \nfor paying the increased interest on the federal debt of $179 billion. \nThis leaves only $25 billion in projected surpluses for the next 10 \nyears.\n  What happens if we enact cuts of $792 billion and the CBO projections \nturn out to be wrong? What happens if they turn out to be wrong, as \nthey have always been? What will Congress do then? The money will by \nlaw be leaving the Treasury everyday in the form of tax cuts, but there \nmay be an inadequate surplus to cover them. Will Congress repeal the \ntax cut? It is easy to vote for a tax cut. Will Congress repeal the tax \ncut? Will it be able to cut spending even further than the Republican \nbudget--which I will say more about later--already calls for? Will it \ndip into the Social Security trust fund then? Or, will Congress find it \neasier to revert back into the bad old days of the 1980s and simply run \nup massive annual deficits? Those are the four choices we will have. \nAll of them are unacceptable. We must not mislead the American people \nby promising them massive tax cuts which may well be based only on \nphantom surpluses which never materialize.\n  Even if the surpluses do happen, this Republican tax plan could \nemasculate national security, public investments, and the operations of \ngovernment. As this chart shows, these areas of the Federal budget \ncould suffer real cuts each year, beginning in fiscal year 2000, \ndrastically below what would be necessary to continue them at the \nlevels provided in fiscal year 1999. In fact, over the whole 10-year \nperiod--over the 10-year period--the real reductions would total $775 \nbillion. In other words, the bulk of the $792 billion Republican tax \ncut is likely, in reality, to be financed by cuts in critical \ndomestic priorities--critical domestic priorities--such as education, \nhealth care, infrastructure, child care, the environment, agriculture--\nthat will affect you, the people of this country--old, young, white, \nblack, male, female. They will affect you--you--because they will be \nfinanced by cuts in critical domestic priorities.\n\n  Mr. President, to give the American people some sense of what I am \ntalking about, let me focus on just three critical areas of the Federal \nbudget that would be thus affected.\n  First, however, let me point out that the cuts in these programs are \nbased on the assumption that the Republicans will fund defense at the \nlevels requested by President Clinton over the next 10 years. If that \nis so, and the tax cuts are also enacted, according to the Office of \nManagement and Budget, an across-the-board cut of 38 percent--that is \nmore than a third--in outlays will be required in the other public \ninvestments and operations of the Federal Government.\n  For example, let us take a look at the VA medical care program. That \ngets close to home. We are already getting lots of mail, lots of \ntelephone calls, e-mails, and so on, from veterans and their families. \nSo let's take a look at the VA medical care program.\n\n  What would happen to veterans' health care under the Republican tax \ncut plan if these cuts are administered in an across-the-board manner? \nThe cuts will rise from $931 million in fiscal year 2000 to over $11.5 \nbillion in fiscal year 2009. In total, the cumulative cuts to the VA \nmedical program--as I say, we are already hearing a lot from veterans \nbecause they see these cuts coming--the cumulative cuts to the VA \nmedical program for this 10-year period will be more than $53.5 billion \nbelow what it would take to continue current VA medical care services. \nI might add, as I say, some veterans are already feeling it, and this \nfigure is woefully inadequate.\n  What do those cuts mean in human terms? As we can see from this \nchart, OMB projects that 3,252,735 veterans--not talking about dollars \nnow; we are talking about real people, veterans in particular--OMB \nprojects that 3,252,735 veterans will seek treatment at VA medical \nfacilities in fiscal year 2000. That is just over the horizon, fiscal \nyear 2000. Under the Republican tax plan, though, 102,278 of these \nveterans are going to have to be turned away: Sorry, that program has \nbeen reduced, or that program has been cut out; we do not have room for \nyou.\n  As we can see, over the 10-year period the number of veterans to be \nturned away--sorry, sorry, we have to turn you away--will increase each \nyear\n\n[[Page S9468]]\n\nuntil fiscal year 2009, when, according to these figures, 1,430,985 \nveterans will be denied critical health care benefits. Is that how a \ngrateful Nation treats its soldiers, sailors, and airmen?\n  Now, let's look at national crime-fighting programs.\n  Mr. President, the budget for the Federal Bureau of Investigation was \napproximately $3 billion in FY 1999. Paying for the Republican tax cuts \nwould require reductions in the FBI budget below what would be needed \nto continue current services over each of the next 10 years. Those cuts \nget progressively worse until in FY 2009, the Republican tax cut would \nrequire a cut of almost $1.9 billion below the $4.3 billion that would \nbe necessary just to maintain--just to maintain--the same level of \nservice being provided by the FBI in 1999. Over this 10-year period, \ntotal cuts to the FBI's budget would equal almost $9 billion.\n  That is $9 for every minute since Jesus Christ was born. Nine billion \ndollars, that is a lot of money!\n  Again, Mr. President, what does this translate to in services to the \nAmerican people? Forget the dollars for a moment. As this chart shows, \nthe FBI will need 10,687 agents in each of the next 10 years in order \nto just continue its current law enforcement efforts. But, that will \nnot be possible if we enact the Republican tax cuts. Instead, we can \nlook forward to progressively--progressively--deeper reductions in the \nnumber of FBI agents in each of the next 10 years. In FY 2009, rather \nthan being able to employ 10,687 agents, the FBI will only be able to \nemploy, 5,878. Is that what the American people want? And what does \nthat do to our efforts to prevent another World Trade Center bombing? \nWhat does it do to our efforts to prevent another Oklahoma City \nbombing? What do cuts of that magnitude do to our programs to fight \norganized crime, or the insidious proliferation of child pornography on \nthe Internet?\n  Sadly, the picture is no better for the effort to patrol our Nation's \nborders. Progressively deeper budget cuts will have to be made over the \nnext 10 years totaling more than $3.5 billion because of the massive \nRepublican tax cuts. As a result, as we can see displayed in this next \nchart, the number of INS agents--Immigration and Naturalization Service \nagents--protecting the Nation's borders will decline from the needed \nlevel of 8,947 to only 4,921 in the year 2009. How does that help \naddress the problem of illegal immigration? And that is a big, big, big \nproblem. How do those kind of cuts help our drug interdiction efforts? \nWhat kind of message does that send to the Colombian drug lords?\n  Mr. President, these are just three--just three--examples of the \nshort-sheeting that will take place throughout the entire Federal \nGovernment because of the Republican tax plan. As if this weren't bad \nenough, the real kicker in the Republican tax cut plan is that not only \ndoes it cut taxes by almost a trillion dollars over the next 10 years \nbut--get this--this tax cut package would explode in the following 10 \nyears, costing roughly an additional $1.8 trillion, according to \npreliminary projections by the Treasury Department. Also, the Treasury \nDepartment points out that interest on the national debt in the second \n10 years caused by the $1.8 trillion in lost revenues would be roughly \n$1.1 trillion higher.\n  Let me say that again. The Treasury Department points out that \ninterest on the national debt in the second 10 years caused by the $1.8 \ntrillion in lost revenues would be roughly $1.1 trillion higher.\n  That makes a total cost of the Republican tax cut plan in the years \n2010 through 2019 of $2.9 trillion. The increased interest due on the \nnational debt of $1.1 trillion caused by the Republican tax cut plan is \ngreater than the total amount of their tax cut for the first ten years, \nwhich was $792 billion. These massive drains on the U.S. Treasury would \ntake place at the very time when the baby-boom generation is retiring \nin huge numbers and placing a great strain on the Social Security and \nMedicare trust funds. This tax cut plan, in my view, represents the \nabsolute omega of irresponsibility. It passes on to our children and \ngrandchildren in the years 2010 through 2019 a $2.9 trillion drain on \nthe U.S. Treasury. The Republican tax cut would have us spend $2.9 \ntrillion over the decade 2010 through 2019 right now, regardless of \nwhether that drain makes it impossible for the country to meet its \nSocial Security and Medicare obligations for its senior citizens.\n\n  Recently the Washington Post carried a political cartoon by Herblock \non one of its pages, which I have here on this chart. As one can see, \nat the top of the cartoon appeared these words: ``Back for an \nindefinite run!''\n  Let me say that again: ``Back for an indefinite run!'' ``Rosy \nScenario''--whoopee, we have heard of her, haven't we? ``Rosy \nScenario--and her long line of stunning surplus sugarplums.''\n  The cartoon depicts Rosy--there she is, all ready for the show--in a \ncostume with dancing girls and throwing dollar bills in the air. There \nis a song, ``Pennies from Heaven.'' But Mr. President, these are dollar \nbills! Holy Smoke! Rosy Scenario is throwing them all about us. In \nfront of the theater in which she is appearing, what do we see? We see \ntwo eager customers about to buy their tickets for the show. One \nappears to be an elephant; one appears to be a donkey. They are both \ndepicted in business attire. The ticket salesman seems to have a \ncynical smirk on his face, as though he knows something that the \nelephant and the donkey, who are waiting for their tickets, don't know.\n  When I saw this cartoon, it brought back memories about Rosy. She \nfirst appeared on the scene in 1981 as a major player in the Reagan \nrevolution. When President Reagan took office, that so-called \nrevolution was based on supply-side economic ideology that called for \nmassive tax cuts. That was before more than two-thirds of the Senators \nhere today arrived--almost two-thirds, to be exact. Sixty-three \nSenators are here today who were not here when I was majority leader \nthe third time, 1987 and 1988. But we are talking about 1981. Even more \nSenators were not here then.\n  That so-called revolution was based on supply-side economic ideology \nthat called, again, for massive tax cuts, a large buildup in defense \nspending, and balancing the Federal budget; all were going to be done. \nThose were the principal budgetary concepts the Reagan revolution put \nforth.\n  There were many skeptics at the time as to whether those policies \nwould actually work. I was one of those skeptics. The Senate majority \nleader, Howard Baker, called it a ``riverboat gamble.'' Nevertheless, \nin 1981 Congress did enact a huge tax cut, and it did increase defense \nspending. Entitlement spending also continued to grow. What was the \nresult? The result was an era of the largest Federal deficits by far in \nhistory.\n  Furthermore, ``Rosy Scenario'' worked her magic numbers in the budget \nunder the direction of President Reagan's chief financial adviser, OMB \nDirector David Stockman. As a result of those policies, rather than \nridding the country of Federal deficits, the country saw for the first \ntime in history triple-digit billion dollar deficits in each of Mr. \nReagan's eight years in office.\n  In fact, the national debt stood at $932 billion on January 20, 1981, \nthe date President Reagan took office. Unfortunately, on the day that \nPresident Reagan left office on January 20, 1989, the national debt \nstood at $2,683,000,000,000.\n  This chart depicts the major causes of increased Federal debt for \nfiscal years 1981 through 1991. It shows that the 1981 tax cut over \nthat 10-year period, cost the Treasury $2.1 trillion. Those tax cuts \nwere offset by a series of tax increases that became necessary during \nthe Reagan years in an attempt to decrease Federal deficits. Those tax \nincreases equaled $800 billion. Entitlement and defense spending each \ngrew by $600 billion above inflation over this 10-year period. Interest \non the climbing national debt increased by $500 billion. The S \nbailout cost $200 billion. And, domestic spending was cut over that 10-\nyear period by $400 billion below inflation. That was a very \nunfortunate and difficult period in our national history.\n  The folly of the Reagan Revolution's fiscal policies is set forth in \ngreat detail in the book entitled, ``The Triumph of Politics'' by David \nStockman. As I previously pointed out, David Stockman was the principal \narchitect of the Reagan budgets until he left the Administration in \n1985. Perhaps the\n\n[[Page S9469]]\n\nbest summary of the conclusions reached by Mr. Stockman is found in the \nepilogue of the book found on pages 378-379.\n\n       The fundamental reality of 1984 was not the advent of a new \n     day, but a lapse into fiscal indiscipline on a scale never \n     before experienced in peacetime. There is no basis in \n     economic history or theory for believing that from this \n     wobbly foundation a lasting era of prosperity can actually \n     emerge.\n\n  Will we never learn!\n  Cicero said, ``To be ignorant of what occurred before you were born \nis to remain always a child.'' That is the value of history. That is \nwhat we are talking about, history, and history is about to repeat \nitself.\n  This can be a year of great opportunity for the Nation if Congress \nand the administration can work together on our budget priorities for \nthe coming decade. I do not think Congress needs to choose an all-or-\nnothing course of action, but we do need to jettison the political \npandering that is going on. This should not be an ``us versus them'' \nbattle; it is not a ``big government versus little people'' battle. So \nwhat should Congress do? The same as any wise investor would do:\n  1, watch our investments carefully and manage them prudently. Manage \nthe economy and watch out for inflation; 2, pay our debt. Pay down the \nnational debt; 3, cover the necessities. Don't short change our \nNation's core programs, such as education, health care and the like; 4, \nput aside what we need to put aside for a rainy day. Reserve the Social \nSecurity and Medicare surpluses exclusively for future costs of those \nprograms; 5, take prosperity in measured doses. Ease up on taxes \nwithout pulling the rug out from under projected surpluses.\n\n  After years of struggling to overcome a sluggish economy and mounting \ndeficits, America is well-launched on an economic renaissance. I hope \nwe in Congress can rise to the challenge and serve as wise stewards of \nthis economic prosperity. I hope we can put aside our political \nposturing and act in the best interests of the American people and the \nAmerican Nation.\n  Before the Congress takes this folly of a plunge, perhaps it is a \ngood time for a bit of a history lesson. It was more than 50 years ago \nwhen the Republican-controlled 80th Congress approved a massive $4 \nbillion tax cut. That was a massive tax cut--$4 billion--in those days. \nPresident Harry Truman--one of my favorite Presidents--vetoed that tax \ncut, calling the Republicans ``bloodsuckers with offices on Wall \nStreet.'' I am quoting Mr. Truman as saying that. It took three times, \nbut the Republican majority overturned that veto.\n  In his nomination speech before the Democratic National Convention, \nPresident Truman put forth an idea that we need to recall today. He \nsaid that ``everybody likes to have low taxes, but we must reduce the \nnational debt in times of prosperity. And when tax relief can be given, \nit ought to go to those who need it most and not those who need it \nleast, as this Republican rich man's tax bill did.''\n  Just as an aside, not only did Mr. Truman upset Mr. Dewey that year, \nbut the Democrats regained control of the Congress. The American people \nknow when the Congress is dealing with them squarely and wisely. They \nalso know when the Congress is playing political games with their \nfutures.\n  I am reminded, in closing, of the lesson conveyed by Chaucer in ``The \nPardoner's Tale.'' Three young men, searching to find and destroy \nDeath, were directed to a tree under which they found bushels of gold \ncoins. They immediately forgot all about their quest to find and murder \nDeath, and they set to plotting how to get the gold safely home. They \ndecided to wait until darkness fell, and they drew lots to see which of \nthe three would be sent into town to buy food and wine for all of them. \nThe youngest was chosen. While he was gone, the other two decided to \nkill him upon his return so as to keep more of the gold for themselves. \nIn the meanwhile, the youngest, as he went into town, decided to poison \nthe other two so as to keep it all for himself. When he returned to the \ntree, the two waiting men pounced upon him and killed him. And then \nthey drank the poisoned wine and died.\n  Let us heed the warning of ``The Pardoner's Tale'' and not allow the \nglitter of gold to blind us to the common good of the Nation. Congress \nhas the ability, the wisdom, and the means to chart a wise budget \ncourse for our Nation's future. Let us hope that Congress can also \nmuster the maturity to put aside election year rhetoric in favor of \nsound fiscal policy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee. I rise \nenthusiastically to speak in favor of the legislation that is before \nus, the proposal to give Americans a $790 billion increase in our \nafter-tax income. I want to, first of all, address this question about \nthe size, which is one of the things I hear most about when I go home. \nCan we afford to do it? The distinguished Senator from West Virginia, \nthe ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, has just spoken \nabout that as well.\n  I believe this is a prudent amount. I do not believe this is going to \nundo the great progress we have made beginning way back in 1990 and the \nfirst balanced budget proposal for which I voted. We had another one in \n1993, and another in 1997. Taken together, they have all contributed to \nthe elimination of our deficit and the very strong economic growth \nwhich we have to be careful not to undo.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, though they obviously will from time \nto time make mistakes, forecasts that there will be $3 trillion more \ncoming in over the next 10 years than we have in obligated \nexpenditures. While I favor significant debt reduction, I think one \nwould have to imagine some pretty unusual economic circumstances to \nimagine a downturn in the economy that would eliminate a $3 trillion \nforecast. It is asked: To what level do we have to get? Does it have to \nbe $5 trillion before we can give the American people back some of \ntheir money?\n  This, it seems to me, is a reasonable proposal, a moderate proposal. \nOne could make a case for an even larger cut in taxes, and the best way \nof illustrating that is if we were to imagine that the budget was \nbalanced and CBO said that over the next 10 years we anticipate exactly \nthe amount of revenue coming in that is needed to meet the expenditures \nthat are forecast, and I walked down here to the floor and offered a \npiece of legislation to increase taxes $2 trillion, I doubt I would get \na single vote.\n  Well, I would actually have to offer a proposal to increase taxes \n$2.1 trillion to find myself in a situation where we are today. We are \ntalking about reducing the projected surplus from $2.9 trillion down to \n$2.1 trillion. This is an increase in the after-tax income for the \nAmerican household. I calculate that, in Nebraska, it means about $4 \nbillion worth of increased income for households that is not taken into \nWashington, DC. That is a significant amount of money.\n  Not only is there broad-based tax relief in here with a reduction in \nthe rate from 15 to 14 percent, but there are a number of other things \nthat will happen that I consider to be good. We have about 130,000 \nNebraskans without health insurance. One of the reasons is that our tax \npolicy doesn't favor an individual who makes a purchase of health \ninsurance. This proposal will enable many of those 130,000 people to be \nable to afford that because there is an above-the-line deduction in \nthis proposal for individuals. There are 400,000 households in Nebraska \nthat I estimate will benefit from the savings section in the proposal \nof the distinguished chairman of our committee--people who are trying \nto figure out how do I save for my own retirement. I know Social \nSecurity doesn't provide me with everything I need. I know I need some \nkind of savings or pension.\n\n  This has significant reform in our pension laws, making it extremely \nlikely that people right now who don't have pensions for small \nbusinesses will have pensions in companies that employ relatively small \nnumbers of people.\n  So in addition to providing $4 billion worth of additional after-tax \nincome to the people of the State of Nebraska, this proposal will also \nhelp them save for their retirement. It will result in an increasing \nnumber of Nebraskans who\n\n[[Page S9470]]\n\nhave health insurance, and, in addition, it is going to make it easier \nfor working-class families to send their children to college.\n  There is a deduction here for interest on student loans. One of the \nmost alarming things I see today in the State is the amount of debt \nstudents are acquiring in order to be able to get a college degree. It \nwill increase the amount of charitable giving in Nebraska. We have a \nproblem with that today. The charitable giving is flat, and we have \nquestions being asked about how we can increase that amount. This \nproposal will increase the charitable giving.\n  There are 180,000 Nebraskans who will applaud this piece of \nlegislation because it eliminates the current tax penalty on them as a \nconsequence of their being married.\n  This is a good proposal.\n  There is a $3 trillion surplus being forecast over the next 10 years.\n  This is a moderate proposal. One could have argued for a larger one.\n  Not only did the chairman of our committee put together a piece of \nlegislation that is moderate in size, but he attempts to, in addition, \nhave broad-based tax relief to solve real problems we have in our \ncountry--that is, individuals who are struggling to plan for their own \nretirement, individuals who are trying to send their children to \ncollege, individuals who are trying to purchase health insurance, \norganizations throughout our State that are trying to solicit \ncharitable contributions, and families who are angry because they pay a \npenalty once they get married.\n  This proposal will not result in our undoing the great progress we \nhave made since the first piece of legislation dealing with the deficit \nwas enacted in 1990, followed with the 1993 effort, and followed by the \n1997 effort.\n  This is moderate tax relief. It will be significant for the people of \nthe State of Nebraska. It will not bring back inflation that Mr. \nGreenspan talked about because of the way the chairman has drawn the \nbill.\n  I have been asked by people: How can you possibly do this? It is not \neven a close call for me. It is not even close.\n  I feel extremely enthusiastic about this proposal, about both the \ndollar size and the makeup of the things that are in it.\n  I think one of the things that would have made this thing very \nattractive to Senators on this side of the aisle, and I believe many on \nthe Republican side as well, is if we could have found a way to include \nan increase in the standard deduction--that is in Senator Moynihan's \nproposal that he will offer later--that would haven taken 3 million \npeople in America completely off the tax rolls. It would take 9 million \npeople that are currently itemizing deductions and put them in a \nstandard deduction category.\n\n  The proposal would have made it even better from the standpoint of \nworking families.\n  In the small amount of time I have remaining, there are three \nremaining problems this proposal doesn't even pretend to address and \nshould attempt to address. I have heard people talk about it a lot.\n  No. 1, discretionary spending. This tax cut is not the threat to \ndiscretionary spending.\n  We have tremendous discretionary spending problems right now.\n  Everybody knows VA-HUD is in trouble.\n  We have significant cuts to veterans that are not what anybody wants.\n  We have problems in Labor-HHS as well.\n  We know we have problems. There is no tax cut that preceded them. \nWhat is causing that is the growing cost of mandatory programs that in \nthe budget we passed in 1997 says that between now and 2009, 56 percent \nof our budget currently going to mandatory programs will grow to 70 \npercent. The discretionary programs will go from 31 percent to 27 \npercent, if we are able to reduce the national debt and reduce the net \ninterest figure as well.\n  That is what is putting pressure on discretionary spending.\n  I know it is difficult to face it because it means we have to make \nchanges in those mandatory programs to reduce their cost, or you have \nto come to the floor and propose increased taxes to pay for all of the \nthings we want to pay for.\n  There is a problem with growing mandatory and declining discretionary \nprogram expenditures.\n  Second, there is a problem with Medicare--not just for the need to \nmodernize the program, not just the need to provide health insurance \nfor prescription benefits, but we should not, with the growing \neconomy--4 percent real growth and 3 percent real growth in quarter \nafter quarter--we should not with growth in the economy see the number \nof Americans who are uninsured go up.\n  There are an estimated 41 million Americans without health insurance, \nand 24 million of them are in the workforce. We tax their wages to pay \nfor health insurance for everybody else, but they don't have it.\n  That, in my judgment, is the problem with Medicare. It is not just \nMedicare. It is all health care that needs to be fixed.\n  Lastly, Social Security. Senator Thompson, I, and others intend to \noffer an amendment at the appropriate time. We know Social Security \nneeds to be fixed.\n  This is not like youth violence or Medicare or lots of issues that \nare extremely complicated--global climate change and others. This is a \nvery straightforward, simple, actuarial problem.\n  I am astonished that we are able to survive around here without \nanswering the question, What do you think ought to be done? The 150 \nmillion Americans under the age of 45 should not like a delay because \nevery year of delay means you have a larger cut in your benefits as a \nconsequence. That is the result of not doing anything.\n\n  Our proposal will cut payroll taxes by $1 trillion and increase the \nnet worth. It fixes Social Security and increases the net wealth and \nworth of American households by $1.5 trillion over 10 years.\n  That is the third remaining problem that needs to be addressed. We do \nnot address it by locking the money in a lockbox. That doesn't do \nanything to extend the solvency of Social Security, and I hope during \nthe progress of this debate we are able to make that clear to the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 14 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I thank the chairman.\n  First of all, I want to align myself with the comments of our \nprevious speaker, Senator Kerrey. I think he is right on all points.\n  I think the question really boils down to a very simple one; that is, \nwhether or not with a $3 trillion surplus it is reckless and dangerous \nto give 25 percent back to the people who created it. Or stated another \nway, now that we apparently are going to be in surplus, is this a time \nfor a tax cut or a tax increase.\n  The President actually over the next 10 years proposes a tax increase \nand $1 trillion more in spending as opposed to the tax cut we have \nproposed.\n  So it is really a very basic philosophical difference that we have \nhere.\n  First of all, I look at the tax burden we have today.\n  The reason we have this surplus, of course, is because of \nunprecedented revenues that are flowing into the Federal Treasury.\n  The primary reason for that is the unprecedented portion of Federal \nincome tax revenues that are flowing into the Treasury.\n  The income tax portion of the gross domestic product has now reached \n10 percent, which is an all-time high in the history of the United \nStates of America.\n  The average two-earner income family is paying 38 percent in taxes.\n  Someone reminded me the other day that even the serfs in feudal times \nonly had to pay a third to their masters, and these families are paying \n38 percent.\n  Tax day now is May 11. We are working for the Government until May 11 \nof every year. Tax revenue has doubled just since 1987. We have this \nrecord level of tax revenues as a share of our gross domestic product.\n  What do we do about that? This bill, first of all, is addressed to \nthe lower and middle-income taxpayer. It is addressed to the small \nbusinessperson who is out there working every day to make a living.\n\n[[Page S9471]]\n\n  It gives some relief to those who want to save. It gives some relief \nto folks who want to invest. It gives some relief to folks who want to \nmarry. And it gives some relief to folks who maybe after paying taxes \nall of their lives, when they die, don't want to have the family farm \nor their business sold just to pay the tax man again.\n  It gives some relief to all of those folks. It will not hurt the \neconomy, as previous speakers have pointed out. As Chairman Greenspan \nhas pointed out, it is phased in. It is only about $38 billion for tax \nrelief for the first 2 years.\n  The President has more spending in his proposal--over $50 billion \nduring the same period of time. If you worried about the stimulus \neffect of the economy, talk to the President. Don't talk to us about \nthis bill. It reduces the Federal debt more than the President's \nproposal does.\n  But in response to this kind of tax burden, and in response to this \nreasonable--as Senator Kerrey said ``no brainer,'' really not even a \nclose call--response to a situation like that where we have this \nunprecedented situation, we have seen an unprecedented amount of \ninside-the-beltway hyperventilation.\n  The President, the Vice President, and members of the White House \nhave taken to the airwaves wringing their hands, and a different part \nof the sky has fallen every day. We are going to pollute the streams, \nour kids are not going to be educated, our military is going to go in \ndisrepair, and the Republicans are not looking out for the military \nanymore. And, that old reliable standby, ``We are going to harm Social \nSecurity and Medicare if we have tax cuts.'' It is called \n``dangerous''--a ``dangerous tax cut.''\n  I think that assumes a level of ignorance among the American people \nthat does not exist. I don't have time to talk about all of the \naccusations and charges and points that have been made to do anything \nbut have tax relief this year. I will discuss one or two in the limited \namount of time we have. Perhaps we can address the others later.\n\n  With regard to Social Security and Medicare, of course we all know it \nis a problem. Senator Kerrey pointed out the nature of the problem a \nminute ago again. It is not as if we don't understand the problem. It \nis not as if we will not have to face up to it. The question is when.\n  We have a demographic time bomb on our hands that will affect Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We are an aging society. Some people say that is \nnot a bad problem, that we are living longer. That is right. However, \nwe have to make some changes precisely because of that if we are not \ngoing to ruin our kids and grandkids.\n  In the year 2030, we will have twice as many people over the age of \n65 as we have today. Currently, we have almost four workers for every \nretiree; in 2030 we will have two workers for every retiree. After the \nbaby boomer generation we will have a smaller population, and a smaller \nand smaller workforce, with a doubling of the people drawing out these \nfunds. It will not work.\n  We have made some progress, at least in advancing the debate on these \nissues on a bipartisan basis. It is the first time I have seen issues \nof this magnitude and of this importance seriously addressed on a \nbipartisan basis. It is very encouraging.\n  We had a Medicare commission with Democrats and Republicans, chaired \nby Senator Breaux, that addressed this Medicare problem in a serious \nfashion. The President's response to that was to scuttle the majority \nwill of that Medicare commission trying to make fundamental reforms \nbecause they told us something we already knew; that is, we can't just \nkeep pouring money into a broken, worn out, outdated system.\n  I think as Senator Breaux once said: You put gasoline into an old, \nbeat up, worn out car and it is still going to be an old, broken down, \nbeat up old car. Instead of pouring more money on top of the system, we \nneed fundamental reform. We tried to do that. The President's response \nwas to scuttle it.\n  On Social Security, we had bipartisan bills in the Senate, with \nDemocrats and Republicans working together for serious Social Security \nreform biting the bullet. It is not the easiest thing politically to do \nbut somebody has to do it. The Democrats and Republicans together are \ndoing it.\n  The President was looked upon to have a little leadership. Perhaps in \nthese last couple of years he will want to exert some leadership when \nhe is not having to run for reelection. His response was not to show \nleadership, but to back away from serious reform, saying he will put \n$100 million worth of IOUs into the Social Security trust fund which \ndoes nothing to save Social Security, and represents nothing more than \na tremendous tax burden down the line when those treasuries are \nredeemed by our kids and grandkids.\n  While they are saying you can't have a tax cut, you can't have a tax \ncut, we have to save all this money for Social Security and Medicare, \nat the same time they are doing everything in the world over at the \nWhite House to prevent any real reform for Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  What about the question should we be saving all of the surplus for \nSocial Security and Medicare and others? The short answer is we are \ntaking 75 percent of these surplus dollars and devoting it to those \nvery areas by means of a lockbox, by means of setting aside Social \nSecurity, Medicare, other spending priorities. Mr. President, 75 \npercent goes to those things.\n\n  I think the more important point we will hear time and time again is \nthe President and Vice President on the airwaves hoping people will \nbelieve we are doing something bad to Social Security and Medicare if \nwe pass a tax cut. The primary point is that these surpluses we are \ntalking about are pretty much irrelevant to Social Security and \nMedicare. As the Comptroller General pointed out, if we put every penny \nin savings, if we put every penny of surplus into Social Security and \nMedicare, it would do nothing to change or rectify the fundamental \ninherent problems we face with those two programs.\n  I think we can cite the Comptroller, as well as GAO, in saying the \nPresident's proposal actually makes the Social Security and Medicare \nsituation worse by pouring additional water into a leaky bucket with \nthe hole in the bottom getting bigger and bigger and bigger, and all \nthe time having to pour more and more water on top. What we are doing \nis buying a little time from the day of reckoning and convincing people \nin the short run all they have to do is concentrate on the short run. \nDon't think about down the road. Don't think about your kids or \ngrandkids. We will not address serious reform but we will start dipping \ninto general revenues instead of having some control with dedicated tax \ndollars, FICA tax money, dedicated to these particular programs. Then \nwe can keep up with it and see how we are doing, know when we are in \ntrouble. Forget that. We dip into general revenues. We have an extra \namount and we will dip into general revenues without any control, \nwithout any way to tell how we are doing.\n  That is totally, totally irresponsible. Yet after doing everything \nthey can to undermine the Social Security and Medicare long-term \nproblem solution the Democrats and Republicans have been trying to work \non, after doing everything they can to work against that, they, in \nturn, use that as a shield to say: Because we are not willing to \naddress that, you have to go along with us and spend an extra $1 \ntrillion to temporarily buy a few more years. Then they hope somebody \nwill come down the road later on with more political courage to address \nthe problem.\n  I think that is outrageous. Tax cuts have nothing to do with that \nproblem. We set aside 75 percent of the surplus for those matters to \nstart with, but tax cuts have nothing to do with the fundamental \nproblem we are facing.\n  The only reason I can see for this kind of overreaction to a tax cut \nwith these unprecedented surpluses is that the administration feels \nlike a person who has been wronged, an injustice has been done to them, \non the premise that it is the Government's money to start with and \nsomebody has improperly tried to take that money away from them.\n  For some folks, there will never be a good time for a tax cut. Over \nthe last few years, the President recommended three tax increases in \ntimes of deficits. Now we have a time of surpluses and his response is \nmore tax increases. I think it is a debate not just over tax dollars; \nit is a debate over power. The folks in Washington don't want to give \nup power. It is a question of who is going to make decisions with \nregard to\n\n[[Page S9472]]\n\npeople's lives. Will Washington collect money and dole it out as we see \nfit? Or are we going to leave it in the taxpayers' hands, at least 25 \npercent of the amount of money about which we are talking?\n  It is not this tax cut that is dangerous. What is dangerous is a \ngovernment that can never, ever go but in one direction: eating a \nbigger and bigger percentage of what we produce in this country. What \nis dangerous is an administration that will use this kind of debate to \nmask over the fact it is not willing to face up to timely problems. \nThat is what is dangerous. I think the American people see that.\n  I think the American people support this bill. I support this bill \nand urge its passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield all 16 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia, \nSenator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am here in the hopes of convincing \nmy colleagues to oppose the $792 billion tax cut, which is based on a \npremise of a projected surplus of $996 billion. We have just heard a \nspeech which basically attacked everything President Clinton has done \nand stayed away from the tax cut debate itself, and that is shaping up \nas somewhat of a pattern.\n  I am also here in the hopes of convincing my colleagues that the only \nprudent fiscal course, the only way you can strike a blow for our \nconstituents and for our country and for our place in this world, is by \ntaking advantage of this, what I consider to be almost certainly a \nonce-in-a-lifetime chance to take the projected surplus and use \nwhatever actually accrues from that to pay down the national debt.\n  It is very odd to me that the Republican Party and Democratic Party \nalmost seem to have switched. The Democratic Party appears to be the \nparty of fiscal responsibility. The Republican Party wants to be the \nparty of political expediency. That is a political statement on my \npart. I apologize for that, but I have to make note of my understanding \nof what has happened in the last several years.\n  I think we should take this money to take down the debt. I think we \nshould use it to save for Medicare and Social Security's future. I \nthink we should position ourselves to be able, as Alan Greenspan has \nsuggested, if we see the surplus coming in the future years in the way \nthat we want, to then do a meaningful tax cut--once we have put our \nfiscal house in order. Remember all the talk about getting our fiscal \nhouse in order? That is all we talked about in 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993. \nThat was the talk--most of it from the other side.\n  We are almost there. Now we have come to the point where we can \nactually get over the hump, position America well for the future, and \nmy colleagues, at least some of them, want to blow all of this \ninvestment of effort and discipline we have made with a huge tax cut \nspending spree which the American people are not asking for, nor is \nAmerican business asking for.\n  First and foremost, let's recognize the $996 billion surplus only \nexists--and I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this--only \nexists if you assume that Congress will cut $775 billion in real \ndollars over the next 10 years from programs that the American people \nwant and need.\n  Does that mean we are adding on new programs? No. That is programs \nthat already exist, that are already under the budget caps and already \nbelow expenditure levels of where they ought to be. So that surplus \nexists only if we cut an additional $775 billion from programs, which I \nwill discuss in a minute.\n  That $775 billion in cuts is itself almost equal to the size of the \nRepublican-proposed tax cut. That should tell you something about the \ntradeoff here, whether the tax cut numbers really add up. Deep, deep \ncuts would be required in seniors programs, education, transportation, \nveterans--just about every area of the Government--an average of over \n30 percent if we are to enact a $792 billion tax cut the American \npeople are not asking for.\n  By deep cuts I mean the kinds of cuts in programs that provide health \ncare to veterans. People talk about veterans and then run away from \ntheir obligations to them. Or child nutrition--we all talk about \nchildren. They will have to be cut by more than 40 percent in real \nterms if the Republican tax cut is enacted. This assumption is \nludicrous. It is ludicrous. It is a sham that a massive tax cut of \neither $792 billion or, the so-called more moderate approach, the $500 \nbillion--they are both shams. They both have the same results. They \nboth cause us to reverse course on fiscal discipline and \nresponsibility, not just to the American people today but to future \ngenerations.\n  We should all have the courage to admit that now, before the Senate \nmakes a mistake of historic proportions, we are subsuming our \nresponsibility to the social fabric of America as we cast our votes. \nThat kind of debilitating discretionary cuts cannot happen in an \nintegrated and united America. The American people will not stand for \nit. I believe the projected $996 billion will not materialize. That is \nmy personal view. I do not believe it will happen. But the tax cuts \nwill kick in and they will be there. I believe once again we will get \ninto the situation of spiraling deficits that we have tried so hard--\ngoing back to the structural impediment talks with Japan, and then the \ndiscipline the folks on this side of the aisle exercised in 1993--that \nall of us have tried to exercise.\n\n  Fiscal responsibility--corporate America has done it. Now Government \nis in the process of doing it. We have eliminated the deficits. We have \na chance to eliminate the debt, something that has never even been \ncontemplated before. Now we are going to blow it on a Republican tax \ncut which the people do not ask for.\n  Well-respected economists estimate that there would be probably \ncumulative deficits of maybe $821 billion in the non-Social Security \nbudget over the next 10 years if the Senate Finance Committee's tax \npackets were enacted. It is a lot less than what is projected. That \nshould be reason enough to rethink a vote for this tax cut package, or \nany tax cut package of such gigantic proportions.\n  Let me take a minute or two to outline what I think would happen to \nour economy if a massive tax cut were enacted. Let us consider what \nwould happen if we actually voted to reduce taxes by $792 billion. \nForget the inequity of distribution. I can go into that, but I will not \nnow. Forget the cruel, gross, greedy inequity of that distribution of \ntaxes.\n  No. 1, if you vote for a $500 billion or $792 billion tax cut, which \nwould undoubtedly further stimulate spending, it is inconceivable to me \nor any rational person in this Chamber that the Federal Reserve would \ndo anything other than raise interest rates. I listened to Alan \nGreenspan this morning as Republicans tried to pin him into corners, \nyet he kept coming back to the point that this is not the time to do \nit. Do not do it now. There will be consequences if you do it now. Do \nnot make the tax cuts now. This is not the time.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, clearly says \nthat. It is not the time for massive tax cuts. If you credit him, as I \nthink most of us do, with being a part, along with the fundamental \nforce of the private sector, of our booming economy, then you should \nconsider what he has to say. One listens closely to every word he has \nto say because he has not missed one yet. Greenspan said just this \nweek:\n\n       The first priority in my judgment should be getting the \n     debt down, letting the surpluses run, and to, as has been \n     suggested here--[I am quoting Greenspan; this is all him]--\n     put in contingency plans so that in the event that all of \n     this is happening, you could move forward later, at a later \n     date, with tax cuts.\n\n  No. 2, let's examine what an increase of tax reductions would do, \nlet's say, with a 1-percent increase in the interest rates by the \nFederal Reserve. In West Virginia it would mean the average home \nmortgage holder with an adjustable rate mortgage of $60,000 would pay \n$456 more every year for that mortgage.\n  The average student loan payment, based upon $11,800 owed, which is \ntypical, would cost the average student $70 more a year. Add those up, \nand an average person in West Virginia will have\n\n[[Page S9473]]\n\nto pay $615 more per year in increased costs due to higher interest \nrates.\n  I encourage any Member to do the math for the people they represent. \nThat is the increase they will have to pay. Then you say: But there is \na tax reduction out there in the land. In West Virginia, the Republican \ntax rate reduction proposal will give the average West Virginia family \na tax cut of approximately $118 per year versus the $615 more they will \nhave to pay just on college, car, and home.\n  That is a tax cut? If they have to pay more money, that is not a tax \ncut. But you say: We have the proposed marriage penalty relief. Maybe \nthat is 100 bucks. Maybe that is a little bit more than 100 bucks, but \nstill that is an enormous tax increase on the burden of average \nfamilies in West Virginia. I am taking the average family median income \nof $30,500.\n  As far as I figure, it does not add up to the cost of what they will \nhave to pay in higher interest rates that are sure to accompany a huge \ntax cut.\n  Moreover, many of the people we represent benefit from the programs \nthat will have to be cut. I go back to the 40-percent cut in programs \nthat are now in effect and helping people; not new programs, not new \nspending, but programs in effect and already underfunded and staying \nthat way through the year 2002. Families with children in Head Start \nprograms will have significant cuts. We all benefit from a range of \nbasic Government services. The air transportation system is grossly \nunderfunded. We all benefit from that. Not all of us, but more and more \nof the American people are flying.\n  We benefit from what goes on at NIH in biomedical research. Cures for \ncancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and many other things are on their \nway. Or the assistance that is provided directly to the States--all of \nthese things will be cut under the Republican tax plan. Not just cut, \nthey have already cut, but they will be cut much more.\n  The NIH increase this year is minute. It will go down substantially. \nDo people really want to do this? Are my colleagues truly willing to \nsacrifice those benefits for the American people for a tax cut that \ndisproportionately benefits those who are doing best in our country \nalready?\n  Three, the Treasury Department just provided us with an analysis of \nwho benefits from the Republican tax cut when it is fully phased in. I \npoint out on the marriage penalty tax cut, there will be no relief for \nany West Virginians or anybody from any of our States for the first 5 \nyears because it does not kick in. All we do in West Virginia is pay \nmore taxes under a Republican tax cut because of what it inevitably \ndoes through the Federal Reserve System.\n  If my colleagues vote for the Republican tax cut, if they are of such \na mind to vote for the Republican tax cut, please understand that \nAmericans in the highest income brackets will get 67 percent of the \nbenefit of this bill. Can anyone call that a middle-income tax cut with \na straight face? If one divides up the quintiles--America divided into \nfive different income categories--it is gross, it is embarrassing to \nsee what happens in the distributional tables of who benefits from the \nRepublican tax cut.\n  How much is there for those in the lower brackets doing the best they \ncan? Very little. In fact, for those in the lowest quintile, which is, \nin fact, close to 23 million families, they get less than one-half of 1 \npercent of this generous Republican tax cut bill.\n  I suggest my colleagues should be able to answer these questions to \nthemselves before they have to answer them to their constituents.\n  Equally shocking is the fact that more than 45 million families in \nthe lowest brackets get a tiny percentage from this bill. The 23 \nmillion American families right in the middle get only 10 percent of \nthe $792 billion Republican proposal. That means, again, that three-\nfifths, or a little bit more, get only 15.5 percent of the total \nbenefits in this bill. This is wrong; this is dangerous tax policy. \nFrankly, it is dangerous social policy which will reverberate upon \nthose who vote for it.\n  Fourth, the Republican tax cut will increase mandatory interest \npayments on the debt by $141 billion over the next ten years. Mandatory \ninterest payments on the debt are already at about $227 billion. \nDoesn't that tell you in fairly clear and simple terms why we need to, \nin fact, pay down the debt to get rid of that obligation, to free up \nfor the capital market this money which is now crowding out private \nsector investments.\n  Five, if we spend every dime and more of our available assets in the \nform of yet unknown surpluses before we preserve Medicare and Social \nSecurity for the future, there will be no additional resources left to \nstrengthen those programs that we know the American people do want, do \nask for, do insist on, and do look to us to provide.\n  Medicare is desperately in need of modernization. It is desperately \nin need of universal outpatient prescription benefits. Social Security \nneeds to meet the needs of the baby boom generation. People on the \nother side and some on our side talk about we in Washington trying to \ndecide what is good for the people as opposed to the people know what \nis good for the people. The people out there know. Those whom I \nrepresent and my colleagues represent know they are not in it for \nthemselves. They are in it for their children and their grandchildren. \nIt is not just what they think might be best for them. They are \nthinking, yes, what might be good for them, but what is good for their \nchildren and grandchildren. That is the way Americans are. That is the \nway we have always been.\n  Six, and finally, for your consideration: If my colleagues cast their \nvote for a $792 billion tax cut predicated on those deep spending cuts, \nhow will my colleagues be viewed in their States?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank my Democratic chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  If my colleagues vote for this bill, will they be viewed as a leader? \nWill they be seen as somebody who is thinking for the long-term good? \nThat is what people want. That is what people yearn for, is leadership. \nOr will they be looked at as somebody who took the easy course of \nvoting to ``return tax dollars,'' or some part of them? Or will they be \nviewed as somebody who signed up to an economic plan that will limit \nour ability to protect Medicare and Social Security? My people point \nthat out. Even if they do not know it, even if they are not sure of it, \nin their own minds, wouldn't they question whether or not you are \nexercising leadership responsibilities or political imperatives?\n  When will these devastating cuts in the important domestic programs \naffect your constituents? Imagine--how would my colleagues respond to \nthat? What would my colleagues say to them? How would they view you \nwhen they discover that these things happened and they happened because \nof a $792 billion vote that you made? What would you hear from your \nconstituents if you agreed to $775 billion in very important \ndiscretionary cuts on programs people care about? These are not new \nprograms but programs already reduced, programs to be further \ndiminished by $775 billion. How would they view you then? Would they \nview you as a leader or as a follower of public opinion that did not \nexist in that regard?\n  Here is one example which is shocking to me, I say to the senior \nSenator from New York. The House is now considering reclaiming $6 \nbillion from the welfare reform money from the States--from the States, \nnot even from us, but from the States--to make up their shortfall on \nthe Labor-HHS budget. It is kind of ``reverse Robin Hood''--stealing \nfrom the poor to make sure we can provide tax breaks for the wealthiest \nof Americans.\n\n  I conclude my remarks simply by urging my colleagues, in the most \nsincere and intense terms, in one of the most important debates--the \nmost important debate I have been associated with in the 15 years I \nhave been in the Senate--to weigh these considerations against the \npossibility that exists for this country and for our people if we \nactually pay down the national debt--to accomplish the impossible--to \neliminate the budget deficit, to eliminate the national debt, and then \nto contemplate what kind of country this could be for all of our \ncitizens.\n\n[[Page S9474]]\n\n  I thank the senior Senator from New York, and I thank our colleagues \nand yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 19 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee for \nyielding me so much time and for letting me speak last on our side as \nwe begin the amendment process.\n  We have heard some awfully strong language here. Our colleague from \nWest Virginia begs us not to give Americans back some of this money \nthat we have taken from them in taxes.\n  We are projecting a $3 trillion surplus over the next 10 years. \nNobody disputes that. We have before us a bill that would give about 25 \ncents out of every dollar of the projected surplus back to taxpayers. \nOur Democrat colleagues say: Please, don't do that. Our President is \nquoted in AP on July 25 as saying that our effort to give 25 cents out \nof every dollar of projected surplus over the next 10 years back to \nworking people in tax cuts ``will imperil the future stability of the \ncountry.'' In fact, yesterday the President said it would hurt women's \nhealth care. Perhaps today it will be that it will bring back the \nbubonic plague.\n  But it is clear that the President is against giving back 25 cents \nout of every dollar of surplus--out of every dollar we are taking in \nabove what the Government needs. He thinks giving back 25 cents out of \nevery dollar is too much.\n  Our Vice President says that the tax cut before us is a ``huge, \ngigantic, risky tax scheme.''\n  This is very extreme language we are hearing. Let me try to explain \nwhy it is so shrill. It is shrill for two reasons, really.\n  No. 1, giving people back their money so they can spend it themselves \nrather than Government spending it for them hardly seems extreme to the \nAmerican people. With the projected surplus of $3 trillion, giving \nabout one-fourth of it back in tax cuts hardly seems extreme.\n  But the other reason the President and his supporters are so shrill \nis, the President is not telling the truth. Let me explain why.\n  I have a chart here that has the cover page and one page of text of \nthe analysis of what is called the Mid-Session Review. This is an \nanalysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that was just \ncompleted of the President's budget; that is, what he proposes we do \nwith the surplus, what the budget adopted by the Congress proposes we \ndo with the surplus; and then it compares the two. The important point \nbeing, this is not me talking, this is not Bill Clinton talking, this \nis the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office talking.\n  To listen to the President and to listen to our Democrat colleagues, \nyou get the idea that this is a debate between cutting taxes and paying \ndown debt. The problem is, that is not what the debate is about. This \nWhite House has turned misinformation into an art form. Here is the \nliving proof of it.\n  In the analysis of the Mid-Session Review that was just published by \nthe Congressional Budget Office, the Congressional Budget Office \nbasically has two findings. One, while the President had initially \nproposed spending some of the Social Security surplus, we have so \nshamed the administration that they now have agreed with us that the \nroughly $2 trillion of surplus caused by Social Security should be set \naside to either pay down debt or to fix Social Security.\n  It is interesting that we have voted many times on a lockbox \nprocedure to require that that money not be spent, and we have been \nunable to get the support of the minority in making that the law of the \nland. But that is something that at least to this point we have agreed \non.\n  Where the disagreement is--and the Congressional Budget Office shows \nit very clearly--is, what do you do with the non-Social Security \nsurplus? Basically, what the Congressional Budget Office finds, that \nthe administration desperately does not want anybody to know, is that \ntheir answer is, spend it. They are not paying down any debt with the \nnondefense discretionary surplus. In fact, over a 10-year period they \nspend every penny of it. And they spend so much money in their budget \nthat in 3 of the years they have to plunder the Social Security trust \nfund, basically, in contrast to what they have committed to do.\n\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office concludes, in looking at \ntheir own budget--and, again, this is the nonpartisan CBO--that in \ntotal, the President, over the next 10 years, would spend $1.033 \ntrillion of the non-Social Security surplus, which is a little more \nthan the entire surplus.\n  So when our colleagues are saying, don't give money back to \ntaxpayers, pay down the debt, they are not talking about their program. \nThe problem is, and the frustration is, if the President stood up and \ntold the truth and said, don't give this money back to families, let me \nspend it, don't give this money back to working couples because they \ncan't do as good a job spending it as the Federal Government could, \nthen we could have a meaningful debate. But it is hard to have a \nmeaningful debate because the administration basically is engaged in a \nconcerted effort to mislead people.\n  But numbers and facts are persistent things. The Congressional Budget \nOffice concludes two things about the Clinton budget that are \ndevastating. No. 1, it would spend an additional $1.033 trillion more \nthan the budget we have adopted and the spending caps to which the \nPresident is committed.\n  Secondly, and equally devastating, despite all this talk about buying \ndown debt, with Chairman Roth's tax cut, the budget adopted by \nCongress, which includes this tax cut, still pays down the Federal debt \n$219 billion more than the President's budget. Why? Because Senator \nRoth's tax cut gives $792 billion back to working families. The \nPresident's budget spends $1.033 trillion. As a result, even after the \ntax cut, the Republican budget reduces debt held by the public by $219 \nbillion more than the President's budget.\n  So his rhetoric is great. His sound bites are flawless. But the point \nis, he is not telling the truth. The reality is, the President proposes \nto spend every penny of the discretionary surplus on Government \nprograms and plunders Social Security for additional money in 3 out of \nthe next 10 years.\n  So the debate is not between reducing debt and cutting taxes. The \ndebate is between letting Government spend the money or letting the \ntaxpayer spend the taxpayer's own money.\n  But in addition to that, the tax cut that is being called ``huge,'' \n``vulgar,'' ``dangerous,'' by President Clinton and his supporters is \nactually substantially smaller than the massive spending spree the \nPresident would take us on with 81 programs.\n  I ask you, how can it be more dangerous to start to cut taxes by $792 \nbillion with a trillion-dollar surplus than it is to fund 81 programs \nand spend $1.033 trillion? Obviously, no one can argue that it is even \nequally dangerous. So what does the President do? He basically does not \ntell the truth.\n  Point No. 2, let's talk about: Why a tax cut now?\n  This chart really shows the highest 7 years in American history, in \nterms of the tax burden on working American families. The highest tax \nburden in American history by the Federal Government was in 1945 when \nHarry Truman was President. By the way, 38 cents out of every dollar \nearned in America is what we were spending on defense in 1945. That was \nthe highest tax burden in American history.\n  The second highest tax burden in American history is today. Under \nPresident Clinton, in the year 2000--which is the budget year we are \nconsidering--the Federal Government will take 20.6 cents out of every \ndollar earned by every American. That is the second highest Federal tax \nburden in American history.\n  The third highest is under President Clinton in 1999.\n  The fourth highest was under President Clinton in 1998.\n  The fifth highest was under Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1944, when \ndefense was 37 percent of the economy.\n  The sixth highest was under Bill Clinton in 1997. Hence, why we have \non this chart ``Cause of Record Taxes: War and Clinton.''\n  The seventh highest tax burden in American history was the day Ronald \nReagan became President. What did we promptly do? We cut taxes by 25 \npercent. So we have never had, except\n\n[[Page S9475]]\n\nunder President Clinton, tax levels approaching the level we have \ntoday.\n  Now, in terms of this ``dangerous'' tax cut, this is probably the \nmost telling chart of all. The day Bill Clinton became President, the \nFederal Government was taking 17.8 cents out of every dollar earned by \nevery American in Federal taxes. Today, we are near an all-time record \nof 20.6 cents out of every dollar earned by every American. Hence, \nsince Bill Clinton has been President, with the 1993 tax increase as \npeople have moved into higher tax brackets, the tax take on the \nAmerican people has grown from 17.8 to 20.6 percent.\n  Now, if we took every penny of the non-Social Security surplus, which \nis $1 trillion, under current services, actually, bigger if you take a \nspending freeze, but if we took every penny of that, and we are not \nproposing that here--we are talking about $792 billion, not over $1 \ntrillion--but if we took the entire trillion and gave it back in tax \ncuts, 10 years from now, when that tax cut is fully implemented, taxes \nwould still be 18.8 percent of the economy, and taxes would still be \nsubstantially above where they were the day Bill Clinton became \nPresident.\n  So when he is calling this tax cut ``dangerous and huge,'' it is a \ntax cut that would not get us back, in terms of tax burden, to where we \nwere the day Bill Clinton became President. It would still mean the tax \nburden during the Clinton administration, even with this tax cut, would \nhave grown by more than in any modern Presidency.\n  Let me address the idea that this is a huge, dangerous tax cut. It is \nvery interesting how people make up these things and nobody goes and \nlooks it up. But let me give you some figures.\n  We are projecting next year, the first year of this tax cut, that \nrevenues are going to be $1.9 trillion. We are going to collect that \nmuch in taxes. This tax cut next year is a whopping $4 billion. So out \nof $1.905 trillion of taxes we are going to collect, this would give $4 \nbillion back. That is .21 percent. Now, that is the ``huge, dangerous'' \ntax cut about which we are talking. It is implemented over a 10-year \nperiod. But over that entire period, what is being called a \n``dangerous'' tax cut would reduce taxes on the American people by 3.48 \npercent. So it is less than a 3.5-percent reduction in taxes, far less \nthan President Clinton would increase government spending, I remind my \ncolleagues, and somehow that is ``dangerous.''\n  Well, it is dangerous if you are Bill Clinton, because if we give \nthis money back to the American people, he can't spend it. There are 81 \nprograms he would like to have that he won't get. What the President \nshould be asking, rather than misleading people, is: Here are my 81 \nprograms. This is what I am going to do for you. I love you and this is \nwhat we are going to do for you. And we ought to be forced to say: We \nare going to give you this tax cut, and we are going to let you decide \nhow to spend it.\n\n  The people could look at the President's 81 programs and look at our \ntax cut and they can say, ``I would rather President Clinton do it,'' \nor ``I would rather do it myself.'' That is the legitimate debate we \nought to be having. But we are not having it because the White House \ncontinues to mislead the American public.\n  Let me make a few other points. Our colleagues keep talking about tax \ncuts for the rich. I have noticed there is a code here: Any tax cut is \nfor the rich. Any tax increase is a tax on the rich.\n  So when the Democrats pushed through the largest tax increase in \nAmerican history when they last had a majority, in 1993, that was a tax \non the rich. Remember? Well, it raised taxes on gasoline for everybody. \nDo only rich people drive cars and trucks? I don't think so. It defined \nas ``rich'' anybody who made $25,000 a year or more because that is the \ntax it put on Social Security. Now, I don't know about some of the \nStates that people may represent, but where I am from, $25,000 a year \nis not rich. But to our Democrat colleagues, obviously, since the \nClinton tax increase was a tax on the rich, $25,000 in income made you \nrich.\n  According to them, our tax cut is for rich people. They get very \nexcited about the fact that they have discovered when you cut taxes, \npeople who don't pay income taxes don't get tax cuts. In fact, they \nwill point out, I am sure a hundred times here, that 32 percent of \nAmerican families pay no income taxes, which I personally think is an \noutrage. I think everybody ought to pay something. But 32 percent of \nAmerican families pay no income taxes, and their obvious question is: \nWell, under your tax cut, 32 percent of families don't get a tax cut; \nhow can that be fair?\n  Let me explain why it is fair. These taxpayers don't get food stamps, \nthe great majority of them. They don't get Medicaid. And unless they \nare elderly, they don't get Medicare. They don't qualify for those \nprograms. Our point is that tax cuts are for taxpayers. When we are \ncutting taxes, if you don't pay income taxes, you should not expect to \nget a tax cut.\n  Some of our colleagues would like you to believe the Roth package \nbenefits the rich relative to the poor. Well, the plain truth is that \nthe Roth package makes the tax system more progressive, not less \nprogressive. Now, it is true that when you cut taxes, people who pay \ntaxes get to keep more; people who don't pay taxes don't get a tax cut. \nBut our colleagues have basically discovered that, over the years, we \nhave made the tax code more and more and more progressive. In fact, \ntoday, the top 50 percent of income earners in America pay 99 percent \nof the income taxes. So is anybody surprised that, when the top 50 \npercent pay 99 percent of the income taxes, that when you cut income \ntaxes, the top 50 percent tend to get more tax cuts? In fact, our \ncolleagues like to rant and rave about across-the-board tax cuts by \nsaying, well, a 10-percent tax cut means that Senator Rockefeller, who \npays at least 10 times as much in taxes as I do, would get 10 times as \nbig a tax cut.\n  I am not offended by that. If he pays 10 times as much, and we have \nan across-the-board cut, he would get 10 times as big a tax cut.\n  Let me run over these figures real quickly so people understand.\n  The top 1 percent of income earners in America earn 16 percent of all \nthe income earned, but they pay 32.3 percent of all the taxes.\n  The top 5 percent earn 30.4 percent of all the income earned, but \nthey pay 50.8 percent of the taxes.\n  The top 10 percent earn 41.6 percent of the income earned, but they \npay 62.4 percent of the taxes.\n  Should anybody be shocked when you cut taxes, when the upper 50 \npercent of American income earners pay 99 percent of the taxes, and \nthey are going to get most of the tax cut?\n  Only our Democrat colleagues and the President would be outraged \nabout that. Our view is that tax cuts are for taxpayers.\n  Who is rich? I decided to look at this top 50 percent of income \nearners and basically ask: Who are these rich people who the Democrats \nthink should not get a tax cut?\n  Let me go down who they are.\n  They are the 50 percent of people who pay roughly 99 percent of the \nincome taxes.\n  They are 62 percent of all homeowners in America. They are 66 percent \nof all people between the age of 45 and 64. They are 67 percent of all \nfull-time workers in America. They are 68 percent of all workers who \nwent to college. They are 69 percent of all married couples. And they \nare 80 percent of all two-earner households in America.\n  These are the people who the Democrats tell us are unworthy and \nshould get no tax cut--that these are rich people and they deserve no \ntax cut. They pay 99 percent of the income taxes, but they deserve no \ntax cut.\n  Let me tell you what the code is. The Democrats are always for a tax \nincrease, and the tax increase, no matter who it is imposed on, is \nalways a tax on the rich. They are always against the tax cut, and the \ntax cut always goes to the rich, and that is basically the code.\n  When you break through the code, the code is they are for tax \nincreases. They are not for tax cuts because they believe the \nGovernment can do a better job of spending your money than you can.\n  The final two points: We often hear from our colleagues that this is \nthe worst tax cut since the Reagan tax cut of 1981. This is the worst \ntax since the Reagan tax cut. Do we want to do it again?\n  Let me remind my colleagues the day Ronald Reagan became President, \nan average family in America making\n\n[[Page S9476]]\n\n$50,000 a year was paying $12,626 in Federal income taxes. They were \npaying 25 cents out of every dollar they earned. Thanks to Ronald \nReagan, today they are paying $6,242, or 12.5 percent.\n  The Democrats think that was terrible. This is the worst tax cut \nsince Ronald Reagan. They must have liked the tax burden under Jimmy \nCarter. They must have liked the 21-percent interest rates under Jimmy \nCarter. They must have liked the 13 percent inflation rate under Jimmy \nCarter. But we had sense enough to end that policy and let working \npeople keep more of what they earn.\n  Final point: Alan Greenspan's statements have become similar to the \nBible--nobody reads them very closely, and everybody quotes them. They \nquote him on both sides of the argument.\n  I would like to let him speak for himself. I would like to do it in \nthe context of what the President has proposed.\n  Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       If you find that as a consequence of those surpluses they \n     tend to be spent, then I would be more in the camp of cutting \n     taxes, because the least desirable is using those surpluses \n     for expanding outlays.\n\n  When the President is proposing increasing spending by $1 trillion \nover the next 10 years, don't we find ourselves in a position where the \nsurplus is being spent?\n  The answer is obviously, yes. It is being spent just as fast as it \ncan be spent.\n  Then Alan Greenspan is in favor of giving part of it back--in this \ncase a very conservative amount, 25 cents out of every dollar we have \nin surplus.\n  I think we should do it. I think it is the responsible thing to do. I \nbelieve we will do it.\n  If this is taking us back to the terrible days of lowering the tax \nburden, I am ready to go back.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nthe tax plan proposed by my Republican colleagues.\n  When I first came to the Senate in 1993, there were projected \ndeficits as far as the eye could see. The United States had not seen a \nbudget surplus in a quarter century. The American people were demanding \nchange after more than a decade of Republicans in the White House, and \nRepublicans in control of this body from 1980 to 1986. We knew we had \nto make some unpopular decisions to put our fiscal house in order. And \nworking with the Clinton administration, the 103rd Congress made those \ntough decisions.\n  We reduced the tax burden for the middle class and we restored some \ndegree of tax fairness to our system. We put the Federal Government on \nthe road of less spending, while maintaining commitments to core \npriorities. Some of my colleagues were defeated in 1994 because they \ndid the right thing for the future of America.\n  In 1997, Congress and the administration reached a bipartisan \nagreement to balance the budget and provide responsible tax relief to \nthe American people. At that time, we had no idea we would achieve an \non-budget surplus so quickly. Wise fiscal and monetary policies and a \nstrong economy have provided a projected surplus that gives us hope we \ncan solve some of the biggest challenges of our time. It is an exciting \ntime to be in the Congress.\n  But in our excitement about the projected surplus, I am afraid we are \nacting in haste. And in doing so, we could undermine the hard work we \nhave done to get to this point.\n  Let me be clear: I support responsible tax relief for the American \npeople.\n  I support further reform of our nation's estate tax laws so that the \nsmall timberland owner in Mason County, Washington, and the small \nbusiness owner who sells farm equipment in Moses Lake, Washington, can \npass their land and livelihoods on to the next generation.\n  I support deductibility of health insurance costs so the self-\nemployed owner of a technology start-up company in Seattle can afford \nhealth care.\n  I support reducing the so-called ``marriage penalty'' so that a young \nmarried couple in Spokane has more money to purchase their first home \nor begin saving for retirement.\n  I support expanding the low income housing tax credit so that we \nincrease the availability of affordable housing for low- and middle-\nincome families, especially in rural and urban areas.\n  I support the creation of Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts so \nthe apple grower in the Yakima Valley will have one more tool to manage \nthe risk inherent in agriculture.\n  I support the extension of the research and experimentation tax \ncredit so Washington state high-tech and bio-tech companies have the \nincentive and the ability to invest in their long-term future and the \nfuture of our country.\n  I support reforming the individual alternative minimum tax so that \nfamilies all across Washington state can continue to enjoy the full \nbenefits of the HOPE scholarship and the per child tax credit that we \npassed in 1997.\n  In principle, I support all of these ideas, and many others that have \nbeen proposed. However, we cannot afford to make tax cuts without \nconsidering and carefully weighing the consequences. The American \npeople deserve a responsible tax cut. They also deserve an honest \ndebate from this Congress about how the Republican tax bill would \naffect their lives.\n  The majority's tax plan is based on an assumption. An assumption \nabout what future Presidents and Congresses will do. They assume we \nwill have a projected $964 billion non-Social Security surplus through \nfiscal year 2009. My colleagues propose to use $792 billion of that \nprojected surplus over the next ten years to reduce taxes. They also \nassume that three-quarters of the projected surplus will come from \nunspecified reductions in spending by future Congresses.\n  To all the citizens watching around the country today, let me \nexplain. The 1997 balanced budget agreement called for strict spending \ncaps in discretionary, nondefense spending in fiscal years 2000, 2001, \nand 2002. In other words, the 17 percent of the Federal budget that \nfunds all Government activities besides Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid, and interest on the $5.5 trillion national debt is subject to \ncuts. That 17 percent funds the federal role in improving education, \ngiving greater access to Head Start, preventing crime, protecting the \nenvironment, providing health care to veterans, investing in urban and \nrural communities, maintaining national parks, creating affordable \nhousing, reducing traffic congestion through highways and mass transit, \nand many other important functions.\n  The projected surplus uses as its baseline spending targets \nestablished for fiscal year 2000. Right now, the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, of which I am a member, is struggling to move forward with \nbills. Even some of my Republican colleagues have indicated they cannot \nwrite appropriations bills within the current spending caps. For \nexample, both the VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies spending bill and \nthe Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education spending bill have \nnot been reported by their respective subcommittee because of the \nfunding difficulties involved.\n  The American people need to understand that this tax cut will \nmean massive, unprecedented cuts in important and popular domestic \npriorities.\n\n  If we assume that Congress will meet the discretionary spending caps \noutlined in the Republican plan, then nondefense discretionary programs \nwould have to be cut by 23 percent by 2009.\n  What does this mean for Washington state?\n  It means 23 percent less for Hanford cleanup. It means 23 percent \nless for salmon recovery. It means 23 percent less for community police \nofficers. It means 23 percent less for highway improvements and mass \ntransit to meet our growing infrastructure demands. It means 23 percent \nless for Head Start, which serves more than 9,000 children in \nWashington state. It means 23 percent less for reducing class size. it \nmeans 23 percent less for our VA hospitals. It means 23 percent less \nfor the management of Mt. Rainer National Park. But reductions in \ndiscretionary spending is far from the only concern with this tax bill.\n  This bill jeopardizes our ability to reduce our national debt. All of \nmy colleagues have worked hard to get our fiscal house in order. We \nhave successfully balanced the budget, provided reasonable tax relief, \nand contributed to the strong economic environment we have today. One \nof our priorities must be continuing to reduce publicly held debt. By \ndoing so we can decrease the interest payments on the debt that \ncurrently claim 15 percent of the federal budget. And reducing the debt \nwill\n\n[[Page S9477]]\n\nalso help keep our economy moving forward. Federal Reserve Chairman \nAlan Greenspan has indicated again and again that reducing debt is \npreferable to a large tax cut.\n  I have saved the most important issue for last: Social Security and \nMedicare. Throughout the past year, as it appeared we would have a \nlarge projected budget surplus over the next ten years, I have said \nrepeatedly that we should not raid the surplus for tax cuts until we \nprotect Social Security and Medicare for the long term.\n  I have listened to many of my colleagues talk about the importance of \nreturning money to taxpayers. Let me tell my colleagues there is no \nbetter return on the investment for taxpayers than saving Social \nSecurity and Medicare. This must be a top priority. If we fail to enact \nreal reform, we will be judged harshly--and rightly so--by our children \nand grandchildren. Our Nation's future economic security rests in our \nhands.\n  Saving Social Security and Medicare is important to all of our \nNation's seniors, but let me explain why it is especially critical to \nwomen and their families. Women are twice as likely as men to live with \na chronic health care condition. Women receive Social Security and \nMedicare longer than men, and for all women over age 65, 60 percent of \ntheir retirement income comes from Social Security. Often, Social \nSecurity and Medicare are their only hope for maintaining a reasonable \nstandard of living and some degree of independence and dignity.\n  If we fail to protect the solvency of both of these important safety \nnet programs, my generation will become a burden on our children. Our \ngrandchildren will not have the same economic opportunities that we had \nsimply because their parents will be taking care of us. More and more \nolder Americans would fail deep into poverty, further straining family \nand government resources, and most important the emotional and physical \nhealth of seniors.\n  My Republican colleagues claim they have created a lock box for \nSocial Security and Medicare. However, the Republican proposal simply \ncontinues to reserve the Social Security trust fund surplus for Social \nSecurity. But, they do not provide any additional resources for either \nSocial Security or Medicare and they do nothing to improve their \nsolvency. Their lockbox is an empty promise.\n  We can argue about the economic threat posed by this package of tax \ncuts targeted to the more affluent and geared towards increased \nconsumption, but I think we should be talking instead about maintaining \nthe most successful economic stability programs ever implemented by the \nfederal government--Social Security and Medicare. Can you imagine the \neconomic upheaval that the insolvency of Social Security or Medicare \nwould cause? I can assure my colleagues that hard working Americans \nwant economic security in their retirement years, not tax breaks they \nmay never even see or benefit from.\n  That's an important point, Mr. President. This tax bill, which would \ndo nothing for Federal initiatives--from Social Security to Medicare, \nfrom transportation infrastructure to education, from Section 8 housing \nto clean air and water--that raise the quality of life of low and \nmiddle income Americans would then give three-fourths of the benefits \nin return to the top one-fifth of income earners. The average tax cut \nfor the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers--with incomes of $38,200 and \nbelow--would be $139 per year. And in return for that tax cut, that \nsame family will have to worry even more about taking care of elderly \nparents, about where they will find money to help their kids go to \ncollege since there are fewer Pell Grants, and about how they get to \nspend some time with their kids when they are on congested highways for \nhours each day. And to top it all off, when the family goes on vacation \nto see our nation's national parks, the gates will be closed.\n  I will support the alternative drafted by my Democratic friends on \nthe Finance Committee. The alternative would meet many of our \npriorities for any tax bill we send to the President.\n  The Democratic alternative would provide broad-based relief to the \nmore than 70 percent of taxpayers claiming the standard deduction. It \nwould remove three million taxpayers from the tax rolls. It would also \nprovide marriage penalty relief. These are real benefits targeted to \nprecisely the lower and middle Americans that need it the most.\n  The Democratic alternative would allow 100 percent deductibility of \nhealth insurance costs for self-employed individuals and include a 30 \npercent tax credit for individuals without employer-sponsored plans. \nSince the Senate failed to pass a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, the \nleast we can do is make health insurance more accessible to all \nAmericans.\n  The Democratic alternative would make public school modernization a \nhigh priority. It would provide $24 billion in modernization bonds. Mr. \nPresident, this would send a strong message to students, parents and \nadministrators that this Congress cares about providing the education \ninfrastructure we desperately need.\n  The Democratic alternative would provide tax relief for our nation's \nstruggling farmers and ranchers. It would establish Farm and Ranch Risk \nManagement FARRM, accounts so that producers could better manage their \nincome to reduce risk. Given that it is unlikely Congress will act to \nimprove the long-term safety net for growers this year, FARRM accounts \nare the least we can do.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Democratic alternative. A vote \nfor the Democratic alternative is a vote for responsible tax relief and \nresponsible government. At a time when most Americans do not have much \nfaith in Congress, let us not compound that sentiment with responsible \ntax politics. We have worked so hard to correct the misguided policies \nof the past. As we move forward into the next century, let's learn the \nlessons of the past and reject the Republican tax plan in front of us.\n\n\n     RETIREMENT SECURITY PROVISIONS IN TAXPAYER REFUND ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address several important \nprovisions in the tax relief legislation that has been reported out of \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  In the last few years, I have taken an especial interest in reforming \nour federal entitlement programs and our tax policies so as to \nrecognize and to prepare for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation \nthat will begin in 2008. During the last Congress, I was appointed by \nMajority Leader Trent Lott to chair a Senate Republican Task Force on \nRetirement Security, on which Chairman Roth served, and provided the \nbenefit of his experience and his enduring commitment to promoting \nretirement saving. Our task force produced a bill, numbered S. 883 in \nthe last Congress, several provisions of which were included in the \n1997 reconciliation bill. I am pleased to see that several more have \nbeen included in this year's reconciliation bill.\n  I would like to review several of these provisions and to discuss \ntheir significance.\n  Chairman Roth has devoted several years of his career to promoting \nincreased personal saving through individual retirement accounts. His \nIRA legislation, the Roth-Breaux bill, was included in its entirety as \nthe first title of our comprehensive bill. The Chairman succeeded in \npassing some of the provisions of this legislation during \nreconciliation last time around, including the back-loaded IRA that has \nbecome known as the ``Roth IRA.'' This time, the Finance Committee mark \nmoves the ball still further forward on expanding the saving in \nindividual retirement accounts. It increases the contributions that can \nbe made to these accounts, as well as expanding the number of \nindividuals who can participate in them. Now more than ever, with the \nBaby boomers poised on the brink of retirement, ready to move from \nbeing earners and investors to being consumers, ``all saving is good \nsaving.'' It is a very propitious time to propose that individual \nsaving be promoted and encouraged.\n  I stress that we score these provisions, for our own accounting \npurposes, as ``revenue losers,'' but this is misleading. This is not \nsaving that is ``lost\"--it is only ``lost'' to the federal government. \nThis saving and investment will result in much-needed contributions to \ncapital formation and to economic growth. This is a far superior use of \nthis money than collecting it to fuel current government consumption.\n\n[[Page S9478]]\n\n  I was pleased to join in cosponsoring Senator Roth's legislation to \nexpand IRAs, and am further pleased that this reconciliation bill \nincorporates a portion of that expansion.\n  Senator Roth's IRA legislation was drafted before the task force \nbegan work on S. 883 in the last Congress. But there were several \nprovisions that were original to the task force of which I remain very \nproud, and I am pleased to see that they have received positive \nattention from the Finance Committee this year.\n  First of these is the ``SAFE'' plan for small businesses. This is a \nnew type of defined benefit plan that we worked to devise in concert \nwith others who also perceived the need to make such pension plans more \nattractive to small business owners. Right now, it is too often the \ncase that it is not in the interest of a small employer to offer such a \npension plan. The nondiscrimination rules are too complex, and the \nsmall employer may not feel that they can afford the fiscal commitment \nof such a size, uncertainty, and duration.\n  The ``SAFE'' plan neatly balances the need of employers to have a \nsimplified pension structure, with the desire to give employees fair \ntreatment and a pension benefit that they can count on. The rules of \nthe ``SAFE'' plan are very simple. Fair treatment is ensured by simply \nrequiring that the employer fund a benefit that is the same percentage \nof pay for each eligible employee in the shop. If one year's \ncontributions produce a pension benefit equal to 2 percent of pay for \nthe boss, then it's also 2 percent of pay for the employee--extremely \nsimple.\n  ``SAFE'' is a fully portable, fully funded pension plan that will \nwork. It's portable because the contributions are made specifically on \nbehalf of each employee, so it is easy to track how much of a nest egg \neach has accrued. If that employee moves on, that balance can move on \nwith them with a minimum of difficulty. It's also fully funded--simple \nrules dictate how much money the employer puts in for each employee in \neach year. It has to be enough to fund the promised defined benefit. \nEach year the accumulation in that account is tracked, and if it falls \nbehind the amount that is assumed to be needed using some flexible and \nreasonable interest rate assumptions, then the employer will have to \nmake additional contributions to make the employee's pension fund \n``whole'' again. The employer meets his obligations in a simple and \neasily understood way, and has no mounting financing problem at the end \nof the game.\n  I also note that the ``SAFE'' plan also is an important benefit for \nlong-time employees who have not been covered to date, because it does \nallow for ``catch-up'' contributions covering an employee's previous 10 \nyears of service. This is a helpful feature because of the assistance \nit will give to employees who have less time to prepare for retirement.\n  The Finance Committee proposal also includes several provisions to \nincrease the amount of contributions that can be made to SIMPLE plans \nor to other pension plans. I am pleased to note that it also includes \nseveral provisions championed by our task force that would benefit \nsmall businesses and the self-employed in particular. For one, it would \nequalize the treatment of self-employed and larger businesses with \nrespect to loans taken from pension plans. Right now, the self-\nemployed, subchapter S owners, partners, sole proprietors, cannot take \nloans from their pension plan as can larger businesses, and this puts \nthem at a competitive disadvantage. Our proposal to correct this \ninequity is included in the Finance Committee bill.\n  We also included a proposal that would remove a disincentive for the \nself-employed to make matching contributions to their pension plans, \nand no longer counting such matching contributions towards the annual \n401(k) contribution limit. I am pleased that a version of this proposal \nis also included in the Finance Committee package.\n  I am also pleased to see the number of provisions included in this \nlegislation aimed at addressing the problem of inadequate retirement \nincome for women, who make up the vast majority of our impoverished \nelderly population. Our task force considered our women's equity \nprovisions to be so important that we introduced them separately in the \nlast Congress as the WISE, Women's Investment and Savings Equity bill.\n  Some of the provisions of WISE were included in last year's \nreconciliation package, including the liberalization of rules governing \ncontributions by homemakers to IRAs.\n  We also included another provision aimed at giving stay-at-home \nspouses a chance to ``catch-up'' on pension contributions if staying at \nhome to care for a child interrupted their past contributions. We \noffered a provision allowing ``catch-up'' opportunities for individuals \nwho had taken maternity or paternity leave. The Finance Committee bill \nalso includes a ``catch-up'' provision. Though not specific to the case \nof families caring for children, the provision providing for larger IRA \nand pension contributions once the individual reaches the age of 50 is \nintended to serve the same purpose--to recognize that individuals often \ndo not have as much money to put aside in saving until their children \nare out of the nest. Giving parents a chance to ``catch up'' for these \nlost opportunities is a family-friendly reform.\n  I continue to believe that allowing ``catch-up'' contributions for \nindividuals who missed out on pension contribution opportunities \nspecifically because of child-rearing is an important idea, which I may \nstill wish to pursue. But I am pleased to see the provision in this \nlegislation and to recognize the chairman's effort to serve the same \nend.\n  Finally, a number of other reforms that I and the rest of the task \nforce have sponsored in the past also appear in this bill--including \nimportant portability provisions that would allow individuals in public \nsector employment plans to take their pension benefits with them when \nthey join a private employer. The current situation is an artifact of \nthe undue complexity of our pension law, and the incompatibility of \npublic and private pension regulations that has interfered with such \nportability until now. Public employees are often afraid to leave \npublic positions because they do not know whether their pension \nbenefits will travel with them, especially once it has accumulated to a \nsignificant amount that is critical to their retirement plans. \nEveryone's interest will be served by allowing these accumulations to \nroll over into other types of plans.\n  I simply close by again thanking the chairman for the level of \nattention that he has given to retirement saving in the Finance \nCommittee mark. As the chair of the Republican Task Force on Retirement \nSecurity, I find it gratifying to see that the chairman placed such a \nhigh priority for these needs among the competing objectives that \nSenators brought to crafting this tax bill. I hope that indeed ``the \ntime has come'' for many of these provisions on which we have worked so \nhard in the past, and I hope that they will be supported throughout \nthis reconciliation process.\n  I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that section 1502 \nof the bill violates the Budget Act.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 313(b)(1)(e) of the Budget \nAct for the consideration of S. 1429, and any conference report \nthereon, amendments between the Houses, and any amendments reported in \ndisagreement.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use.\n  Mr. President, the point of order against section 1502 is made \nnecessary by the antiquated provision of the Budget Act where \nprovisions were drawn to function in an era of deficits.\n  Even though the Senate instructed the Finance Committee to cut taxes, \nalmost everyone understood those instructions to mean the tax cuts \nwould be permanent.\n  Nevertheless, we must contend with the language of section \n313(b)(1)(e) of the Budget Act which forbids any reconciliation bill \nfrom achieving a net reduction in revenue beyond the 10 years for which \nthe committee was instructed.\n\n[[Page S9479]]\n\n  Of course, achieving a net reduction in revenues is our goal, as well \nas our instructions.\n  Moreover, the Budget Act provision in question was not written with \nthis situation in mind. It was not written to hinder refunds of a \nbudget surplus. Rather, it was written to bar creative accounting \nprovisions, such as those offered on this floor to delay the timing of \nexpenditures, or to accelerate the timing of revenue.\n  These were one-time only provisions designed to occur at the end of \nthe window--not for any policy reason but only to achieve compliance \nfor a moment in time with the relevant instructions.\n  I remember a military pay installment was once moved from the last \nday of one fiscal year to the first day of the next year, which was \noutside the window, to achieve budgetary savings in the earlier years. \nBut no provision of that sort is contained in this bill.\n  Rather, the question here is whether any tax relief can be permanent \nexcept for a very small percent of tax provisions.\n  It is a general rule that tax relief is permanent. This was true with \nthe last tax bill, which provided an actual tax cut--the Tax Relief Act \nof 1997. But that bill was paired with a balanced budget act of the \nsame year, the savings of which far exceeded the tax cut then provided.\n  Today, we face a new question under the Budget Act because it is \nunnecessary to pair this tax cut with another bill to cut spending. It \nis unnecessary because we have already achieved the goal that such a \nspending bill would hope to achieve, a surplus to fund a tax cut.\n  In my opinion, the Budget Act provision makes no sense if applied to \nthe current circumstances.\n  Everything I have said applies in equal measure to the Democratic \nalternative, and every other tax cut Members are anxious to propose on \nthe floor this week.\n  In sum, everyone thought we were instructed to achieve permanent tax \nrelief. That was the commonsense understanding. That is the better tax \npolicy. I urge support for the waiver to protect this legislation \nagainst an arcane budget rule never intended to apply to this \nsituation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. As my good friend knows, at the end of my statement \nthis morning I indicated I would raise this point of order against \nsection 1502 of the bill, which takes the 10-year provisions of the \nbill before the Senate and extends them for an additional 10 years. \nThat is clearly a violation of the Byrd rule which deals with \nincreasing the deficit on a reconciliation bill.\n  I am surprised to find my friend refer to that provision as \n``antiquated'' or ``arcane.'' We have spent 20 years trying to control \nthis deficit. We quadrupled the national debt in 12 years, from 1980 to \n1992. We have now reversed that. We have made the point on this floor \nthat we are providing tax reductions from a projected surplus that has \nnot occurred and may not occur. It certainly does not exist.\n  A few days ago, in a letter to the Democratic Members on our side, \nour dear friend, the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations, \nwith respect to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, used the word \n``floccinau\ncinihilipilification,'' and it was reported in the press this morning. \nHe got that word from the Senator from New York. Floccinau\ncinihilipilification is now the second longest word in the Oxford \nDictionary. It is from a debate in the House of Commons in the 18th \ncentury meaning the futility of budgets. They never come out straight.\n  I had the opportunity to review an autobiography of John Kenneth \nGalbraith years back in the New Yorker magazine. I added ``ism'' to \nrefer to the institutional nature of this, so it became \nfloccinaucinihilipilificationism. It is no joke. One never gets it \nright. It is not because one cannot, one does not try.\n  ``Exogenous'': Come in from the outside. Drought, hurricane, Asia \ngoes to pieces. We don't know what will happen. We have this surplus \nthat would match a $792 billion tax cut. However, does anybody believe \nwe know enough about the decade beyond this one to continue these tax \ncuts, many of which take hold later in the first decade, such that the \nTreasury Department holds that in the second decade the revenue costs \nwill be $1.9 trillion and the interest and consequence will be $1.1 \ntrillion. So the total costs would be $3 trillion, which is almost four \ntimes the cost of the first decade.\n  Surely we cannot be so irresponsible. It speaks of hubris to suggest \nwe know what is going to happen that far out. It speaks calamity, as \nwell.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota. I yield to the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the distinguished Senator from New York.\n  I rise to urge my colleagues to resist the move to waive the budget \nprocedures. I think it is important to remember the history. The budget \nreconciliation process was devised to expedite consideration of deficit \nreduction measures. That was the purpose.\n  The bill before the Senate now perverts that process by using \nexpedited procedures to secure enactment of a measure to increase the \ndeficit. Fortunately, Senator Byrd crafted the Byrd rule to prevent \nabuse of reconciliation's expedited procedures. He did that to protect \nthe fiscal integrity of the United States. This move to waive that rule \nis a move to undermine the fiscal integrity of the process. It ought to \nbe resisted by every Member, especially those who profess to be \nconservative.\n  Section 313(b)(e) of the Byrd rule provides that any provision in the \nreconciliation bill that would decrease revenue in years beyond the \nbudget window violates the Byrd rule and would be automatically \nstricken from the bill upon a point of order being waived.\n  It is clear this measure, this risky tax cut scheme, explodes in the \nsecond 10 years.\n  This chart shows what happens with the tax scheme being proposed. It \nstarts out modestly, but it grows geometrically. In the second 10 \nyears, it absolutely explodes. It goes from being an $800 billion tax \ncut over the first 10 years to being over a $2 trillion tax cut in the \nsecond 10 years.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I believe the Treasury Department estimated the second \n10 years is a $1.9 trillion tax cut, but we have to add $1.1 trillion \nin interest payments, such that the total cost is $3 trillion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is exactly right. The tax cut alone in the \nsecond 10 years is nearly $2 trillion. Obviously, there are additional \ncosts. Because of additional interest costs, if you spend the money or \nrun it in tax cuts, you lose the interest earnings. So you add to the \ninterest costs of the United States. That is why Senator Byrd put in \nplace this very wise rule, so we would not undermine the fiscal \nintegrity of the United States. Now there is a move to waive that rule. \nIt ought to be resisted. It ought to be defeated.\n  This morning a column in the Washington Post by Robert Samuelson \naddressed this issue in ``The Reagan Tax Myth.'' He pointed out the \ndanger, the riskiness, the radical nature of the tax proposal before \nthe Senate, and pointed out that it is all based on projections that \nvery well may not come true.\n  In fact, he pointed out:\n\n       . . . there is no case for big tax cuts based merely on \n     paper projections of budget surpluses.\n\n  He pointed out:\n\n       The projections, for example, assume a steep drop in both \n     defense spending and domestic discretionary spending that may \n     be unwise, particularly for defense.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Suppose that spending exceeds projections by one percentage \n     point of national income and that tax revenues fall below \n     projections by the same amount. In today's dollars, these \n     errors--not out of line with past mistakes--would total about \n     $170 billion annually. Most of the future surpluses would \n     vanish.\n\n  They would vanish.\n  Mr. President, I think it is very important. We have heard repeatedly \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle that they are only \nproviding 25 percent of the surplus in tax cuts. They are not telling \nthe whole story. They are being very selective about what they tell the \nAmerican people. They say we have $3 trillion of projected surpluses--\nprojected. Let's remember they are projected; they may\n\n[[Page S9480]]\n\nnot happen. And they say they are only providing $800 billion of tax \nrelief.\n  I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we check their math, we find the story is quite a bit \ndifferent from the way they are telling it. Of the total surplus over \nthe next 10 years, $2.9 trillion, nearly $2 trillion of it is Social \nSecurity surplus. Are they talking about spending some of this Social \nSecurity surplus? Are they talking about once again raiding the Social \nSecurity surplus? If they are not, then this should be taken right out \nof the calculation.\n  Then we have to take out an additional amount, about $130 billion, \nbecause if you provide tax cuts, or you spend the money, interest cost \ngoes up. So now you are down, instead of $3 trillion, to $870 billion. \nAnd they are talking about a $800 billion tax cut. They are not using a \nquarter of the money, unless they intend to use Social Security funds. \nFairly described, they are talking about using 94 percent of the non-\nSocial Security surplus for a risky tax cut scheme based entirely on \nprojections, projections that might not come true, and in the second 10 \nyears those tax cuts explode, endangering the fiscal integrity of this \nGovernment.\n  My God, after the progress we have made to eliminate the deficit and \ncreate surpluses in the last 6 years, to turn our back on that and take \nthe risk of putting this economic expansion in jeopardy? It is wild. It \nis risky. It should not happen. And the move to waive the budget rules \nthat protect the fiscal integrity of this country ought to be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota who \nwould like to speak on the motion to waive the Byrd rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. I \nactually was going to come down here and take a little bit of time to \nprepare for this, but I will just do this off the top of my head.\n  I want to say to the Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, I come \nto the floor to fully support his initiative, what he is trying to do. \nI think what the Senator from New York is saying is that we have a \nproposal on the floor, the Republican proposal, which after the first \ndecade is essentially going to explode the debt, and that really this \nis the height of folly.\n  I will not get at all demagogic right now, but I will say this. I do \nnot mean that other times when I speak that I am demagogic. I don't \nmean that at all. I will say this. When I hear the discussion about how \nwe need to give the surplus back to people, give it back to the \ntaxpayers, I say to myself--and I think this is what Senator Moynihan \nis trying to say, not just to the Senate but to the country--I say to \nmyself, this is actually not true.\n  Whatever we have by way of surpluses, assuming that our economic \nperformance will continue to be as good over the decades to come, that \nsurplus belongs to our children and grandchildren. We built up this \ndebt. We saddled this debt on them. We ought to make sure that whatever \nwe do doesn't explode the debt after 2010, that we make sure Medicare \nand Social Security will be available for them, and we make sure our \nchildren and grandchildren will have the same opportunities we have \nhad.\n  What the Senator from New York is doing with this point of order, his \nchallenge right now to the majority party's plan, is to essentially say \nthis. The people of our country, the vast majority of people in \nMinnesota, New York, and all across the country, are very intelligent \nabout this. The last thing they want to see us do is explode the debt \nagain. They don't want to see us do it because they don't want to see \nus go into more debt as a nation. They don't want to see their children \nsaddled with more debt.\n  There is one other point, which is a political point and also an \nideological point. If we pass this proposal, the Republican plan--and I \nbelieve the President must veto it--as we look to the second 10 years, \nwe are going to have such an explosion of deficits and debt that will \nmake it impossible for us to move forward on any of the initiatives \nthat do in fact give more opportunities to children, to allow some of \nthe investments we should make--not unwise investments, but investments \nin education, investments in child care, investments in economic \ndevelopment, investments in our urban communities, investments in our \nrural communities.\n  This Republican initiative will explode the debt. It is fiscally \nirresponsible. It will put us in a straitjacket where we as a country \nwill not be able to make any of the wise investments we should make in \neducation for our children and our grandchildren. This is a critically \nimportant initiative, I say to the Senator from New York, and I fully \nsupport his action. This vote is probably as important a vote as we are \ngoing to have over the next couple of days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I could not more agree with my friend \nfrom Minnesota, who has taught political science superbly well. Earlier \ntoday, in opening remarks, I commented on a theory that developed on \nthe conservative side of politics in the 1970s which held that the way \nto control the size of the Federal Government was to starve it of \nrevenue--``starve the beast'' was the rather graphic term. It was \nindeed. That was the effort in the early 1980s until they realized it \nwas not working. Just yesterday, E.J. Dionne wrote:\n\n       The long-time goal about which Republican leaders are \n     candid, is to put Government in a fiscal straitjacket for \n     years to come.\n\n  This is an idea with which we are dealing, not a bunch of numbers, a \ngrand strategy, and it will work if, in the second decade, we see a \ncost of this measure. The Treasury estimate is $3 trillion, an \nincalculable sum, which will paralyze, which will put the Government in \na straitjacket. We have no right to do that to another generation of \nAmericans. If they wish to do it, that is their right, but it is not \nsurely our option.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague from New York, \nthe point he just made is profoundly important. We do not have a right \nto make this decision for our children. The next century belongs to \nthem. We do not have a right to make this decision for other Democrats \nand Republicans who are in the Senate to serve and represent people. \nThis is fiscally irresponsible. It explodes the debt, and it puts us in \nan absolute straitjacket whereby we will be incapable of making any of \nthe investments we all say we are for to make this a better country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague for this opportunity to address \nwhat I consider to be a very important issue. Of all the freedoms we \nenjoy, I think the freedom to use and to spend and to devote the \nproduct of our own hands, the work we do to benefit our own families, \nis perhaps one of the most cherished freedoms of a free society. In our \ndebates about the theories of government and resources and whether we \nshould have tax cuts or increased taxes, sometimes we forget that it is \na fundamental freedom--a cherished opportunity for individuals--to \naccept the incentive, the opportunity, and the responsibility of \nproviding for themselves.\n  One of the things we want to provide for ourselves, obviously, is \ngovernment, so that we have a framework in which to work, which \nprotects our property, protects us, and protects our families. That is \nan important thing we do.\n  We have to be careful that we do not think we are working for \ngovernment rather than for ourselves, or that government should do for \nus those things we can do for ourselves.\n  As we think about how we deal with the resources that are generated \nby the enterprise and the productivity of the American people, we ought \nto think about the American people and the fact that the fundamental \nfreedom we cherish is being able to work, to produce something, and \nthen to manage that which we produce for our own benefit.\n\n[[Page S9481]]\n\nWe as a people have been so successful at it that we even are able to \nbe generous with that which we produce. But it is our own generosity. \nAmerica is the most giving nation in the world. Philanthropy here \ndwarfs philanthropy in other settings, but it is, in part, because we \nare allowed to keep that which we produce. Giving is greater here than \nany place on the planet because we allow people to keep that which they \nproduce, to manage it for their own benefits and for their families, \nand then to give it according to their desires.\n  We stand on the threshold of a debate about what happens when a \nperson works hard and creates something, creates resources, earns \nwages, creates wealth--that is what wages are. People earn that, they \ncreate it with work and decide how it will be devoted, what will happen \nto it.\n  We have a situation now where our Government has taxed the American \npeople to such an extent that if those taxes are just collected over \nthe next 10 years, we will have collected in that 10-year period about \n$3.3 trillion that we will not need to spend in that 10-year period. \nThat is why we call it the general surplus, the sort of global surplus, \nthe entirety of the surplus.\n  A number of us realized it would not be responsible to spend all of \nthat, so we said: Wait a second, there is a part of that surplus which \nwe will not spend, and that is the part that is the surplus related to \nSocial Security. We said there will be no expenditures of the Social \nSecurity surplus. It sounds simple and it sounds like something that \nshould always have been the case, but the truth of the matter is, for \nthe first time in recent history, in memorable history, for the first \ntime we had a budget in this body that said we are not going to spend \nthe Social Security surplus.\n  Frankly, on this side of the aisle, I am very proud of the fact that \nwe have been able to do that. It was not a budget that was voted for by \nthe people on the other side of the aisle. They did not vote for that. \nThat is not something they have ever done with one of their budgets or \none of the things they have done with their leadership, but it is \nsomething they fought against. We have done it, and it is now an \nachievement of the Senate that we have a budget which is designed to \nprotect every cent of Social Security, none of it to be spent to cover \noperating budget demands of this Government. That is a major \nachievement. That is something for which we can be grateful.\n  Secondly, we have a plan in place, even with the proposed tax relief \nfor the American people, that will cut the national debt, the publicly \nheld debt of America, in half over the next 10 years. That is pretty \nresponsible. They are talking about lots of things, saying we are not \naddressing the debt properly.\n\n  Never have I seen any budget in a previous setting ever purport to \nmove forward to cut the deficit in half in the next 10 years. Very few \nfamilies will try to pay off a mortgage in that period of time--very \nfew. We have an opportunity now, very responsibly, to set aside Social \nSecurity, which the American people want us to do, to take the budget \ndeficit of publicly held debt in this country, and cut it in half, \npaying down the publicly held debt by half in the next 10 years. And \nthen we will have some money, some resources that are left over in this \nvast infusion of Government resource that has come from the people. \nWhat are we going to do with the rest of it?\n  The Republican plan simply says a good part of that, some significant \npart of it, ought to go back to the American people. They should be \nable to spend it on their families, to do for themselves what they do \nnot need Government to do for them, because the best department of \nsocial services is the family, the best department of education is the \nfamily, the best department of health is the family.\n  Let's let our families operate. Let's fund families, not just \nbureaucracies. Let's fund people in their homes, not just the \nbureaucracy in its Government. That is what the Republican plan is.\n  There is a lot of debate now: If we can afford a tax cut for the next \n10 years, we have to make sure we do not promise the American people we \ncan have tax cuts on a permanent basis.\n  We are making this tax relief on very modest presumptions regarding \nthe prosperity of this country. We are presuming a very modest growth, \nvery limited. This is conservative.\n  It is not appropriate for us to say we will provide tax relief now \nand not provide it later. If we repeal the marriage penalty tax now, we \nshould not repenalize you ten years later. That does not make sense.\n  We simply ought to put the tax rates where we believe they reflect \nthe integrity of the American people and the productivity of the \nAmerican people and the fact that the American people are now being \nasked to pay more than it costs to provide the service. And we ought to \nreduce them, and we ought to reduce them permanently, not on a \npiecemeal basis, not with an automatic reinstater of a tax which is the \nhighest in history.\n  Why is it we are asked to have a tax cut and those on the other side \nof the aisle want to make sure we cannot make it permanent relief for \nthe people, that we have to promise somehow that the highest rates in \nhistory will be revisited after a 10-year lapse? I do not believe that \nis good government. I do not believe that is good judgment.\n\n  I believe when we lower taxes, when we lower the burden on the \nAmerican people, we are beginning to direct the assets of the culture \nto America's families instead of governmental bureaucracy. It seems to \nme we ought to do that on a permanent basis.\n  I do not remember tax increases that have said they only last 10 \nyears. It seems to me that when taxes have been raised in this culture, \nthey are just raised. I think we would be well served to say we are \ngoing to provide a tax structure that respects families. We are not \ngoing to say we will take the marriage penalty out of the code for 10 \nyears and then reimposed it.\n  If we are going to provide tax equity for people so that the lowest-\nrate taxpayers in America have an even lower rate, and more people are \npaying at that lower rate, we should not say this is a sale which goes \noff and later on your taxes will automatically be raised by some \nCongress in the future or at some certain date in the future.\n  It is time for us to say that the American people have simply paid in \nmore than it takes to provide the services. When you pay in more than \nit takes to provide what you are buying, you get change.\n  I go to the grocery store. When I pay in more than it takes to buy \nthe gallon of milk that I want to buy for my family, the grocer does \nnot say to me: I tell you what I'm going to do for you. I'm going to \ngive you a stalk of celery and a bag of broccoli and two boxes of \ncereal so you use up all the money you paid me. He says: You paid more \nthan is necessary for the services, and you get change. You get a \nrefund. You get relief. You get some of your resource back.\n  I think that is where we are as a Senate. It is time for us to look \nat this country, where our cost of government is higher than it has \never been in the history of this Republic, and to say that it is time \nto give people relief. That relief is appropriate. And it should be \npermanent, not relief upon which we could not rely, but that it should \nbe relief upon which we can rely, plan, and build for our future.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I observe in passing, the cost of government is not \ngreater than it ever has been. The revenues are. That is why we have a \nsurplus.\n  To my good friend, the Senator from North Dakota, I yield 4 minutes \nto respond; and then the remaining 5 minutes I yield to the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom New York.\n  The Senator from Missouri misspoke. He said that those of us on this \nside have not supported saving every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security. He is simply wrong. The budget we offered \non our side not only saves every penny of the Social Security surplus \nfor Social Security; in addition, we proposed saving an additional $300 \nbillion over the next 10 years to strengthen and preserve Medicare.\n\n[[Page S9482]]\n\n  So not only did we propose saving every penny of the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security, we also proposed taking another $300 \nbillion and using it to preserve and protect Medicare.\n  The thing that is really jolting about this discussion is what is in \nthis column that I referred to earlier by Robert Samuelson in the \nWashington Post today. He says:\n\n       The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a \n     program that is dubious as [to] both policy and politics. As \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other day, \n     tax cuts might someday be justified to revive the economy \n     from a recession or to improve the prospects of a sweeping \n     program of tax simplification. But there's no case for big \n     tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget \n     surpluses.\n\n  Members of the Senate, that is what is so radical about this \nproposal--radical, risky, dangerous. This proposal not only has massive \ntax cuts--94 percent of all the non-Social Security surplus over the \nnext 10 years--but it absolutely explodes in the outyears. A tax cut \nthat is $800 billion in the first 10 years becomes $2 trillion and \ncosts an additional $1 trillion of interest. That is exactly what the \nByrd amendment was designed to prevent. The whole reason there are \nexpedited procedures in budget reconciliation is to reduce deficits.\n  Our friends on the other side are trying to use those expedited \nprocedures on a measure that would increase deficits--blow a hole in \nthe budget, potentially a hole of over $3 trillion. That is dangerous. \nThat is not conservative. It is radical. It is risky. It is reckless.\n  When they say they are only using 25 percent of what is available--\nnonsense, absolute nonsense. Of the $3 trillion that is projected--and, \nremember, just as Mr. Samuelson points out--if these projections just \nchange a little bit, as they have over and over and over in our \nhistory, these projections of surplus could change to projections of \ndeficit, and we will rue the day when we have undermined the dramatic \nmoves we have made toward fiscal responsibility in getting this country \nback on track.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I just remind my colleagues, the Democratic plan has more \ndebt reduction in it than the Republican plan. That is a fact. It is \nindisputable. I hope my colleagues will resist this move to overcome a \nbudget rule to prevent undermining the fiscal integrity of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. The Senator from Montana is yielded the remaining time \nwe have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this debate is almost surreal. We are \ndebating whether to be reckless or not. It comes down to that, whether \nto be responsible or not. I am astounded that the Senate is having this \ndebate of whether to be responsible or whether to be reckless.\n  The numbers are clear. They are compelling. The logic is steel-trap \nlogic, with these numbers showing what this Republican majority budget \ntax proposal will cost--creating recklessness, irresponsibility. The \nnumbers are just black and white clear.\n  This side has come up with charts, numbers; we have quoted from \nobjective observers, columnists. It all comes out the same. This is \nextremely irresponsible. Let me remind my colleagues again why.\n  First of all, this is a column in a recent, very respected paper, the \nWall Street Journal, from a day or two ago: ``GOP Uses Two Sets of \nBooks. Double-Counting Surplus Keeps Alive the Notion of Being Within \nBudget.'' That is from the Wall Street Journal written by David Rogers. \nNo one accuses him of being a biased Democrat. He is a reporter of one \nof the most respected financial papers in the world, the Wall Street \nJournal.\n  This is his conclusion of what is going on: GOP uses two sets of \nbooks; double-counting.\n  I call that reckless. I call that irresponsible. Again, it is \nsurreal.\n  Let me point this out, again, undisputed. Nobody disputes this. The \nRepublican tax breaks explode, like the atom bomb, in the second 10 \nyears. Nobody disputes that. If you added interest to this, their tax \ncuts are roughly $1 trillion. There is nothing left over for anything \nelse--Medicare, veterans. If you add in defense, which I am sure the \nRepublican majority is going to do, that amounts to about a 40-percent \ncut, 40 percent in veterans' benefits, in education, et cetera. That is \njust the first 10 years.\n  Then you add it out in the next 10 years and it is over $2 trillion.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Plus interest.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So $2 trillion, plus interest on the national debt, at a \ntime when the baby boomers retire. Why is that so important?\n  Just one more chart here. It shows when the baby boomers are going to \nretire, when current younger Americans are going to retire. It is \nclear. The chart goes way up, beginning here in 2010, and the cost is \n$250 billion by 2020, at a time when the trust fund, the Medicare trust \nfund, comes to zero.\n  So add it all together and the Medicare trust fund comes down to zero \nin 2015. No dollars are left there. The baby boomer population is \nexploding and the tax cuts, which push us down into a deeper deficit, \nwill be exploding in the second 10 years. No wonder the majority party \nwants us to pass this motion waiving all points of order, waiving \nfiscal responsibility. Again, why are we debating this? Why are we even \ndebating whether to be responsible or irresponsible? It is clear.\n  One final point. We remember that dreadful day when a conference \nreport was brought back to this body with everything including the \nkitchen sink in it--everything--bills that were never debated in either \nthe House or Senate, tax bills that were never debated, spending bills \nthat were never debated. They all came back in one gigantic package. \nThat is going to happen if this motion passes. That is very \nirresponsible. It is irresponsible to us and to the American people.\n  I am just astounded, frankly, that we as a Democratic Party are in a \nposition of saving the majority party from themselves and, more \nimportant, saving the American people. What happened in the 1980s? This \nis history all over again. In the 1980s, this body, the Republican \nPresident and Republican Congress, at the time succumbed to the siren \nsong of huge tax breaks. What happened? Deficits exploded. Then what \nhappened? The Republican Congress was forced to increase taxes. The \nRepublican Congress and the President were forced to increase taxes \ntwice--in 1982 and 1984.\n  So I say if we, today, lock in these huge tax cuts for the future, \nthey are going to have to come back again to re-enact it and put it \nback in place at a future time. I don't think they want to do that. I \nurge colleagues to do what is right and not support the majority on \nthis motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware controls the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from Texas \nneeds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I could not hear the manager. Is the time \nyielded on this amendment or on the bill?\n  Mr. ROTH. On this amendment, on the waiver motion.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think there are a lot of ways you can \nargue this point. The Byrd rule, as the distinguished Senator from \nMontana argued, is to try to protect us from provisions that have not \nbeen debated, provisions that have not been considered in committee, \nbut provisions that show up in a reconciliation bill where we have \nrules that are distinctly different from the Senate rules, principally, \nthat you have limited debate for 20 hours and that, therefore, you \ncan't filibuster it and, therefore, you don't have to have 60 votes to \npass it.\n  I am a supporter of the Byrd rule. I think it is a good rule, and I \nthink it is a rule aimed at exactly the kind of offense that the \nSenator from Montana is talking about; that is, issues that have not \nbeen widely debated, issues that have not been considered in committee, \nand issues that have not had a full airing of public opinion. But can \nanybody argue that any one of those points applies to this tax bill? \nDoes anybody here believe this tax bill has not had a full airing of \npublic opinion?\n  The President, daily, issues some new statement. Yesterday, it was \ngoing to be the end of health care for women in America if we cut \ntaxes. For all I know, by this afternoon there could be a new coming of \nthe bubonic plague if we cut\n\n[[Page S9483]]\n\ntaxes. Daily, the Vice President comments on it.\n  We have had a running debate now for weeks on this issue. We held \nextensive hearings in the Finance Committee on the issue. We held a \nmarkup. We have had extensive debate. Nobody in America has any doubt \nas to what we are doing in this bill. So my point is that all the \nreasons we have the Byrd rule, all the reasons that were adequately \nexplained by the Senator from Montana, are good reasons to strike \nprovisions from a reconciliation bill. And that is, if the provisions \nhave not been widely discussed, if the public is not generally aware of \nthem, if there have not been committee hearings and a markup on them, \nyou don't want to give them the special privilege of being in a \nreconciliation bill. But surely I don't have to make a lengthy argument \nto convince people that none of those points apply here.\n  It is true that our Democrat colleagues, using this technicality, can \nforce us to sunset this tax cut in 10 years. They can do it. And in \ndoing so, we have the tax cut for 10 years. Nobody believes the \nCongress or the American people will just allow them to fall off the \nend of the Earth in 10 years. It is not the complete undoing of our tax \ncut if this point of order should be sustained. I don't know that it \nwould be of great practical importance. But I simply say that on an \nissue that is the No. 1 issue in the country, on an issue that has been \nextensively debated, on an issue where we held hearings and a markup, \non an issue where every American knows the subject is being debated--it \nis referred to on a minute-by-minute basis on most of the major outlets \nfor news in America--there is no logic to sustaining this point of \norder.\n  I really see this as creating instability in the Tax Code. It wasn't \nour intention to raise a similar point of order against the Democrats' \nbill. Basically, it seems to me they have a right to propose a \npermanent tax cut. We could have raised a point of order against such a \ntax cut if it had been proposed. We would not have done it--basically \nbelieving they ought to have a chance to say to the Nation what their \nvision is. We know their vision. They want to spend this money and they \ndon't want to give it back. It is perfectly legitimate; I just don't \nagree with it.\n  I hope our Democrat colleagues will not take this technicality as an \nopportunity to create a Tax Code that is in effect for 10 years and, at \nthe end of 10 years, it goes away. I think it is unstable. I think it \nis an irresponsible way of doing it. I don't object. The minority has \nthe right to do this. If we can't get 60 votes, they have every right \nunder the rule to do it. It doesn't undo our tax cut. It is not the end \nof the world. It certainly makes what we are doing still of great \nimportance.\n  I argue to those who have not hardened their hearts to a tax cut to \nallow us to have a permanent tax cut. If you are not for it, vote \nagainst it. We are willing to let you offer a permanent tax cut. So \nthat is really the issue. The Byrd rule technically applies to this \nprovision, but the logic of it does not apply. Therefore, I argue that \nwe should waive the point of order, and that is going to take 60 votes. \nThere are 55 Republicans, so if every Republican voted to waive it, we \nwould have to get five Democrats. My argument is, if you are against \nthe tax cut, great; it is perfectly legitimate to be against it. But \ndon't use a technicality to try to undermine a legitimate proposal, \nwhich has been debated extensively, which is known to virtually \neverybody who hasn't been hiding under a rock for the last 6 months; \ndon't use a provision of law that is really aimed at preventing \nextraneous material from getting into the bill to undermine basically, \nat least today and tomorrow, and I think for a long time, the No. 1 \nissue in the country. I hope our Democrat colleagues who are not just \nhell-bent against a tax cut will vote to waive this point of order so \nwe don't have the absurdity of adopting a tax cut and have it temporary \nand have it end in 10 years.\n  Hopefully, we are going to have an opportunity to improve this during \n10 years. I am still for it if it is sunset in 10 years. But I don't \nthink this is good policy, and I urge my colleagues to rise above the \npolitics of the moment and vote for good policy.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know our side is out of time, so I will \nuse leader time to make a couple of remarks with regard to the vote we \nare to take.\n  We all are able to use our rhetorical acrobatics from time to time, \nbut I must say, no one is better at it than the distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas as we try to define this set of circumstances.\n  This is a lot more than a technicality. The Byrd rule is there for a \nreason. I am glad he subscribes to the Byrd rule, but I must say, this \ngoes way beyond the debate we had in committee and the understanding \nthe American people and even Senators have with regard to what is in \nthe bill. This will give the conference, the Congress, the Senate, \neverybody, carte blanche all the way through the legislative process \nuntil this bill goes to the President's desk. Is that what we want to \ndo?\n  It would be one thing to waive a point of order and do so on the bill \nalone. That would be understandable. I might add, in that regard, it \nwasn't the Democrats who made the point of order; it was the majority \nleader. The majority leader made his own point of order on this bill. \nIt was the distinguished Chair, the senior Senator from Delaware, who \nmade the motion to waive the point of order. So let's make sure we have \nour facts straight. No one here made the point of order. They did.\n  But the point of order is not just on the bill. The point of order is \non the conference report as well. I want somebody to come up and tell \nme what is going to be in that conference report. There is a huge \ndifference between the Senate version and the House version, even on \nthe Republican side. There are major differences that have to be ironed \nout and worked out.\n  Is anyone here today prepared to waive the point of order on a \nconference agreement for which there has not been one word written, for \nwhich there has not been one meeting, for which really there is no \nunderstanding or comprehension today? How could we possibly waive a \npoint of order on something we haven't done yet? That is what our \nRepublican colleagues are prepared to do.\n  I hope we would have better sense than that, that we would recognize \nhow ill-founded it would be and what a terrible precedent it would be \nfor us to waive a point of order on actions to be taken at a later date \nby a conference we haven't even named.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Will the distinguished chairman yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Following up on the Democratic leader's question, when we \nhave passed a bill out of the Finance Committee, the Moynihan bill, the \nDemocratic version, and the Roth version, both for permanent tax cuts, \ndifferent amounts--ours was $295 billion, the chairman's was $792 \nbillion, but they were both permanent tax cuts--I think the point the \nDemocratic leader makes is a good one. I think I could possibly be for \nwaiving the point of order if it was against this bill that we all know \nabout. But to extend that to a conference report when we do not know \nwhat is going to be in that bill I think is probably going further than \ncertainly I would be comfortable going.\n  If it was limited to the bill that is before the Senate where \neverybody does know what is in it, I could understand that argument. \nBut to say that all points of order against anything that may come \nback--and who knows what may come back; I have my ideas about what it \nshould be, and others have different opinions. I don't know that we can \nwaive points of order against something we have not yet seen. I was \nwondering, why does the point of order waiver cover everything that has \nnot yet even been written?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I say to my distinguished colleague, if we \ndo not waive it with respect to the conference report, then we put the \nconference in a very difficult position. Should it write a bill for 10 \nyears, or should it write one for a permanent tax cut?\n  Just let me point out that I don't know of a single tax cut taking \nplace since we have had the Budget Act that was not permanent. I don't \nthink there is a single person in the Finance Committee or on the floor \nwho thought\n\n[[Page S9484]]\n\notherwise--that when you had tax cuts it was necessarily going to be \npermanent. That is just common sense.\n  We all know that the point of the Byrd rule in this case was to avoid \nmonkey business. We have all seen that happen, where you shift payment \nfrom one fiscal year to the next year by changing it but for 1 day and, \nby doing that, you assure that you are in compliance with the budget \ninstructions in theory but not in substance.\n  Now, we are all interested in seeing this economy continue to grow \nand prosper. One of the purposes of the tax cut is to ensure that it \nwill happen. I am weary of those who are saying, well, this is going to \ncause inflation, and so forth. That is just plain rubbish. If you look \nat our tax cut, practically nothing happens the first year--a very \nsmall tax cut. For the first 5 years, it is something like $156 \nbillion. So the big tax cut is 5 years off.\n  Let me make the point: Congress will be in session. People will be \nhere. They will be able to take appropriate action. If it is thought \nthat the tax cut is not desirable, there is nothing to prevent them \nfrom changing it. But let me just say, common sense--and that is what \nthe American people want to see displayed here on the Senate floor--\ncommon sense is that when you have a tax cut, it is permanent.\n  Every substitute, every amendment to be offered here is permanent. \nEven the Democratic substitute is permanent. Every reconciliation \nbefore on spending or taxes, whether it was a Republican Congress or a \nDemocratic Congress, has made permanent changes. Every reconciliation \nbill has depended on projections. There is nothing new about that. This \nbill is no different. It is not reckless; it is not radical; it is \ntraditional and common sense.\n  As I said earlier, everyone thought we were instructed to achieve \npermanent tax relief. That was the commonsense understanding. This is \nby far and away the better tax policy.\n  I urge Members to support the waiver to protect this legislation \nagainst an arcane budget rule never intended to apply to this \nsituation.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  All time having expired, the question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive section 313(b)(1)(e) of the Budget Act for the consideration of \nS. 1429. This vote requires a three-fifths majority. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Sir, I do not envy your position, but you seem to have \nhad some success.\n  I yield 20 minutes for a general statement by my associate on the \nFinance Committee, the distinguished Senator from Louisiana, the senior \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader of our Finance Committee. It is interesting; I think the action \nwe have taken really means no matter what type of tax bill ultimately \ncomes back to this body after the conference, we cannot make it a \npermanent tax cut. For those on our side who have argued for permanency \nin the Tax Code for research and development or tax incentives, that \nmeans we cannot do that. It means if we have an increase in the \nstandard deduction and fix the marriage penalty, we can't do that. It \nmeans all those things many of us as Democrats have argued should be \npermanent tax policy, now we are no longer going to be able to make it \npermanent no matter how good it is. The argument is true for the other \nside as well. No matter what comes back in the conference report, it \ncannot be permanent.\n  I think from a policy standpoint this is terrible policy. We \nliterally are telling all the businesspeople in this country and \nemployees in this country, people who save in this country, no matter \nwhat the law is today, it is going to fall off a cliff and go poof in \n10 years. What kind of roadmap for economic growth is it, when a \ncountry says our tax policy is only going to be good for 10 years no \nmatter how good it is? No matter how good a Democratic policy it is or \nRepublican policy, it is only going to last for 10 years. That in \nitself is very bad policy in this Senator's opinion.\n  At the same time, I recognize we are operating with our hands tied \nbehind our back with regard to bringing up a tax bill through budget \nreconciliation, with all these rather archaic rules. We ought to be \nable to debate fairly a tax bill, make it permanent. If you do not like \nwhat is in it, vote no; if you like what is in it, vote yes. But we \nshould not be restricted from offering tax legislation that is the \npermanent policy of this land.\n  We have had meeting after meeting in the Finance Committee, when \npeople have come up and said: You have to make these provisions \npermanent. I am\n\n[[Page S9485]]\n\nnot sure whether I am going to expand and grow my company if you are \nonly going to allow it for 10 years, and who knows what is going to \nhappen after 10 years.\n  That is not good public policy; it is not good tax policy, and it \npoints to the problem: the fact that we are bringing up tax legislation \nin this reconciliation scenario that requires us to operate as we are \noperating. I suggest to folks on both sides of the aisle, if we can't \nmake tax laws in this country for more than 10 years, we have done \nsomething that is very terrible for this country. I think it is the \nwrong thing to do.\n  Let me make a couple of comments on the legislation that is before \nthe Senate. Most countries around the world would love to have the \nproblem we have in this Senate and in this Congress right now. Other \ncountries would look at it as a great opportunity to have the problem \nwe are facing. We cannot seem to come to an agreement on it. That \nproblem is the United States has about a $1 trillion surplus, and all \nof us are trying to figure out what to do with the surplus. I suggest \nif we as a Congress, Republicans and Democrats, cannot come to an \nagreement on what to do with a $1.1 trillion surplus, we, in effect, \nhave said we are not very good at governing; that we cannot simply come \ntogether, make our points, seek legitimate compromise, and figure out \nwhat to do with a $1 trillion surplus.\n  I know there are some who want the President to be in a position to \nhave the Republican tax bill of $796 billion pass and send it down to \nhim at the White House and have a great ceremony vetoing it.\n  His argument will be that it is too large; it is too irresponsible; \nit is wasteful; it is going to cause the economy to go south; we are \ngoing to have an increase in interest rates. He is going to make a lot \nof good, solid political points when he has that veto ceremony.\n  There are those on the Republican side who I think would love that to \nhappen, in fact, because they will be able to say: No, the President, \nwhen he had the opportunity, chose not to give the American people a \nlegitimate tax cut, and he turned his back on the American people; we \nare fine with that political argument, and we will take that argument \ninto the election.\n  The American people outside Washington, in my opinion, have come to \nthe conclusion that they are getting very tired of those types of \npolitical positions being taken by Members on both sides of the aisle.\n  Under the current circumstances, we are headed for a financial train \nwreck because we are taking positions on both sides of the aisle: It is \nmy way or no way.\n  I suggest that type of position leads to nothing happening. Sure, we \nwill all at the end of the debate have an argument politically about \nwhose fault it was that nothing was done. Some will say it is the \nRepublicans because they were too greedy. Others will say, no, it was \nthe Democrats' fault because they did not want to give a reasonable tax \ncut to the American people. We will have good political arguments, but \nwe will have no public policy. We will have good political arguments, \nbut we will be arguing about failure and whose fault it was and whose \nfault it was that nothing was done. We will not have good public \npolicy, which we were all sent here to craft.\n  It is clear that in a divided government under which we operate, no \nparty can have their way all the time. If both parties take that \nposition, we will end up getting absolutely nothing done.\n  There are a number of us who have suggested that somewhere between \nthe $295 billion Democratic proposal and the $796 billion Republican \nproposal which the President has said he will veto, there has to be \nsome common ground. There has to be a way in which intelligent, hard-\nworking Members are able to come to an agreement somewhere in the \nmiddle and come up with a figure that is reasonable and gives a good \ntax credit to the American people and, at the same time, uses some of \nthe surplus money, the $1 trillion, to address the very serious needs \nand shortages we have in discretionary programs, such as veterans, \nhealth and education, and has some money in it for paying down the \nnational debt, has money in it for Medicare, which is obviously very \nimportant.\n  There should be a way both sides can come together and say: We don't \nhave everything we want but, yes, this is good public policy.\n  I suggest the American people are crying out for us to move in that \ndirection.\n  I and others have joined in offering an amendment, which we hope to \noffer tomorrow, which tries to take the approach of: All right, let's \ntake $500 billion of the $1 trillion and give the American people a \ngood, solid tax cut for those who need it the most, increase the \nstandard deduction for hard-working people, increase the amount that \nyou can earn before you are kicked up into the higher 28-percent \nbracket so people can keep a little bit more of their dollars. Yes, \nlet's fix the marriage penalty that encourages people, who are two \nsingle earners in the same family, not to marry only because of the Tax \nCode. Yes, let's do something for education and savings, but let's keep \nit at a reasonable figure of $500 billion, and then we can have the \nother $500 billion for things that are necessary or are needed.\n\n  The President has put some 320-odd billion dollars into Medicare. I \nwas privileged to chair the Medicare Commission for a year. I will tell \nyou that no one can tell this Congress how much money we need to fix \nMedicare. No one can make that assessment today because we have not yet \nreformed Medicare. How can we say how much we need to spend on Medicare \nuntil we reform it, which everybody agrees we ought to do?\n  Yes, ultimately the Roth tax bill will pass the Senate. A similar \nbill with the same size tax cut has passed in the House. I suggest to \nour leaders on both sides of the aisle, let's hold back trying to go to \nconference. Pass these two bills and hold them in abeyance and let all \nMembers, Republicans and Democrats alike, those in the House and in the \nSenate, go back to their respective States and respective districts and \nlisten to our constituents and ask them what their priorities are.\n  Do not look at the polls that Republican pollsters take and \nDemocratic pollsters take. I can give you the answer when I see the \nquestions they ask. Listen to the people and have town meetings and \ntalk about trying to work together to finish this problem and solve \nwhat I think is a real opportunity on what to do with $1 trillion.\n  I suggest that after we spend that time in August, we then come back \nto our respective bodies, the House and the Senate, and move quickly, \nas Senator Roth has said he will do, on reforming Medicare, real \nMedicare reform, coming up with good suggestions about what we need to \ndo with a system that was first established in 1965 which no longer \nworks as it should.\n  When we do Medicare reform, we will then know how much more money we \nneed in order to make that program work. When we find out what that \nnumber is, we can then combine it with a reasonable tax cut and have \nenough money for hard-working Americans and yet have enough money for \nMedicare reform with a good, solid prescription drug package to go \nalong with it, and then come together, join hands for a very rare \nmoment in bipartisan cooperation to do something which I think is in \nthe national interest, so that at the end of this year we will have \nmore than a political issue about whose fault it was that nothing was \ndone. We will be able to go back to our constituents and say that when \nwe had the opportunity to decide what to do with $1 trillion, we took \nthat opportunity and came up with good public policy.\n  I hope many of our colleagues can say: I think the Democratic bill is \na little too low in the tax cut, but I also think the Republican bill \nis a little too much of a good thing; therefore, I want to find a \nlegitimate compromise.\n  I suggest the word ``compromise'' is not a dirty word. It is \nsomething we should be seeking as Members of an elected body which is \ncalled upon to make Government work for everyone.\n  I hope when we do offer in a bipartisan fashion the $500 billion tax \ncut and reserve the other $500 billion for other needs of discretionary \nspending, to fix Medicare and reform it with prescription drugs, that \nwe will be able to get a strong degree of bipartisan support so we can \nall work together and hopefully, sometime in September, we\n\n[[Page S9486]]\n\ncan reach an agreement that makes sense and is good public policy. Good \npublic policy is also good politics. I suggest that is the approach we \nshould be taking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from North Dakota \nsuch time as he requires to express himself fully on the matter of the \ncommittee substitute.\n  Mr. CONRAD. May I withhold for the moment?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. By all means. I will take the opportunity to make a \nbrief description of the committee substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, it is our view that the roughly $900 \nbillion in projected surpluses for the coming decade can prudently be \nallocated in thirds: the first to be reserved for Medicare. We are \ngoing to have to get to Medicare. If we do not do it in this session, \nwe may do it in the next or the next Congress, but that time is coming. \nIt will require money. It will require general revenues, there is no \nmistaking that any longer. We think that keeping a third of a billion \ndollars for that purpose is prudent. In the meantime, it will retire \nsome debt and there will be some interest savings and we will have that \nmoney generally understood to be available.\n  We think another third has to be used to restore what we have come to \ncall discretionary spending. I wish I knew for sure from where that \nword came. I think Senator Roth would not have produced so devious a \nterm. Is the Marine Corps discretionary? Is the Coast Guard? Do we \nregard the Bureau of the Census as something we can do without? We did \nfor a while, letting the States do it, but since 1860 we have had \none. This is our general Government, and it is not discretionary, save \non the margins. Most of these functions have been with us a long time, \nand we need them.\n\n  The present arrangement is for drastic reductions in real dollars for \nthese programs over the next decade. It cannot go on. We have just seen \nthe painful scene of the House of Representatives providing an \nemergency appropriations for the year 2000 census, as if the census \ncame up like a hurricane or a flood. We have had one every 10 years \nsince 1790. It is not an emergency. It is just that it cannot be met \nunder these caps. So we think a third should be preserved for that \npurpose.\n  Finally, a third for tax relief, targeted to generally accepted \nprinciples that are widely based. We would have $189 billion in broad-\nbased tax relief. That would, most importantly, increase the standard \ndeduction by 60 percent. This would remove more than 3 million \ntaxpayers from the tax rolls and would provide an estimated 9 million \nmore to simply take the standard deduction. It is good tax policy. We \nbelieve it certainly is simplification.\n  We would like to have $27 billion for health care initiatives, \nincluding a $1,000 long-term care credit and a 50-percent deduction for \nlong-term health insurance to make health insurance affordable.\n  We look forward to $17 billion in education initiatives. That would \ninclude a large bond program for public school modernization and \npermanently extending employer-provided tuition assistance for higher \neducation.\n  If the Senate would indulge me, this latter provision is so \nimportant. I have now 23 years in the Finance Committee, and it seems \nevery other year we recommend extending it instead of making it \npermanent.\n  But if ever there was a palpable, demonstrably useful program, it is \nwhen employers send employees to receive education at various levels, \ncommonly graduate levels, because they want to acquire new skills for \nwhich they will be put to work at higher wages, and for which they will \npay more taxes, and that virtuous cycle I was talking about this \nmorning will continue. It is unreal we continue to keep it on a short \nlifespan. But this gives it a much longer period.\n  Finally, $31 billion in technological and economic development \nincentives, including an extension of the research credit. These seem, \nto us, to be widely based. They are equitable, and I hope they will \namend themselves to the Senate.\n  I see my friend from North Dakota is on the floor, is ready, and I \nyield him 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from New York.\n  I thought it might be helpful to review the record on how we got to \nwhere we are today as we put in context the choices that Senators have \nto make.\n  I think it is helpful to go back to 1981, the Reagan administration, \nand look at what happened to deficits and debt during that period, and \ncompare it to the Bush administration and the Clinton administration, \nso that we understand how we got to where we are today and what the \nimplications are for the proposals before us.\n  If we go back to the Reagan administration, I think we all recall the \neconomic history. We had, then, a major tax cut. The results were \nclear. The deficits exploded. The debt exploded.\n  Then, in the Bush administration, we saw a further explosion of \ndeficits, until in the last year of the Bush administration we reached \na budget deficit of $290 billion. The national debt had tripled under \nthe Reagan administration.\n  In 1993, we passed a plan, on the Democratic side, without a single \nvote from the Republican side, a 5-year plan to reduce the deficits and \nrestore our economic health.\n  That plan worked and worked beautifully. We saw reductions in the \ndeficit in every year of this plan. We saw in the first year the \ndeficit go down to $255 billion, and then we saw declines in the \ndeficit until we reach surplus.\n  That is the record of these three administrations.\n  In 1993, when we passed a 5-year plan that put us on the path to \ndeficit reduction, we had increased taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent \nof taxpayers on income taxes and cut spending. That is how we achieved \nbalance.\n  If we look at it from another vantage point, debt held by the public, \nwe can see during the 1880s the debt held by the public grew \ndramatically. It was only after we passed the 1993 5-year plan that \ndebt held by the public started coming down.\n  In fact, here we are today; we have seen significant progress made on \ndebt held by the public being reduced. If we have the wisdom to stay on \nthis course, we will see further declines in the publicly held debt. In \nfact, we can be on a course to eliminate the publicly held debt in 15 \nyears.\n  What have been the results of this economic policy? The results have \nbeen a resurgence in our national economic lives--the lowest inflation \nrate in 33 years, the lowest unemployment rate in 41 years, and we have \nseen the best economic performance since the Johnson administration \nback in the 1960s.\n  We can see the rates of growth of various administrations. In the \nClinton administration we see an economic growth rate of nearly 4 \npercent. We compare that to the Bush administration, 1.3 percent; 3 \npercent under Reagan; the Carter administration, and so on. So we have \nseen a period of sustained economic growth--in fact, the longest \neconomic expansion in our history.\n  In addition to the other positive benefits, we have seen a dramatic \nreduction in the welfare caseload. This is largely a result of the \neconomy. It is also a result of the welfare reform proposal that we \npassed a number of years ago. The percentage on welfare is the lowest \nin 29 years.\n  All of this is jeopardized. All of this is jeopardized by the risky, \nradical, reckless proposal that is before us from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle. Interestingly enough, the very people who are \nadvocating this proposal said, about the 1993 plan that has formed the \nbasis of the deficit reduction and the economic resurgence of this \ncountry, that that plan would not work.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee said about the \n1993 plan:\n\n       It will flatten the economy.\n\n  Senator Gramm of Texas, a member of the Finance Committee, said:\n\n       We are buying a one-way ticket to recession.\n\n  The truth: The economy has reached a new milestone--the longest \npeacetime expansion on record.\n\n[[Page S9487]]\n\n  We had a former President who said: Facts are stubborn things. \nIndeed, they are. The fact is the 1993 5-year plan, that passed without \na single vote on the Republican side, reduced the deficit and formed \nthe basis for an economic resurgence in this country.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle, the very ones who are \nhere with a radical, risky plan, were the ones who were wrong about the \n1993 plan. In fact, Senator Gramm, who was just speaking, said at the \ntime about the 1993 plan:\n\n       I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill \n     the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, \n     the deficit four years from [now] will be higher than it is \n     today and not lower . . . when all is said and done, people \n     will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, \n     Government will spend more money, and the American people \n     will be worse off.\n\n  Senator Gramm was wrong on virtually every count.\n  The fact is, the 1993 plan reduced the deficit and kicked off this \nextraordinary economic expansion: the lowest unemployment rate in 41 \nyears, the lowest inflation rate in 33 years. The fact is, the very \nfolks who are now advocating this radical, risky plan were wrong in \n1993, and not just a little bit wrong; they were dead wrong.\n  Now, let's check their math. It is fascinating what I have heard on \nthe floor today. Over and over the message is that we have a $3 \ntrillion surplus and we are only using one-quarter of it for tax \nrelief. Let's check that.\n  The truth is, the total surplus that is projected over the next 10 \nyears is $2.9 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \nBut what they haven't been saying on the floor is that $1.9 trillion of \nthat, nearly two-thirds, is Social Security surplus. So you have to \nsubtract that. That leaves a surplus of $1 trillion. When you take out \nthe additional interest cost that will accrue, if you are going to give \na tax cut of $130 billion, you are left with $870 billion that is \navailable of non-Social Security surplus.\n  What do our friends on the other side of the aisle want to do with \nthis $870 billion? They say, let's take $800 billion, or nearly that, \nand give it in a tax cut, a risky tax cut that has the potential to \nblow a hole in the fiscal discipline we have established--$800 billion \nof tax cut out of $870 billion that is available. That is not 25 \npercent, that is 94 percent, 94 percent of the non-Social Security \nsurplus being used for a tax cut--not 25 percent, 94 percent.\n  It is very interesting, the choices that leaves us with. We have \nnothing for Medicare under the Republican plan, nothing to strengthen \nMedicare, nothing for domestic needs over the next 10 years, and they \nhave got unallocated $63 billion.\n  Compare that to the Democratic plan that saves every penny of the \nSocial Security surplus for Social Security and then, in equal thirds, \none-third for tax relief, $290 billion--$500 billion less than our \nfriends on the other side--$290 billion to strengthen and protect \nMedicare, and $290 billion for high-priority domestic needs.\n  I think it is critically important that people understand when we \ntalk about domestic needs, what are we talking about for the next 10 \nyears? This chart shows what happens if we just have constant buying \npower over the 10 years, which is represented by this blue line. That \nis constant buying power.\n  Our friends on the other side say the Democrats just want to spend \nmoney. Let's look at the Democratic plan.\n  I have just indicated we want $290 billion for domestic needs. That \nrepresents this red line. That is a cut in buying power for the Federal \nGovernment from what we now have. If you just take last year's spending \nand add inflation, that is the blue line, constant buying power.\n  The Democrats are proposing cutting the buying power of the Federal \nGovernment. They are proposing cutting spending.\n  Here is what our Republican friends are talking about in terms of \nspending cuts, this green line. This green line means dramatic, radical \ncuts in education, in defense, in parks, in law enforcement. That is \nwhat they are talking about. Does anybody believe this is going to \nhappen? Does anybody believe it? It is not even happening this year.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that they are cooking the \nbooks on the Republican side because they want to spend more money and \nwant to act as if they are not breaking the caps. At some point we have \nto face reality and face facts. Facts are stubborn things.\n\n  This blue line is constant buying power. The Democratic plan proposes \ncutting Federal spending in real terms. The Republican plan proposes \ndramatic, draconian cuts, cuts that cannot be sustained, will not be \nsustained. In fact, they won't support them for defense, and they \nshouldn't. They are living with a fiction, and it is a fiction that is \nbeing revealed every day as the committees of Congress do their work.\n  Not only should we check their math but we should check the whole \nbasis for the projections that are being made to sustain a tax cut. \nLet's remember, the money is not in the bank. The money is projected to \ncome in.\n  I used to be in charge of projecting the revenue for my State of \nNorth Dakota. I can tell my colleagues, there is no 10-year projection \nthat anybody can have great confidence in.\n  Robert Samuelson, in today's Washington Post, said:\n\n       The wonder is that the Republicans are so wedded to a \n     program that is dubious as to both policy and politics. As \n     Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan noted the other day, \n     tax cuts might some day be justified, but there is no case \n     for big tax cuts based merely on paper projections of budget \n     surpluses.\n\n  In fact, he went on to indicate, if there was just a 1-percent change \nin revenue and expenditure from what is projected, these surpluses \nwould vanish. That is very much in line with what mistakes have been in \nthe past.\n  This tax cut scheme is not conservative; it is radical. It is risky. \nIt is reckless. It poses the threat of undermining all of the work we \nhave done to restore the fiscal integrity of this country that has \nplayed such a large role in restoring our fiscal health. This is not \nconservative. It is radical. It is risky. It is reckless. It ought to \nbe stopped.\n  Now, our friends on the other side of the aisle say tax revenue is \nthe highest it has been in a long time, but they are not telling the \nwhole story. Here is what the revenue and expenditure line of the \nFederal Government looks like going back to 1980 and carrying through \nto today.\n  The blue line is the outlays of the Federal Government, the spending. \nThe red line is the revenues. What we can see is, it has been pretty \nconstant over time. The reason we had a deficit was that the spending \nline was above the revenue line--pretty basic stuff.\n  In 1993, when Democrats, without a single Republican vote, passed a \nplan to balance the budget, we reduced the spending line and we raised \nthe revenue line. That is how we balanced the budget. We cut spending \nand, yes, we raised income taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent in this \ncountry. That is how we balanced the budget. That is how we got the \ndeficit under control. That is how we got the lowest unemployment in 41 \nyears. That is how we got the lowest inflation in 33 years. That is how \nwe got 18 million jobs created. That is how we restored this country to \neconomic health--by cutting spending and raising the revenue to balance \nthe budget.\n  There is one thing they don't tell us much about because I don't \nthink they want to deal with these facts. They are saying the taxes are \nthe highest they have ever been. The tax revenue is the highest it has \nbeen in a considerable period. That is what helped us balance the \nbudget, along with cutting spending. But what they have not talked \nabout is what has happened to individual taxes. Most individual taxes \nin this country have gone down. It might surprise you to hear that \nafter all the rhetoric on the other side.\n  These are not Kent Conrad's calculations; these are the calculations \nof the respected accounting firm, Deloitte and Touche. These are the \ncombined tax rates of income tax and Social Security taxes. It is very \ninteresting. This is for a working mother, the tax burden, with a \nfamily income of just under $20,000 a year. In 1979, their tax rate----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 15 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Would the Senator like another 5 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would. I thank the Senator from New York.\n  It is very interesting; if we study what has happened to the \nindividual tax\n\n[[Page S9488]]\n\nrates and tax burden of people in this country over 20 years, they have \ngone down. The Republican rhetoric suggests everybody's taxes are at \nrecord highs. It is not true. It is not true. This is the accounting \nfirm of Deloitte & Touche. They point out that for a working mother \nwith an income of just under $20,000, in 1979, her combined tax rate \nwas 8.6 percent. That has dropped to 5 percent today. Why? Because when \nthe Democrats passed that budget balancing plan in 1993--it is true we \nraised taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent, but we cut taxes on the vast \nmajority of Americans by expanding the earned-income tax credit.\n\n  Look at what happened to a middle-income family earning $35,000 a \nyear. Their taxes have not gone up. They have gone down. Again, this is \naccording to the respected accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche. In \n1979, their combined tax rate--income tax and Social Security taxes--\nwas 11.2 percent. That dropped to 10.5 percent in 1999, again, because \nwhen the Democrats passed the plan to balance the budget in 1993, we \nexpanded the earned-income tax credit.\n  Look at a tax burden of a family of four earning $85,000, and look at \nthe last 20 years. Again, their tax burden has been reduced. In 1979, \nit was 17 percent; it is 16.3 percent today.\n  Don't get me wrong. I am not suggesting that people don't deserve \nfurther tax relief. I believe they do. The Democratic proposal provides \nit. It provides it in a fair and balanced way, in a fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  That is not the case of the risky, radical scheme of our friends on \nthe other side. Their tax break explodes in the second 10-year period. \nWe have just stopped that, at least momentarily. But this program that \nthey have outlined of $800 billion in tax cuts explodes to $2 trillion, \nwith the additional interest costs that would add another trillion to \n$3 trillion in the second 10-year period. That is risky. At the very \ntime the baby boomers start to retire, they are going to undermine the \nfiscal stability of the country.\n  Those aren't the only issues that need to be addressed. We have \nalready seen how their tax cut explodes in the outyears, just as the \nbaby boomers retire. But we should also ask ourselves how fair is the \ntax cut scheme of our friends on the other side.\n  This shows the House bill that has already passed. Their idea of \nfairness is to give the top 1 percent of the people in this country 32 \npercent of the benefit. The top 1 percent get 32 percent of the \nbenefits of the tax cut proposal of the Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives, which has already passed. So for people earning under \n$38,000 a year, they would get, on average, $99. If you are earning \nover $300,000 a year, you get $20,000. That is not fair. That should \nnot be the policy of the United States--a tax cut plan that is skewed \nto the richest and wealthiest among us, that gives 32 percent of the \nbenefit to the richest 1 percent. That is not fair. It is not wise. It \nis radical; it is risky; it is reckless.\n  There is a better way. The Democratic alternative says save Social \nSecurity first--every penny of Social Security surplus for Social \nSecurity. And then for the non-Social Security surplus, to split it in \nequal thirds: one-third to protect Medicare, to extend its solvency, \nand to provide prescription drug coverage; one-third, tax reductions \nfor working families, targeted squarely at the middle-income people in \nthis country, the very ones who need tax relief; and one-third for \nhigh-priority domestic needs such as education, agriculture, defense, \nand law enforcement.\n  Again, that $290 billion doesn't even keep pace with inflation. We \nare cutting Federal spending, in real terms, in the Democratic \nproposal.\n  I might add that we have more debt reduction than the Republican \nplan. Let me make that as a final point. The Democratic plan has over \n$2 trillion of debt reduction. The Republican plan has just under $2 \ntrillion.\n  I suggest to my colleagues that the Democratic plan is superior in \nevery way--greater debt reduction, preserving the Social Security \nsurplus for Social Security, preserving and protecting Medicare, \nproviding for our high-priority domestic needs, and, yes, tax relief \ntargeted at those who deserve it the most--not the wealthiest among us, \nbut middle- and lower-income people who richly deserve some tax relief.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Finance Committee, I \nstood on this floor for 10 long hours 6 years ago and I thank the \nSenator from North Dakota for recreating what we did that day and what \nthe consequences have been.\n  It had been our idea that the Senator from Montana would go next, but \nwe can alternate.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized for 15 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, we have a Democrat alternative tax cut \nthat is the weakest, least adventuresome effort to reduce taxes that \nyou could ever expect which will do little good for anybody.\n  I call upon my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to be bold \nin trusting the American people with their money, to be bold in letting \npeople keep money in their own pockets to spend. I ask the other side \nof the aisle to be as bold in tax policy, and to be as bold in reducing \ntaxes as they are bold in wanting to spend the taxpayers' money. I \nwould like to have them be as bold in reducing taxes as they are bold \nin their budget of this year to increase practically every program that \nhas ever been thought of, and even establishing a lot of new programs \nto have Washington bureaucrats spend the additional money coming into \nthe Federal Treasury.\n  They are not very bold when it comes to giving the taxpayers back \ntheir money, but they are very bold in saying how Washington can spend \nthat money better than the taxpayers. They are very bold in increasing \nnew programs and very bold, without using the words, but saying, in \neffect, that we in Washington know better how to spend the taxpayers' \nmoney than the taxpayers do.\n  How they like to quote Chairman Greenspan because of his respect, but \nalso they only like to tell half of what Chairman Greenspan says. We \nhave had an opportunity, as Senators, to hear Chairman Greenspan in so \nmany different forums this year, just since the first of the year, talk \nabout a surplus and what should be done with it. They would like to \nhave you believe the only thing that Chairman Greenspan says is that he \nis against any tax cuts.\n  But what he does is give Congress several alternatives. Admittedly, \nhe says that his first choice is to retire debt held by the public;\n  Next, to give tax reductions, because tax reductions are better than \nspending the money as the third alternative.\n  And particularly, Chairman Greenspan says, top priority ought to be \ngiven to cutting marginal tax rates.\n  Appearing just last week before the House Budget Committee, Chairman \nGreenspan reiterated his position by making clear, and I will give you \nthis quote:\n\n       Only if Congress believes that the surplus will be spent \n     rather than saved is a tax cut wise.\n\n  I think given the President's, and his party's, past and present \npropensity to want to spend all of the surplus--the President's budget \nnot only spends all the surplus, the President's budget would take $30 \nbillion from Social Security, and they have a $100 billion tax increase \nas well--with their propensity to spend all of it, and more than the \nsurplus, it should be obvious that the congressional budget plan that \nis before us by the people on this side of the aisle is aligned very \nmuch with Chairman Greenspan's position.\n  I wish our friends on the other side of the aisle would speak in the \nsame way when they say that this money is not in the bank, that it is \nonly projected income--when they use that as an excuse that you can't \ngive people a tax cut--they ought to not project the expenditure of \nthat money as well.\n  Yet they are willing to be radical. They are willing to be risky when \nprojecting expenditure of this money. But somehow it is wrong to give \nthis money back to the people to spend because if the people keep this \nmoney in the first place, they don't send it to Washington, and it is \ngoing to create more jobs. It is going to turn many times over in the \neconomy than would\n\n[[Page S9489]]\n\notherwise be turned over in the economy if it were spent by Washington \nbureaucrats--creating jobs and creating wealth, if the taxpayers spend \nit, and just being poured down the black, bottomless pit if it is spent \nin Washington, DC.\n  We had a chart from the other side of the aisle that said what a \ngreat deal has happened since 1993 on reducing the deficit. But what is \nleft out of that equation and that presentation is one of the greatest \npolitical revolutions that has come from the grassroots of America in \nan off-year election in the last 60 years. And that was that the people \nof this country for the first time in 40 years turned both Houses of \nCongress over to a Republican majority.\n  It was only after that Republican majority was elected that there \nwere dramatic changes in budgeting with the caps, and even with a \nreduction of taxes in 1997 that brought the changes and the discipline \nto the Hill--even to the White House as well--that brought us to the \nplace where we are today of talking about surpluses, because in the \nfirst 2 years of this administration their own budgets were projecting \nin the outyear deficits for a long, long time. But all of that was \nturned around when Republicans took over Congress, and started down the \nroad of bringing surpluses and balancing the budget.\n  We are here to say that the Democrat tax decrease of $300 billion \ncompared to our $792 billion is too puny to do the economic good that \nought to be done. It is too puny to return political and economic \nfreedom to the taxpayers of this country because the taxpayers will \nspend that money more wisely than if it is sent to Washington.\n  But we are also here to declare victory in the debate over whether we \nshould give tax relief to the American people because they want us to \nbelieve with their amendment that they are for a tax cut. They are for \na tax cut--a very small, puny tax cut. The President says now he is for \na tax cut.\n  We have won somewhat of a victory in this year's debate. The question \nnow is not whether there should be tax relief, but what kind and how \nmuch?\n\n  As a Member of the majority party, I can't think of a better problem \nwith which to be confronted. With a tax cut plan before us, we are \nproposing to finally start sending hard-earned dollars out of \nWashington and back to the taxpayers.\n  Most of the provisions of this bill are what the people from the \ngrassroots of America have been telling their Congressmen and Senators \nthey want done--and really want done--because we include those things \nin our bill: addressing the marriage penalty; providing health care tax \nrelief; more help for education, pensions and savings; long-term care; \nchild care; estate tax relief; and, most importantly, general relief \nfor middle-income taxpayers.\n  Nearly all of the provisions that I and Senator Feinstein introduced \nin S. 1160 are included in some form in the bill before us. I commend \nthe chairman for taking the initiative and pushing major tax relief \nthat people really want. And, by the way, even some Democrats supported \nit out of the Finance Committee. The President has only offered modest \ntax cuts.\n  This amendment is an example of it. Of course, in the process, as I \nindicated, he wants to raise taxes $100 billion in other ways in the \nprocess of giving a tax cut, because the President of the United States \nwants it both ways. He wants to be able to take credit for a tax cut on \nthe one hand while he is raising taxes on the other hand.\n  Of course, he is sending out all of these frantic, hysterical veto \nthreats. He attacked the House bill, playing the class warfare card \nthat he plays so well, saying that it benefited the rich. Of course, he \ncan't do that with a Senate bill. We saw that was not challenged on \nthis point by people on the other side of the aisle, since 60 percent \nof the bill before the Senate helps families who are middle class and \nearning $75,000 or less.\n  Now the President and his minions are saying $792 billion in tax \nrelief to the American people is too much. He is saying that either \nthey don't need it--meaning they don't need the tax decrease--or he \nmight even be saying they don't deserve it. He says this while asking \nfor billions of dollars in new taxes to pay for even more spending \nwhile raiding the Social Security trust fund of $30 billion.\n  That is right. This President and his budget team raids Social \nSecurity to pay for more spending. He does this when taxes as a \npercentage of the Gross Domestic Product are at an all-time high of \naround 21 percent. Historically, taxes have been around 18 to 19 \npercent of the Gross Domestic Product over the last 30- to 40-year-\nperiod of time. We restore that historical level.\n  The public at the grassroots has pretty much consented to pay--not \nevery American would agree with that--but over 30 to 40 years, it has \nbeen about 18 to 19 percent. But now it is up to 21 percent. We propose \nthat it be more like that historical rate of taxation, as it has been \nfor a long time.\n  By contrast, the administration, in addition to providing puny tax \nrelief, would have a debt of $200 billion more than what we will have \nif our budget is adopted.\n  We also protect Social Security and Medicare.\n  The congressional budget plan before the Senate provides a blueprint \nfor savings. We are projecting a cumulative surplus of $3.4 trillion. \nThis includes the surplus in the Social Security trust fund as well as \nthe on-budget general fund surplus. Of the estimated $3.4 trillion \nsurplus, Republicans are advocating in this budget saving $1.9 trillion \nto save Social Security. These are the funds which are estimated to \ncome into the Social Security trust fund from the payroll tax.\n  Of course, the President of the United States in attacking our budget \nis dead wrong in saying we put tax cuts before Social Security, because \nwe plan for Social Security very thoroughly. We have been trying to set \nup a lockbox so no one will be able to get at that money and spend it. \nHowever, we have not met with much cooperation from the other side of \nthe aisle on saving Social Security. I have lost track of the number of \ntimes since the first of the year we have had cloture votes on our \nRepublican lockbox proposal. This is truly unfortunate. If we don't \ncreate a Social Security lockbox, we are going to end up spending the \nmoney for everything else but Social Security. Even the President has \nsaid he is in favor of a lockbox, but his actions fall far short of his \nrhetoric.\n  The tax cut we are talking about today is $792 billion. This is less \nthan 25 percent of the total cumulative surplus of $3.4 trillion. A lot \nof our taxpayers say even $792 is not a bold enough tax cut. It is even \nless than the $1 trillion that will accumulate on the on-budget \nsurplus. There is money left over, $505 billion to be exact, to take \ncare of problems with the Medicare system and provide additional funds \nfor discretionary spending.\n  In our budget resolution, we provide $180 billion for increased \ndiscretionary spending after the budget caps expire in the year 2002. \nThat still leaves $325 billion to help solve Medicare problems and \nspending for domestic priorities.\n  Over the next 10 years the Federal Government will take in nearly $23 \ntrillion in all taxes. That is a lot of money. This bill gives $792 \nbillion back to the American taxpayers. That still leaves $22 trillion \nin revenue that the Government will spend. The tax cut we are talking \nabout is only 3.5 percent, 3.5 pennies out of every $1 coming into the \nFederal Treasury over the next 10 years. I am a little embarrassed to \ntell the taxpayers we are only giving a tax cut of 3.5 percent from all \nthe money the Federal Government will take in over the next 10 years. \nThat is three times what the other side of the aisle would return to \nthe taxpayers.\n  The congressional budget plan will save 75 percent of the surplus \nprojected by the CBO over the next 10 years. In contrast, the President \nsaves only 67 percent. The President is proposing a $95 billion tax \nincrease.\n  We continually ask the American taxpayers to trust us as legislators. \nThere isn't a day that goes by without us asking for that support from \nour constituents. Now it seems to me it is time to return trust to the \nAmerican taxpayers. It is time to trust the American taxpayers with a \nlittle bit of their own money--3.5 percent of all the money coming in \nover the next 10 years.\n  The latest challenge from the other side of the aisle is reflected in \nthe Democrat substitute before the Senate. I suppose it could be called \na tax ``scratch'' instead of calling it a tax cut because it is that \npuny. Even a number of Democrats are scoffing at\n\n[[Page S9490]]\n\nsuch a weak effort. It is less than $300 billion over 10 years. It does \nnot even have a rate cut for middle-income taxpayers. It does not even \nget rid of the unfair marriage penalty that affects millions of \ntaxpayers. Compared to our tax bill, it delays the 100-percent \ndeductibility for self-employed health insurance and in the process \nhurts small business and farmers.\n  The Democrat plan only provides half of the assistance the Republican \nplan provides for people who need to purchase their own health \ninsurance. The Clinton-Gore team and their lockstep followers in \nCongress do not think that the tax rate the average American pays is \ntoo much. We all know what their record has been. We all know the \nClinton-Gore tax increase of 1993 was the largest ever in the history \nof the United States. I have heard some Members, in defense of their \nsupport of this massive tax increase, try to argue that this is what \nbrought about the current surpluses.\n\n  This is a revisionist history that has risen to some sort of art form \non the floor of the Senate today. First, the Clinton-Gore tax increase \nwas supposed to raise $240 billion. Of course, this is less than the \n$290 billion they now say they want to give back in this substitute \namendment.\n  However, the Clinton-Gore tax increase never raised the money it was \nsupposed to raise. The revenue increase that did come in is due to the \nprivate sector economic engine and did so despite all of the shackles \nthis administration has placed on business through both tax increases \nand unprecedented regulation.\n  In addition, $40 billion of this new revenue can be attributed to the \ncapital gains tax reduction that the Republican Congress passed in \n1997. The administration argued this tax reduction would cost revenue, \nbut the Wall Street Journal has said this has brought in $40 billion \nmore. So most of the arguments on the other side of the aisle are just \nplain wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  I begin by asking Members and the public to review the remarks of the \nSenator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, given 15 or 20 minutes ago. It \nwas one of the best summations of the facts and choices we now face \nthat I have ever heard.\n  Senator Conrad is a former tax commissioner of the State of North \nDakota and is intimately familiar with tax matters. He also is a very \nsenior member on the Budget Committee. He is very deeply involved in \nall of the tax and spending matters that face our Federal budget. I \nurge Senators to review the comments made by the Senator from North \nDakota, Mr. Conrad. They were very much on target. As I said, it was \nprobably the best factual summary of the choices facing Members that I \nhave heard in the entire debate.\n  Essentially, we have choices that are quite significant. How are we \ngoing to manage this additional surplus? I don't want to say awesome, \nbut it is very unusual for this country to have a budget surplus and be \nfaced with these choices. Not too coincidentally, it is the end of the \n1990s that we have the choice, as we face the next century, the \nmillennium. I think the American people sent legislators to the Senate \nand the Congress to do what is right, to do what is right when we have \na big surplus.\n  It has been stated many times, and I will repeat it: The projections \nover the next 10 years are for a $3 trillion surplus, $2 trillion out \nof payroll tax additional revenues because more people are working, the \neconomy is doing so well, the payroll tax revenues increase. We have \nagreed that that $2 trillion generated from the payroll tax increases \nwill go into the Social Security trust fund. We want to make sure the \nSocial Security trust fund is as secure as we can possibly make it. It \nseems reasonable those revenues go to the Social Security trust fund. \nThat is agreed to here. That is not a problem.\n  The question is: With the remaining $1 trillion of the $3 trillion \nthat comes out of general revenue--from income taxes, including \ncorporate and individual income taxes--what do we do with that? Very \nsimply, it comes down to making choices. Under the choices we make, \nsome people are going to be helped and some people are going to be \nhurt. That is the nature of choices. Or some people are helped more and \nsome people are helped not quite as much because we have to make \nchoices.\n  So essentially what do we have in front of us? I would like to show a \nchart that has been presented many times, but it is important to drive \nthis point home. It is a fact. The fact is, our friends on the other \nside of the aisle do propose a tax cut of about $792 billion over the \nnext 10 years. Because of that tax cut, it means the debt will not be \nreduced as fast as otherwise might be, which means interest on the debt \nwill be a little more. That additional interest on the debt is about \n$141 billion. If we add the two together, in effect the tax cut offered \nby the other side really takes $933 billion out of the roughly $1 \ntrillion surplus. That is a fact. Nobody can deny that. That is a fact.\n  Then the next question is, does that make sense? Who is helped by \nthat? Who is hurt by that? Given the composition of the tax reduction, \nthose helped tend to be the most wealthy Americans at a period in our \nAmerican history when our economy is doing very well. Who is hurt? The \npeople hurt by this tend to be people who are necessarily going to face \nvery severe reductions in veterans' benefits. It might be in education \nprovisions, it might be the FBI salaries, Head Start, kids not admitted \nto the program, and so forth.\n  Why do I say that? I say that because the budget tax proposal before \nus, presented by the other side, necessarily assumes we are going to \nstick with the budget caps on discretionary spending.\n  My friends around the country watching this ask what in the world are \ndiscretionary spending caps? Let me explain to the American public what \nthey are. Essentially, Congress passed a budget, by the other side, \nentirely by the other side--and by the other side I mean the Republican \nparty--which set very tight budget caps. If those budget caps are \nprojected in the next 10 years, that necessarily means about a $595 \nbillion cut in discretionary spending, which is spending on such things \nas education, veterans' benefits, Head Start programs, education \nprograms, and so forth. But to make it even worse, that does not take \ninto consideration the probable scheduled increase in defense spending \nof about $127 billion, which means if you add the two together, this \nbudget means about $775 billion in real discretionary spending cuts. \nThat is necessarily, arithmetically, mathematically, the consequence of \nthis proposal --cuts that deep. That means, if defense is increased \n$127 billion, all the other discretionary spending will be cut about 43 \npercent by the year 2009.\n  That means a 43-percent cut in veterans' benefits. Let me tell you a \nlittle more about that. What does that mean? That means about 1.5 \nmillion veterans will be turned away--turned away because of those \ncuts. It means about 375,000 kids will be out of the Head Start \nProgram, gone--375,000 kids. That is necessary because of a 43-percent \ncut in all these programs because this budget assumes no increase in \ndiscretionary spending caps and probably, if we are realistic with \nourselves, it means the other side is going to add back in defense. \nThat nets out at a 43-percent cut.\n  I am not saying we should increase these programs above the baseline, \nalthough perhaps in some areas we could. But at the very least, we \nshould not cut them 43 percent across the board. Let's say we are not \ngoing to cut them 43 percent across the board. Let's say we are going \nto keep Head Start funding. That necessarily means you have to cut \nsomething else by more than 43 percent. That is where we are. Nobody \ncan dispute those facts --nobody. Those are the facts.\n  Let me show another chart. To state it differently, take a dollar \nbill. This is the line--it is hard to see on this chart --of the tax \nbreaks as a consequence of the bill before us. This is the additional \ninterest payment, which is about $63 billion for everything else, and I \nhave already outlined what the consequences of that are.\n  The proposal before us is the Democratic alternative. What is it? \nBasically, we think it is a wiser set of choices. Again, with roughly a \n$1 trillion surplus that we are debating, the question is what choices \nare we going to make? What should we do about it? The choice made by \nthe other side is essentially all of it in tax cuts--all of\n\n[[Page S9491]]\n\nit. Because if you add interest lost, it basically comes to it all \ngoing to tax cuts. That is basically what it is.\n  We say no. First, because that is a projection and we do not know if \nit will be real; it is so back loaded. You have heard all the \narguments. Rather, let's do a little bit here and a little bit there \nthat protects the future. We say let's have about a $300 billion tax \ncut. Sure, we are for tax cuts. Let's take $300 billion and reduce it.\n  Mr. President, I yield myself an additional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. So another third, we say, goes to Medicare. Let's give \nsome to Medicare. I heard a Senator a few minutes ago say it is \nreckless or it is irresponsible to spend money on programs. I ask the \nSenator, is it reckless, is it radical to save a little bit for \nMedicare? The Medicare trust fund is in dire straits, even more so than \nthe Social Security trust fund. Right now it is projected that the \nsurplus in the Medicare trust fund is due to reach zero about 2015. \nWhat happens if the economy is not doing as well in the next several \nyears? What does that mean? That means the Medicare trust fund is due \nto reach zero earlier than 2015.\n  You wonder why the projections for the Medicare trust fund expiration \nkind of bounce around? It is basically because the economy itself \nchanges. Some years we are doing very well, some years not so well. \nRight now we are doing well, so that means a 2015 expiration date.\n  So we are saying in the proposal crafted by our leader, the Senator \nfrom New York, let's save about a third of this surplus, this $1 \ntrillion surplus, for Medicare. One-third for tax cuts, one-third for \nMedicare, and we are also saying come on, men and women around here, \nlet's be realistic.\n  I mentioned earlier about the discretionary spending caps and how the \nbudget on the other side assumes we are not going to raise the caps, \nwhich means in effect if we add some for defense, about a $775 billion \ncut in spending. We are saying that is unrealistic. We are not going to \ncut veterans' benefits nearly that amount. We are not going to take \nyoung kids out of the Head Start Program. So we are saying take a third \nof that $1 trillion, roughly, and let's dedicate that to the \ndiscretionary spending programs so the reductions are not as great as \nwe note they otherwise might be. The result is the interest cost that \nwill necessarily result from this proposal.\n  So, again, it comes down to choices. Who is helped? Who is hurt? We \nsay the people who should be helped are seniors on Medicare. We should \nhelp shore up the Medicare trust fund, the program. Some of these \nMedicare dollars could be set aside for drug benefits. We know how many \nseniors desperately need help with prescription drug benefits. We are \nsaying some could help veterans.\n  What are we really saying? Many say, give back the tax cut, give it \nback to the people, give it back now to the people.\n  It is a very sympathetic argument. We are saying let's be responsible \nbut let's give it back to our children. Let's give it back to our \nchildren in greater deficit reduction. Let's give it back to our \nchildren to help their parents with Medicare. Let's give it back to the \nfuture. Let's be responsible.\n  I do think we have a moral obligation as representatives of the \npeople to do what we can to leave this country in at least as good a \nshape, if not better shape, than we found it. That means reducing the \ndebt, it means helping shore up Medicare, it means just meeting \npeople's needs in a very solid, responsible way.\n  The majority plan hurts people on Medicare, hurts veterans, hurts \nkids in Head Start, hurts the country. We say let's not hurt the \ncountry, let's help the country. Let's help the country with a \nbalanced, responsible alternative, one I think the American people \nreally would prefer if they were fully involved in this debate rather \nthan a reckless, irresponsible--I hate to categorize it that way, but I \ndo think it is, quite honestly--a program that takes all of the \nsurplus, $1 trillion, and sends it all back for tax cuts at a time when \nMr. Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, says is not the \nright time for a tax cut. He says it is not the right time because the \neconomy is already heated up and we are dangerously close to the point \nwhere, with more stimulus, a bubble could burst and we could be causing \na lot more problems than we can even think of at this point.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we consider the $792 billion of overpaid \ntaxes we seek to refund in the Taxpayer Refund Act, millions of \nAmericans are deeply concerned about President Clinton's veto threat. \nWe just heard the statement about we cannot have a ``reckless'' tax \ncut, but they want to give back this money to our children and \ngrandchildren and to the American people.\n  The truth is, our bill is the bill that wants to return this surplus \nto the taxpayers of the country; the President's bill wants to spend \nit. It is very different. Somehow, if we give it back in tax relief, it \nis reckless because the American people somehow do not know how to \nspend it, but let us keep it in Washington and let Washington spend it \nand it is fine. I do not understand that logic.\n  The President has also threatened to veto a proposal from his own \nparty to provide just $500 billion in tax relief--again, more evidence \nthat they want to spend the money, not give it back, not save it for \nour children, but spend it on new Washington programs.\n  The President is hinting at supporting tax relief somewhere in the \n$250 billion range, but his own budget included only one tax cut, and \nthat could only be used for savings, not to let families decide how to \nspend their own money, but for Washington, the President, to tell you \nwhat you are going to do if he decides to give any of your surplus \nback.\n  I take this opportunity to make a few points about why the taxpayers \nhave every right to expect this Congress and the President to return at \nleast $792 billion of overpaid taxes.\n  First, let me emphasize that this bill is a 10-year $792 billion tax \ncut plan that benefits all Americans, with a focus on providing major \ntax relief for middle-class families. It is not a tax cut for the rich. \nIt is not an unrealistic level of relief. It significantly reduces \ntaxes for millions of American families and individuals, and it is the \nbiggest tax relief we have ever had since President Ronald Reagan cut \ntaxes dramatically in the early 1980s. I again commend Chairman Roth \nfor his leadership and his commitment to providing major tax relief.\n  We promised to return to American families the non-Social Security \ntax overcharges they paid to the Government, and we have fulfilled that \nsolemn promise. The proposed tax relief will immediately ease working \nAmericans' tax burden and allow them to keep a little more of their own \nmoney and use it on their family priorities--not Washington's, not \nPresident Clinton's, but their families' priorities.\n  This taxpayer relief refund legislation gives middle-class working \nfamilies at least $450 a year in relief from the tax squeeze. It \ncorrects the injustice of the marriage penalty tax by allowing married \ncouples to file joint returns as if they were single payers of taxes, \nso 22 million Americans will no longer be penalized simply for the fact \nthey are married.\n  This legislation also eliminates the alternative minimum tax to \npermit millions of American families, including farmers, to enjoy the \nfull benefit of tax exemptions and credits such as the $500-per-child \ntax credit which I championed and the Senate passed back in 1997.\n  The proposed tax relief includes a reduction in the death tax which \nwill help farmers and small businesses across the country pass on their \nhard-earned legacies to their children, not to pass it on to the \nGovernment but to pass it on to their children and their heirs.\n  The bill makes health care more affordable for millions of self-\nemployed and uninsured by making their health care costs 100-percent \ndeductible, and it includes my legislation to permit workers without \ncoverage to deduct\n\n[[Page S9492]]\n\ntheir health insurance costs and also allows those purchasing long-term \ncare policies to deduct them as well. These measures will allow more \npeople to obtain health care coverage or improve the coverage they \nalready have.\n  The bill before us also encourages working Americans to save more for \ntheir future by expanding IRAs and providing education tax benefits for \nparents, for students, and for workers.\n  There is other tax relief for hard-working Americans as well. While \nthere is still room to improve the legislation, such as to expand the \nbroad-based tax relief and to provide immediate relief of the marriage \npenalty, this $800 billion package is a clear victory for working \nAmericans.\n\n  One of the most important points I have made repeatedly in this \nChamber is that the non-Social Security surplus is the working people's \nmoney, not Washington's, and the people deserve the refund.\n  America's strong economy has turned the ink in Washington's \naccounting book black for the first time in 40 years. The budget \nsurplus above and beyond Social Security will top $1 trillion to $1.4 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. The CBO finds the increased revenue is \npropelled by personal income tax increases, and the CBO cites four \nsources for this unexpected revenue:\n  First, the rapid growth of taxable income, which has raised the tax \nbase for personal income tax receipts.\n  Second, the CBO says adjusted gross income, which has grown even more \nrapidly than taxable personal income, mainly through the realization of \ncapital gains. The capital gains tax increased by 150 percent between \n1993 and 1997, which is a third of the growth of tax liability relative \nto GDP.\n  Third, rising taxes paid on pension and IRA retirement income.\n  Fourth, and I think the most important, is the increase in the \neffective tax rate. As Americans are working harder, as they earn more \nmoney, as inflation is there, it pushes more and more of them into the \nhigher tax brackets. The tax rate increase accounts for 40 percent of \nthe tax growth in excess of GDP growth. That is an unfair tax. It has \npushed people from one tax bracket into another.\n  By the way, the CBO also points out the revenue windfall did not \nresult from legislative policy changes. In other words, according to \nthe CBO, the legislative initiatives taken by the President and by \nCongress did not generate this surplus.\n  Clearly, all four reasons we have a surplus are the result of the \nproductivity of working men and women of this country, and it has \nlittle or nothing to do with Washington. So why should the President, \nwhy should Congress, be at the front of the line to spend this surplus, \nand why are we hearing claims that the $792 billion of tax relief \nwill--and these are the scare tactics, we hear them time after time and \nthey are ridiculous, but they say that tax relief will somehow harm \nSocial Security, it will harm Medicare, and similarly impact Federal \nspending.\n  Again, my point is, these are overpaid taxes from American workers \nand they have every right to get it all back. To say we cannot provide \nthis level of relief without hurting Americans is totally inaccurate.\n  We must recall that Americans have long been overtaxed and millions \nof middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the growing \ntax burden. Our savings rate in this country this year is a negative \nbecause families do not have any money left, especially after paying \ntaxes, to put away. They are desperately in need of this largest \npossible tax relief.\n  Americans today, for example, are paying in my State of Minnesota 42 \npercent of their hard-earned money on taxes to support Government.\n  It is hard enough to raise one family without having to raise your \nUncle Sam at the same time. According to the Government's own data, the \naverage household today pays about $10,000 in Federal income taxes \nalone. That is twice as much as they paid in Federal taxes in 1985. The \ntotal Federal tax will consume 21 percent of the national income. \nAmericans have not paid this much in taxes since World War II.\n  They say: Oh, Americans aren't overtaxed. But since President Clinton \nwas elected in 1993, the amount that Federal tax consumes of the gross \ndomestic product has gone from 18 percent to 21 percent. So the \nGovernment is taking more of what this country produces, and it comes \nout of the pockets of average working Americans.\n  In the past few years, Washington's income, in fact, has grown faster \nthan our economy and twice as fast as the income of working Americans. \nWashington is growing twice as fast as what you are getting in your \npaychecks. With more middle-income workers being thrown into higher tax \nbrackets, the ``middle class tax squeeze'' has been devastating.\n  Millions of middle-income Americans, who have worked hard to get \nahead, have been pushed from the 15-percent tax bracket up into the 28-\npercent tax bracket. Hundreds of thousands of others have been pushed \nfrom the 28-percent tax bracket into the 31-percent bracket, and so on. \nMore people working explains the surge of the Social Security surplus \nbecause payroll taxes are levied against everyone. So part-time, low-\nincome, minimum-wage earners cannot escape the cruel tax bites.\n  According to the census report, the income of the average American \nfamily has grown--get this--the average income of the American family \nhas grown only 6.3 percent, in constant dollars, between 1969 to 1996--\n6.3 percent, while Federal tax revenues have increased by nearly 800 \npercent during the same time. Yet I hear my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle say Americans aren't overtaxed; somehow, they are \ndoing fine.\n  As a result, Americans today are working harder and they are working \nlonger, but they are taking home less money because the Federal \nGovernment is taking home more. A larger share of the earned income of \nworking Americans is siphoned off here to Washington, and it isn't \navailable for families to spend on their priorities.\n  A recent Census Bureau report finds that 49 million hard-working \nAmericans, including 8 million middle-class Americans, live in a \nhousehold that has trouble paying for just their basic needs.\n  President Clinton himself at one time--this was down in Texas during \na campaign swing in 1995--admitted to a group of contributors, by the \nway, that Americans were taxed too much. He said: I might have raised \ntaxes too much in 1993. He said: You might think I did. Well, I think I \nraised them too much, too.\n  But today he still refuses to refund overpaid taxes to Americans, \nbecause he does not think working Americans are ``going to spend it \nright.'' President Clinton believes individuals are not capable of \nmaking decisions for themselves and bigger Government is the only \nsolution. Instead, he spends the surplus for Government programs, and \nhe calls meaningful tax relief ``fiscally irresponsible.'' His priority \nis not to give tax relief at all. It is ``irresponsible'' to ease \nAmericans' tax burdens a little so they can afford basic necessities.\n  That is the question. Is it irresponsible to even have a family night \nout once in a while? The family has been, and will continue to be, the \nbedrock of American society. Strong families make strong communities; \nstrong communities make a very strong America. But 22 million working \nAmerican couples have been forced to pay $1,400 a year more, on \naverage, in taxes every year simply for choosing to be married. Is it \nirresponsible to get rid of an unfair tax policy that discourages \nmarriage?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 12 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes. Or are we \nshort on time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 28 more minutes.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator 5 more minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  So the question I was asking is, Is it irresponsible to get rid of an \nunfair tax policy that discourages marriage? The President at one time \na couple years ago said, yes, this is an unfair tax, but, basically, \nWashington needs it more than the couple does in order to raise a \nfamily.\n  I have heard many who oppose $792 billion in tax relief support the \nindividual relief included in this package. Just which specific section \nof the Roth bill would they throw out? What part\n\n[[Page S9493]]\n\nof tax relief do they object to most? I would like to know which part \nthey would like to get rid of to get down to what they are proposing in \ntax relief.\n  Let me further address the issue of so-called ``fiscally \nirresponsible'' tax cuts that we hear of so often. ``Fiscally \nirresponsible,'' that means, do not give it back to the people who own \nit, earn it, and should have it, but give it to Washington. That is \n``responsible,'' I guess.\n  But in a recent analysis of President Clinton's midsession proposal, \nthe bipartisan Congressional Budget Office found that our budget plan \nsaves all of the $2 trillion Social Security surplus while the \nPresident's revised plan still spends $30 billion of the Social \nSecurity surplus. He cannot get by with just spending surplus; he is \ngoing to raise taxes by $98 billion, and he is also going to dip into \nthe Social Security trust fund again.\n  His original plan spent over $150 billion of the Social Security \nsurplus. Yet we still hear claims that our tax relief is at the expense \nof seniors. It is the President who is spending the money, raising \ntaxes, and dipping into the Social Security trust fund. Yet we are \nirresponsible because we want to return to the American people the \novercharge in taxes?\n  The CBO estimates that our plan reduces more debt held by the public \nthan the President's plan. That is another thing. We do reduce the debt \neven more than the President's plan. Ours also produces an additional \nnon-Social Security surplus of nearly $300 billion over the next decade \nwhile the President's plan, again, spends almost all of the on-budget \nsurplus. Do you spend it or do you give it back in tax relief? That is \nthe question. Whose money is it?\n  The CBO also says the President's midsession proposal has no net tax \ncut but, instead, increases taxes by $95 billion. Again, the surplus \nisn't enough. He wants to raise taxes another $95 billion. The \nPresident commits over $1 trillion in new and additional spending over \nthe next decade by expanding Government programs or creating new \nprograms.\n  Just quickly, I will show this chart. This is what we are talking \nabout as to what the President plans to do.\n  We all agree on saving Social Security, putting every dime from the \nSocial Security surplus into the trust fund, into our lockbox, and not \nspending that. This is our projected $3,371 billion expected surplus. \nBut the President wants to spend all that is remaining and raise taxes \nby $95 billion more in order to do that.\n  So contrary to Mr. Clinton's plan, our budget provides $792 billion \nin tax relief to working Americans. Meanwhile, we save every penny of \nthe Social Security surplus exclusively for Americans' retirement. In \naddition, we set aside over $505 billion for Medicare and to address \nspending needs.\n  Out of this whole projected surplus, we plan on saving for Social \nSecurity, for Medicare, for education, other needs, 75 cents on every \ndollar of this expected surplus. Only 25 cents on the dollar, one-\nquarter, would go to tax relief. Somehow, they want to spend the whole \ndollar.\n  Our tax relief takes only a small portion of the total budget \nsurplus. In fact, only 23 cents of every dollar of the budget surplus \ngoes for tax relief.\n  There is enough to provide this 23 cent of every surplus dollar for \ntax relief, to protect Social Security and to reform Medicare, \nincluding prescription drug coverage from needy seniors. But what I \nwant to stress today is how we spend this $505 billion is not the \nquestion before today. It will come at the end of the year when we look \nat Medicare reform and the final appropriations bills. Today the issue \nis, can we provide $792 billion in tax relief, and I think we have \nproved we can with these charts, and the expert advice us received \nthrough the budget process.\n  In fact, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who is \nfiscally responsible and who's fiscally irresponsbile.\n  Contrary to Mr. Clinton's rhetoric that tax relief will cause \nrecession, cutting taxes will keep our economy strong, will create \njobs, increase savings and productivity, forestall a recession and \nproduce more tax revenues.\n  History has proved that tax cuts work:\n  In the 1960s, President Kennedy proposed and later President Johnson \nenacted an individual income tax reduction of an average of 20 percent \nand reduced the top income tax rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. This \ntax relief preceded one of the longest economic expansions in U.S. \nhistory.\n  In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan inherited an economy that was deep in \nrecession. Unemployment and inflation sank to double digits and \ninterest rates hit over 20 percent. Reagan implemented an economic plan \nthat dramatically cut taxes, reduced regulations, and got the economy \nmoving again.\n  What resulted was nothing short of an economic miracle. Our nation \nexperienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American \nhistory. Over 8 years, 20 million new jobs were created, unemployment \nsank to record lows, all Americans did better, and in spite of lower \nrates, tax revenues increased.\n  In the 1990s, many States cut taxes and turned their budget deficits \ninto budget surpluses.\n  Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating enacted the largest broad-based tax \ncut in the state's history; Michigan Governor John Engler enacted 24 \ntax cuts, reducing state personal income taxes to the lowest level in a \ngeneration; New Jersey Governor Whittman cut taxes 17 times, reducing \nstate income taxes by 30 percent. In my own state of Minnesota, \nGovernor Carlson cut taxes and generated a record budget surplus. And \nGovernor Ventura returned the surplus to Minnesotans in the form of \nsales tax rebate and across-the-board income tax cuts.\n  None of these states broke their budgets; instead they produced a \nrobust economy and generated big budget surpluses which allowed them to \nprovide even more tax cuts.\n  Our neighbor north of the border, in the Province of Ontario, chose \nto follow New Jersey and cut their income tax by 30 percent in 1995 \ninstead of increasing spending. It generates a very successful economy. \nThis year, Ontario Premier Mike Harris will cut the income tax by \nanother 20 percent. Here is what he says; ``the debate is over; tax \ncuts create jobs.''\n  Finally, I would like to take a moment to talk again about Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and debt reduction.\n  Republicans are pleased that President Clinton agrees with us that \nshoring up Social Security and Medicare should be our nation's top \npriority. But the difference is President Clinton talks about it; and \nRepublicans act on it.\n  We are determined to achieve these goals. We have locked in every \npenny of the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 \nyears, not for government programs, not for tax cuts, but exclusively \nto protect all Americans' retirement.\n  We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be \nthere for seniors. Prescriptions drug coverage for the needy will be \npart of our commitment to seniors to protect their Medicare benefits. \nHad the White House and Democrats cooperated with us, we could have \nfixed Medicare by now.\n  In any event, we will continue our effort to preserve Medicare as \nChairman Roth reveals his Medicare bill in the near future.\n  We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically \nreduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by \n2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 \nbillion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire \ndebt held by the public by 2012.\n  As I indicated before, we have not ignored spending needs to focus on \ntax cuts as has been charged. We not only have funded all the functions \nof the government, but also significantly increased funding for our \nbudget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture \nand others.\n  In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we set aside over $505 billion in \nnon-Social Security surplus to meet these needs and the debate on how \nthese funds is not before us today. But is there to highlight how \nRepublicans can provide $792 billion in tax relief while not ignoring \nother important priorities.\n  This major tax relief does not come at the expense of seniors, \nfarmers, women, children or any other deserving group. On the contrary, \nit benefits all Americans and keeps our economy strong. And most \nimportantly, this tax relief will give every working American more \nfreedom to decide what's best for themselves and their families.\n\n[[Page S9494]]\n\n  Let me include my remarks by citing President Reagan who once said: \n``Every major tax cut in this century has strengthened the economy, \ngenerated renewed productivity, and ended up yielding new revenues for \nthe government by creating new investment, new jobs and more commerce \namong our people.''\n  President Reagan was right.\n  I remember vividly that when I first proposed the $500 per child tax \ncut in 1993, the naysayers called it bad policy, even ``dangerous.'' \nDemocrats accused us of cutting taxes for the rich. Sound familiar? \nSome in Congress contended it was too costly, and others argued that we \nshould balance the budget first. I argued repeatedly that we could and \nshould do both. And so we did. As a result, now we have a balanced \nbudget, and the largest surplus in U.S. history. Cutting taxes, \nreducing the national debt, and reforming and protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare at the same time are all possible. We can do it \nagain. We must do it again.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and support the $792 \nbillion in tax relief in the Taxpayer Refund Act.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my colleague from \nNevada who is on the Finance Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from New York and the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I came to the Senate as a new Member in January 1989, \nat the end of the decade of the 1980s. The fiscal policies the Federal \nGovernment pursued during the 1980s resulted in a Federal budget that \nwas awash in red ink.\n  At the beginning of the 1980s, the entire national debt--from the \ntime of the ratification of the Constitution up until 1980--was less \nthan $1 trillion. That included the assumption of the Revolutionary War \ndebt, financing a costly and devastating Civil War, two world wars, \nKorea, Vietnam, and the programs of the Great Depression.\n  In less than a decade, the national debt tripled to $3 trillion. That \nis an indictment of the fiscal policies of the 1980s that we ought not \nto repeat.\n  Mr. President, we have an opportunity here.\n  One can debate as to who should take credit for the circumstances \nwhich none of us could have foreseen a decade ago. A decade ago it was \nmy fondest hope that somehow we would be able to control the spiraling \nannual deficits which were hundreds of billions of dollars each year. \nWhen asked by my fellow Nevadans, how about the national debt, how are \nyou going to pay that back, my response was: I did not see any \nrealistic likelihood that that would occur in my lifetime, certainly \nnot my lifetime as a Member of the Senate.\n  So today we are in a fortuitous circumstance. As I said, who gets \ncredit for that, that is an issue we can debate at some length. But we \nhave an opportunity to do the responsible thing, and we have the \nopportunity to do the irresponsible thing.\n  I think the responsible course of action is to save Social Security, \nensure the solvency of Medicare, pay down the national debt, and then \nprovide for a modest and realistic tax cut. That is the responsible \nthing to do.\n  In my judgment, the irresponsible alternative is the Republican tax \ncut before us.\n  There have been numbers bandied around, $3 trillion is the projected \nsurplus. With respect to the Social Security surplus, that means the \nSocial Security taxes that exceed the amount of the Social Security \npayments, it is projected over the next decade that that surplus will \namount to $1.9 trillion. With respect to that surplus, there is no \ndisagreement. That should be set aside to protect Social Security.\n  The debate is about the $1 trillion projected surplus that is \nreferred to as on-budget or non-Social Security surplus.\n  Earlier this morning, as a member of the Senate Banking Committee, we \nwere privileged to have Alan Greenspan, the distinguished and able \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board. There are many, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike across the land, who give Alan Greenspan a \nsubstantial measure of credit for the reversals in our fortunes at the \nFederal level in terms of the situation we find ourselves in today, \nwhere we are talking about projected surpluses and not projected \ndeficits. I was privileged to have an opportunity to ask him a \nquestion.\n\n  I said: Mr. Chairman--directed to Mr. Greenspan--given our current \neconomic circumstances, if we had three choices, what choice would you \nmake: Choice No. 1, a substantial tax cut; Choice No. 2, additional \nspending; Choice No. 3, reducing the debt?\n  His answer, unequivocal: Reduce the debt. That, he said, would be the \nmost important thing this Congress could do in fiscal policy to \ncontinue the extension of the longest economic expansion in our \nNation's history. That comes from Chairman Greenspan.\n  Now, under the Republican proposal before us, $964 billion is the on-\nbudget surplus. Their proposal would be to reduce taxes by $792 \nbillion.\n  I understand the instant gratification and I understand that if in a \nroomful of good and hard-working Americans you asked, would you like to \npay less tax, all of us would say yes. Perhaps it is because my wife \nand I are entering a new period in our lives--we are blessed with three \nadult children, two of whom have blessed us with grandchildren and a \nthird to bless us with a grandchild to be in a couple of weeks--that my \nthoughts are not with respect to instant gratification, not the kind of \npolitical rhetoric ``we want to return your money to you.'' What is the \nresponsible thing to do for the country? What about my grandchildren \nand your grandchildren? Ought we not to think about them? Our \ngeneration doesn't have a particularly impressive track record running \nup a national debt that tripled in less than a decade.\n  The Republican plan would reduce taxes by $792 billion, would cost \n$141 billion of additional interest, and would result in a surplus \nremaining over the 10-year period of $32 billion. This surplus that is \nprojected over 10 years is on a very shaky foundation.\n  I also was able to ask Mr. Greenspan to talk about projections. I \nsaid to him: Is it not true, Mr. Chairman, that not even the most able \neconomists--distinguished graduates of the Wharton School of Finance, \nthe Harvard Business School, the Stanford Business School, the most \nerudite institutions in America--isn't it true that no one can tell us \nwhat the economy is going to be like next year, much less what it is \ngoing to be like a decade from now? He opined that that was in fact the \ncase.\n  So this policy is built upon a house of cards. We are not sure these \nsurpluses will, in fact, materialize. Yet we build in to our \nlegislative actions a $792 billion tax cut.\n  We have been there before, and we have done that before, in the \n1980s. We were told in the 1980s that we could have substantial tax \ncuts and, at the end of the day, we would still be able to reduce the \nnational debt. That did not occur. The national debt more than tripled.\n  I know that our friends on the other side of the aisle would say that \nhad nothing to do with tax cuts. That is because you all in Congress \nspent recklessly, foolishly, and irresponsibly.\n  I was not a part of the Congress at that time. I will not defend all \nof the expenditures. But I will tell Senators this: If you add what \nPresident Reagan requested the Congress to spend in the 8 years he was \nPresident and you add up the appropriations that the Congress approved \nduring those 8 years, some of those with a Republican majority in the \nSenate, the Congress approved $13 billion less, $13 billion less than \nPresident Reagan requested. So whether you went to school, as I did, \nwith the old math or the new math, those kinds of tax cuts left us with \ndeficits in the trillions of dollars.\n  Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader if he would extend me \nanother 5 minutes; is that possible?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Another 5 minutes for my friend from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S9495]]\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, there are several assumptions that our \nRepublican colleagues make in reaching the conclusion of a $792 billion \ntax cut, $141 billion in interest, leaving a $32 billion surplus to \ntake care of Medicare, other priorities, including reducing the debt. \nIt is a very shaky assumption. Mr. Greenspan also told us this morning \nthat history teaches us to be cautious. This surplus may never \nmaterialize. No one can predict with certainty whether it will occur or \nnot.\n  Implicit in this are some other assumptions that are totally \nunrealistic. One of those assumptions is we will be able to reduce \ndiscretionary spending by $700 billion over the next 10 years. Now, \nthere are more people in America who believe there will be a sighting \nof Elvis than believe that we are going to reduce discretionary \nspending by $700 billion. We are talking about such programs as \nveterans' health, education, what we need to do for agriculture, and \nany kind of emergencies that might occur as a result of natural \ncalamities or disasters. So the assumption that we can reduce spending \nby $700 billion in the discretionary accounts, also including national \ndefense, is not realistic.\n  Indeed, that is premised also upon the spending caps that are in \nplace--next year and the year after it will be even tighter--that we \nwill be able to adhere to them. The chairman of the Banking Committee, \nas part of his questioning to Mr. Greenspan, indicated that in the \nHouse already this year they are talking about emergency spending, \nwhich is a vehicle to avoid the spending caps and, in point of fact, is \nnot emergency spending at all--$3.5 billion or $4.5 billion for the \ncensus, $3 billion for veterans' health, $30 billion this year alone. \nThat wipes this out.\n  The point I am trying to make is this is a highly reckless and \nirresponsible approach. What we ought to do is protect Social Security \nwith the $1.9 trillion surplus, and there is agreement on that. Next, \nwe need to shore up Social Security solvency, pay down that debt, \nreduce the amount of money we are paying on interest on the national \ndebt, so that we can do some other things with the additional tax cuts \nor selective spending in terms of veterans' health, or education, or \nnational defense, whatever we determine the priorities may be, and then \na more modest tax cut.\n  The Democratic alternative, I think, comes pretty close to hitting \nthe mark: Tax cuts of $290 billion, Medicare cuts of $290 billion, \ndomestic needs of $290 billion--that reduces spending in real terms \nover the next 10 years by about $300 billion--and interest, $126 \nbillion. That is a more responsible approach.\n  I hope we do not revisit the mistakes of the past. Chairman \nGreenspan, it seems to me, had a lot of wisdom to offer. History \nteaches us to be cautious. These surpluses may, indeed, never occur \nand, indeed, if we can pay down the national debt, would we not be \ndoing something for our children and our grandchildren that is the \nresponsible course of action, something we can all be proud of, and \nprovide a reduction in the interest payments we make each year, which \nis about $230 billion?\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Abraham \nbe recognized to offer the next amendment regarding the Social Security \nlockbox, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, the \namendment be temporarily laid aside and Senators Baucus or Conrad be \nrecognized to offer a lockbox amendment.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the amendments be debated \nconcurrently for a total of 2 hours to be equally divided between \nSenators Abraham and Baucus, or their designees, and following the \nconclusion or yielding back of time, the amendments be laid aside.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the debates just \ndescribed, Senator Daschle, or his designee, be recognized to offer an \namendment, and following that debate the Senate proceed to a period of \nmorning business.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that no other amendments be in order \nprior to the stacked votes and the votes begin in the stacked sequence \nat 9:30 a.m. on Thursday in the order in which they are offered, with 2 \nminutes of debate prior to each vote.\n  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that following those votes, there be \n10 hours remaining for the consideration of the bill and Senator Gramm \nbe immediately recognized to offer his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask also unanimous consent that the next Democratic \nfirst-degree amendments be in the following order:\n  Senator Kennedy, Senator Bingaman, Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, \nand Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, the next vote in regard to the Democratic \nalternative is scheduled to occur at approximately 6:30 or 6:35 this \nevening. It will be the last vote of the evening. The lockbox issue and \nthe Baucus amendment will be debated this evening, with those three \nvotes occurring in the stacked sequence at 9:30 on Thursday morning.\n  As a reminder to Members, a late session is expected Thursday, and \nvotes are expected to occur on Friday, since it appears it may not be \npossible to finish Thursday night.\n  I reiterate my commitment that if we find a way to finish the votes \non this issue Thursday night, we will not have a session on Friday. If \nthat is not possible, we will go into session Friday and continue \nvoting as is necessary in order to complete this reconciliation tax \nrelief bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 14 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for 14 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, although I agree with many of the specific \nprovisions in the Democrat alternative tax package--including a few \nbills that I have introduced--I must rise in opposition to this \namendment. The plain fact is that the tax cut offered is just too \nsmall. We have budget instructions to cut taxes by $792 billion over \nthe next 10 years, and we should cut taxes by $792 billion.\n  I am glad I have this opportunity to talk about tax cuts, one of my \nfavorite subjects.\n  We are in the midst of what should be a very easy task: reducing the \ntax burden on our citizens by $792 billion over the next ten years. \nAfter all, over the next decade, the federal government is on track to \ncollect over $3 trillion dollars more than we have budgeted for \nspending.\n  In other words, we will be overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion. \nYou would think that the suggestion to return to the taxpayers a mere \n25 percent of these overpayments would not be controversial. But we \nhave heard, over the past few months, the defenders of the status quo, \nthe advocates of big government, raise their voices in criticism of our \ntax cut goal.\n  These critics say that tax cuts are not needed, that taxpayers do not \ndeserve to keep more of their hard earned money. It has even been \nsuggested that the tax burden on our families has been falling. Well, \nthe facts could not be any clearer: the federal government will tax \naway 20.6 percent of our nation's gross domestic product this year. \nThat is an all-time, peacetime record, a level that was only exceeded \nwhen we mobilized to win World War II.\n  But even though the tax burden is a record high, even though we will \nbe overcharging the taxpayers by $3 trillion over the next decade, \nevery excuse under the sun is being raised against tax cuts. Some of \nthese arguments are contradictory, and all are wrong.\n  Some argue, from a Keynesian demand-side perspective, that tax cuts \nwill overstimulate the economy. But even after a $792 billion tax cut, \nthe federal government will run up over $2 trillion in surpluses over \nthe next ten years--from a Keynesian viewpoint, $2 trillion in \nsurpluses is not considered a stimulus. And with all of the lags, the \ndelays, and the phase-ins, the bulk of the tax cuts will not arrive \nuntil years 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n  Can anyone seriously suggest that, in a $9 trillion economy, a $4 \nbillion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 will overstimulate consumer \ndemand? Or even a $25 billion tax cut in 2001? Would a $39 billion tax \ncut in 2002 overheat the economy, when this is only .004 percent of \nprojected GDP?\n\n[[Page S9496]]\n\n  Clearly, the facts do not support the argument that our tax cuts will \noverheat the economy. In any event, from the demand-side perspective, \nthe tax cut would be irrelevant. If we do not cut taxes by $792 \nbillion, it is safe to say that spending will increase by $792 billion \nover the next decade--spending by the government, that is. That is what \nPresident Clinton means when he says we cannot afford a tax cut--his \nbureaucrats are working overtime to dream up new ways to spend the \nmoney, as if the government has first claims to the fruits of our \ncitizens' labor.\n  What kind of spending initiatives can we expect? A few years back, as \nmany of us recall, President Clinton's so-called stimulus package \nincluded spending on such urgent needs as building parking garages at \nthe beach, resurfacing tennis courts, researching the sicklefin chub \nfish, renovating swimming pools, building golf courses, soccer fields, \nand softball diamonds, and constructing an ice skating warming hut.\n  Now, the President is not the only source of such wasteful spending \nideas--we in Congress are very susceptible to pressures to spend, \nspend, spend. But no one here doubts for a minute that if the $792 \nbillion in taxes are instead brought to Washington, the money will all \nbe spent. That is one very good reason why we must keep the money out \nof Washington in the first place.\n  The argument is also raised that a $792 billion tax cut leaves no \nmoney to meet some other important government goals such as debt \nreduction. But we still have $1.9 trillion in social security surpluses \nthat will be in a ``lock-box'' to retire debt and shore up our \ncitizens' retirement security, and another $505 billion in non-social \nsecurity surpluses that can be used for Medicare, National Defense, and \nour other priorities. It is my hope that these surpluses will be used \nfor real priorities, not the ice skating warming huts and beach parking \ngarages. It should be clear that this half-trillion dollars is more \nthan enough to cover our priorities.\n  The rest of the arguments against our tax relief goal are similarly \nmistaken. Some people argue that the money is needed to retire \npublicly-held debt--although, after the tax cut, the remaining 75% of \nthe surplus is available for debt reduction. Even with our tax cut, \npublicly-held national debt will be reduced from 40% of GDP to just 12% \nof GDP by 2009.\n  Other people argue that the Federal Reserve Board would react to the \ntax cut by tightening the money supply. I have already noted that the \nvery small size of the tax cuts over the next two years--just .0015% of \nGDP--does not add up to a dramatic increase in consumer demand and, in \nfact, will not increase demand since government spending would have \nincreased by that same amount were we to collect the taxes. And I will \npoint out that, on many occasion, including today, Fed Chairman Alan \nGreenspan has stated that he believes that government spending is the \nworst possible use of the surpluses, and that he would support tax cuts \nif spending is the alternative. Furthermore, a tax cut that removes \ngovernment barriers to savings and investment is not an ``artificial \nstimulus'' that should worry the Fed one bit. Inflation, after all, is \ncaused by too many dollars chasing too few goods, not by too many \ninvestors creating wealth and opportunity. An even stronger economy, \nfueled by the freedom and enthusiasm of our entrepreneurs, is not \nsomething to fear.\n  It is even argued that a sizable tax cut passed now makes a future \neconomic downturn more hazardous, as if the tax cuts needed for an \neconomic rebound will have already been wasted by our efforts this \nyear. Of course, that argument makes the case for tax cuts, as any tax \ncuts that would succeed in getting us out of a recession should keep us \nout of one in the first place. That is why former Fed Governor Lawrence \nLindsey considers a tax cut a good insurance policy against an economic \ndownturn.\n  When you consider all of the arguments, there really is no case \nagainst cutting taxes by at least $792 billion. Chairman Roth is to be \ncommended for sticking to his guns and reporting out of Committee a \nbill that cuts taxes by that full amount, despite all of the pressure \nexerted by all of the advocates of big government, who would rather \nspend the money.\n  One final point I want to make is that these abstract discussions \ntend to obscure the real reason we are here. Tax cuts are not about \nnumbers, they aren't about aggregate statistics, they aren't about \nincreasing demand by 4 thousandths of a percentage point--tax cuts are \nabout people. We are cutting taxes because of the 67-year-old owner of \na family business in Florida's panhandle, who is discouraged from \nreinvesting his hard-earned profits because the specter of the federal \ndeath tax is hovering, waiting to swoop down and scoop up 55% of the \nincreased value of his business. We are cutting taxes because of the \ntwo-earner family, struggling to make ends meet, that has to pay over \n$1,000 extra in taxes just because they are married.\n  We are cutting taxes so that waitresses, truck drivers, teachers and \ncarpenters can put an extra $1,000 in their IRAs each year, to build a \nbetter nest egg for retirement. We are cutting taxes to enable a \nbiomedical company to budget that one additional research project that \njust might lead to a breakthrough in the treatment of glaucoma or a \ncure for cancer. And we are cutting taxes to reduce government barriers \nto saving and investment, so the capital is available for the American \nentrepreneurs of the 21st Century to develop markets in technologies we \ncannot even imagine today. We need to cut taxes to get government out \nof the way and give people the freedom to pursue their own dream--not \nWashington's.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield whatever time I did not use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the Taxpayer Refund \n     Act of 1999.\n       If you wish for further details on this estimate, we will \n     be pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Hester \n     Grippando.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Barry B. Anderson\n                                   (For Dan L. Crippen, Director).\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office cost estimate\n\n     Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999\n       Summary: The Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999 would provide for \n     a variety of phased-in tax reduction proposals, including a \n     reduction of the 15 percent income tax rate to 14 percent and \n     an expansion of the proposed 14 percent bracket, a provision \n     for married couples to file single returns, modifications of \n     the individual alternative minimum tax, an increase of the \n     annual contribution limit for individual retirement accounts, \n     a reduction of estate and gift taxes, and a new tax deduction \n     for health insurance expenses. The Congressional Budget \n     Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate \n     that the bill would decrease governmental receipts by about \n     $4 billion in fiscal year 2000, by about $155 billion over \n     the 2000-2004 period, and by nearly $792 billion over the \n     2000-2009 period. In addition, the legislation would increase \n     direct spending by $40 million over the 2000-2004 period, but \n     would decrease direct spending by $83 million over the 2000-\n     2009 period. Because the bill would affect receipts and \n     direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply.\n       The bill contains a new intergovernmental mandate, the cost \n     of which would not exceed the threshold for intergovernmental \n     mandates ($50 million in fiscal year 1996, adjusted annually \n     for inflation) established in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA). The bill also contains 16 new private-sector \n     mandates. The costs of those mandates would exceed the \n     threshold established by UMRA for private-sector mandates \n     ($100 million in fiscal year 1996, adjusted annually for \n     inflation) in fiscal years 2000 through 2004.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of the bill is shown in the following table.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1999         2000         2001         2002         2003         2004\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               CHANGES IN REVENUES\n \nEstimated Revenues:\n    On-Budget.....................           22       -4,042      -24,391      -39,124      -41,685      -45,043\n    Off-Budget....................            0          -97         -224         -274         -292         -312\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total Change in Revenues....           22       -4,139      -24,615      -39,398      -41,977      -45,355\n \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0            2            4            6            6           10\nEstimated Outlays.................            0            2            4            9            9           13\n \n                                  CHANGES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\nEstimatd Outlays..................            0        (\\1\\)        (\\1\\)        (\\1\\)        (\\1\\)        (\\1\\)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Amounts under $500,000.\n \nSources: Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation.\n\n       Basis of estimate: All estimates, with the exception of the \n     following provisions, were prepared by JCT.\n     Revenues\n       Accelerate the Repeal of the FUTA Surtax. The Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) imposes on employers an effective \n     tax of 0.8 percent on the first $7,000 in wages paid annually \n     to each employee. This 0.8 percent includes a 0.2 percent \n     surtax scheduled to expire on December 31, 2007. The bill \n     would accelerate the expiration date to December 31, 2004.\n       Revenues from the FUTA tax are deposited into federal \n     unemployment trust funds, which are statutorily capped. Under \n     current law, CBO projects that the amounts in the federal \n     trust funds will exceed the caps beginning in 2003. Amounts \n     above the caps are transferred to state unemployment \n     compensation trust funds. Since the state funds are included \n     in the unified federal budget, this transfer will have no net \n     budgetary effect. However, CBO expects that states would \n     respond to this transfer by lowering their unemployment \n     taxes so that their trust fund balances would remain \n     constant.\n       The bill would lower the amount of revenues deposited into \n     the federal trust funds and thus would reduce the amounts \n     flowing to the state funds. CBO assumes that in the year \n     following each lowered transfer, states would respond by not \n     lowering their unemployment taxes as much as they would have, \n     thus increasing revenues relative to current law. CBO \n     estimates that the measure would reduce governmental receipts \n     by $1,029 million in fiscal year 2005 and by lesser amounts \n     in 2006 and 2007. We estimate increases in receipts in fiscal \n     years 2008 and 2009. Over the 2005-2009 period, CBO estimates \n     that the measure would have no net impact on governmental \n     receipts.\n       IRS User Fees. The bill would adjust and extend the \n     authority of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to charge \n     taxpayers fees for certain rulings by the Office of the Chief \n     Counsel and by the Office for Employee Plans and Exempt \n     Organizations. The bill would eliminate the fee the IRS \n     currently charges on determination letter requests regarding \n     new small business pension plans beginning on December 31, \n     2000. The bill also would extend for six years beyond its \n     current expiration date of September 30, 2003, the authority \n     of the IRS to charge taxpayers fees for certain rulings. CBO \n     estimates that the adjustment and extension of IRS fees would \n     increase governmental receipts by $42 million over fiscal \n     years 2001 through 2004 and by $323 million during the 2001-\n     2009 period, net of income and payroll tax offsets. CBO based \n     its estimate on recent collections data and on information \n     from the IRS.\n     Federal spending\n       IRS User Fees. The bill would adjust and extend the \n     authority of the IRS to charge taxpayers fees for certain \n     rulings by the Office of the Chief Counsel and by the Office \n     for Employee Plans and Exempt Organizations. The IRS has the \n     authority to retain and spend a small portion of these fees \n     without further appropriation. CBO estimates that the \n     adjustment and extension of fees would increase direct \n     spending by $3 million over the 2001-2004 period and by $18 \n     million over the 2001-2009 period.\n       National Vaccine Injury Compensation Fund and Medicaid. The \n     bill would add conjugate vaccines against streptococcus \n     pneumoniae to the list of taxable vaccines and thus would \n     allow for compensation for injuries related to those vaccines \n     from the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. CBO \n     estimates that this provision would increase outlays by $4 \n     million over the 2000-2004 period. This provision would also \n     increase federal Medicaid outlays by $21 million over the \n     2000-2004 period because Medicaid would be required to pay \n     the excise tax on purchases of vaccines against streptococcus \n     pneumoniae. The federal government purchases about one-half \n     of all vaccines through its Vaccines for Children program.\n       In addition, the bill would reduce the tax rate applicable \n     to all taxable vaccines from 75 cents per dose to 25 cents \n     per dose for sales of vaccines after December 31, 2004. This \n     provision would reduce the amount of tax that the Medicaid \n     program would be required to pay for vaccines purchased \n     through its Vaccines for Children program and would decrease \n     federal outlays after the effective date by about $35 million \n     annually.\n       Also, by adding conjugate vaccines against streptococcus \n     pneumoniae to the list of taxable vaccines, the bill would \n     increase the cost of vaccines purchased under section 317 of \n     the Public Health Service Act. Section 317 authorize grants \n     to states for the purchase of vaccines under federal \n     contracts with vaccine manufacturers. The bill would also \n     reduce the cost of vaccines purchased under this program \n     after December 31, 2004, by reducing the excise tax rate. Any \n     changes in spending under this section would be subject to \n     the annual appropriation process. CBO estimates that there \n     would be additional, but insignificant costs from the \n     addition of the streptococcus pneumoniae vaccines and savings \n     of about $9 million annually from the reduction in he excise \n     tax after December 31, 2004.\n       Reduced PBGC Premiums for New Plans. Under current law, \n     single-employer defined benefit pension plans pay two types \n     of annual premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty \n     Corporation (PBGC). All covered plans are subject to a flat-\n     rate premium of $19 per participant. In addition, underfunded \n     plans must also pay a variable premium that depends on the \n     amount by which the plan's liabilities exceed its assets.\n       The bill would reduce the flat-rate premium from $19 to $5 \n     per participant for plans established by employers with 100 \n     or fewer participants during the first five years of the \n     plan's operation. According to information obtained from the \n     PBGC, approximately 3,000 plans would qualify for this \n     reduction. Those plans contain an average of about 10 \n     participants each. CBO estimates that the premium change \n     would reduce PBGC's premium income, which is classified as an \n     offsetting collection, by about $0.4 million annually \n     beginning in 2002 or by about $1.3 million over the 2000-2004 \n     period.\n\n[[Page S9498]]\n\n       Reduction of Additional PBGC Premiums for New and Small \n     Plans. The bill would make two changes affecting the \n     variable-rate premium paid by underfunded plans. First, for \n     all new plans that are underfunded, the bill would phase in \n     the variable-rate premium the plans must pay. In the first \n     year, they would pay nothing. In the succeeding four years, \n     they would pay 20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent, and 80 \n     percent, respectively, of the full amount. In the sixth and \n     later years, they would pay the full variable-rate premium \n     determined by their funding status. On the basis of \n     information on premium payments to the PBGC in 1996-1997, CBO \n     estimates that this change would affect the premiums \n     of approximately 400 plans each year. It would reduce \n     PBGC's total premium receipts by about $4.2 million over \n     the 2000-2004 period.\n       The bill would also reduce the variable-rate premium paid \n     by all underfunded plans (not just new plans) established by \n     employers with 25 or fewer employees. Under the bill, the \n     variable-rate premium per participant paid by those plans \n     would not exceed $5 multiplied by the number of participants \n     in the plan. CBO estimates that approximately 8,300 plans \n     would have their premium payments to PBGC reduced by this \n     provision beginning in 2002. Premium receipts by the PBGC \n     would decline by $1.5 million in 2002 and by about $4.6 \n     million over the 2002-2004 period.\n       Missing Plan Participants. The legislation would expand the \n     missing participant program. The Retirement Protection Act of \n     1994 established a missing participant program at PBGC for \n     terminating defined benefit plans. The bill would expand the \n     program to include terminating multiemployer plans, defined \n     benefit plans not covered by PBGC, and defined contribution \n     plans.\n       The budgetary impact of this provision would be less than \n     $0.5 million annually. PBGC does not expect a high volume of \n     missing participants as a result of this proposal, and the \n     administrative costs of expanding the program would not be \n     high. The net budgetary effect of increased benefit payments \n     would also be small. Amounts paid by a pension plan to PBGC \n     for missing participants are held in PBGC's trust fund, which \n     is off-budget. Amounts paid out by PBGC to participants at \n     the time they are located are funded in the same manner as \n     benefit payments to participants in plans for which PBGC is \n     the trustee--partially by the trust fund and partially by on-\n     budget revolving funds.\n       Rules for Substantial Owner Benefits in Terminated Plans. \n     The legislation would simplify the guarantee and asset \n     allocation rules as they relate to terminated plans involving \n     a substantial owner (ownership interest of at least 10 \n     percent). All owners other than majority owners (those with \n     an ownership interest of 50 percent of more) would be treated \n     the same as other participants, thus receiving a more \n     generous guarantee than under current law. Majority owners \n     would be subject to simplified special rules. The guarantee \n     for majority owners would be phased in at the rate of \\1/10\\ \n     for each year that the plan has been in effect, which is \n     faster than the current-law phase-in, but the nonguaranteed \n     benefits of majority owners would be given a lower priority \n     in the allocation of assets. Only about one-third of the \n     plans taken over by PBGC involve substantial owners, and the \n     change in benefits paid out by PBGC to owner-employees under \n     this provision would be less than $0.5 million in each year.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act sets up pay-as-you-go \n     procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or \n     receipts. The net changes in governmental receipts and \n     outlays that are subject to pay-as-you-go procedures are \n     shown in the following table. Only changes affecting on-\n     budget outlays and receipts affect the pay-as-you-go \n     scorecard. For the purposes of enforcing pay-as-you-go \n     procedures, only the effects in the current year, the budget \n     year, and the succeeding four years are counted.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                              By fiscal years, in millions of dollars--\n                                                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                        1999       2000       2001       2002       2003       2004       2005       2006        2007        2008        2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nChanges in Receipts................................................         22     -4,042    -24,391    -39,124    -41,685    -45,043    -89,541    -114,318    -129,025    -145,337    -156,219\nChanges in Outlays.................................................          0          2          4          9          9         13        -16         -26         -26         -26         -27\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     JCT has determined that the provision that would add \n     streptococcus pneumoniae to the list of taxable vaccines in \n     an intergovernmental mandate.

Will the Senator inform us as to the nature of the \namendment?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is why I asked for 5 minutes, so I can tell the \nSenator the nature of the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No objection.\n   Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am proposing an amendment to \nauthorize a three-year nationwide school choice demonstration program \ntargeted at children from economically disadvantaged families. The \nprogram would expand educational opportunities for low-income children \nby providing parents and students the freedom to choose the best school \nfor their unique academic needs, while encouraging schools to be \ncreative and responsive to the needs of all students.\n  The amendment authorizes $1.8 billion annually for fiscal years 2001 \nthrough 2003 to be used to provide school choice vouchers to \neconomically disadvantaged children through the Nation. The funds would \nbe divided among the States based upon the number of children they have \nenrolled in public schools. Then, each State would conduct a lottery \namong low-income children who attend the public schools with the lowest \nacademic performance in their State. Each child selected in the lottery \nwould receive $2,000 per year for three years to be used to pay tuition \nat any school of their choice in the State, including private or \nreligious schools. The money could also be used to pay for \ntransportation to the school or supplementary educational services to \nmeet the unique needs of the individual student.\n  In total, the amendment authorizes $5.4 billion for the three-year \nschool choice demonstration program, as well as a GAO evaluation of the \nprogram upon its completion. The cost of this important test of school \nvouchers is fully offset by eliminating more than $5.4 billion in \nunnecessary and inequitable corporate tax loopholes which benefit the \nethanol, sugar, gas, and oil industries.\n  First, the amendment eliminates tax credits for ethanol producers, \neliminating a $1.5 billion subsidy. Ethanol is an inefficient, \nexpensive fuel that has not lived up to claims that it would reduce \nreliance on foreign oil or reduce impacts on the environment. It takes \nmore energy to produce a gallon of ethanol than the amount of energy \nthat gallon of ethanol contains. Ethanol tax credits are simply a \nsubsidy for corn producers, and the amendment ends the taxpayers' \nsupport for this outdated program.\n  Second, the amendment eliminates three subsidies enjoyed by the oil \nand gas industry, totaling $3.9 billion. It phases out oil and gas \nindustry's special right to fully deduct capital costs for drilling, \nexploration and development; eliminates the 15% tax credit for \nrecovering oil using particular methods and ends special right of oil \nand gas property owners to claim unlimited passive losses under income \nand alternative minimum tax provisions. Subsidizing the cost of \ndomestic production has not been shown to have reduced reliance on \nforeign oil or directly contributed to more efficient resource use or \ndomestic productivity. The amendment ends these special tax treatments.\n  Finally, the amendment eliminates the special loan program for sugar \nproducers and processors, worth $390 million. The Federal Government is \nburdened with an unnecessary and unprofitable loan program for big \nsugar producers and enforcing mandated import quotas on foreign sugar. \nSugar price supports also force consumers to pay $1.4 billion every \nyear in artificially inflated sugar prices. The amendment simply \neliminates the taxpayer-funded loan program in 2003 and immediately \nrequires repayment of existing loans in cash, rather than sugar.\n\n  These tax benefits and subsidies were originally intended to serve a \nlimited purpose during times of economic recession and hardship in the \n1970s. Our economy has long since recovered and I believe that these \nsubsidies have outlived their purpose. The sunset of these programs \nwill end these corporate welfare programs and return any remaining \nbenefit back to our nation's children.\n  Mr. President, we all know that one of the most important issues \nfacing our nation is the education of our children. Providing a solid, \nquality education for each and every child in our Nation is a critical \ncomponent in their quest for personal success and fulfillment, as well \nas the success of our nation: economically, intellectually, civically \nand morally.\n  We must strive to develop and implement initiatives which strengthen \nand improve our education system thereby ensuring that our children are \nprovided with the essential academic tools for succeeding \nprofessionally, economically and personally. I am sure we all agree \nthat increasing the academic performance and skills of all our Nation's \nstudents must be the paramount goal of any education reform we \nimplement.\n  School vouchers are a viable method of allowing all American children \naccess to high-quality schools, including private and religious \nschools. Every parent should be able to obtain the highest quality \neducation for their children, not just the wealthy. Tuition vouchers \nwould provide low-income children trapped in mediocre, or worse, \nschools the same educational choices as children of economic privilege.\n  Some of my colleagues may argue that vouchers would divert money away \nfrom our nation's public schools and instead of instilling competition \ninto our school systems we should be pouring more and more money into \npoor performing public schools. I respectfully disagree. While I \nsupport strengthening financial support for education in our Nation, \nthe solution to what ails our system is not simply pouring more and \nmore money into it. Currently our nation spends significantly more \nmoney than most countries and yet our students scored lower than their \npeers from almost all of the forty countries which participated in the \nlast Third International Mathematics and Science Study TIMMS test. \nStudents in countries which are struggling economically, socially and \npolitically, such as Russia, outscored U.S. children in math and scored \nfar above them in advanced math and physics. Clearly, we must make \nsignificant changes beyond simply pouring more money into the current \nstructure in order to improve our children's academic performance in \norder to remain a viable force in the world economy.\n  It is shameful that we are failing to provide many of our children \nwith adequate training and quality academic preparation for the real \nworld. The number of college freshmen who require remedial courses in \nreading, writing and mathematics when they begin their higher education \nis unacceptably high. In fact, presently, more than 30 percent of \nentering freshmen need to enroll in one or more remedial course when \nthey start college. It does not bode well for our future economy if the \nmajority of workers are not prepared with the basic skills to engage in \na competitive global marketplace.\n\n  I concede that school vouchers are not the magic bullet for \neradicating all that is wrong with our current educational system, but \nthey are an important opportunity for providing improved academic \nopportunities for all children, not just the wealthy. Examination of \nthe limited voucher programs scattered around our country reveals high \nlevels of parent and student satisfaction, an increase in parental \ninvolvement, and a definite improvement\n\n[[Page S9500]]\n\nin attendance and discipline at the participating schools. Vouchers \nencourage public and private schools, communities and parents to all \nwork together to raise the level of education for all students. Today, \nwe have the opportunity to replicate these important attributes \nthroughout all our Nation's communities.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``The purpose of education is to create young \ncitizens with knowing heads and loving hearts.'' If we fail to give our \nchildren the education they need to nurture their heads and hearts, \nthen we threaten their futures and the future of our nation. Each of us \nis responsible for ensuring that our children have both the love in \ntheir hearts and the knowledge in their heads to not only dream, but to \nmake their dreams a reality.\n  The time has come for us to finally conduct a national demonstration \nof school choice to determine the benefits or perhaps disadvantages of \nproviding educational choices to all students, not just those who are \nfortunate enough to be born into a wealthy family. I urge my colleagues \nto support this amendment and put the needs of America's school \nchildren ahead of the financial gluttony of big business.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this. It is time we got rid of \nwasteful and unnecessary subsidies. It is time we had a national test \nvoucher program to find out if vouchers, indeed, will live up to the \npromise that many of us believe is there as a result of giving parents \na choice, the same that wealthy parents have in this country.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1397, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from \nMontana, and I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect upon the date of its enactment, \n     and the amendments made by this Act shall apply only to \n     fiscal year 2000 and subsequent fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a motion to recommit the bill and \nsend it back to the Finance Committee with instructions. The \ninstructions would be to change the tax bill to ensure that 100 percent \nof the off-budget surplus--that is, the Social Security surplus--be set \nin a lockbox that is in reserve, and it also provides that one-third of \nthe on-budget, or non-Social Security surplus, be set aside for \nMedicare.\n  You might remember that although both sides generally agree that of \nthe roughly $3 trillion projected surplus over 10 years, $2 trillion \nwould be reserved for Social Security--that is the Social Security \nlockbox part of this amendment--we have not reached agreement on the $1 \ntrillion projected on-budget surplus, and this amendment reserves one-\nthird of that for Medicare.\n  Why is this amendment so important? Plainly, simply, we believe that \na portion of the budget surplus should be reserved for Medicare. \nAmericans very much believe in Medicare. Americans want Medicare. \nAmericans want the Medicare program to be in good shape. They want to \nhave the security of knowing that seniors will have a better chance to \nhave a portion of their health care bills provided for, and that means \nwe need Medicare.\n  There are several problems facing us with Medicare right now. One of \nthem is solvency.\n  I would like everybody to look at this chart behind me. Very simply, \nit shows that the Medicare trust fund will become insolvent, under \ncurrent projections, by the year 2015. That assumes the economy stays \nas strong in the next 15 years as it is today. That is the assumption.\n  If for some reason economic growth in America declines slightly, \ninflation rises slightly, if for some reason there is a reduction in \nthe stock market boom, a reduction in markets, if for some reason \ninterest rates go up, then the insolvency of the trust fund moves back \nto the left; that is, before 2015.\n  The Medicare trust fund is in much worse shape than Social Security. \nProjections are with this lockbox amendment that the Social Security \ntrust fund will be in good shape way off in the future. That is not \ntrue for the Medicare trust fund, not true at all.\n  In fact, this chart shows that, optimally, the trust fund is going to \nreach a deficit situation--the surplus will be zero--and Medicare \npayments will therefore have to be decreased under the hospital trust \nfund, at the very latest by the year 2015, probably earlier.\n  Why is that doubly important? We are reserving a portion for \nMedicare, one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare, not only \nbecause the solvency of the trust fund is in a difficult position, but \nalso because the baby boomers are due to reach retirement age at about \n2011 and on through to about 2020.\n  The baby boomers are going to reach retirement, and that is going to \ncause much more pressure on the trust fund. We believe it is prudent \ntoday to reserve a portion of the on-budget surplus --a third of it--to \nmeet that problem, to meet that demographic condition that is going to \noccur; namely, more baby boomers. We think it is only prudent to \npreserve Medicare for that reason.\n  There is another reason to save for Medicare, and that is very simply \nto help make it easier for us in the Congress to provide prescription \ndrug coverage for seniors. If we have heard anything lately with \nrespect to Medicare, it is that seniors want and deserve some kind of \nMedicare prescription drug coverage. Why is that? One reason is that \ntoday, essentially, Medicare does not provide for drug coverage out of \nhospital.\n  There are some exceptions for that, but as a basic rule Medicare does \nnot provide for prescription drug coverage for seniors except when they \nare in the hospital. That is a problem. Roughly 30 percent of Americans \nover age 65 depend entirely on Social Security for their income.\n  There are a lot of seniors who are not very wealthy. A lot of seniors \nwho desperately look for that Social Security paycheck and who \ndesperately are trying to figure out how to balance their individual or \nfamily budget to pay for prescription drugs, to pay for heating bills, \nto pay for food. This is not some cataclysmic scare tactic. It is not \nsome wild story.\n  All of us in this Chamber who go to drugstores to get prescription \ndrugs run across an elderly lady or an elderly man talking to the \ndruggist, trying to balance things out, trying to fill a prescription \nand trying to find enough money to pay for it all, and asking the \ndruggist, ``Well, maybe just half,'' because they don't have enough \nmoney. I have seen it. I will bet that most Members of this body have \nseen either that or something similar to it.\n  When I first ran for office, I knocked on virtually every door in \nMissoula County, MT, a lot of doors. One thing that struck me--and I \nknow it gets everybody who does the same thing--there are a lot of \npeople who are really poor, who are really hurting, and most of them \nare seniors. There are seniors who are having a hard time making ends \nmeet. They are lonely. And we know, too, that drug benefits, drug \ncoverage is more and more important to seniors. Seniors rely much more \non drugs today than they did 20, 30 years ago. In part, that is because \npharmaceuticals have come out with lots of different drugs that affect \npeople's medical condition, help people's health, especially for \nseniors, whose health needs more attention in later years. That is \nclear. We all know that.\n  When I talk with folks when I am home--it is with some frequency--I \nsee it everywhere. You are reminded just how many people in our country \nare really in tough shape and they need help. Most of them are seniors. \nA lot of seniors need a lot of help. Our proposal is simple--a third of \nthe on-budget surplus should be saved for Medicare.\n  Now the alternative from the other side has no coverage for \nMedicare--zero, nothing, not a red cent for Medicare, nothing.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield at the appropriate point.\n  We have two amendments before us. One is the Republican alternative, \nwhich is the lockbox only for Social Security, that is all and, I might \nsay, in a way which is very dangerous. It will cause train wrecks. It \nis going to\n\n[[Page S9502]]\n\ncause the precipitation of confrontations in government. It is very \nreckless--very reckless. That is one alternative--only Social Security \nin a reckless way.\n  The other alternative before us, of the two amendments, is a lockbox \nthat protects Medicare also, but in a nonreckless way.\n  Those are the two choices. It is very simple. We say that in these \ntimes of tremendous projected surpluses, at least a third of the on-\nbudget surplus should be protected for Medicare--at least a third.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle says zero--they want to \nput aside nothing for Medicare. We say a third, and we lock it in. We \nlock it in to the same degree as both sides want to in some way lock in \nSocial Security protection. We lock it in, and we provide for it. The \nother side has not one red cent for Medicare, not one red cent, not a \npenny, not a dime, not a quarter, nothing. If they come back and say, \nwe have some money for Medicare, that is a wish. They don't lock it in. \nThey just say maybe. Because of the big tax cut, it is not going to be \nthere. It is just a hope and a wish and a prayer. We say we lock it \nin. That is the difference.\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to take advantage of this situation by \nlocking in a third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare.\n  Another reason for doing this is, all of us have heard in the last \nyear, roughly, about how we went too far in 1997 with the Balanced \nBudget Act provisions which cut providers' benefits. We have all heard \nthat, that we have cut hospitals, too, that we cut home health care too \nmuch, and so forth.\n  Let me show my colleagues this chart. If they can see this chart, \nbasically it shows the projected cuts under Medicare were about $100 \nbillion over 5 years. Now it has turned out that the actual cuts are \nalmost twice that, almost $200 billion over 5 years. We have all heard \nthat.\n  To be a little more specific, look how big the differential is \nbetween anticipated cuts under the BBA 1997 and the actual cuts. In the \nanticipated cuts, the differential is greatest for home health care--\nbig difference. It turns out that the actual cuts for home health care \nare more than twice what we anticipated. And the actual cut under \nskilled nursing homes is about 60 percent more than we anticipated.\n  So I will summarize and say that the choice between us is very \nsimple. We have two amendments we are considering. One is a lockbox \nwith only Social Security, in a very dangerous way because it is tied \nto projections by the CBO. CBO determines what the debt limit is under \ntheir amendment.\n  The other choice is ours, which is not only to protect Social \nSecurity but also to protect to the same degree Medicare, at a time \nwhen the American Government faces a surplus, a surplus of about $1 \ntrillion over 10 years. It is very simple: Save a third of the surplus \nfor Medicare, for seniors. Help them pay those health care bills. Help \nthem get those prescription drug benefits. Help us relieve the undue \npressure we have caused on home health care agencies, on nursing homes, \non hospitals, particularly rural hospitals.\n  This is a no-brainer, Mr. President. This is pretty simple stuff. It \nis a matter of choices. Do we want to help people on Medicare or do we \nnot? We say yes, we do want to help people on Medicare. We want to help \nthose seniors. This amendment we are offering enables people who are \nsenior citizens to get the health care protection and the health care \nbenefits that we think are so important.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. Abraham addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, because we had a little bit of confusion \nin the order of speaking, I propose at this point a unanimous consent \nagreement which would allow first the Senator from Pennsylvania to \nspeak on our amendment for up to 10 minutes, to be followed by the \nSenator from Georgia to speak for 5 minutes on the amendment, and then \nwe would go back at that point to the other side. We had thought we \nwould start since we offered the first amendment on this side of the \naisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield up to 10 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from Michigan \nand Senator Domenici for their great work on the Social Security \nlockbox issue.\n  Before I get into our amendment, I will address the Senator from \nMontana. First he says there is no money, not a penny, not a nickel, \navailable for Medicare under the Republican bill. As the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee will show in his big charts--I don't have one of \nthose big charts with me, but I have a smaller one--this yellow area is \n$505 billion for domestic spending programs.\n  If we want to--and that is the second point I want to make--use the \non-budget surplus to fund Medicare, which is not an on-budget program, \nit is a separate program like Social Security, by the way--it is a \nseparate program--one of the things I hear from seniors most: Keep \nMedicare and Social Security separate. That is what the lockbox is \ntrying to do with Social Security. There is money there if we want to \ntake money from the general fund and use it for Medicare.\n  So the idea that we don't lock it up is ridiculous. The money is \nthere. Then we can decide where we want to spend that money. It is a \nmatter of priorities.\n  I will make this argument: I don't know if the Senator from Montana \nhas ever voted to spend general fund money on Medicare. I don't think \nthere has been a vote I am aware of in the Finance Committee to \nactually--there have been resolutions, a sense of the Senate, we should \nsave Medicare--fund a Medicare program out of general fund revenues, \nMedicare Part A Program.\n  That, to me, is a dangerous precedent. We have a separate dedicated \ntax for Medicare--a separate tax. What is now being talked about is \nthat we have to grow Medicare by using the on-budget surplus.\n  Let me say this: If Medicare was a program that was financially \nsound, that was doing a very solid job in the sense of providing \nefficient services, was the kind of coverage that seniors are really \nlooking for, then you might make the argument that it is a well-run \nprogram and is doing everything it should be doing, and instead of \nraising taxes on people to fund Medicare, we should take that money out \nof the surplus. The problem is, we have a fairly strong bipartisan \nagreement that there are a lot of problems with Medicare. The Senator \nfrom Montana will agree there are serious problems. No. 1, it doesn't \ncover even half of health care costs of seniors. Here is the major \nhealth care program for seniors, and it doesn't even cover half of \ntheir costs for health care.\n  What we are saying is--and we said on a bipartisan basis--let's fix \nMedicare, make it more efficient, let it meet the needs of seniors, \nincluding prescription drug coverage. Why? Because when Medicare was \nput together 35 years ago, drug therapies weren't that common or well \nused; they were a very different game. Well, today is different. So we \nneed drug therapy as part of a basic benefit because it is the way we \ntreat people more often. So this idea that, somehow or another, our \nlockbox is not sufficient because we don't lock up Medicare is \nridiculous. We have money to do it, A; and, B, we have to question \nfirst whether we should throw more money at Medicare before we fix what \nis fundamentally flawed with Medicare, in making it a better program. \nThose are the things I would like to address on Medicare.\n  With respect to our lockbox, I always find it unbelievable that when \nwe have an issue here with broad consensus--in this case, or in most \ncases, the issues pushed by our side of the aisle--all of a sudden we \nhave agreement. We have agreement in the House, 416-12. The President \nsays he wants a Social Security lockbox. We come to the Senate and we \nhave agreement. Probably if I talk to seniors around the country, the \nfirst thing they will tell me is: If you quit raiding that money out of \nthe Social Security trust fund, Social Security would be OK. We have an \nagreement.\n  So we come to the floor with an agreement to fix the Social Security \nproblem. Let's lock that money up so only Social Security money can be \nused for Social Security. Well, sometimes, as the song in Oklahoma \nsays, a\n\n[[Page S9503]]\n\ngirl can't say no. These are the girls who can't say yes on the other \nside of the aisle. These Democrats just can't say yes.\n  We have an agreement, we have something that we all agree on. America \nis overwhelmingly agreeing with it, but they can't come around to \nsaying let's get this done. No, they are going to change the subject. \nWell, that Social Security thing, we agree with you; but you don't do \nenough and therefore we can't let you do this. We can't let you do your \nSocial Security. They throw up this phony red herring with Medicare. I \nam trying to say the public is tired of this. They want us to be able \nto find things we have consensus on and do them, instead of playing \npolitical games.\n  What is going on in the Senate on this issue, for six cloture votes, \nover a several-month period, is political gamesmanship. We have \nagreement that Social Security moneys should only be used for Social \nSecurity, and we can't get one single Democrat vote to pass that \nmeasure. We have 80-plus percent of the American public who want it \ndone. We have their President who said: Send me only a Social Security \nlockbox--only. We have 416 Members of the House who say ``Social \nSecurity lockbox,'' and we have 45 obstructionists--45--who would \nrather play politics because they think they can win the election on \nmaking the Republicans bad guys on Medicare. So they throw the Medicare \nherring out. We don't have the Social Security herring this time. These \nare the two red herrings that are chronically thrown at Republicans at \nelection time. We have lost the Social Security card, so let's play the \nother card to muck things up so we don't get things done.\n\n  People are sick of that. I can tell you, as a Republican Member who \nis working hard to preserve Social Security, I am sick of it. We can \nget this done tomorrow. We can pass a lockbox that says to every Social \nSecurity recipient in America: Your money is not going to be spent on \nother Government programs. We can make that assurance. The President \nsaid he would sign it, and 45 people on the Democratic side of the \naisle are saying, no, we are not for getting anybody any political wins \nbecause we only think of politics. We don't want to give you this \npolitical win. We want you to be the do-nothing Congress, so we are \ngoing to throw this red herring out. Medicare. Oh, the bogeyman on the \nRepublican side; they don't have a nickel or a penny or a quarter for \nMedicare.\n  Garbage. The issue is not Medicare. This is a Social Security \nlockbox, which the Democrat President--their President and our \nPresident--wants. We are ready to give it to him. What is the response \nfrom the other side? The response could be, should be: OK, let's do \nSocial Security. We all agree on it. We have broad bipartisan \nconsensus. We have public approval. Let's do Social Security.\n  But, no. Let me tell colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the \nMedicare issue is going to be here a little while longer. I don't know \nof anybody who thinks Medicare is going to go away, or the problems in \nMedicare are only temporary. That issue will be here, and it is an \nimportant issue, one that should be fully debated. But it should not be \nused to obstruct something that is desperately needed to protect the \nSocial Security trust fund, and that is the political game that is \ngoing on. We should call it what it is; it is an absolute red herring.\n  Social Security can be--should be--must be--protected from raids by \nthe general government and by the very same people, I might add--we saw \nthe Democratic leader come forward this week and say we need $10 \nbillion more for agriculture. May I ask the Senator from Montana where \nthat money is coming from?\n  Let me answer that question. The Social Security surplus. So is it \nreally that they want to do the Social Security lockbox as they say? Is \nit really that they want to put all that money aside to make sure \nSocial Security is solvent for the next generation? Or is it really \nbecause they just can't help themselves; they want to spend it?\n  They don't want a lockbox because a lockbox keeps their fingers out \nof the Social Security trust fund, which they love to raid. They just \ncan't help themselves. They just love to stick their fingers in there \nand get that money out that is just sitting there. It is just sitting \nthere. It is similar to a sailor on leave, sitting there with a shot on \nthe bar and he is staring at it and he can't leave it alone.\n  All I am saying is: Leave Social Security alone. Pass the lockbox.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I think it might be useful for anybody \nlistening to the debate to put this in some sequence. When the Nation \ndiscovered there would be projected surpluses of amounts that had not \nbeen anticipated, they changed all the dynamics of our discussions \nabout budgets and Social Security. When the President gave us his \nbudget, he spent about 40 percent of the Social Security receipts.\n  If there is one complaint you hear as you travel across the country, \nit is that people are unhappy when the Congress dips into the Social \nSecurity taxes that have been sent, purportedly, to prepare for the \nretirement of all those who participate. So when this Congress began, \nwe got a budget from the President that spent 40 percent of those \nSocial Security receipts.\n  Our side of the aisle said no. We are going to take the President at \nhis admonishment over the years. We are not going to spend any of the \nSocial Security receipts, and we are not going to use it for tax \nrelief. It is going to be set aside and protected. Over the next 10 \nyears, that is almost $2 trillion.\n  I might add, that does not solve all the issues that deal with Social \nSecurity. But it makes a pretty good downpayment on the problem. \nEverybody in America agrees that ought to be done.\n  After this debate was floated around the town for a while, I think \nthe President realized it was not going to fly to propose to spend the \nSocial Security receipts. So he said on June 28. That is just several \nweeks ago after being pummeled for 5 weeks that he should not be \nspending those receipts. He said, ``Social Security taxes should be \nsaved for Social Security, period.'' He didn't say, ``and something \nelse,'' or, ``Maybe we ought to talk about Medicare.'' We will talk \nabout that in a minute. He said, ``Social Security taxes should be \nsaved for Social Security, period.'' That was a big change.\n  We had our side of the aisle saying no Social Security receipts for \nanything but Social Security, and we had the President.\n  They brought it up in the House of Representatives. It was virtually \nunanimous with 415 votes. We are going to protect all the Social \nSecurity receipts. All that has to happen is for that to clear the \nSenate, and we say to America: We have made a monumental breakthrough.\n  What happened when it got to the Senate? Filibuster.\n  We have endeavored to go to the measure to debate it and to amend it \nfive different times. I might add it would be subject to amendments to \nimprove it and to have the ideas heard from the other side of the \naisle.\n  But what was the response? Don't let the Senate get to the bill. \nBlock it.\n  The latest ruse, which is this amendment, is to cloud it because they \ndo not want to be responsible for blocking a sound measure to protect \nSocial Security. They don't want to be responsible for that. They do \nnot want headlines such as the New York Times that says ``Republicans \nSeize the Banner on Social Security.'' This has been their purview for \nyears. Suddenly, they are in the position of having to cloud the issue \nbecause they do not want to be seen as being responsible for leaving \nall of those receipts out there that could be spent or used for some \nother issue.\n  We are prepared to pass a lockbox for Social Security--that none of \nthose receipts would be spent on anything but Social Security, or the \npay-down, and that they would not be used for tax relief. It would be a \nmonumental breakthrough.\n  You can only conclude that, A, they don't want a lockbox because they \nwant those funds to be available; and, B, that the reason they are \ncoming forth with blocking going to the bill or an amendment--that gets \ninto another subject--is to cloud the issue, which is they are blocking \nthe ability of the Senate to concur with the President of the United \nStates and the House of Representatives and give America a\n\n[[Page S9504]]\n\nlockbox that protects Social Security. It is not very complicated.\n  I will say one last thing. When you go to a town hall meeting and you \ntalk to the American people, they do not want these two subjects mixed. \nThey don't want them jumbled up. They want Social Security protected, \nand then they will consider what we are talking about on Medicare. They \ndo not want the Government in their medicine cabinet. They don't want \nthese two issues mudded.\n  Mr. President, I yield in accordance with the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, at this point, on behalf of myself and \nthe managers of the bill, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Michigan. I thank \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  Stepping back from what we have been talking about for the last few \nminutes, I will go back and address the issue at hand concerning the \nlockbox.\n  I think it is important to keep in mind what we are about here and \nwhat the essential question is. The essential question remains whether \nor not when we are faced with projected substantial surpluses, 25 \npercent of that amount should be returned to the people who created \nthose surpluses. That is the American taxpayer. I think that question \nshould answer itself.\n  Another way to put it is whether or not, in view of these surpluses, \nwe need a tax cut or a tax increase. You would think that question \nwould answer itself. You would think that certainly in a surplus \nsituation you would have to seriously consider tax cuts under those \ncircumstances.\n  We have a tremendous tax burden right now. Taxes are taking a greater \nand greater share of our economic productivity. Income taxes alone have \nreached the level of 10 percent of gross domestic product, the highest \nthey have ever been in this country.\n  A two-earner family nowadays pays 38 percent of their income in \ntaxes. You would think that surely we could reach agreement that now is \nthe time for a decent tax cut for the American people. If not now, \nwhen?\n  Our Democratic colleague, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, put it well \nearlier today. He said: I don't even think it is a close call--that \nunder these circumstances we should have a tax cut.\n  But what we are dealing with now, with regard to the Democratic \namendment, is another reason why they say we should not have a tax cut.\n  We have seen time and time again over the last few days almost utter \nhysteria in this town primarily from the White House, the President, \nthe Vice President, and their spokespeople wringing their hands giving \none reason after another after another why we cannot possibly have a \ntax cut under these circumstances. It is going to destroy the economy; \nold folks are going to be put out on the street; we are going to \npollute the environment; women's health issues are coming into play.\n  It is substantial overkill, and it is based upon the fact that they \nare not telling the truth about the elements of what they are trying to \ndo; that is, essentially give us a tax increase instead of a tax cut \nand spend an additional $1 trillion-plus.\n  Now what we have as part of the reason why we can't have a tax cut is \nwe want to protect Medicare and Social Security, and, in this \nparticular amendment we are addressing, the question of a Medicare \nlockbox.\n  I think one of the essential questions before this Congress is, What \nis the responsible way to protect Medicare? We all know we have a \nsubstantial problem. We all know we are going to have to address it.\n  What happened in response to that was a bipartisan effort by the \nMedicare Commission, chaired by Senator Breaux from Louisiana. They \ncame up with real reform because everybody knows you can't keep pouring \nmoney on top of a system that is broken, that is flawed, that is out of \ndate, that is uneconomical, and that everybody says has to be changed. \nWe can disagree on how to do it, but everybody says and recognizes that \nwe have to have fundamental reform.\n  The difficulty with that is a political difficulty. It is not one of \nnot knowing what to do; it is having the political nerve and \nwherewithal to sit down and get the job done.\n  This commission addressed it. This commission did it, Democrats and \nRepublicans together. But the President pulled the rug out from under \nthat effort. That was a real chance to do some Medicare reform. That \nwould be the only thing that was going to save Medicare. It is \nfundamental reform. The President pulled the rug out from that effort.\n  He says now, since we have this Medicare problem and essentially \nsince they have pulled the rug out from the reform effort that would do \nsomething to solve the problem, that we have to look to general \nrevenues. We can't have a tax cut now so we have to take this surplus \nand dedicate a huge chunk of it for so-called fixing Medicare.\n\n  The fact of the matter is that will not fix Medicare. It will not \neven help Medicare. It will be counterproductive. There will be some \ntransition costs as we move from a failing system--it still does a lot \nof good, but it is a failing system--to one of real reform. There will \nbe some transition costs. The Republican proposal has over $500 billion \nof revenues in our proposal that can be used for Medicare or any other \nreason.\n  Pouring more money in, setting it aside, and calling it a lockbox--\nand by the way, nobody goes to jail if they get inside the lockbox--I \ndon't think fools anybody. We are making a commitment to set the money \naside and not mess with it. I take that commitment seriously. There is \nnothing keeping Congress from coming in the next day and doing \nsomething about it.\n  The fact of the matter is we are not helping the system by saying we \nare going to set aside some money for Medicare without addressing \nfundamental reform. A lot of people want prescription drugs as an \nadditional entitlement. At a time when we have a real fiscal problem \nwith the system itself, laying another entitlement on will provide \nadditional challenges we will have to meet. However, there is even a \nway to do that if it is accompanied with fundamental reform.\n  Instead of doing that, what we have in a proposal similar to the \nPresident's proposal, just another variation, is saying another reason \nwe cannot have a tax cut is because we need to set aside the general \nrevenues, the surplus, to save Medicare. It will not save Medicare. \nThat approach will actually wind up hurting Medicare.\n  I was looking at testimony of the Comptroller General on this issue. \nHe was talking about the President's proposal. It has to do with the \nidea of setting aside general fund revenues, general surpluses, and \nclaims we will use that to solve the Medicare problem.\n  It is fallacious; it is phony. The Comptroller General says even if \nall future surpluses were saved, we would be saddled with the budget \nover the longer term and at current tax rates could fund little else \nbut entitlement funds for the elderly population. Reforms reducing the \nfuture funds of Medicare and Social Security and Medicaid are vital to \nrestoring fiscal flexibility for future generations of taxpayers.\n  The Comptroller General says if we took all the money and poured it \ninto the programs, we are really not doing very much other than perhaps \nbuying a little bit of additional time to allow us to pour more money \ninto a leaky bucket, when the hole in the bucket at the bottom is \ngetting bigger and bigger, and we are pouring more general revenues, \nunder the assumption, I suppose, that we can do that forever without \never having to make real reform.\n  He says:\n\n       I feel that the greatest risk lies in extending the HI [the \n     hospital] trust fund solvency, while doing nothing to improve \n     the program's long-term sustainable. Or worse, in adopting \n     changes that may aggravate the long-term financial outlook \n     for the program and the budgets.\n\n  The Comptroller is saying we are aggravating the problem. You are \nactually doing harm if you think by putting a little more money on top \nof this program you can forestall real reform and you can fool the \nAmerican people into thinking they don't have to make some tough \nchoices and have real reform such as the Medicare Commission came up \nwith. It is making you stand\n\n[[Page S9505]]\n\noff from the problem and not address the problem.\n\n  We are facing a demographic time bomb. In the year 2030 we will have \ntwice as many people over the age of 65. We will have about half as \nmany worker-per-retiree ratio. It will be twice as bad by the year \n2030. We know we have to do something.\n  I am afraid I must conclude that although saving Medicare and Social \nSecurity has worked very well for some people who have used it as a way \nof having to face up to the fundamental problems those two programs \npresent, the real answer to the question that is presented tonight with \nregard to the Medicare lockbox amendment is that, once again, it is \nbeing used as yet another excuse, along with ``it will ruin the \neconomy, it will pollute the atmosphere, it will destroy the \nmilitary.'' It is being used simply as another excuse as to why we \ncannot have a tax cut.\n  For folks who believe the money ought to come to Washington, there is \nnever a good time for a tax cut. There is never a good time for it. It \nis about power. It is fundamentally about who makes decisions in our \nsociety. Anyone believing Washington should have control of this, \nthinks even in a surplus situation that 25 percent of it can't be \nreturned to the American people.\n  I say if not now, when in the world could we ever do it? Certainly, \nwe are not doing Medicare any good. We are not doing Medicare any good \nby standing here and trying to convince the American people that by \nsetting aside a few more general revenue dollars for this system, when \nwe have failed to reach fundamental reform, that we can do that and we \nwill be doing something good for Medicare or the country.\n  If we can't have a tax cut with a $3 trillion surplus, I don't know \nwhen we will ever have one. The President, in three different years, \nhas recommended tax increases in a deficit situation. Now we have a \nsurplus situation. One would think the answer to that would be a tax \ncut. Now he comes back and suggests another tax increase. It doesn't \nmake sense.\n  I suggest the Medicare lockbox proposal be defeated.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the Presiding Officer to tell me when I have used \n10 minutes.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, say there \nis not one nickel for Medicare in this Republican budget. That is \nabsolutely wrong. Perhaps the Senator forgot to include the fact that \nthere is $3.1 trillion in this budget for Medicare, fully funded.\n  What the Senator should have said was: Shame on the President. He is \naccusing Republicans, and he underfunded Medicare $31.5 billion on \npurpose. He did such things in his budget as freezing hospital costs \nfor rural America. Senators, including the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, are worried about that. The President's proposal is that it be \nfrozen for another year. That is where he picked up $31.5 billion. \nGuess what he did with it. He spent it on other domestic programs. That \nis the stark reality, unequivocal truth.\n  Having said that, let me start with a quote from the CBO on July 23 \nof 1999. It has some real application to the so-called Medicare lockbox \nthat is being proposed today to confuse the issue. The issue is putting \na lockbox around Social Security. The other side doesn't want to vote \nfor that for some reason, so they say: Let's do another lockbox, let's \ndo Medicare, and we will get credit for reducing the debt.\n  Here is what they say about it.\n  The chief criticism that the President--that is, OMB--has of CBO is \nthat,\n\n       . . . we did not give them credit for $328 billion in \n     transfers from the general fund to the Medicare trust fund.\n\n  Then they say,\n\n       That's right, we didn't, and that's because transfers from \n     one part of government to another do not reduce the public \n     debt.\n\n  The whole argument the President is taking to the American people is \nthat he reduces the debt more than we do. But one of his big-ticket \nitems is this one right here. The Congressional Budget Office says that \n$328 billion that he wanted to move out of the general fund, so it \ncould not be used for tax cuts, he puts in the Medicare trust fund and \nwants credit for reducing the debt.\n  What does the Congressional Budget Office say? Fundamentally the most \nsimple of all propositions: We did not give them credit for that \nbecause transfers from one part of Government to another do not reduce \npublic debt. That is an interesting one.\n  Then, in addition, we had a very good Senator who does not agree with \nthe Democrats on everything and say--this is Bob Kerrey:\n\n       The President also has a great deal of pain in his plan--a \n     hidden pain in the form of income tax increases that will be \n     borne by future generations of Americans.\n\n  He is alluding to the $328 billion which are IOUs, and he says:\n\n       I strongly disapprove of a plan that provides a false sense \n     of complacency that Social Security has been saved by this \n     nebulous and vague idea of ``saving the surplus''--\n\n  The very same thing applies to Medicare--\n\n     while failing to disclose the real pain that will be imposed \n     on future generations.\n\n  When they will have to pay for it, is what he is saying. Their income \ntaxes are going to go up by the amount of $328 billion or whatever \namount the Democrats allegedly want to secure for Medicare by putting \nit in some kind of lockbox in an on-budget trust fund.\n  I also ask an interesting question: Is there anybody who can stand on \nthe floor of the Senate and suggest that by taking this money away from \nthe taxpayers and shuffling it over into a trust fund extends the date \nby which we run out of money to pay the Medicare people what they are \nentitled to? Does it increase any? Not at all. You have to change the \npayment plan to do that. That is what Medicare reform is all about.\n  Having said that, I could even quote the President's own OMB budget \nabout it.\n  Suffice it to say, anybody who wants to read this can. But even they \nsay, ``only in a bookkeeping sense'' does this carry out any real \npurpose--in a bookkeeping sense, nothing else. We don't need \nbookkeeping; we need to decide what we are going to do with this \nsurplus.\n  I believe I understand the nature of this surplus. I am working very \nhard to convince people that we all ought to agree on one set of facts \nand then see where we are.\n  So I would like to suggest to the Senate, if they find fault with \nthis, they can do their own. But I submit that we have, if you start \nwith a freeze on domestic spending for the next 10 years--Do not jump \nup and say we cannot do that. I know we cannot do that. But if we start \nwith that, we have an accumulated surplus of $3.3 trillion. We ought to \nthen talk about how the Republicans plan to use that. Very simply, we \ntake every penny that belongs to Social Security and we say put it in a \nlockbox. That is the debate tonight. But put it in a real lockbox, \ndon't put it in a lockbox such as the one that is offered here on the \nfloor tonight. It is unbelievable that the other side would even claim \nto have a lockbox.\n\n  They create another budget point of order on top of at least four \nthat already exist, against a budget resolution that has an on-budget \ndeficit. That is exactly the issue. You can call it Social Security or \nwhatever. There are already four points of order on that. You do not \nneed this new lockbox on Social Security.\n  But let me suggest, let's continue on. If this is the way you look at \na surplus, then set all the Social Security money aside. Then go and \nsay, What do we do with the rest of it? We submitted the proposal that \nwas put in this budget resolution when we designed it and voted on it \nfor a tax cut over a 10-year period.\n  People are acting as if we are cutting $792 billion worth of taxes \nnext year. Do you know how much we are cutting taxes next year? Four \nbillion dollars. They are worried about whether we have a tax plan that \nwill overstimulate the American economy. That is so small that it is in \nthe range of rounding errors in terms of the tax take of America.\n  In the next year it is maybe twice that--$8 or $10 or $12 billion. It \ndoes not do anything to inflate this economy because we are planning it \nright. We are planning it to come in piecemeal, as a booming American \neconomy can absorb it. That is $792 billion. If you want\n\n[[Page S9506]]\n\nto know the number, that is 23.4 percent of this total surplus.\n  I have been using a dollar bill. It caught on. The Democrats have \nused dollar bills, and they got us all confused. They have two \ndifferent dollar bills, one cut in thirds, one cut some other way. Ours \nis simple. We have not cut it any way. We say one-quarter of it, 23.4 \npercent, should go back to the American people. It is tough for \nDemocrats to believe this, but plain old arithmetic says there is $505 \nbillion left over. The other side says there is not a nickel in this \nfor Medicare.\n  Before they came to the floor, before this idea that we were not \ndoing anything for Medicare became a political issue, the budget \nresolution had $90 billion in it for Medicare--the one you voted on, \nRepublicans. It had $90 billion in. Now, look here, there is $505 \nbillion worth of domestic priorities. We submit it is up to the \nCongress and the President to decide how to use it. But would anybody \nbelieve we are not going to use part of it for prescription drugs? Of \ncourse we are. And, incidentally, is that enough money?\n  Do you know how much the President said we need for prescription \ndrugs? And he would have sold this to the American people, except it is \nimpossible. He said $48 billion of that is what you need to fix, \nreform, and pay for prescription drugs. It turns out he totally \nunderestimated it. It is more like $111 billion--$118 billion. But the \ntruth of the matter is, take $90 billion out of it, take $100 billion \nout of it; that leaves $405 billion to add to discretionary. Just in \nrough numbers, you could add about $50 billion a year. If you do $100 \nbillion worth of Medicare, you can add $40 billion a year. Is that \nenough?\n\n  Tomorrow I will put up a chart showing how much discretionary \nspending has gone up in the last decade. I would be surprised if it \nwent up $40 billion, net increase, in very many of the years.\n  So essentially we have only one issue here: Do we lock up, in an \nirretrievable manner, as suggested in the Abraham-Ashcroft-Domenici \nlockbox, which is really a lockbox--such a lockbox that the Secretary \nof Treasury was even worried that it did not give Government enough \nflexibility, so we changed it to give them some flexibility. We \nprovide, in the case of a war, in the case of great emergencies, you \nare not bound by it. We provide some other flexibility.\n  But the truth of the matter is that this is a prudent way, if you \ndecide you do not want to use the surplus to grow big, big, big, big \nGovernment. If you want to grow it, then do it the way the President \nrecommends: Do not have this tax cut in; have a little piece of one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes and has 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In fact, I am prepared to make a guess, if they want us \nto settle for $300 billion--and $792 billion, rounded to $800 billion, \nis almost 25 percent--they would like to give the American taxpayers \nback less than a dime, it looks to me. So if they have a chart up that \nexplains their position and want to use an American dollar, put it up \nand clip it off at 10 percent and say: That is what we would like to \ngive you back because we need all the rest of it because we want to \nincrease spending.\n  I do not think this applies to the distinguished Senator who is \nmaking the argument in behalf of the Democrats. I do not think he would \nwant to spend all that money. But I do believe the President has \nsnookered us all. He has us believing we are really going to harm the \nAmerican people by not paying for every new program he has in mind and \nmore. And, frankly, that is just not true.\n  In fact, tomorrow, if I can, I will put up about five of the \nPresident's new programs, I say to Senator Abraham. I will get them on \na chart here, and I will ask the American people: Which do you prefer? \nThese five new programs? Or would you prefer to make it easier to pay \noff student loans? Would you prefer to make it easier to take care of \nan elderly parent? Would you prefer to stop penalizing marriage? Or \nwould you prefer a new program? It does not matter what new program. \nNew programs are new programs, if they are added to the expenditure of \nthe Federal Government and are making it grow.\n  We believe it is a pretty good size right now. We believe there is a \nneed for some growth. We believe there is a need in some instances to \nincrease dramatically what we have been spending, and we voted for that \nin our budget resolution. We said education is one of them, if you will \nreform the way we give it to the States. Let's put more money in, not \nless. We said that. We argued it here on the floor. We propose to stick \nwith that.\n  But the truth of the matter is that our lockbox will make our tax cut \nreasonable and plausible and will make sure the Social Security people \nare safe.\n  I close tonight by suggesting to everybody who is listening to this \ndebate the President continues to raise the issue and Democrats are \nfollowing him almost in rote marching, and that is, they get cranked up \nand they say: We want to save Social Security; we want to save \nMedicare, which simply means you should not have tax cuts.\n  Here is $1.9 trillion waiting for you to tell us how to fix Social \nSecurity. Is it so complicated? No, it is not complicated. He prefers \nthe issue to a solution. That is why we are on the floor. He does not \nwant to submit a Social Security reform program. He wants to continue \nto hoodwink us into thinking if you give the people a tax cut, you \ncannot fix Social Security.\n  I will bet the President would not submit a Social Security program \nthat would cost so much that it would not leave money for a tax cut out \nof this surplus. That is absolutely incredible that he would do that. I \ndo not believe he would submit a Medicare reform program that would be \nso big and so costly that there would not be money for a tax cut. As a \nmatter of fact, he kind of shocked me. He submitted a reform Medicare \nplan that only costs $48 billion, if he was right in his numbers. It \nturns out he is not right, but had he been right, he would have been \nsubmitting one that cost $48 billion. I submit there is plenty of money \nleft over to do that.\n  My last argument, and it will take a minute, is there are some \nsuggesting we should not do this now. If we do not do this now, we will \nnever do it because, as a matter of fact, as we proceed through, we \nwill obligate all this money one way or another for some American \nprogram, and then we will say there is not any money left for tax cuts.\n  For those who are so frightened about us having a negative impact on \nthe American economy, let me suggest, for the next 3 years, our impact \nis insignificant, almost negative. It begins to grow a little bit in \nthe outyears, but even the great doctor--as Phil Gramm said today--he \nis like the Bible, everybody quotes him but nobody reads him. That is \nwhat Phil Gramm said today on the floor. Even he said if you are going \nto spend it, have a tax cut. He also said the Republican plan is not \nsignificant enough in size over a 10-year period or annually to have a \nnegative impact in terms of the American economy.\n  I think we are on the right track. Will the Senator yield me 1 \nadditional minute?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are on the right track, and I think the Democrats \nhave missed the boat. They are mixing apples and oranges when they try \nto confuse us on another lockbox for Medicare. I think tonight we have \njust about disposed of that as being a ridiculous approach which I call \nanything but a tax cut approach. Frankly, with that size surplus \naccumulated over this period of time, I say if you cannot give back a \nlittle bit of it to the American people, then what do they elect us \nfor? I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of words.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Good words.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. My question is, Where's the beef? There is nothing on the \nother side about what they want to do to help Medicare--nothing. The \nSenator from Pennsylvania started out by saying: Gee, there's money for \nMedicare. Then he shifted his argument to say we should not use general \nrevenue. Then he shifted his argument to say that the amendment we are \noffering is a charade, a smokescreen. But if you listen to the words, \nthere is not one\n\n[[Page S9507]]\n\nword of what he wants to do to help Medicare and help Medicare \nbeneficiaries, to provide money for drug benefits, to help address the \nbalanced budget agreement overcut, and to help the solvency of the \ntrust fund.\n  I ask again: Where's the beef? Not one word on that side about what \nthey want to do to help Medicare. As a matter of fact, what I hear in \nthe words is, first, we need some kind of structural reform. Let's get \nstructural reform, but let's not use general revenue.\n  There has been reference to the Breaux commission. Senator Breaux \nadmits we need resources in addition to structural reform to help solve \nthe Medicare problem. He said that. He is the chairman of the \ncommission. He said we need it. I think he is right. The problems \nfacing Medicare will require both structural reform as well as some \nadditional resources to help solve the problem. At least that is his \nview, and he is chairman of the Breaux commission. He ought to have \nsome idea of what is necessary.\n  I also remind my colleagues that structure reform is not easy. I will \nnever forget catastrophic attempts several years ago. That was about $4 \non seniors to pay for catastrophic and people went berserk. That thing \nwas repealed faster than a New York minute because of the politics and \nthe difficulty of addressing Medicare reform.\n  The Breaux commission did not come up with any super-majority \nrecommendation. They could not. It is so difficult, which is not to say \nwe should shirk from structure reform. Of course, we should work on \nstructural reform, but we also need general funds to help with \nMedicare.\n  I was very perplexed when I saw the chart put up by the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee. I want to ask him where he got his numbers. I \nknow where he got his numbers. They are his own numbers, not CBO \nnumbers. For example, the CBO baseline projection over the next 10 \nyears is a surplus of about--it is on the chart--of about $2.896 \nbillion. That is CBO.\n  If you look closely at the chairman's chart, down below in the corner \nit says: Source. What is the source? It is CBO and the Senate Budget \nCommittee, not just CBO.\n  We have the Senate Budget Committee--I am trying to avoid the phrase \n``cooked the books.'' I will tell you what it did to come up with the \nchart the chairman was showing. Here is what it did:\n  The Congressional Budget Office said, OK, we are going to freeze the \ncaps as required under the budget through the year 2002. Then CBO said: \nWe are going to assume a baseline at the rate of inflation for the \nremainder of the term up to about 2009. That is how they got this \nnumber, $2.896 billion.\n  What did the chairman of the Budget Committee do? He said: I know \nwhat I am going to do because the Democrats are really right. What I am \ngoing to do is come up with a different number to show there are more \nsavings.\n  How did he do it? He said: OK, I am going to freeze the baseline \nafter the year 2002 for discretionary spending, and that is going to \nmean that I get to come up with additional--that is the yellow, \ndomestic priorities.\n  The fact is, that is very unrealistic and it's not what CBO projects. \nI think we ought to use the same numbers. A lot of us on our side think \nCBO is a little tainted; it has become a little political over the \nyears. But I suggest we all start with the same numbers, and the best \nplace to start is CBO. If the Senate Budget Committee majority can come \nup with its numbers, I suppose the Budget Committee minority can come \nup with its own numbers. It is no different. That is where we are.\n  It is important for Senators to know those are not CBO numbers, those \nare Senate Budget Committee numbers. Those are the majority's numbers, \nnot CBO's numbers.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Just say the yellow is an illusion, it is not there, \nbecause most of us, if we are realistic, are going to assume we are \ngoing to at least keep up with inflation over those years. If we do not \nkeep up with inflation over those years, then we are going to \ndramatically cut programs.\n  How much are we going to cut? The figure is about a 54-percent cut in \ndomestic spending.\n  By saying there is no inflation rate considered past the year 2002, \nfor the rest of the term, these numbers represent, in effect, a 54-\npercent cut in discretionary spending. That is what it comes out to. \nThat is pretty big. So that is why I say that yellow is an illusion. It \nis not going to happen.\n  If I could address another point. My colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle made two basic charges. First, they say that this is a \nsmokescreen. That we really do not want a lockbox. My good friend, the \nSenator from New Mexico, said: Well, we have the points of order. It is \ntrue, we create an additional point of order, but it is a supermajority \npoint of order--60 votes. It is pretty hard to get more than 60 votes \naround here.\n  Witness the waiver on the Byrd rule did not get 60 votes. Oh, that \nside really wanted to waive the Byrd rule. They could not do it. They \ncould not get 60 votes. Sixty votes is a pretty big hurdle.\n  Make no mistake, we are very serious about protecting medicare. You \ncan also tell that we are serious because we are proposing a lockbox \nthat is very similar to the House lockbox which passed by an \noverwhelming margin.\n  Why is the Senate lockbox not a good idea? I will tell you why. \nBecause it says the debt limit has to go down on a step basis, \ndepending upon what CBO's projections really are for the debt. That is \nwhat it says. That is going to force all kinds of votes here to raise \nthe debt limit if it does not work out that way.\n  We know all the charades around here, all the politics, all the \nnonsense that goes on around here, because of votes on raising the debt \nlimit, whether or not to pay bills we know we have to pay anyway. It \njust doesn't make sense. It just does not make sense to tie the debt \nlimit to what CBO says the projections are going to be on the debt. We \nalready have a lockbox which works--at least the House thinks it works. \nThe House approved it. I think only a handful of House Members voted \nagainst it.\n  So we are saying the House lockbox basically works. House Republicans \nvoted for it; House Democrats voted for it. But we want to go one step \nfurther. We are also saying, let's reserve some money, a third of the \nsurplus each year, reserve that for Medicare. If it is not used, if \nstructural reform takes care of it and we do not have to use it, it can \nbe used for tax cuts, it can be used for defense spending, it can be \nused for whatever this body thinks makes the most sense. But only with \na supermajority vote.\n  My good colleagues on the other side of the aisle also made an \nargument about shifting $328 billion. That is a red herring. That \nargument has nothing to do with this issue. It is irrelevant.\n  The only point I am making is that of the $1 trillion on-budget \nsurplus, we ought to at least set aside a third in a reserve fund for \nmedicare.\n  Congress can decide what it wants to do in helping protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare. We can decide to provide for prescription drug \nbenefits. We can address the problems caused by the balanced budget \namendment cut backs. We can extend the solvency of the trust fund. That \nis what this amendment is all about. It is about reserving the funds \nnecessary to help America's seniors. It is actually very simple.\n  Again, I go back to my basic question, Where is the beef? How do our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle assure that are going to \nprovide for Medicare, provide for seniors, provide for drug benefits \nfor our elderly men and women? That is the problem.\n  I urge Senators, cut through all the rhetoric. Listen carefully to \nthe underlying words. Sometimes, what people don't say is just as \ntelling as what they do say. In this case, our good colleagues make no \npretense of guaranteeing funds for medicare. Whereas we say, very \nsimply, let's save a third of the surplus each year in a reserve fund. \nIf we need it, fine. If we do not need it, fine--we can reduce the debt \nand leave our options open.\n  We have this opportunity because we have the large projected on-\nbudget surplus in the future. We do not have these opportunities very \noften. How many Senators can remember times in the past having a $1 \ntrillion on-budget projected surplus? I can't. I do not think anyone \nelse can either.\n  What is the likelihood that is going to continue? What is the \nlikelihood we are going to have this opportunity 5 years from now? What \nis the likelihood\n\n[[Page S9508]]\n\nwe will have it 8, 10 years from now? Pretty slim; not very likely, in \nmy judgment.\n  So we have an opportunity. We have an opportunity to put aside the \nfunds necessary to extend the solvency of Medicare. We have the \nopportunity to put aside the funds necessary for structural reforms. We \nhave the opportunity to put aside the funds for a prescription drug \nbenefit. I am saying, let's preserve this surplus--let's keep our \noptions open.\n  Do you know what else our lockbox does? Deficit reduction. People \nwant deficit and debt reduction. They are tired of being saddled with \nthis debt. They don't want their children similarly constrained. That's \nwhy this lockbox is such a good proposal. If we don't need the funds \nfor the next, say, 10 years--because the Medicare trust fund will be \nsolvent at least until 2015--that is a $300 billion reduction in the \nnational debt. That is what it comes down to.\n  So, again, I do not hear anything from the other side aisle about any \nguarantees to help Medicare except for words--maybe something in the \nfuture about structural reform, but certainly not in the budget tax \ndebate--I repeat again, not one red cent for Medicare.\n  Helping to provide for Medicare is not a smokescreen because we do \nhave a Social Security lockbox that works. Our lockbox is very similar \nto the one that the House passed. They passed it. If they passed it by \nsuch a large margin, providing a supermajority point of order, it makes \nsense to me that we should do it. But let's go farther and protect \nMedicare. Let's have both. Let's protect Social Security. Let's also \nprotect Medicare. It is very simple. They are two parts of the same \npackage, if you will, to help the elderly.\n  We have a lot of very poor elderly. About a third of the American \nelderly rely solely on Social Security for income--about a third. There \nare a lot of people who just do not have any money. Virtually one-third \nare dependent upon it. There are about 44 million people on Social \nSecurity including folks with disabilities. The average payment is \nabout $750 a month. That is all. If a third are relying on only $750 a \nmonth, that means, clearly, they really need the help.\n  So, again: A lockbox for Social Security that works and a lockbox for \nMedicare that also works.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 33\\1/2\\ minutes; the other \nside has 17 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 20 minutes to my good friend, the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Montana. Perhaps I will use \nless time than that.\n  Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate. I heard \ncomments that I would describe as scornful, derisive, challenging \neverybody else's honesty.\n  I know one thing. When we are challenging someone else's honesty, it \nis a good idea to do it in front of a mirror. That way, one gets to see \nwhat perhaps one might be saying, and understanding where one is going, \nso that when one reviews the argument being made for or against a \nparticular point of view, if they want to talk in terms of dishonesty \nand in terms of scorn and in terms of derision about what is being \nsaid, it invites the same kind of commentary--which gets us nowhere.\n  It doesn't improve the debate. It doesn't make it clearer to the \nAmerican people. It doesn't establish a framework for really thinking \nthe problem through.\n  Mr. President, I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. And \nI want to suggest that my colleagues take a look at an article in the \nWall Street Journal, entitled ``GOP Uses Two Sets of Books.'' The \narticle explains that the GOP is using two sets of books--one from the \nOffice of Management and Budget, the other from the Congressional \nBudget Office. And, by taking the best of each, it's trying to hide the \nfact that, and I quote, ``lawmakers are poised again to raid the very \nsame Social Security funds they have promised to lock away.''\n  Mr. President, I don't accuse our friends on the other side of the \naisle of deliberate untruthfulness. But I hope the American people will \nbe able to understand what is really going on.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to this tax bill, there is no doubt \nwhere I stand. I stand for the majority of the American public. The \npeople who are concerned with making a living and providing for their \nchildren. The people who are working hard to help their parents and \ngrandparents. The people in families where two people are working, and \nwho are having a hard time meeting their obligations. When mom has to \nwork and dad has to work and they are either on different shifts or the \nsame shifts, it means one of the parents is not home to be with the \nchildren at times when that might provide the kind of encouragement and \nsustenance for development. There is a price to pay for it.\n  There is physical fatigue. My mother was a widow at age 36. She \nworked hard. I was old enough to be in the Army. My sister was only 12 \nwhen my father died. But there was exhaustion. It was hard to take care \nof all of the responsibilities.\n  When I look at tax cuts, I ask, which Americans need them? The guy \nmaking $800,000 a year? I don't think he needs a $23,000 tax cut. But \nthat's what he'd get under this bill. And that's money that we could be \nusing to pay off our national debt.\n  Mr. President, most Americans, if given the opportunity, would love \nto pay off their loans and their debts. Their mortgages. Their car \nloans. Well, that's what we want our nation to do.\n  But the Republicans, instead, want to use the money to provide \nmassive tax breaks for wealthy individuals and special interests. Oil \ninterests, mineral interests, many others. Instead of paying off our \ndebts and leaving our children free from that obligation, the \nRepublican bill would give that money to these special interests.\n  As you can tell, Mr. President, I object strongly to the Republican \ntax bill. This legislation raids surpluses that are needed for Social \nSecurity, that sacred covenant we have with people who have my color \nhair that says we want to care of them. It is a commitment we made, a \npromise we made, as we took the money from their paycheck.\n  I want to protect Social Security. My conscience calls for it. I have \nto make sure those who are paying Social Security are going to get the \nbenefits they expected when it comes to retirement time.\n  Medicare? There are few programs in this country that have the value \nto people like Medicare, which says that when you reach that age when \nsickness, when physical problems are not a surprise, you will get the \nmedical care you need. Those are essential, basic things--Social \nSecurity solvency, Medicare. These are for people when they are most \nvulnerable, in their older age. We have made a commitment that we are \ngoing to take care of them. Our friends on the Republican side say no, \ntax breaks; that is more important.\n  By the way, all of this is more show business than plain business. It \nis designed to let the American public think they want to be generous \nand they want to return the money, and we are sinners because we say we \nare going to help pay off the debt that your kids, Mr. and Mrs. \nAmerica, won't have to worry about.\n  They say: Who knows better how to spend the money? Is it those bad \nguys in Washington--bad guys and women; that is the way we are today--\nthose bad people in Washington who want to just take your money? I \nheard someone say ``take it and spend it,'' take it and spend it, like \nthat is the principal motive for responsible people serving here. I \nwouldn't accuse them of that, and I don't think they ought to accuse us \nof that silly nonsense. Take your money and spend it? That is not what \nanybody wants to do.\n  We want to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing. They \njust haven't learned how yet.\n  Mr. President, the cost of the tax breaks under their bill would \nincrease dramatically just when the baby boomers begin to retire. The \nbill would force drastic cuts in education, environmental protection, \nother priorities. It could lead to a return of higher interest rates. \nAnd it is fundamentally unfair.\n\n[[Page S9509]]\n\n  Mr. President, Democrats strongly support tax cuts for middle-class \nAmericans, ordinary people who are working hard to keep things \ntogether. We have proposed almost $300 billion worth of tax cuts. Our \ncuts were targeted to the middle class, the people who needed them \nmost. But we couldn't get the cooperation of our friends on the other \nside. We won't take funds needed for Social Security and Medicare like \nthe Republican bill does. They are willing to take it out of this \nSocial Security trust fund, which I will demonstrate later.\n  Neither Social Security nor Medicare has enough financing to support \nthe baby boomers in their retirement. We need to extend the solvency of \nboth programs. We need to pay off our debt, which now forces taxpayers \nto pay $225 billion a year in wasted interest payments. I guess they \ndon't want to stop that. They don't want to stop that. They would \nrather try to dole it out principally to people at the top of the \nincome ladder. They don't want to reduce that debt.\n  President Clinton has proposed to reserve all Social Security \nsurpluses for debt reduction as well as another $325 billion for \nMedicare. The Republicans openly oppose reserving non-Social Security \nsurpluses for Medicare, but they claim their bill reserves all Social \nSecurity surpluses for Social Security. The claim is untrue.\n  The bill before us would raid Social Security surpluses in 5 of the \nnext 10 years. This chart shows the numbers.\n  Here we are, 2005; that is practically around the corner. What does \nit say? Red. Everybody knows what red ink means. Minus $12 billion. \nThat is out of the Social Security trust fund. We have no place to get \nit. So instead of protecting Social Security, we are raiding Social \nSecurity because of the tax cut they want to give to the fat cats.\n  Consider what will happen in 2005. The non-Social Security surplus \nthat year will be $88.6 billion. But this bill would cost $89.9 \nbillion. The bill therefore would directly create Social Security \nsurpluses of $1.3 billion in that year. However, the real raid on \nSocial Security would be much deeper. This legislation would increase \ndebt and lead to higher interest costs. In 2005 alone, these additional \ninterest costs would eat up another $10.9 billion of Social Security \nsurpluses. So the total raid on Social Security would be over $12 \nbillion in 2005.\n  If you consider both the direct revenue losses and the additional \ninterest costs, this bill would raid the Social Security surplus in \neach of the second 5 years after enactment.\n  Mr. President, I think I know what the Republicans would say about \nthis. They will promise that even if this bill does spend Social \nSecurity surpluses, many years from now, Congress will somehow make \nhuge cuts in programs, such as education and the environment, to offset \nthese costs. Unfortunately, it is an empty promise that is completely \nunenforceable. No credibility.\n  Consider the depth of the cuts that would be required. If you assume \nthe Republican Congress funds defense programs at the levels presently \nproposed by President Clinton, by the end of the 10 year period, \ndomestic needs, everything from education and environmental protection, \nto the FBI, would have to be cut roughly 40 percent. Is that credible? \nA 40-percent cut in student aid? A 40-percent cut in health research? A \n40-percent cut in veterans' programs?\n  That is not going to happen. But that is the pretense under which we \nare operating.\n  The Republicans are saying we have to reduce and cut programs. But \nthe American people need to understand what that would mean. Head \nStart--375,000 preschool children would be denied services that help \nthem come to school ready to learn. The FBI--that is a favorite of all \nof ours because they do very important work--would have to cut 6,300 \nagents in order to accommodate this. VA medical care--a promise that \nwas made to veterans, and to me when I enlisted in the Army--they would \ntreat 1.4 million fewer patients. Superfund--the wonderful program that \nhelps clean up toxic waste sites in our society--no funding would be \nprovided for any new cleanups, due to begin in 2009. Are summer jobs \nimportant? I think so. But 270,000 young people would lose jobs and \ntraining opportunities. The list goes on.\n  Look how the tax breaks in this bill explode in cost. In the first \nyear, they cost $4.2 billion. By the last year, they cost almost $200 \nbillion. In the following 10 years, these costs explode even more. All \nof this will be happening when the baby boomers start retiring.\n  In other words, the Republican plan doesn't just raid the Social \nSecurity trust fund; it also would undermine the Government's revenue \nbase and dramatically increase the chances that Social Security \nbenefits will be cut.\n  Similarly, this bill proposes a very real threat to Medicare. The \nMedicare trust fund is now scheduled to go bankrupt by 2015. President \nClinton has proposed a comprehensive reform plan that would extend \nsolvency through 2027, for a dozen years or more. He wants to provide a \nnew prescription drug benefit for older Americans. That is going to \ncome from the surpluses that we enjoy, as long as we don't give them \naway.\n  What does this legislation do for Medicare? Zero. There is not a \npenny to extend the program's solvency, and not one penny for \nprescription drugs.\n  Another problem with the bill is that it is fundamentally unfair. It \nis loaded up with various special interest provisions. Meanwhile, \nordinary Americans are left with a few crumbs.\n\n  If we look at this chart, the top 1 percent of the income earners, \nearning $837,000, get a $23,344 cut. If you are in the bottom 60 \npercent, earning below $38,000, you get $141. That is less than 50 \ncents a day. I hope those people making $38,000 don't go out and blow \nthat 50 cents a day.\n  Another problem with this bill, according to an analysis by Citizens \nfor Tax Justice, the top 1 percent of the taxpayers, those with incomes \nover $300,000--and the average, as we saw, is $837,000--will get those \njuicy tax breaks that we see here, while the bottom 60 percent will get \nthat $141.\n  That is not fair. Beyond the threat to Social Security, Medicare, \neducation, and other priorities, and beyond its fundamental unfairness, \nthis bill also poses a significant risk to our economy.\n  It would be one thing to call for huge tax cuts if our Nation were in \nthe middle of a recession. Sometimes you need a boost, a stimulus, but \ntoday our economy is very strong. In this kind of an environment, a \nlarge fiscal stimulus is dangerous.\n  The Federal Reserve just tightened monetary policy, forcing up \ninterest rates to preempt inflation. Chairman Greenspan suggested last \nweek the Fed may raise interest rates again to preserve price \nstability. A huge tax cut in these conditions would be a serious \nmistake. It could force up interest rates, which could drag down the \ninvestment that is driving our economy. As Chairman Greenspan \ntestified, ``The timing is not right.''\n  Mr. President, we are doing no favors for middle-class families if we \ngive them a tax break worth less than 50 cents a day and then force \nthem to pay higher interest rates on their mortgages and their car \npayments.\n  Mr. President, before I close, I want to take a minute to respond to \nan analysis released last week by the Congressional Budget Office. That \nanalysis supposedly shows that the GOP budget plan reduces debt more \nthan the President's. But the analysis is highly misleading, largely \nbecause it is based on questionable assumptions.\n  For example, the analysis assumes the Congress will abide by this \nyear's spending cap, even though the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, a distinguished Senator, Senator Stevens from Alaska, says \nthere is no way he can pass the bills without more money. It then \nassumes that Congress will abide by the caps in 2001 and 2002, which \nare both lower than this year's.\n  Then, to top it off, CBO assumes Congress will cut even further in \nreal terms in each of the following 7 years. Mr. and Mrs. Public, don't \nyou believe that. Congress is not going to make cuts like that in \nveterans' medical care. We are not going to permit Head Start to be \ndecimated. We are not going to cut out programs that people depend on \nfor their very lives.\n  Mr. President, people really need many of these programs. Most don't \nlike to depend on government if they can avoid it. My father at the \nheight of the depression was most ashamed of\n\n[[Page S9510]]\n\nthe fact that he had to go to work for WPA, the public works program. \nHe demanded dignity. He demanded it almost more than his pride would \npermit. He worked for a government program, and he was ashamed to tell \nanybody. People like him do not want government programs. I had my GI \nbill for my education. I took it because I thought that in the final \nanalysis not only would it help me, but it would help me to be a better \ncitizen, to make a contribution to my country.\n  The Congressional Budget Office is assuming we will not abide by the \nspending caps. They are assuming we are actually going to cut almost \n$200 billion below it. That is not credible.\n  CBO's analysis also contains a variety of questionable statements. \nFor example, it ignores the extra $14 billion in tax breaks that were \nadded to the $778 billion originally assumed in the budget resolution. \nIt also ignores the Budget Committee's directive to CBO that it use \ndifferent scorekeeping estimates when it scores appropriations bills.\n  Those mandates for special, ``directed scoring'' will allow the \nAppropriations Committee to spend more, and will reduce the surplus by \nat least $18 billion. Yet CBO doesn't even mention this in its \nanalysis.\n  Mr. President, there are other inaccuracies and distortions in the \nCBO analysis. But together they undermine the credibility of last \nweek's analysis. And, unfortunately, they've raised many questions on \nthis side of the aisle about CBO's fairness and objectivity.\n  Mr. President, CBO is supposed to be objective and fair to both \nsides. They are just supposed to look at the numbers. That is all.\n  Mr. President, let me close by just recapping the main problems with \nthe Republican tax bill.\n  It raids Social Security surpluses in several years.\n  It leaves nothing for Medicare.\n  Its costs explode in the future, just when the baby boomers will be \nretiring.\n  It would force extreme cuts in education, health care, crime \nfighting, and other priorities.\n  Its tax breaks are unfair, and give huge benefits to special \ninterests and the wealthiest Americans.\n  And it's fiscally irresponsible, risking higher interest rates and a \nreturn to the days of red ink and large deficits.\n  In sum, Mr. President, this is extreme legislation. It may appeal to \nthe far right wing of the Republican Party. But by posing such a direct \nthreat to Social Security and Medicare, it's inconsistent with the \nvalues of mainstream American families.\n  That is why this President is determined to veto it the minute it \nreaches his desk, and he should.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and to support the amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the principle of the Bancus amendment \ngoes to the heart of this debate. We should not enact tax cuts which \nwill use up virtually the entire surplus before we solve the \nsignificant financial problems facing Social Security and Medicare.\n  Placing Social Security and Medicare on a firm financial footing \nshould be our highest budget priorities. The surplus gives us a unique \nopportunity to extend the long-term solvency of these two vital \nprograms, without hurting the senior citizens who depend upon them. We \nshould seize that opportunity.\n  Two-thirds of senior citizens depend on Social Security retirement \nbenefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. Without \nit, half of the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. \nThese same retirees rely on Medicare for their only access to needed \nhealth care. For all of them, the Republican proposal does absolutely \nnothing. It does not provide one new dollar to support Social Security \nor Medicare. It squanders the unique opportunity which the surplus has \ngiven us.\n  Social Security and Medicare represent America at its best. They \nreflect a commitment to every worker that disability and retirement \nwill not mean poverty and untreated illness. They are a compact between \nthe Federal government and its citizens that says: work hard and \ncontribute to the system when you are young, and we will guarantee your \nfinancial security and your health security when you are old.\n  It has been said that the measure of a society is how well it takes \ncare of its most vulnerable citizens--the very young and the very old. \nBy that standard, Social Security and Medicare are among the finest \nachievements in all of our history. Because of Social Security and \nMedicare, millions of senior citizens are able to spend their \nretirement years in security and dignity. A Republican tax cut of the \nmagnitude proposed here today will put their retirement security in \nserious jeopardy.\n  In the first ten years, the Republican tax cut of $792 billion--plus \nthe increased interest on the national debt required by it--will \nconsume all but $25 billion of the $996 billion surplus. The cost of \nthe tax cut alone will mushroom to two trillion dollars between 2010 \nand 2019, plus hundreds of billions more in additional debt service. \nThere will be no surplus left to strengthen Social Security and \nMedicare for future generations of retirees. The needs of the millions \nof Americans who depend on these basic programs for their well-being \nare ignored.\n  Democrats propose a very different set of priorities for the surplus. \nWe commit one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next decade \nand more thereafter--to Medicare. And beginning in 2011, we would \ndedicate all of the savings which will result from debt reduction to \nSocial Security.\n  Today, interest on the debt consumes nearly 13% of the federal \nbudget. Under the President's plan, by 2015, that annual debt interest \nexpense will be completely eliminated. As a result, between 2011 and \n2019, more than a trillion additional dollars will be available to pay \nfuture Social Security benefits. We will be meeting our responsibility \nto future generations of retirees.\n  In addition, the GOP tax cut is fundamentally unfair in additional \nways. It distributes the overwhelming majority of its tax breaks to \nthose with the highest incomes. The authors of the Republican plan \nhighlight the reduction of the 15% tax bracket to 14%. They point to \nthis reduction as middle class tax relief. But that relief is only a \nsmall part of the overall tax breaks in their plan. It accounts for \nonly $216 billion of the $792 billion in GOP tax cuts. Most of the \nremaining provisions are heavily tilted toward the highest income \ntaxpayers.\n  If the Republican plan is enacted and implemented, nearly 50% of the \ntax benefits would go to the richest 5% of taxpayers--and more than 75% \nof the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20%. Those with annual \nincomes exceeding $300,000 would receive tax breaks of $23,000 a year. \nBy contrast, the lowest 60% of wage-earners would share less than 11% \nof the total tax cuts--they would receive an average tax cut of only \n$139 a year.\n\n  The choice could not be more stark--it is between using the entire \nsurplus for an enormous GOP tax cut which overwhelmingly benefits the \nwealthiest Americans, or using the surplus for modest tax cuts that \nleave room to preserve Social Security and Medicare for future \ngenerations of retirees.\n\n\n                            social security\n\n  On Social Security itself, the Republican proposal is misleading. The \nrhetoric surrounding it conveys the false impression that it is a major \nstep toward protecting Social Security. In truth, it does nothing to \nstrengthen Social Security.\n  The Republican plan would not provide even one additional dollar to \npay benefits to future retirees. It would not extend the life of the \nTrust Fund by one more day. It merely pledges to give to Social \nSecurity the dollars which already belong to Social Security under \ncurrent law.\n  By contrast, by drawing on the surplus, President Clinton's proposed \nbudget would contribute more than a trillion new dollars to Social \nSecurity over the next twenty years. Beginning in 2011, the \nAdministration's plan would devote all of the savings which will result \nfrom debt reduction to the Social Security Trust Fund. That step would \nextend the life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond \n2050.\n  In fact, the Republican plan does not even effectively guarantee that \nexisting payroll tax revenues will be used to pay Social Security \nbenefits. There are trap doors in the Republican\n\n[[Page S9511]]\n\n``lockbox.'' A genuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those dollars \nwould be in the Trust Fund when they are needed to pay benefits to \nfuture recipients. But that is not what the Republican plan does.\n  Our Republican friends claim that the enormous tax cuts they have \nproposed will have no impact on Social Security, because they are not \nusing payroll tax revenues. On the contrary, the fact that the \nRepublican budget commits every last dollar of the on-budget surplus to \ntax cuts does imperil Social Security.\n  First, revenue estimates projected ten years into the future are \nnotoriously unreliable. As the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice candidly acknowledged:\n\n       Ten year budget projections are highly uncertain. In the \n     space of only six months, CBO's estimate of the cumulative \n     surplus has increased by nearly $300 billion. Further changes \n     of that or a greater magnitude are likely--in either \n     direction--as a result of economic fluctuations, \n     administrative and judicial actions, and other developments.\n\n  Despite this warning, the Republican tax cut leaves no margin for \nerror. If we commit the entire surplus to tax cuts and the full surplus \ndoes not materialize, Social Security revenues will be required to \ncover the shortfall in tax cuts.\n  Second, even if the projected surplus does materialize, the cost of \nthe Republican budget exceeds the surplus in five of the next ten \nyears--2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009. Unless the Republican proposal \nis restructured, Social Security revenues will be required to cover the \nshortfall in each of those years.\n  Third, the Republican tax cut leaves no funds to pay for emergency \nspending, which has averaged $9 billion a year in recent years. Over \nthe next decade, we are likely to need approximately $90 billion to \ncover emergency needs. That money has to come from somewhere. With the \nentire surplus spent on tax cuts, the Social Security Trust Fund will \nhave to fund these emergency costs as well.\n  These three threats to Social Security that I have described are very \nreal. They expose the fundamental flaws that prevent the Republican \n``lockbox'' from being a genuine lockbox for Social Security.\n  In addition, there is an even greater threat to Social Security in \nthe out-years. Under the President's plan, the Social Security Trust \nFund would receive 543 billion new dollars from the surplus between \n2011 and 2014, and it would receive an additional $189 billion each \nyear after that. The Republican tax cut will make the President's plan \nimpossible to carry out. The cost of their tax cut proposal mushrooms \nto over $2 trillion between 2010 and 2019. It will consume all of the \nsurplus dollars which were intended for Social Security. There will be \nnothing left for Social Security. As a result, no new dollars will flow \ninto the Trust Fund, and the future of Social Security will remain in \nserious doubt.\n\n\n                                medicare\n\n  The failures of the Republican plan to preserve and strengthen \nMedicare is just as serious. Today, Medicare is a lifeline for the 40 \nmillion elderly and disabled citizens who depend on it for health care. \nIt is an essential part of our health care system. It allows families \nto save to send a child to college, instead of saving to send a parent \nto the hospital. It fulfills its founding promise, in which everyone \npays in to Medicare during their working years, and everyone benefits \nfrom good health care during retirement.\n  The Republican budget threatens to destroy Medicare by putting it on \na starvation diet. Instead of protecting Medicare in anticipation of \nthe largest demographic challenge in its history, the Republican budget \nsacrifices Medicare on the altar of tax breaks for the rich. There is \nnot one additional dime for Medicare in the Republican budget, although \nthat budget contains nearly $800 billion in tax breaks that \ndisproportionately benefit the wealthy.\n  Make no mistake. This budget will determine whether we keep the \nmedical care in Medicare. This budget will determine whether Medicare \nwill continue strong and continue to guarantee the protections that are \nso essential for senior citizens in the years ahead.\n  Unfortunately, the pending bill falls unacceptably short of reaching \nthese important goals. It is, in fact, a thinly-veiled assault on \nMedicare and an affront to every senior citizen who has earned the \nright to affordable health care by a lifetime of hard work. It is a \nbill that says $800 billion of new tax breaks for the rich are more \nimportant than preserving Medicare for our senior citizens.\n  The top priority for the American people is to protect both Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But this budget puts tax breaks for the rich \nfirst, and Medicare and Social Security last.\n  Our proposal says: save Social Security and Medicare by devoting all \nof the Social Security surplus to Social Security, and by reserving \none-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. It says: extend the \nsolvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, not by raiding Social Security but \nby assuring that some of the benefits of our booming economy are used \nto preserve, protect, and strengthen Medicare. It says that we should \nmodernize Medicare to ensure that all senior citizens have access to \naffordable medications.\n  Some of the other side contend that we should not provide additional \nfunds for Medicare. They say we should look for additional ways to \nreduce Medicare spending. But Medicare spending growth is at an all-\ntime low. In fact, evidence is mounting that Congress has already cut \ntoo much from Medicare in the drive to balance the budget in 1997.\n  While Democrats and Republicans have different opinions about how \nbest to reform Medicare, one fact remains clear: Starting in 2010, the \nretirement of the baby boom generation will begin in earnest. Without a \nsignificant investment now to prepare Medicare for the financial \ndemands of that era, the only options will be to dramatically cut \nbenefits or raise taxes.\n  According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if \nwe do nothing, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will \nrequire benefit cuts of almost 11%--massive cuts of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--or double-digit payroll tax increases. Keeping \nMedicare solvent for the next 50 years will require cuts of 25%--or \neven larger payroll tax increases.\n\n  Under the guise of reform, some argue that we should reduce our \nobligation to support guaranteed benefits. They favor proposals to \nprivatize Medicare, or turn it into little more than a voucher \nprogram--leaving senior citizens to the tender mercy of profiteering \nprivate insurance companies. Nothing could be more devastating for \nAmerica's elderly--today and in the future.\n  We have a clear opportunity to protect Medicare. All we have to do is \nreserve a fair share of the surplus for Medicare. But instead of \nprotecting Medicare, the pending bill uses $800 billion of the surplus \nto pay for new tax breaks. You don't need a degree in higher \nmathematics to understand what is going on here. This Republican plan \nis Medicare malpractice.\n  Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren \nknow, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are \nalready stretched to the limit--and often beyond the limit--to purchase \nthe health care they need.\n  Because of gaps in Medicare and rising health cost, Medicare now \ncovers only about 50% of the health bills of senior citizens. On \naverage, senior citizens spend 19% of their limited incomes to purchase \nthe health care they need--almost as large a proportion as they had to \npay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. Many low-income \nsenior citizens have to pay even more as a proportion of their income.\n  By 2025, if we do nothing, the proportion of out-of-pocket spending \ndevoted to health care expenses will rise to 29%. Too often, even with \ntoday's Medicare benefits, senior citizens have to choose between \nputting food on the table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health \ncare they need.\n  The typical Medicare beneficiary is a widow, seventy-six years old, \nwith an annual income of $10,000. She has one or more chronic \nillnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet this budget would cut \nher Medicare benefits in order to pay for new tax breaks for the \nwealthy. These are women who will be unable to see their doctor, who \nwill go without needed prescription drugs, or without meals or heat, so \nthat wealthy Americans earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year \ncan have tens of thousands of dollars more a year in additional tax \nbreaks.\n  This is the wrong priority for spending our hard-earned surplus--and \nthe\n\n[[Page S9512]]\n\nwrong priority for America. And the American people know it.\n  As we debate these issues this week, the response of our opponents is \npredictable. They deny that they have any plans to cut Medicare. But \nthe American people will not be fooled. They know that our plan and the \nPresident's plan will put Medicare on a sound financial basis for the \nnext generation--without benefit cuts, without tax increases, without \nraising the retirement age, and without privatizing Medicare.\n  In this debate, we intend to offer Senators a chance to vote on \nwhether they are sincere about protecting both Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  Our opponents are already trying to confuse the issue. They say that \nit is wrong to put the surplus into Medicare.\n  The workers of this country are the ones who have earned this \nsurplus--and they want to use it to preserve and protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare, not use it for new tax breaks for the wealthiest \nAmericans.\n  Our opponents say that our proposal just puts new I.O.U.s into the \nTrust Fund. Let's be very clear. There are two ways to restore \nMedicare's financial stability. One way is to cut benefits. The other \nway is to provide new resources. Our proposal puts new resources in the \nMedicare Trust Fund. It takes funds that would otherwise be used for a \ntax cut for the wealthy, and uses them instead to maintain the health \nprotection the elderly need and deserve--and have earned. In terms of \nits effect on Medicare, it is no different from depositing payroll tax \nreceipts in the Trust Fund, as we do today.\n\n  Those on the other side of the aisle have tried to conceal their \nneglect of Medicare. They say that their plan does not cut Medicare. \nThat may be true in a narrow, legalistic sense--but it is fundamentally \nfalse in every way that counts.\n  Between now and 2025, Medicare has a shortfall of almost $1 trillion. \nIf we do nothing to address that shortfall, we are imposing almost $1 \ntrillion in Medicare cuts, just as surely as if we said so directly in \nthe text of the legislation. No amount of rhetoric can conceal this \nfundamental fact. The authors of the pending bill had a choice between \nsupporting Medicare or slashing Medicare--and they chose to slash \nMedicare.\n  A vote for our alternative is a clear statement that Congress should \npreserve and protect Medicare for today's elderly and their children \nand grandchildren. Rejection of our alternative is an equally clear \nstatement--in favor of new tax cuts for the rich, paid for by harsh and \nunacceptable cuts in Medicare.\n  In 1935, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Social \nSecurity Act, he said it was ``a cornerstone in a structure which is \nbeing built but is by no means complete.''\n  The creation of Medicare 30 years later added significantly to that \nstructure. On the threshold of a new century, the time has come to add \nagain to that structure.\n  We can modernize Medicare and prepare for the 21st century--the \ncentury of life sciences. We can prepare for the massive influx of \nretirees from the baby boom generation, if we devote the resources \nneeded to do so. The surplus was generated in part by Medicare savings, \nand it is only right that a responsible portion be invested in \nmodernizing and strengthening the Medicare.\n  We know how the American people want us to vote. Congress should \nlisten to their voice. The opponents of Medicare were wrong in 1965, \nand they are wrong in 1999.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Mr. President, it would be amusing, if it weren't tragic, to hear the \nrepresentations made by those on the other side of the aisle that the \nRepublicans are indifferent to our senior citizens and to Medicare, or \nindifferent to Social Security.\n  Let us not forget the Social Security lockbox is a Republican \nconcept.\n  They come to us saying how aggressively they are supporting what \nhappened in the House. It is about time they started to support a \nlockbox of some sort. They filibustered that at least six times \npreviously to keep it from being here. It is time we have a lockbox.\n  We enacted a credible lockbox to protect Social Security so our \nseniors won't be jeopardized by a reckless sort of effort to spend.\n  There is real distress on the part of our colleagues on the Democrat \nside of this Chamber who are afraid we are not going to leave enough \nmoney to spend. Their spending habit is hard to break.\n  But I think we ought to understand the American people are paying in \nover the next 10 years $3.3 trillion of surplus, and they don't want to \nbuy that much more government. They want some change to go to the \nstore.\n  You by a gallon of milk, and you give them 10 bucks. You don't expect \nthem to start adding other items to your order to fill up what you \ncould have bought with your 10 bucks. You expect to get your money back \nwhen you pay in a surplus, and the American people should do that.\n  They suggested we don't have any money to deal with a Medicare \nproblem. It is pretty clear we have $505 billion available to deal with \nMedicare, if we choose to, over the next 10 years.\n  Just for example, the President said he could fix it for $48 billion. \nAnd $505 billion is 10 times that much. But I don't recommend that we \nallocate a specific amount to fix Medicare before we have decided how \nto reform Medicare.\n  The Senator from Tennessee eloquently stated the position of the \nComptroller General of the United States, our sort of auditor, the \nperson who looks at things and asks: How are you doing? Is this \nreasonable? Does it make sense?\n  He indicates that just pouring more money into a system that is \nbroken--well, you know, if you just step on the gas in a car that is \ngoing in the wrong direction, it doesn't get you to your destination \nany more quickly. The key is to reform Medicare and have a resource \navailable when you reform it. That is the Republican plan.\n  Are we being irresponsible by taking 23.8 cents out of every surplus \ndollar and saying to the American people who earned it that we are \ngoing to return it?\n  There is an old slogan in Washington. ``You send it; we spend it.''\n  People are a little tired of that.\n  We have the highest tax rate in the history of the country. Even \nState and local rates are higher in many cases caused by our mandates \non State and local government.\n  We have a $3.3 trillion surplus, and someone says we should save tax \ncuts for when it is the right time for tax cuts as if the timing is \ncontingent on the Government.\n  I tell you. It is the American people's money. Their timing ought to \nbe considered.\n\n  I think the American families need resources to do for themselves \nnow, that they should have the money to do it for themselves, and not \nhave to rely on government. We should make that choice.\n  I rise to say that this business about us not having a regard for \nMedicare should be dismissed.\n  We want to reform Medicare. We don't want to pour more resources into \na bucket, the bottom of which is like a sieve.\n  Sure. We will do what we can to sustain the system. It is \nsustainable, according to the most recent data, until the year 2014. It \nis good. But we shouldn't decide to just pour money into that system. \nWe should reform it.\n  There was a bipartisan commission led by Senator Breaux that would \nhave reformed it. The proposed reform led by Senator Breaux wasn't to \ntake a lot of money. As a matter of fact, it was to save money.\n  We are willing to make resources available. But the idea that somehow \nwe have to lock up $300 billion in order to make possible a reform of \nthe system when the $300 billion will keep people from wanting to \nreform it, and just wanting to spend what is there is not the way to \nhandle the problem.\n  The chairman of the bipartisan commission, Senator Breaux, I don't \nbelieve supported that provision when it was before the Finance \nCommittee. I don't think we should support it now.\n\n[[Page S9513]]\n\n  But it is time for us to say to the American people what we said in \nour budget process, what the Senate voted, I believe, 99-0 to do; and \nthat is to lock up the Social Security surplus.\n  It is a program which we promised to the American people. It is a \nprogram that can go forward. We ought to have that resource available \nto them. We agreed on that. The House agreed on that.\n  Talk about the House agreement on the other side of the aisle, yes. \nThis is what the House agreed to--lock up Social Security. I think that \nis what we ought to do.\n  We expect to have $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses over the \nnext 10 years. We ought to make sure we don't spend it on anything \nelse. That is the Republican plan. It ought to be the Republican plan. \nIt is the Democrat plan, and the President's plan. The President agreed \nto it. He said we needed a durable lockbox, ``period.'' He didn't say a \nlockbox for Social Security and add Medicare. The President didn't say \nthat. He said we need a Social Security lockbox, period. The ``period'' \nwas his language, not mine. It is not some Republican plot. The \nPresident said it. The House of Representatives said it. The Republican \nSenate has been asking for it, filibustered on the other side of the \naisle time after time after time after time after time after time, and \nnow trying to keep us from doing it again.\n  I think we need to make sure we honor and respect the retirement \nsecurity of individuals who expect us to protect Social Security.\n  Having done that, and we find out there is roughly half of the next \n10 years' surplus that is not earmarked for Social Security and it is \nnot paid in for Social Security, that money could be divided between \ntax relief and resources for contingencies that come up in this body, \nor to the United States Congress. That is why we planned $792 billion \nin tax relief.\n  Some say: Is that too much? Is it too little? It is 23-plus percent \nof the total surplus.\n  The lion's share of the total surplus should go right into this \nlockbox. This proposal that Senator Domenici, Senator Abraham, I, and \nother Senators have been talking about, taking Social Security money \nand earmarking it for Social Security benefits alone, and then \nreserving the $505 billion that is available in addition to that for \nfuture contingencies and needs including, if necessary, transitional \ncosts for reform in Medicare. The Senator from Tennessee eloquently \nrelated comments by the Comptroller General of the United States.\n  This is a resource we now have that we do not have a right to keep, \nin my judgment. The American people have overpaid their taxes. Like a \nshopkeeper, who has a responsibility to give back change when they are \npaid too much for an ordered item, rather than trying to foist off an \nextra gallon of milk, another ham or another box of cereal, another box \nof nails or hammer if you are at the hardware store, when a person has \npaid more for the item than requested, they get their money returned.\n  Return the money to the American people. The American people earned \nthis money. This is not money that came from Government. This is not \nfrom the magic of the Congress. This is not from the creativity of the \nPresident. This isn't the product of the bureaucracy. This is the \nproduct of the hard work of American families. In many families, both \nparents work. In some families, both parents are working two jobs or \nextra work. They have sacrificed and sweat. It is their money.\n  We have to make a decision. Are we going to fund families in this \ncountry or are we going to fund bureaucracy? Are we going to let \nfamilies have an opportunity to spend the resources which they have \ncreated? We must. In order for them to be confident about the fact we \nare not giving away the future, make clear that the President has said \nwe need what the House of Representatives voted 416-12 in favor of, and \nthat is a lockbox to protect Social Security.\n  With that in mind, I say we have a responsibility to the American \npeople to put the Social Security proceeds in the lockbox, to have a \nprudent approach to the rest of the expenses. Say to the American \npeople with that $800 billion over the next 10 years: You earned it; we \nreturned it. Let's end this idea of: You send it; we spend it. Our \ndesire and appetite should not be unlimited.\n  I thank the Chair for this opportunity to support the concept of a \nlockbox.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Abraham's \nSocial Security lockbox amendment to the Taxpayer Refund Act. This is \nthe third time the Senate has considered this language and I believe it \nis appropriate that we take up this matter during the debate on the \nreturning the non-Social Security surplus for tax cuts. This amendment \nshould put an end once and for all to the rhetoric about raiding the \nSocial Security trust fund to provide tax cuts. By passing this \namendment, the Social Security surplus will be protected.\n  Congress has the responsibility to create a firewall between the \nSocial Security surplus and the discretionary surplus to ensure that we \ncan meet the future needs of retirees. The Social Security surplus is \nspoken for and Congress must take steps to ensure that the money is \nprotected and ready for the future.\n  The source of the surplus is a rising inflow of Social Security \npayroll taxes. This is money that comes out of the paycheck of every \nworking American who has been paying into the system and we deserve to \ngive them some assurance that the money will be there when they retire. \nUnder the current budget rules, this revenue is treated like revenue \nfrom another source--it is put into the general fund and then spent. \nThe lockbox would capture the difference between the inflows to the \nSocial Security trust fund and the payment of benefits to current \nretirees--reserving it for the Social Security program and helping to \nguarantee benefits for future retirees.\n  The amendment that we are debating tonight also prohibits transfers \nbetween the general fund and Social Security. That is an important \nprovision, it prevents the president and Congress from playing hide the \nball and shifting money from the Social Security trust fund to the \ngeneral fund and replacing that money with IOUs. An IOU in the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund is an obligation of the United States Government, \nit is a debt that we must pay back. Where is that money going to come \nfrom? We cannot repay an IOU with an IOU. We must hold on the Social \nSecurity surplus in a budgetary lockbox and protect it.\n  The Social Security lockbox will also protect the Social Security \nsurplus from wasteful spending and ensure that the money will be there \nto fulfill future obligations. Just as corporations are prohibited from \nspending their pension funds on regular business expenses, Congress \nshould have the same restrictions on the Social Security surplus. If \ncompany executives handled pension funds like the current use of Social \nSecurity the executives would be in jail. The temptation to go back to \nthe old tax and spending ways is too great if Congress has access to a \ngrowing pot of money. Congress must not go back to the old spending \nrules. Just because we have a surplus does not mean hat the battle has \nbeen won. It means that we must continue to be watchful and ensure that \nthe surplus is used wisely.\n  One of the attacks we have heard from the White House and the \nDemocrats is that the we should not refund American's hard-earned money \nto them because we still have an enormous federal debt. I find this \nargument astonishing given the spending appetites of many on the other \nside of the aisle. There is nothing quite like a good tax cut to turn a \ntax-and-spender into a deficit hawk. While I fear this interest in \nretiring the national debt may be short-lived metamorphosis, I welcome \nthe interest of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle in \nfiscal responsibility. In fact, I would invite them to join me as a \ncosponsor of Senator Alldard's bill to retire the entire national debt \nover a 30-year period. I believe that debt reduction is consistent with \na tax cut. We need to pay off our debt obligations and trim the \nallowance of the federal government by returning some of the taxpayers \noverpayment to them.\n  The lock-box amendment furthers this goal of debt reduction. This \namendment includes higher debt reduction provisions than previous lock-\nbox\n\n[[Page S9514]]\n\nproposals. As the surplus has continued to grow Senator Abraham has \nmoved the bar higher. The amendment requires more debt reduction as the \nsurplus grows and I believe the American people expect that. Debt \nreduction creates a ripple effect throughout the economy in the form of \nlower interest rates for home mortgages or car loans or student loans.\n  The time has come for the White House and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to finally provide protection for the Social Security \nprogram. Congress must not continue to pay lip service to the concept \nof preserving the Social Security surplus. We must take the bold steps \nnecessary to ensure that the program is around for the long term. We \nmust not use long term funds to satisfy short term wishes. I urge may \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this important in the Taxpayer \nRefund Act of 1999.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, a couple of points. I heard my good friend, the \nSenator from Missouri say, as has often been stated, they are using \nonly 23 percent of the surplus for tax reduction.\n  I think it is important to get the facts out so the American public \ncan decide what the truth is. The fact is, about $3 trillion is \nprojected over the next 10 years. Mr. President, $2 trillion off-\nbudget, Social Security surplus; $1 trillion on-budget surplus. No one \ndisputes that.\n  We also agree that the roughly $2 trillion generated by the payroll \ntax, the off-budget surplus, should be reserved for Social Security. We \nall agree to that. What is in dispute is the $1 trillion remaining on-\nbudget surplus.\n  The Republican tax cut essentially uses it all, roughly $800 billion, \nplus the interest expense added on because the tax cut will increase \ninterest, which amounts to a 97-percent tax cut of the on-budget \nsurplus.\n  So that we have our facts straight, it is roughly 25 percent of the \ntotal, if we include the $2 trillion for Social Security that we all \nagree to protect. What is in dispute is how much of the $1 trillion on \nbudget is used for a tax cut. The answer to that is about 97 percent, \nincluding the interest. If interest is not included, maybe about 60 or \n70 percent of the surplus is used for a tax cut.\n  Decide which numbers to use. Those are the facts. I will not stand \nhere and say it is necessarily 97 percent or it is necessarily 23 \npercent. I think people should recognize what the truth is.\n  I have a couple of points. This is about choices. Either we choose to \nset aside one-third of the on-budget surplus for Medicare for seniors, \nor we don't. That is the choice. That is the choice we have between the \ntwo lockbox amendments. One says lockbox Social Security only; the \nother says lockbox Social Security and Medicare. We believe the proper \nchoice is to protect Medicare.\n  There is a deeper choice I want to talk about for a moment. It is a \nchoice that many senior citizens in our country make each day. Do they \nchoose to use their income to pay for drugs or do they choose their \nincome for food, to pay the rent, or to pay for the bus? That is the \nchoice that many senior citizens make each day.\n  About 16 million Americans are faced with that choice a day. That is, \n16 million Americans rely solely on Social Security for their income. \nAbout 30 percent of American senior citizens rely solely on Social \nSecurity for their income, which comes out to about $750 a month. \nSeniors with a total income of about $750 a month have to make choices. \nChoose for drugs, choose to pay the rent, choose to pay the food bill, \nthe bus, taxi service--those are the choices. They have to decide which \namong the choices to make.\n  We are saying let's help the seniors with that choice. Let's help \nseniors pay the drug bill. Let's help seniors pay a little more of the \ndoctor bill. If there is anything that obsesses senior citizens, it is \ntheir health.\n  I will never forget when I was walking across Montana campaigning for \nCongress 24 years ago, I was walking toward Butte, MT, near Elk Park. I \nwas walking down the highway, and I could see perpendicular to me an \nolder fellow hunched up way off in the distance walking toward his \nmailbox. I could tell we were going to meet at the mailbox. I had my \nbrochure in my pocket in my campaign for Congress. Sure enough, we met \nat the mailbox. I pulled out my brochure and said: Sir, I am Max \nBaucus. I am running for Congress. Is there anything on your mind you \nwant to talk about? Anything that is really bothering you that you want \nto talk about?\n  He said: Oh, nothing except the perplexities of health.\n  It is certainly true for seniors, and he very much was a senior \ncitizen.\n  In summation, this is about choices. I think the choice is for \nMedicare, not against Medicare. The choice is also to help those senior \ncitizens pay for their medical benefits. I hope Senators choose for \nseniors.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seven minutes twenty-three seconds.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I will not use all that time.\n  First, I thank the manager of the bill, Senator Roth, for his \npatience and the support tonight in this debate. I thank all the \nSenators who have spoken on our side, to argue, once again, for the \nSocial Security lockbox. We have been doing this now for almost 3 \nmonths. I assure our colleagues will continue to do this as long as we \nhave to.\n  I suspect again tomorrow procedural impediments will be placed in the \nway of our efforts to try to protect the Social Security surplus, even \nas everyone in this place makes at least verbal assertions that they \nwant to protect that surplus.\n  But we will keep trying. Whether or not we have 60 votes tomorrow, we \nare going to continue this battle until it is won. Every single Member \nof the Senate, I think, hears from their constituents what this Senator \nhears when I am back in Michigan; an ongoing and ever increasing level \nof frustration that our seniors, as well as almost anybody who pays \nmoney into the Social Security fund, has with the notion that we spend \nthose dollars on anything other than Social Security.\n  We have tried to make this a simple issue from the very beginning. We \nhave tried various forms of this lockbox. We have offered different \ntypes of amendments to try to address concerns that have been raised. \nEach time, procedural roadblocks have been placed in our way. My \nunderstanding and expectation is that they will be placed in our way \nagain tomorrow. But the bottom line is that--and I agree with the \nSenator from Montana--that Republicans do want to cut taxes more than \nDemocrats. There is not much disagreement about that around here. That, \nI believe, reflects a clear distinction between us. And we Republicans \nwant to protect Social Security with a tough lockbox, the very lockbox \nthat has frequently been criticized tonight because it is so tough.\n  The question is, where is the beef? The answer is in our lockbox. It \nis so tough that in fact we have been criticized for making it too \ntough. That is where it is. It is in the teeth we have put in the \nlockbox.\n  We are going to try again tomorrow. We are going to try tomorrow to \npass this lockbox proposal in a form that will absolutely guarantee \nthat Social Security money sent to Washington by people who pay payroll \ntaxes is protected from any spending of any kind.\n  The budget that has been offered by the President is a budget that \nactually spends over one trillion new dollars of that surplus over the \nnext 10 years. We say those choices, as to how that surplus ought to be \nspent, should reside in the hands of the people who earned the money \nand paid the taxes and sent them to Washington. We say take all the \nSocial Security money, protect it in a tough lockbox, and then let's \nreturn 25 cents out of every surplus dollar to the men and women in our \ncountry who earned those dollars in the first place.\n  As I have tried to indicate tonight, we have endeavored, on six \nprevious occasions, to try to pass this lockbox. In each case \nprocedural impediments have been placed in our way to prevent it from \nhappening. We would just like to have a chance to have an up-or-down \nvote. If we have 50-plus votes, then we will have a Social Security \nlockbox. Hopefully we will get that chance.\n\n[[Page S9515]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I ask the Senator a very gentlemanly, civil question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The Senator from Michigan, the lead sponsor of this, has \nvery little time left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison). Does the Senator from \nMichigan yield?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask the Senator whether he would agree to the lockbox \nthe House passed?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Let me say this. We have offered that to the Senate to \nbe considered. One of the cloture votes which was offered was on the \nHouse lockbox when they passed it. And once again, on party lines, we \ncame to the well of the Senate and our effort to pass that bill was \nprevented.\n  All I am saying is we would like to have a final up-or-down vote on \nthis. That is what we are asking for.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, one more brief question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I am going take back my time actually, Madam President. \nI am the only person who has been on the floor tonight who has not \nspoken. The Senator from Montana had two opportunities to speak. I \nrefrained because we had so many speakers on our side. I would like to \nsummarize. I have a feeling the debate is not over on this topic and we \nwill have other opportunities.\n  I just want to say we brought up the House lockbox on the floor. It \nwas prevented from moving forward. We brought up the tougher version, \nthe Senate version we are offering tonight. We have not had a chance, \nbecause of procedural impediments, to vote on it. One proposal I hope \nmight be followed up on is a simple one. Tomorrow maybe neither side \nshould impose procedural impediments, and if one or the other version \nof this gets a majority of votes in the Senate, then let's move it \nforward. I suspect that will not happen. I am not going to ask anybody \nto answer that tonight. But tomorrow I may make a pitch and an appeal \nto our colleagues to let each side have their vote. If one or the other \nof these lockboxes gets 51 votes, let's move it forward. Let's give the \nAmerican people what they want. That is a lockbox to protect Social \nSecurity.\n  Madam President, to me that makes sense. To me it certainly is \nconsistent with what voters in our States want, what people who pay \npayroll taxes want. It is overdue.\n  This Senator will come back, if he has to, time after time, well into \nthe night if we have to, to make this case. But it is a simple one--are \nwe or are we not going to really protect the Social Security dollars, \nthat are sent to Washington, from being spent on anything other than \nSocial Security? I say we should. I think we should use a tough lockbox \nto make sure that happens. We have a chance tomorrow to vote on these \ntwo lockbox proposals. I say, if one of them gets 50 votes, that ought \nto be good enough, if it is true we all want a lockbox. If it is not \ntrue, then we will be back again as we have been over the last 3 \nmonths, endeavoring to find a way to finally get the American people \nthat which they want.\n  But, in closing, as we examine this issue, as we consider the next 10 \nyears, if we are really going to have, as current projections indicate, \nalmost $2 trillion in Social Security surpluses, and if we do not do \nsomething soon to protect this with a lockbox, those dollars are going \nto start to be spent. There will be great arguments made for cutting \ninto portions of it this year and the same will happen next year, as \nhas been happening for so many years already. This Senator is doing \neverything he can to try to make sure those efforts to take money out \nof the Social Security trust funds for other programs do not happen any \nlonger.\n  All this debate which has gone on for 3 months has done nothing more \nthan delay and keep open the possibility that Social Security money \nwould be spent on other things. I do not believe we should let that \nhappen. I think we should pass a lockbox tomorrow. If somebody gets 50 \nvotes for their proposal, then my recommendation is we should not use \nany procedural impediments to prevent that proposal from happening. The \nPresident says he wants it. Even the House has passed a version, not \nthe one we are offering, but they passed one nonetheless. So let's go \nforward. If somebody gets 50 percent let's move this issue out of the \nSenate and on towards final completion.\n  I gather my time is up, and I appreciate the debate that has happened \nthis evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and \nin so doing state to my colleagues the next amendment will be offered \nby the Senator from Florida.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask that \nwe consider it for debate at this time and that the vote occur on this \namendment at the time previously designated under the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Robb], for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, Mr. Rockefeller, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n     Bryan, proposes an amendment numbered 1401.\n\n  Mr. ROBB.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this particular \namendment with my long-time friend and colleague from Florida, Senator \nGraham, and others who join us. Both Senator Graham and I served as \nGovernors before coming to this body, and our views on fiscal matters \nare frequently very much in sync as they are on the amendment we offer \nthis evening. Having served as executive officers of our States, we \nshare a somewhat unique perspective, and it is from that particular \nunique perspective that we offer this amendment.\n  The amendment simply states that if it is the will of a majority of \nthe Members of this body to enact the tax cut before us, let's at least \naccept responsibility for strengthening Social Security and Medicare \nfirst. In short, let's get our priorities straight.\n  We all understand the allure of tax cuts. I do not know many \nAmericans who would not like to have a few extra dollars to spend on \nsomething, and I do not know many Americans who truly enjoy writing a \ncheck to the IRS. Most of us work hard to minimize legally what we have \nto pay to Uncle Sam to run our Government, and most of us can find \nareas where we would like to see Government spending cut or eliminated \naltogether. Sure, we like and, indeed, expect many of the services and \nprotections Government offers, but we do not like to have to pay for \nthem.\n  To enact a tax cut of this magnitude at this time when the economy is \nnot in need of an economic stimulus, when\n\n[[Page S9516]]\n\nwe have not fixed Social Security, when we have not fixed Medicare, \nwhen we backload all of the tough decisions future Congresses will have \nto make to pay for the cuts, when we frontload only the politically \npopular promise of more than we are actually delivering, when we know \nthat discretionary spending assumptions are unrealistic and \nunattainable, when we are already breaking the spending caps we have \npledged to adhere to in the Balanced Budget Act we passed just 2 years \nago, when we know defense spending is going to have to increase well \nbeyond the current baseline, when we know that correcting a course of \naction will be far more difficult than anything we are bent on doing \nwith this bill, Mr. President, I submit that to pass this bill at this \ntime without this amendment would be ludicrous. It would be fiscally \nirresponsible in the extreme. It would be as fiscally irresponsible as \nanything Congress has contemplated during the 11 years I have served in \nthis body, and we are doing it all in the face of a certain \nPresidential veto. Is it any wonder people lose faith in their \nGovernment?\n  Enacting massive tax cuts today before addressing the obligations we \nknow we have tomorrow is reckless. Those who propose this approach are, \nin effect, buying political benefits by using our children's credit \ncards. We curry favor today and leave the bill for others to pay. A \nsurplus is what is left over after we have met our obligations, and we \nwill not know what our obligations are until we reform Social Security \nand Medicare.\n  I am pleased to offer this amendment with my distinguished colleague \nfrom Florida and many others who are acting as cosponsors. I say in the \nspirit of the amendment that we all have enormous respect for the \nchairman of the committee and the bipartisan effort that has preceded \nthis particular point in the debate. But we are simply--I am simply \nunwilling--we are simply unwilling to accept the fact that we should \nmove forward with the tax cuts before the surplus upon which those tax \ncuts are premised has actually materialized.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from \nFlorida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the issue before us with this amendment is \nwhat is the proper order of consideration of the issues challenging our \nNation? In the Bible it talks about the fact that there is a season for \nall things. There is a season to plant; there is a season to harvest. \nThe question is, What is the season of America here in late July of \n1999?\n  The position Senator Robb and I and our cosponsors take is that the \nseason is not for a massive tax cut until we have planted and harvested \nthe seeds of a strengthened Social Security program and a strengthened \nMedicare program.\n  The bill that was reported by the Senate Finance Committee and its \ncompanion, which has already passed the House of Representatives, would \ncut taxes by approximately $800 billion over the next 10 years.\n  Some have claimed--and claimed on this floor earlier today --that a \ntax cut of $800 billion is the ideal way to usher in a new era of \nbudget surpluses and to maintain the economic growth and prosperity \nthrough which we are currently living. I could not disagree more.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues, the tax cut jeopardizes the \nlong-term solvency of two of the critical programs for millions of \nAmericans--Social Security and Medicare--programs for which there is a \nsolemn contract, a contract between the American Government and its \npeople, a contract which is now in question.\n  There are a series of rather straightforward questions that lie at \nthe heart of this debate: Do we live for today? Do we consume for \ntoday's satisfaction? Or do we plan, do we save, do we prepare for \ntomorrow? Do we support fiscal gluttony or fiscal discipline? The \nquestion our children might ask is, do we eat our dessert before or \nafter spinach?\n  The amendment Senator Robb offers delays the effective date of any \ntax cut until after legislation strengthening Social Security and \nMedicare has been enacted. This proposal, I suggest, is not dissimilar \nto the approach which has been proposed by the leadership in the House \nof Representatives. They have agreed that debt reduction, at least as \nmeasured by interest expense, should take priority over tax cuts. Under \nthe House proposal, tax cuts are not made if interest payments do not \ndecline.\n  Similarly, our amendment places the preservation of Social Security \nand Medicare as higher priorities than tax cuts. The amendment states \nthat before any tax cut proposal can be implemented, Congress must \npass, and the President must sign, legislation extending the solvency \nof Social Security three generations, or to the year 2075. The Congress \nmust also pass, and the President must also sign, legislation that \nmodernizes the Medicare program and extends the solvency of the \nhospitalization program within Medicare through the year 2027.\n  Unfortunately, the tax cut proposal on the Senate floor does not just \ndelay our efforts to preserve these important programs for future \ngenerations; it brings these efforts to a screeching halt. The $800 \nbillion tax cut in the plan before us represents over 80 percent of the \nprojected non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years.\n  I point to this chart, which indicates that through the combination \nof the tax breaks of $792 billion, and then the interest which we will \nhave to pay--rather than as our budget has been calculated, those $792 \nbillion would have been used to reduce the Federal debt--since that use \nwill now be diverted to tax cuts, that means we will be required to pay \nout an additional $100 billion in interest during the next 10 years. \nWith the combination of the lost interest savings associated with these \ntax cuts and the lost revenue from the tax cuts themselves, the surplus \ndisappears completely, leaving no resources to strengthen Social \nSecurity or modernize Medicare for our Nation's older citizens.\n\n  Although we cannot accurately predict how the economy will perform \nover the next 10 years, we do know that demographic changes taking \nplace in America will place a tremendous strain on Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  Our elderly population is growing quickly. Those seniors are living \nlonger than ever before. As a result, Social Security is projected to \nrun its first ever deficit in the year 2014.\n  It has been stated that all we have to do to save Social Security is \nto lock up the $1.9 trillion that will be derived by the Social \nSecurity surpluses in a lockbox, that we can wipe our hands of any \nfurther responsibility for the solvency of Social Security. As you well \nknow, the fact is that that will only extend the Social Security \nsolvency to approximately the year 2034. Yet our commitment is to \npreserve Social Security for three generations, not only to those who \nare the current beneficiaries, not only to those who will soon become \nbeneficiaries but to their children and their grandchildren. A three-\ngenerational solvency for Social Security cannot be achieved through \nthe singular step of investing all of the Social Security surplus into \nstrengthening the Social Security trust fund.\n  Even worse than the challenge faced by Social Security is the \nchallenge faced by Medicare. The twin pillars of security for older \nAmericans--financial security through Social Security, health security \nthrough Medicare.\n  The trustees of the Medicare fund have reported that Part A, the \nhospital payments, already exceed the program's revenue and will do so \nin each of the next 15 years.\n  In addition, not only does the program have a serious financial \nproblem, Medicare is an increasingly out-of-date program and one that \nfails to take advantage of the benefits of modern medical science. We \nhave a program which is from the model year 1965 when we desperately \nneed one worthy of the 21st century.\n  For example, we should increase the number of important preventive \nbenefits available to Medicare. We should provide for programs such as \nhypertension, programs like glaucoma, for smoking cessation, for the \nmanagement of hormones--all of which would extend the quality and the \nlength of life, all of which are within the current extents of modern \nmedicine. Yet the Medicare program does not provide those or many other \nof the important, proven preventative measures.\n\n[[Page S9517]]\n\n  We need to support that preventive effort by extending Medicare to \ninclude a prescription drug benefit, which is not only an important \npart of treating chronic diseases but a critical part of maintaining \nthe health of our older citizens.\n  Private health care plans long ago recognized that prescription drugs \nare a vital tool in efforts to save lives, improve health quality, and \nprevent and treat sickness and disease.\n  Medicare will not be relevant in the 21st century if it does not \ncover the treatments physicians use and patients require.\n  Yet the tax plan before us says nothing about preserving Social \nSecurity to the year 2075 or protecting and strengthening Medicare to \nthe year 2027. Instead, it blindly devotes virtually all of the non-\nSocial Security surplus to tax cuts without considering the larger \nbudget issues, issues which hang over us like the sword of Damocles.\n  Despite a record economy, the best fiscal situation since the late \n1960s, this tax bill passes on the hard choices, passes on the choices \nthat are going to be important to our children and our grandchildren.\n  The deficit may be gone, but we are still operating under the same \npass-the-buck-to-the-next-generation mentality that created it. Talk of \nan $800 billion tax cut versus a $500 billion tax cut versus a $250 \nbillion tax cut, all of those miss the fundamental point. The \nfundamental point is, Congress should not pass any tax cut until we \nhave strengthened Social Security by making it solvent for three \ngenerations. We should not pass any tax cut until we modernize Medicare \nby increasing the number of preventive benefits, incorporating a \nprescription drug benefit, and securing the program's fiscal health. \nThose should be our priorities.\n  When this amendment was introduced during last week's Finance \nCommittee markup, it was defeated on a strict party-line vote. It is my \nhope that bipartisanship, common sense, respect for future generations \nof Americans will prevent a similar outcome on the Senate floor this \nweek. But if it does not, I am very confident and, frankly, very proud \nthat President Clinton has stated he will veto any tax cut proposal \nthat does not put Social Security and Medicare first. He is in the \nfiscally responsible position, one that values wise preparation over \ninstant gratification.\n  Now is the time to extend the life of Medicare and Social Security. \nLater, if our fiscal situation permits, it might be time to enact tax \ncuts. But my first priority, shared by Senator Robb, is to my nine \ngrandchildren and the other children of their generation. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in making this the priority of Congress as \nwell.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Tennessee such \ntime as he may require.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Chair, and I thank Senator Roth.\n  It must seem strange to those watching this debate that people on \nboth sides who have the same interest come to such different \nconclusions about how to get where we both say we are trying to go.\n  There is no controversy with regard to the need to do something about \nMedicare and Social Security. We all know that. There is no controversy \nabout the need to do something not just for ourselves but the next \ngeneration and the next generation after that. I think that is why many \nof us came to the Congress and to the Senate. We wanted to give back a \nlittle bit. We wanted to look forward. We wanted to do some of those \ntough things that maybe we thought anybody couldn't do and we could \nmaybe come in for a little while and do that.\n  Yet here we are, with such diametrically different views as to what \nwill accomplish that. That is what makes good debates, and we have \nheard a fine presentation with regard to this amendment. But I think it \nis totally shortsighted and misguided.\n  In the first place, let's not forget what we are about. We are about \nthe question of whether or not we should have a tax cut with a \nprojected $3 trillion surplus. Some people are suspicious of these \nprojections. I am suspicious of most projections. We know it will not \nbe exactly right. We just don't know which direction or how much. But \nthis Congress gets together quite often and passes tax cuts. If a \nlittle farther down the road we have been proven to be incorrect with \nregard to our projection, it won't take us very long to come in here \nand raise additional revenues if they are needed. It happens all the \ntime, in my opinion, whether they are needed or not.\n\n  On the other hand, if we spend an additional trillion dollars, as the \nPresident suggests, that is gone. If we add on additional entitlements \nwithout the ability to pay for it when our entitlements are eating us \nalive in terms of squeezing out spending for everything else, we will \nnever reverse that process.\n  I fail to see the danger, the treacherous nature of a tax cut, \nbecause we can raise taxes anytime we want to. But right now on the \ntable we have a $3 trillion projected surplus. It is really very \nsimple. What do we do with that?\n  We say that actually less than 25 percent of it, a little over 23 \ncents on the dollar, should go back to the taxpayers. The rest of it \ngoes to debt reduction, Social Security, whatever we choose to spend \nwith regard to Medicare or any other items of preference on which we \nbelieve we need to spend money. And we can't tell that year to year.\n  Some people say we are cutting money from education and the \nenvironment and all that. It is not true. It is absolutely not true. We \ngot together as a Congress with the President a couple of years ago and \nagreed to abide by some caps. That was the deal. We are trying to stay \nwith that deal. After that deal runs out in 2002, we, as a Congress, \ncan spend the money however we want to.\n  My personal opinion is, we need to put some more money into some \nthings and we need to take some money out of things on which we are \nspending money. That is what Congress is all about. So this business \nthat we are going to be cutting this program and cutting that program \nwould lead someone watching us to believe that in our proposal we are \nslashing this and slashing that. That is what the President is going \naround and saying, and he is misleading people when he is doing that.\n  When we increase, we have certain constraints. There is no question \nabout that. I make no apologies for it. I think it is a good thing. It \nis what we agreed to do. Even past that, we should have certain \nconstraints. But within that framework, we have the ability to spend \nmore money on some things and less money on others. That is as far as \ndiscretionary spending is concerned.\n  Now, with regard to Medicare and Social Security, the proposal before \nus basically takes our natural sentiment to be very concerned about \nMedicare and Social Security, because they are in trouble, and says \nlet's hold everything off until we solve that problem. That sounds like \na good idea, if this proposal that is before us right now would solve \nthat problem. It would not. It would exacerbate the very problem we say \nwe are trying to solve.\n  This amendment would say we can't have any tax cuts until we pass \nlegislation that will make Medicare solvent to the year 2027 and make \nSocial Security solvent to the year 2075. What is magic about those \ndates? What about the year after 2027? We have been talking about what \nis going to happen in the year 2030. We are going to have twice as many \npeople over the age of 65 at 2030. Why would we want to make it solvent \nto the year 2027 when we are going to be right in the middle of crunch \ntime?\n  There is no magic to these dates. Where these dates come from is the \nPresident of the United States. These are President Clinton's dates. \nThese are the dates to which he says what he is doing will extend \nMedicare and Social Security. And they won't.\n  I think that most economists, most objective observers, the \nComptroller General, the CBO, and everyone else who has taken a look at \nit basically acknowledged that. But it is suggested that we wait before \nwe have any tax cuts until we agree on legislation that will solve \nthese problems by those dates. Can you imagine that process? Can you \nimagine our agreeing on what legislation in effect accomplishes that?\n\n[[Page S9518]]\n\n  I can tell my colleagues--and I think most observers I have read who \nhave a job in looking at these things would conclude--that the \nPresident's proposal does not do that. What the President basically \nproposes--and he is able to say this with a straight face because it is \nso complicated; it is difficult to understand--is saying, okay, we have \ntrouble with Medicare and Social Security. For the most part we have \ndedicated sources, FICA taxes, to take care of most of all that. But we \nhave trouble with that now. So instead of disciplining ourselves, let's \ngo to the general revenue, because we have some extra now, and instead \nof reforming Medicare and Social Security and doing those things that \nthe Medicare Commission tried to do, instead of doing those things that \nsome bipartisan Senators--the Senator from Virginia is on one bill that \nI am on--instead of doing those fundamental things to really solve \nMedicare and Social Security, let's just transfer some general revenues \nover into those items to serve as a temporary fix--in Medicare's case, \nuntil 2027.\n  I don't know what the idea is that we are supposed to do. I guess the \nidea is none of us will be around here to have to answer for it by \n2028. But let's look at it individually. Since this amendment is \npredicated upon the President's proposal, I can only assume that it \ntakes the position that the President's plan works and the President's \nplan will actually get us solvency by these dates.\n  But with regard to Social Security, I think both the majority leader \nand the Speaker of the House have reserved bill No. 1 on both sides for \nthe President's Social Security bill, where he can submit his \nlegislation that he says will effectuate his plan in order to save \nSocial Security. It hasn't come yet because I think most people realize \nit is not a serious plan. It is a transfer of trillions of dollars of \nIOUs in the Social Security trust fund, the creation of a new debt that \nwill constitute a burden on future taxpayers.\n  You talk about looking out for the future. This is not looking out \nfor the future; this is not looking out for our children and our \ngrandchildren, by transferring trillions of dollars in IOUs that will \nhave to be redeemed some day. Then the President, of course, doesn't \nmake these transfers until starting 2011 because that is outside the \npurview that we are looking at, and CBO and all these other \ncommentators. So nobody is really able to evaluate it very effectively. \nAnd then it takes the money he says will come from all of this and he \nhas the Government invest it. He has the U.S. Government invest it.\n  Chairman Greenspan says that is a terrible idea. When you get right \ndown to it, after all is said and done, there are only three ways to \nsolve this problem, in terms of Social Security: You have to increase \ntaxes, you have to cut benefits, or you have to come up with a way that \nwill produce more off the investments than are being made.\n  Now we have bipartisan legislation over here--the Senator from \nVirginia and I--on a bill that we think will do that. That is the only \nkind of thing that will do that. Transferring more general revenue \nfunds--as I put it earlier, putting more water into a leaky bucket, \nwhen the hole in the bottom of the bucket is getting bigger every day--\nwill only carry us so far, they think until 2027 on Medicare and 2075 \non Social Security. It might. It might get us that far if we put enough \ngeneral revenue funds in while we have a surplus. I assume it very well \nmight get us to 2027.\n  So what. Don't we have an obligation past that? Don't we have an \nobligation to do something more fundamental? It doesn't take a genius \nto say you have some extra money, let's just pour it on top of a broken \nsystem, or, as one of our Members likes to say, putting more gasoline \ninto an old run down, beat up, decrepit automobile doesn't change the \nnature of that automobile.\n  So the President's plan with regard to so-called saving Social \nSecurity is not a serious proposal. The President's own budget--the \ndocument that he submits, the ``Analytical Perspectives of the Budget \nof the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2000''--says that:\n\n       Under the proposals in the President's budget, the trust \n     funds balances are estimated to increase by approximately 70 \n     percent by the year 2004, raising to $2.8 trillion.\n\n  That is the part of the plan the President says will take Social \nSecurity out and keep it solvent until the year 2075. But the \nPresident's own folks continue:\n\n       These balances are available to finance future benefit \n     payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a \n     bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be pension \n     funds, as are the funds of private pension plans. They do not \n     consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the \n     future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the \n     Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by \n     raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing \n     benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust \n     fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any \n     impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.\n\n  It is a shell game. His own folks, in this thick document, basically \ntell it like it is. When you hear him talk about it, of course, it is a \nlittle bit different. It makes you believe it is real money and you are \nsetting something aside, and so forth. It is not. The only way we can \nreform this problem, and the only way we are going to get our arms \naround it, is to increase FICA taxes. We don't want to do that. The \nworking man is overburdened as it is today. Cut benefits. We don't want \nto do that, or come up with a system that is going to produce more \nrevenue than the investment that our Social Security system has today, \nwhich is virtually nil. We can put a little part of it in the stock \nmarket, and even if the market crashed, unless we had unprecedented \ndecades of low market, it would produce much more than what the Social \nSecurity system is producing today. Those are the only things we can \ndo. I do not believe these other things are serious in the effect they \nwould have.\n  Of course, again--and I mentioned it several times today--we are \ndependent upon the President's support, I guess, to pass a bill that \nwill do these things when, on the other hand, he is doing everything he \ncan to prevent reform. We had a bipartisan Medicare commission. We have \nthese bipartisan bills. As far as the commission is concerned, the \nPresident did everything he could to defeat the recommendations there. \nDemocrats and Republicans--and Senator Breaux chaired that commission, \na Democrat--worked together and came up with solutions. The President \nwould not support it. He would rather have a temporary political issue \nthan a long-term solution to this problem. That is very disappointing. \nMany of us who were critical of the President some time ago thought \nthat in his last couple of years in office he might want to step \nforward and do this and leave that kind of legacy. He could have done \nthat. It is a wasted opportunity, and I regret that.\n  So that is the Social Security plan, one that doesn't consist of real \neconomic assets and will have to be financed by raising taxes borrowed \nfrom the public or reducing benefits.\n  What about Medicare? As I understand it, the President's proposal \nthere basically transfers $327 billion from the general revenue. CBO \ntakes a look at it and says it will make Medicare more solvent for \nseveral more years. It doesn't have a number on it. But this is what \nthe professionals who look at this say about that. This is what CBO \nsays about the President's Medicare financing. Again, is this the \nsolution to the Medicare problems we have? Is this the reason why we \ncan't have tax cuts because this is what we need to do? I don't think \nso. Listen:\n\n       The President is proposing to augment Medicare's financing \n     by making transfers from the general fund of the U.S. \n     Treasury to the program's trust funds.\n\n  That sounds familiar--Social Security and Medicare.\n\n       Consistent with the policy outlined in the President's \n     budget for fiscal year 2000, CBO estimates that $288 billion \n     would be transferred from the general fund to the Hospital \n     Insurance trust funds over the next decade. That transfer \n     would delay by several years the projected date on which the \n     HI [Hospital Insurance] trust fund will become insolvent by \n     committing future general revenues to the program. It would \n     do nothing to address the underlying rapid growth in spending \n     for Medicare that will eventually outrun the revenues \n     dedicated to the program.\n\n  Just on borrowed time, headed toward a cliff.\n  This plan does nothing to fundamentally alter that.\n  The Comptroller General, talking about the President's proposal--\nagain, this amendment is based upon the numbers, as I understand it--if \nI am\n\n[[Page S9519]]\n\nwrong about that, I can be corrected. But they are the same numbers \nthat the President has been using throughout his plan. The Comptroller \nGeneral says:\n\n       I feel that the greatest risk lies in extending the HI \n     trust fund solvency while doing nothing to improve the \n     program's long-term sustainability, or worse, in opting for \n     changes that may aggravate the long-term financial outlook \n     for the program.\n\n  What he is talking about is something that might not only not do any \ngood in terms of a fundamental sense but will aggravate the problem. If \nwe deceive ourselves into believing that by using general revenue \nmoneys we are really doing something to solve the Social Security/\nMedicare problem, it will put off real reform and wind up hurting \nSocial Security and Medicare. It encourages us to wait. We can't afford \nto wait for fundamental reform.\n  We have in excess of $500 billion in our proposal that can be spent \nfor transition costs, Medicare, any other discretionary spending \nproposals that we as a Congress decide to spend it on. That is general \nrevenue money, too. There is no question about that.\n  But, fundamentally, both sides have to come together on an agreement \nthat this is not the sort of thing that is going to solve that problem. \nIt has nothing to do with tax cuts. If we don't fundamentally solve the \nSocial Security problem, a tax cut is going to be irrelevant. If we \ndon't fund it, they are going to be irrelevant to that. It has nothing \nto do with that basic problem. By keeping the economy strong, cutting \ntaxes for working people, letting them keep a little bit more of their \nown money, it doesn't directly benefit these programs but it helps the \npeople whom these programs ultimately are designed to benefit.\n  In conclusion, basically we have no legislation before us and no \nproposal that would effectuate this amendment in terms of what kind of \nlegislation are we talking about to reach these magic dates.\n  Second, the President's position, which I think these dates are based \nupon, is a flawed one for the reason that we have set out.\n  Lastly, not only is this not reform, but it goes against reform. So, \nindeed, we come full circle.\n  I agree with my colleagues that my heart is in the same place as \ntheirs. I want to figure out a way for us to come together and really \ndo something about Medicare and Social Security. I want to find a way \nto do something about not just ourselves up to 2027, or however long \nsome of us might still be around here--not myself, but the next \ngeneration and the generation after that.\n  Let's look seriously and see whether or not this is the sort of thing \nthat is going to get us there, or whether buckling down and doing the \nhard work, the hard, politically risky work--because if you use the \nwords, you are running some kind of political risk--and not be diverted \nwith false reasons as to why we shouldn't have a tax cut.\n  We have had more reasons in one day than you can shake a stick at as \nto why the world would come to an end if we had a tax cut. There is no \ngood time for a tax cut for some people because a tax cut has more to \ndo with than just dollars and cents; it has to do with the exercise of \nwho is going to make decisions in this society. Money is power. Where \nthe money lies is where the power lies. Is it going to be in the \npockets of the American people, or is it going to be in our pockets?\n  Some say we have been a little bit too reticent ourselves because we \nsay of the surplus dollar that only 25 percent or less should go into \nthe American people's pockets. But to call that dangerous, to call that \ngluttonous, to call that selfish greatly exceeds the mark.\n  I urge the defeat of the amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee for his comments. I think he is absolutely \ncorrect in that there is much that we agree upon. I would like to \ncommend him for his effort to reach the bipartisan consensus that is \ngoing to be required if we are going to solve either challenge that we \nare discussing this evening.\n  Social Security will not be saved without a bipartisan effort, and it \nis going to require the hard, politically risky work that the Senator \nfrom Tennessee just alluded to. The same thing is true with saving \nMedicare. Those are not easy decisions. That is one of the principal \nreasons that we are suggesting we ought to address those tough \nquestions first.\n  Let me suggest I understand in terms of the remarks made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee that taking on something that is \nnot on the table is effective. But we are not really defending all of \nthe President's plan in this particular instance. We are using a couple \nof numbers that happen to coincide with the President's. But ours is \nmuch simpler and much more specific. We are talking about simply \npostponing this tax cut.\n  The Senator from Tennessee made the point that it might be difficult \nto actually achieve whatever is necessary for some actuary to come to \nthe conclusion that we had in effect saved Social Security or that we \nhad saved Medicare. I would not contest that assertion by the Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  But we are not saying you can never have a tax cut. We are saying \nonly that we will not have this tax cut, this tax cut that we believe \nat this time is excessive. It may be that a time will come when tax \ncuts, particularly targeted tax cuts, are appropriate. I suggest to my \nfriend from Tennessee that while the time may be difficult to envision \nin terms of major tax cuts, it seems to me a time that does not cry out \nfor tax cuts is a time when the economy is not in need of the economic \nstimulus that would come with a tax cut.\n  The one thing that the Fed seems to suggest to us is that a tax cut \ncould overheat the economy and would have consequences that we are \ntrying to avoid at this particular time. But the bottom line is this: \nWe are not suggesting anything but, hold up. We are saying in effect, \nWhat is the hurry? There is no compelling urgency to cut taxes, \nparticularly when we are talking about a tax cut of this magnitude that \ncan be addressed next year, or the year after, or whenever we find that \nwe can afford to make that kind of a tax cut after meeting our \nobligations, such as protecting Social Security and Medicare.\n  That is all we are saying. We are only suggesting that, because of \nthe magnitude of this particular bill, we ought to suspend this \nparticular tax cut until we have achieved those objectives. I suggest \nthat is a relatively modest restraint on our activities, but it is a \nfiscally responsible approach to take.\n  I have to tell the distinguished Senator from Tennessee that there \nare many on this side of the aisle at least who are not all that \nenamored with some of the suggestions that our brethren have made with \nrespect to tax cuts at this time, and indeed we voted for the \nDemocratic alternative only because it would substitute for the bill \nthat is on the floor today.\n  But we are not against tax cuts altogether for all time. Indeed, \nthere are some areas where we should provide cuts--the extending, for \ninstance, of the R tax credits and others that we know we are going \nto do anyhow--it is something that would provide a sense of realism and \nwould allow some certainty in terms of planning for those companies \nthat are doing the cutting edge work, that make our economy strong, and \nthat make us a leader in the global economy.\n  But we are just saying this tax cut is so big and so difficult to \njustify that we ought to at least hold up until we have, again to quote \nthe distinguished Senator, ``done the hard, politically risky work'' to \nprotect Social Security and Medicare.\n  Again, I commend the Senator because he is willing to engage. He is \nwilling to roll up his sleeves and engage on a bipartisan basis in \ntrying to make those tough decisions. I wish we could find more on both \nsides of the aisle who were willing to roll up their sleeves and work \non these decisions.\n\n  The distinguished Senator from Florida and I are saying, let's simply \nnot make this tax cut effective until we have solved those problems \nfacing both Medicare and Social Security. I agree with the Senator from \nTennessee, we are not solving these problems just by saving some of the \nsurplus generated by Social Security. That does not bring about the \nsystematic change we are going to need to have if we are going to\n\n[[Page S9520]]\n\nsolve the long-term solvency question with respect to Social Security. \nWe are not doing that at this point with respect to Medicare. To that \nextent, I agree with the Senator.\n  We have the tougher decisions to make. We are saying let's not take \nadvantage of a projected future surplus since that would, indeed, make \nall of the other decisions more difficult.\n  Another point where I differ with the Senator from Tennessee, he says \nit is always easy to come back and, in effect, reverse the decisions; \nif we cut taxes too deeply, we can turn around and raise taxes. With \nall due deference and respect, raising taxes is not easy to do. There \nare very few in this body on either side of the aisle who like to be \ntagged with either authoring or voting for a tax increase. That is the \nproblem with tax cuts of this magnitude, particularly when they would \nbe so difficult to reverse, and we splurge without making the tough \ndecisions first. In the meantime the current surplus can be used for \nconstructive, long-term debt reduction.\n  Lastly, I have been concerned about the focus on publicly held debt \nas opposed to the total debt. We used to be very much concerned about \nthe total debt. I have told my friends from the White House and others \nwho have focused on this, I think what we are doing to reduce the \npublic debt is a good thing. However, the plan promises too much. We \nare really not reducing the total obligation we have simply by making \nthe IOU a statutory obligation instead of having it part of the \npublicly held dealt. Reducing the publicly held debt does good things. \nIt makes our financial future better. It means we don't have to go out \nand borrow on the markets. However, the same obligations we have with \nrespect to Social Security now, with respect to Medicare now, are still \nthere. We are simply transferring them to a different form so our \nfinancial picture looks a little better.\n  I suggest again this is a limited amendment. It is simply saying, \nwhat is the hurry with respect to huge tax cuts that may or may not \nmaterialize? Let's do the responsible thing. Let's do that hard, \npolitically risky work of extending Social Security and Medicare \nsolvency first. Then we can address the question of whether or not we \nprovide additional tax cuts and what form and what magnitude they might \ntake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in 1983 Alan Greenspan chaired a \ncommission to study the state of Social Security. He began the \ndeliberations of that commission with this admonition: Every member of \nthe commission is entitled to their opinion. No member of the \ncommission is entitled to their facts. We are going to work off a \ncommon base of facts and then from that common base arrive at an \ninformed set of judgments.\n  What are some of the facts that drive this amendment? One, there is a \ntidal wave of Americans who will reach 65 and become beneficiaries \nunder the Medicare program and the Social Security program beginning in \nthe year 2010. That generation, the generation born immediately after \nWorld War II, will more than double the number of current beneficiaries \nin Social Security and Medicare. That is a fact.\n  Second, it is a fact that under the current financing in the year \n2014, 4 years after that tidal wave begins to hit, Social Security will \ngo negative. That is, it will begin to pay out more benefits than it \nwill take in annually in revenues.\n  Third, it is a fact that even if we do as is suggested, put all of \nthe Social Security surplus into strengthening the Social Security \nsystem primarily by paying down the national debt, even that step will \nonly extend the solvency of Social Security to the year 2034. That \nhappens to be a significant date for me because my youngest daughter \nwill become 65 in the year 2034. I hope she might not necessarily be \nlistening to my remarks, she would not be happy for me to remind her of \nthat.\n  Fourth, it is a fact that Medicare is a program of the 1960s based on \n1960s knowledge of medical science, 1960s concepts of how to provide \ninsurance for health care. With a few exceptions, it is still a 1965 \nprogram. It is a program in which the trust funded portions--that is, \nthose that relate to hospital services--is already in a negative \nposition. It is a program which will crack under the weight of the \nbeneficiaries who will begin drawing its services in the year 2010.\n  Finally, it is a fact that the longer we delay dealing with Social \nSecurity and Medicare, the more difficult the problem becomes. We may \nthink we have eased our burden by delaying these hard decisions. We may \nhave eased our burden because we may not be here. But the sooner we act \nfor the benefit of all Americans, particularly those Americans who \nproperly are anticipating the contract they have with their Government \nfor the financial security of Social Security and the health security \nrepresented by Medicare, their problems, their challenges, grow daily \nmore severe as we delay dealing with these fundamental issues.\n  I want to join my colleague, Senator Robb, in saying much of what the \nSenator from Tennessee said was compelling. However, he asked a \nquestion: Why is there a relationship between Social Security solvency, \nMedicare and its strengthening and solvency, and the tax cut? These are \nunrelated, disparate policy issues.\n  I beg to say I could not disagree more. There are two ways in which \nthese issues are inextricably intertwined. One is fiscal. This chart \nindicates with the tax cut of $792 billion and the foregone interest \nsavings of $141, the total cost to the treasury over the next 10 years \nof the plan before the Senate is $933 billion. If someone wishes to \nchallenge those numbers, I stand silent and yield for them to do so.\n  I assume, thus, that we agree those are the right numbers.\n  With a total surplus from non-Social Security purposes--and we have \nalready agreed we will put all the Social Security surplus into saving \nSocial Security--that is $964 billion over 10 years, meaning the total \namount that is left will be $32 billion over 10 years, or a little over \n$3 billion a year in order to do everything else that we may find needs \nto be done.\n  The fact is, once we have committed ourselves to this plan, there are \nno fiscal resources to either further strengthen Social Security to \nmove beyond the year 2034, or to strengthen Medicare. So there is a \nfiscal relationship.\n  But beyond the fiscal Siamese twins of these issues, Social Security \nand Medicare, and this tax cut, is a political reality. There is \nnothing easier in politics, there is nothing that is less likely to get \nyou a chapter in ``Profiles In Courage,'' than cutting taxes. Everybody \nlikes to cut taxes. That is the classic case of eating your political \ndesert. The question is, Do you eat your desert before you have had to \nfirst eat your vegetables? That is what we are being asked to do by \npassing this tax cut before we have dealt with the vegetables of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  One of the most responsible groups is a group which is now led by two \nof our colleagues, former Republican Senator from New Hampshire, Warren \nRudman, and Democratic Senator from Georgia, Sam Nunn, the Concord \nCoalition. The Concord Coalition was one of the driving forces that has \ngiven us the opportunity to have this debate tonight about surpluses \nbecause they helped focus national attention on the rot we were \nsuffering year after year because of the deficits and the mounting \nnational debt.\n  What does the Concord Coalition advise us about the issue we face \ntonight? Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord immediately after my remarks, a statement released today, July \n28, 1999, by the Concord Coalition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. This is the statement of the Concord Coalition. In \nconclusion it provides:\n\n       The bottom line is that, at the moment, political leaders \n     have no idea how to meet the long-term spending promises that \n     have been made for Social Security and Medicare, and no idea \n     how to meet the tough discretionary spending caps on which \n     the baseline surplus is premised. Major tax cuts should await \n     the resolution of these issues. If the politically hard \n     choices are not made before the easy ones, there is a very \n     real danger that we'll end up spending a surplus we don't \n     really have.\n\n  Let me repeat:\n\n       If the politically hard choices are not made before the \n     easy ones, there is a very real danger that we'll end up \n     spending a surplus we don't really have.\n\n\n[[Page S9521]]\n\n\n  So those are why the issues of sequencing--what do we do first, where \ndo we put our primary priorities--are central for the fiscal future of \nthis country and the debate we have this week. I will briefly say why I \nthink the proper order is Social Security and Medicare first.\n  First, the Social Security taxpayers and the Medicare taxpayers, \nthrough their payroll taxes, have created the totality of the surplus \nwe have today. There is no other surplus than the Social Security \nsurplus today, and there will only be a meager surplus beyond Social \nSecurity for the foreseeable future. So should not the people who \ncreated the surplus have some moral standing to be at the front of the \nline, not the back of the line, when we decide how to spend the \nsurplus?\n  Second, a substantial amount of the non-Social Security surplus is \ngoing to be the result of the Social Security surplus being invested in \npaying down the debt held by the public and therefore relieving the \nNational Government of enormous interest payments--that $2 trillion of \nSocial Security surplus when it is fully committed to reducing the debt \nheld by the public. Let us say the average interest on the debt of the \nFederal Government today is 6 percent. Mr. President, as a certified \npublic accountant, what kind of interest savings do you get at 6 \npercent on $2 trillion? A very substantial amount of money. And that is \na significant part of the non-Social Security surplus. Don't the people \nwho are creating those interest savings deserve to be at the front of \nthe line, not at the back of the line?\n\n  Third, we do have a solemn contract between the American Government \nand its people on these programs. If we think we should not have that \ncontract, then I think someone should stand up and be candid and honest \nand say: Let's repeal the 1935 Social Security Act, let's repeal the \n1965 Medicare Act, so there will not be any false expectations. We are \ngoing to abrogate these contracts.\n  I do not believe there is any Member of this Senate or the House of \nRepresentatives who would do so. Therefore, I believe we, as the \ntrustees for the American people in these important programs, have an \nobligation to see that they can fulfill their expectations.\n  Finally, we are not suggesting, with the amendment that Senator Robb \nand I have offered, what the resolution of this issue should be. There \nare probably a dozen or more good ideas in this Chamber as to how we \nshould strengthen Social Security, how we should strengthen Medicare. \nWhat we are saying is there should be a performance standard. The \nperformance standard, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, my good \nfriend, is not one we stole from somebody else. We have been saying for \nmany years that Social Security should be solvent for three \ngenerations.\n  When you apply that three-generational test to 1999, it happens to \ncome out to the year 2075. If somebody has a different standard they \nbelieve Social Security solvency should be judged by, let them come \nforward and make the case. But I believe we should guarantee this \nprogram for current beneficiaries, their children--like my child who, \nin the year 2034, will start drawing her Social Security benefits and \nbecome eligible for Medicare. I am pleased to say that same daughter is \nnow about to make us grandparents, Adele and myself. This will be our \n10th grandchild. In November she will have a baby. So we are concerned \nabout the new baby who will soon come into our family. I believe that \nis a concern all of us share who are or hope soon to be grandparents. \nSo I believe in the three-generational standard, which has been the \nstandard against which Medicare solvency has been historically judged, \nis a sound one and represents the intergenerational contract.\n  We are not suggesting how that contract should be fulfilled because \nthere are many ways. But we are saying that is the standard against \nwhich all proposals should be judged. Similarly, with Medicare--that is \na more difficult proposition because Medicare, unlike Social Security, \nis not totally funded out of a trust fund but rather a mixture of a \ntrust fund for hospitalization and general revenue, plus premiums by \nthe beneficiaries for the physicians' portion of Medicare. We are \nsaying that, for the hospitalization plan, we should set as a standard \nthe year 2027 for solvency of that trust fund.\n  Again, if someone wishes to argue for a different standard, that is \ncertainly their prerogative. But we need to have a measurement. We need \nto have something like an external audit, some standard to which we can \nsubmit our proposals and have them evaluated as to whether they meet \nthe test of the American people.\n\n  So what we are saying is let's maintain our options. Let us not place \nourselves in a position where we are unable to achieve those standards \nof solvency for Social Security and Medicare. Once we have done that, \nwe can declare hallelujah, and then we can proceed, if there are funds \nleft after we have accomplished those purposes, to tax cuts or whatever \nelse the Congress and the American people believe to be their \npriorities. But these are the first two priorities. There is both a \nmoral and a legal obligation, and maybe most important, an obligation \nto our future, as seen in the faces of our children and grandchildren. \nIt is to them that this amendment is directed.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the simple principle: Let's do first \nthings first, and Social Security and Medicare solvency are the first \ntwo responsibilities of this Congress. I thank the Chair.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Concord Coalition, July 28, 1999]\n\n             Tax Cuts Should Await Hard Choices on Spending\n\n       Washington.--With the House and Senate headed toward \n     passage of a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut, The Concord \n     Coalition today challenged Congress and the President to make \n     the hard choices on discretionary and entitlement spending \n     before enacting a major tax cut.\n       ``Cutting taxes in anticipation of spending cuts that have \n     not been made, and may never be made, is a recipe for the \n     return of chronic annual budget deficits,'' said Policy \n     Director Robert Bixby. The Concord Coalition pointed out that \n     Congress and the President have yet to agree on several key \n     spending issues, including:\n       Discretionary caps--The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     baseline assumes that the discretionary spending caps will be \n     complied with through 2002. It is increasingly clear, \n     however, that this goal will not be met. Spending will exceed \n     the caps either explicitly or by stealth through the \n     emergency loophole. The projected baseline surplus varies by \n     hundreds of billions of dollars depending upon the path of \n     discretionary spending. Tax cuts should therefore await a \n     more realistic assessment of the non-Social Security surplus, \n     which will be available only after the dust settles on the \n     appropriations bills.\n       Medicare prescription drug benefit--Congressional leaders \n     and the President seem to agree that a prescription drug \n     benefit should be added to Medicare. According to CBO, the \n     President's plan would cost $111 billion over ten years. \n     Republican leaders have suggested a less expensive approach, \n     but the question remains--how much will the new benefit cost?\n       Social Security reform--The CBO baseline assumes that the \n     entire surplus will be used for debt reduction. But what \n     about Social Security reform? Many responsible reform plans \n     would use at least the Social Security portion of the surplus \n     as the down payment on a funded system of individually owned \n     Social Security accounts. If combined with appropriate long-\n     term cost savings in the rest of the program, such a reform \n     plan would do more to improve the outlook for future \n     generations than a strategy of debt reduction alone. Enacting \n     a major tax cut now, however, could drain away resources that \n     may well be needed for the costs of transitioning to a more \n     sustainable, generationally equitable Social Security system.\n       ``The bottom line is that, at the moment, political leaders \n     have no idea how to meet the long-term spending promises that \n     have been made for Social Security and Medicare, and no idea \n     how to meet the tough discretionary spending caps on which \n     the baseline surplus is premised. Major tax cuts should await \n     the resolution of these issues. If the politically hard \n     choices are not made before the easy ones, there is a very \n     real danger that we'll end up spending a surplus we don't \n     really have,'' Bixby said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, my good friend and colleague, the Senator from \nVirginia, raised the question as to why a tax cut now, what is the \nhurry; the economy is doing well. Let me tell you why I think it is \ncritically important we have a tax cut now. That is because the \nAmerican family needs it.\n  In going home and talking to my constituents, talking to many \nfamilies, whether they are farmers or small businessmen, or whomever, \nthey are finding it hard to face the challenges of today. The cost of \nsending a child to college is increasing very rapidly and is taxing the \ntypical American family.\n\n[[Page S9522]]\n\n We provide relief in this package for the American family who is \ntrying to send their children to college. They are trying to send their \nchildren to college today, not 5 or 10 years hence. That is the reason \nit is important.\n  I point out there is something like 42 million families without \nhealth insurance. There is no hurry to try to address that, as we do in \nthis legislation? We provide that someone who is self-employed or an \nemployee who works for a company that has no health insurance can take \na tax deduction for their insurance. That is helping to provide access \ntoday. None of us know whether we will be sick today, tomorrow, or in a \nweek. There is a need for that today, not 5, 10 years from now.\n  What about savings? We all agree as to the critical importance of the \ntwo domestic programs--Social Security and Medicare. But to retire \ntoday, it is important people have savings, and that is the reason we \nhave stressed so much the importance of pensions, the importance of \nIRAs, because if people are going to retire with dignity, they must \nhave the opportunity to save not tomorrow, not 5 years from now, but \ntoday.\n  Marriage penalty: How many of my colleagues have gone home and talked \nto people about that? There is concern that taxwise it pays not to \nmarry but to live in so-called sin. We take care of the marriage \npenalty. It is long overdue. Why wait? I think there is good reason, if \nwe are going to help the American family, let's help the American \nfamily today, not sometime in the distant future.\n  It intrigues me. People say delay the tax cut, it is not important. \nBut what about spending? My good friend from Wyoming raised that point, \nand it is a solid one. If we are going to delay tax cuts, why shouldn't \nwe say there can be no increased spending until we solve these two \ndomestic programs? If it is fair for one, why isn't it fair for the \nother?\n  Then the point was made this tax cut is inflationary. That is hard to \nunderstand. In the year 2000, we are talking about a $4 billion tax \ncut. That is not very large when you stop and think that our GDP is $9 \ntrillion. It is not very likely our tax cut in the next year or two is \ngoing to have a very significant effect on the economy. The larger cuts \ncome down the road in the last 5 years. Sure, we may not like to vote \nfor tax increases, but we have all done it in the past, and we will do \nit again if it is necessary, but this tax cut is very slow in \ndeveloping into a major reduction for the American people.\n  I oppose the legislation for those reasons. I am a strong believer \nthat we can have the tax cut, address the problems of Medicare, as well \nas Social Security. As I said, the new CBO estimate of the on-budget \nsurplus over the next 10 years is $996 billion, while my bill returns \nmost of this overpayment of taxes back to those who sent it to \nWashington, while at the same time it leaves enough money on the table \nfor Social Security reform, $1.9 trillion, and Medicare reform, $505 \nbillion.\n  As I said in the Finance Committee, I am committed to moving a \nMedicare bill through the committee after we return in September. It is \nmy hope that comprehensive Medicare reform can be achieved, including \nproviding for a prescription drug benefit, but it must be on a \nbipartisan basis and it must be done with White House cooperation.\n  The chairman's mark complies with the budget resolution to this \ncommittee by reducing on-budget revenues by $792 billion over 10 years. \nThis amount will allow up to $505 billion of the on-budget surplus to \nbe dedicated to Medicare reform. The President's plan costs $118 \nbillion over 10 years. Clearly, the $505 billion left on the table is \nmore than sufficient to reform Medicare with a prescription drug \nbenefit.\n  The Committee on Finance has held numerous hearings on Social \nSecurity over the past few years. Many of the members of the committee \nhave offered comprehensive Social Security reform plans that, I have to \nsay, are quite compelling. I do intend to return to Social Security \nafter this recess and the Senate works its way through Medicare reform.\n  I oppose this amendment, and I firmly believe we can address all \nthree--a tax cut, Medicare reform, and strengthen Social Security. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I want to respond \nbriefly, if I can, to our distinguished chairman and friend from \nDelaware with respect to the question of timing.\n  The distinguished Senator from Delaware mentioned the fact that the \ntax cut this year is only $4 billion out of some $792 billion that is \nproposed in the bill. That is about one-half of 1 percent of the total \npromise that would be incorporated in statutory law if, for any reason, \nwe are wrong. That is what we would have to find a way to change, \nagainst all of the forces that are normally arrayed against any tax \nincrease.\n\n  Why squander the opportunity to pay down or to begin to pay down the \nnational debt--not just the publicly held debt, the national debt, the \nnational unified debt? This is the first time in well over a generation \nthere has been any opportunity to pay down the debt.\n  We are not proposing additional spending. I have not checked with my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida for certain, but if the \ndistinguished chairman of the committee were willing to accept an \namendment that would suggest some similar restraint on spending which \nwould correspond to the restraint we are attempting to place on cutting \ntaxes, I will suggest to the chairman of the committee, I think we \ncould find a place to make a deal.\n  We are not suggesting profligate spending. We are suggesting that we \nput that money in the bank, that we pay down the national debt.\n  Again, in terms of urgency, one-half of 1 percent is what we would do \nright now. But the other 99.5 percent would be locked into the law that \nwe would be obligated, by law, to change at the appropriate time. That \nis the reason we are suggesting that we do not want to rush to judgment \nwith respect to what many of us believe would simply not be a \nresponsible tax cut of this magnitude at this time.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nTennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. If the chairman will cede me a couple other minutes, \njust a couple of points.\n  I have enjoyed this discussion very much. It is a serious discussion \nabout a serious problem. My only real disappointment is to learn that \nthe Senator from Florida has twice as many grandchildren as I have. But \nall we ask is for an opportunity to catch up.\n  But I think there are a lot of things we do agree on. We agree that \nthere is a crisis. We agree that we need fundamental reform in Medicare \nand Social Security. We agree that the longer we delay in doing that, \nthe worse the problem is going to be.\n  So the question is, Are we doing the right thing by temporarily \npapering over the problem to extend it a few years, knowing that is not \ngoing to fundamentally solve the problem, giving us an excuse not to \nreally address the fundamental problem or should we push and pressure \nourselves to go ahead and address the fundamental problem? That is \nreally the issue here today. I think that is where we have a \ndisagreement.\n  When I said that there is no relationship between this Medicare/\nSocial Security problem on the one hand and tax cuts on the other, I \ndid not mean to say if you keep more of the tax money and pour more of \nit into Medicare and Social Security, you could not delay it a little \nlonger. That is certainly true, but fundamentally there is no \nrelationship.\n  The reason I said that was because of what the Comptroller of the \nUnited States said. In his testimony in July before the Finance \nCommittee, he said:\n\n       Even if all future surpluses were saved--\n\n  Taking every penny of the surplus, not one dime of tax cuts--\n\n     we would nonetheless be saddled with a budget over the longer \n     term that the current tax rates could fund little else but \n     entitlement programs for the elderly population. Reforms \n     reducing the future growth of Medicare, as well as Social \n     Security and Medicaid, are vital under any fiscal and \n     economic scenario to restoring fiscal flexibility for future \n     generations of taxpayers.\n\n  That is the reason I say that even if we put all this aside --we are \nthrowing a lot of numbers around here--take all of it, pour it into \nMedicare and Social\n\n[[Page S9523]]\n\nSecurity, so we can tell people we saved it for a few more years, it \nreally would not address the fundamental problems.\n  Is it incumbent on us to have a temporary solution or to force \nourselves to have a longer-term solution? I think it is the latter. \nThat is kind of what it boils down to.\n  My friends talk about the size of this tax cut. The economy is \nprojected to be $9 trillion next year. The net tax cuts next year alone \nare $4 billion, so the tax cuts are less than one-twentieth of 1 \npercent of the economy next year--less than one-twentieth of 1 percent.\n  I am told that the tax cuts over the 10-year period would be 3.4 \npercent of total Federal revenues, and it would be under 1 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. So that is not a huge tax cut if you look \nat it under those terms, in terms of the share of the economy, \nespecially in light of the fact that taxes, especially Federal taxes--\nespecially Federal income taxes--are mushrooming as a share of our \ntotal economy. It is eating up more and more and more as a share of our \ntotal economy.\n  We may have good times now, but that is not guaranteed. We are in a \nworld standing as an island, as it were, at the present time while \nthose all around us have problems. Our friends in Asia, our friends in \nJapan, some of our friends in Europe, some in South America, all have \neconomic problems. So we have to be mindful of that as we go along.\n  Quite frankly, there are some who say, when we have a deficit, \ncertainly we can't afford to cut taxes; we have a deficit. And \nlistening to the debate today, apparently some of our same friends, \nwhen we have a surplus, say we can't cut taxes because we really don't \nknow whether or not we will have the surplus. So that does not leave us \nmuch room for a tax cut.\n  I have enjoyed the debate. I yield the floor and thank the chairman \nand my good friends from Florida and Virginia for such an interesting \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nVirginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. I will just respond to one point made by my distinguished \nfriend from Tennessee. He was suggesting, correctly, that if we were to \nreserve, save, all of the surplus, we would not save Social Security \nand we would not save Medicare. We do not disagree. We concede.\n  Indeed, I suggest that that makes the case for why we believe we \nought to save this surplus and, at the very least, not squander it, \nbecause it might increase the incentive to make those tough political \nchoices we have not made to protect these two programs.\n  So saving all of the surplus is not going to save Social Security. It \nis not going to make Social Security solvent in the context that the \nSenator from Florida and I are discussing, nor is it going to do that \nfor Medicare. We understand that. But it might focus the mind a little \nbit. As Samuel Johnson said: when a man knows he is to be hanged it \nconcentrates his mind wonderfully. That is not an exact quote, but that \nis fairly close to it. Delaying the effective date of the tax cuts \nmight give us some incentive, some focus, to conduct that hard, \npolitically risky work that the Senator from Tennessee so accurately \ndescribed it is going to take if we are to solve the problem with \neither Social Security or Medicare.\n  All we are saying is, let's not squander this money. It isn't just a \nmatter of correcting it next year, it exacerbates the problem, because \nit is going to increase the amount of money we are going to have to \ncarry in terms of the debt. So we are saying: Hang on; $4 billion, one-\nhalf of 1 percent; it is not worth locking in the kind of a tax cut \nsome are suggesting until we've done first things first.\n  It has been a good debate. I am particularly grateful, first of all, \nto my friend and colleague from Florida for his leadership and \ncosponsorship, and to the distinguished chairman, who is also good \nnatured--notwithstanding differences we may have which may be fairly \nsignificant, but I have never heard a cross word uttered by him--and to \nthe distinguished Senator from Tennessee for engaging in this dialogue \nwhich I think does at least illustrate the choice we are going to have \nto make and the choice that, in fact, we are asking our colleagues to \nmake.\n  We are simply saying do not squander the surplus by making this kind \nof humongous tax cut this year when we can wait until next year or the \nyear after and find out exactly where we are going and, hopefully, \nincrease the pressure to actually save Social Security and \nMedicare. With that, I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues.\n\n  The Senator from Florida and I happily yield back the remaining time \non our side.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending Baucus motion be considered \nin order under the provisions of the consent agreement and all other \nprovisions of the consent agreement remain in status quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9523-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize the death of the Arab \nworld's longest-standing leader, King Hassan II of Morocco, who died \nlast Friday at the age of 70. To his family, and to the people of \nMorocco, I extend my heartfelt condolences.\n  King Hassan ruled Morocco for 38 years as only the second King of \nMorocco in that country's modern, independent history, having succeeded \nto the throne after the death of his father, King Mohammed V, in 1961, \nonly five years after Morocco gained its independence from the French.\n  Morocco, however, is an ancient country and the country with which \nthe United States has its oldest uninterrupted diplomatic relations. \nOur two countries signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1786, \nwhich the United States ratified the following year. Thus began a \nrelationship that provided our tall ships a haven in the 18th century \nand developed into a relationship of geostrategic importance in the \n20th century.\n  This special friendship was cherished in modern times by leaders in \nboth of our countries, particularly King Hassan, and I was pleased to \nsee that President Clinton, along with former President Bush, attended \nKing Hassan's funeral this weekend. America lost a good friend, a wise \ncounsel on the region, and an important and brave promoter for peace in \nthe Middle East.\n  One of the biggest challenges for the Arab world, as in other parts \nof the world, has been the challenge of modernization, and how leaders \nencourage their governments and societies to rise to this challenge.\n  We have seen several models: secular socialist dictatorships, radical \nfundamentalist regimes, and traditional authoritarians. King Hassan, \nwhose remarkable career spanned from the era of decolonization to the \ndoorstep of the next century, demonstrated that the traditional model \ncould adapt to the economic and political challenges of modernization. \nHe understood that tradition was not the enemy of the modern, but could \nease the transition by providing stability and respect for his people \nwhile allowing political and economic reforms to unleash the \nfundamental strengths and dreams of his people.\n  For his adept stewardship, he earned the deep and sincere affection \nof the vast majority of Morocco's nearly 30 million citizens.\n  Beginning as a traditional authoritarian, the King recognized the \nimportance of constitutional governance early in his reign and expanded \npolitical rights through the years. In doing so, he was one of the most \nsuccessful leaders in the Arab world in reconciling traditional \nmonarchy with the requisites and demands of modernity. King Hassan in \nrecent years had furthered political reform such that, today, the lower \nhouse of parliament is elected through universal suffrage from a roster \nof multiple parties, and the governing coalition, including the Prime \nMinister, is controlled by the opposition.\n  Concomitant with these political reforms has been a steady \nimprovement\n\n[[Page S9524]]\n\nin the human rights situation, marked, in some significant cases, by \nreconciliation with and compensation for victims of the past. While \npower still resides predominantly with the crown, King Hassan, by \nadvancing political democracy and the free market, allowed his people \nand provided his son, King Mohammed VI, with the fundamental platform \non which Morocco will proceed confidently into the next century.\n  Mr. President, no remarks on the legacy of King Hassan can be \ncomplete without recognizing his prescient view of reconciliation \nbetween Israel and the Arab world. Many note that some of the initial \nmeetings preparing for the signing of the historic Camp David accords \noccurred with King Hassan in Morocco. The fact is that the King of \nMorocco had been providing opportunities for encounters and dialogue \nfor years before then, showing that the King had a wise vision for \npeace as well as a pragmatist's approach for moving toward this noble \ngoal.\n  From the 1960s to the late Prime Minister Rabin's visit to Morocco in \n1993--which was, by the way, only the second Arab nation visited by an \nIsraeli leader, after Egypt--King Hassan of Morocco demonstrated that \nhe recognized the permanent role that the Jewish state had to play in \nthe affairs of the Middle East. In this, as in many other areas, King \nHassan was a leader among leaders.\n  Morocco's new king, King Mohammed VI, has many challenges before him. \nHe, along with King Abdallah of Jordan, represents the new generation \nof leaders in the region: highly educated, understanding the West, \ncognizant of the realities of the region, and faced with enormous \ndomestic economic challenges. Morocco's is a youthful population, \nstraddled with an unacceptably high illiteracy rate and an unyielding \ndemand for economic development. These are extremely tough challenges \nto burden a new and young king. But let us recall the youth of King \nHassan when he assumed the throne in 1961 and the misplaced doubts \nabout his future. We recognize today the legacy of King Hassan to his \nson and his nation.\n  The United States should assist in the continuing modernization of \nMorocco and the continuing cooperation to create a more peaceful Middle \nEast. So should continue a special relationship into the 21st century \nthat began so propitiously in the 18th.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9524-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE DEATH OF KING HASSAN II OF MOROCCO\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

The King was \nbeloved not only by the Moroccan people, but by people committed to \npeace throughout the Middle East and around the world. He was dedicated \nto this mission for decades, and it is quite unfortunate that he could \nnot live to see the final outcome of his lengthy efforts.\n  Many in my home State of Michigan and throughout the United States \nstand with the people of Morocco in mourning the loss of this great \nleader.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act, Employee \nRetirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to provide for nondiscriminatory coverage for substance abuse \ntreatment service under private group and individual health coverage; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n fairness in treatment--the drug and alcohol addiction recovery act of \n                                  1999\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will ensure that private health insurance companies \ncover the costs for drug and alcohol addiction treatment services at \nthe same level that they pay for treatment for other diseases. The \npurpose of this bill is to end discrimination in insurance coverage for \ndrug and alcohol addiction treatment. This bill, entitled Fairness in \nTreatment: The Drug and Alcohol Addiction Recovery Act of 1999, offers \nthe necessary provisions to provide this assurance.\n  For too long, the problem of drug and alcohol addiction has been \nviewed as a moral issue, rather than as a disease. Too often, a cloak \nof secrecy has surrounded this problem, causing people who have this \ndisease to feel ashamed and afraid to seek treatment for their symptoms \nfor fear that they will be seen as admitting to a moral failure, or a \nweakness in character. We have all seen portrayals of alcoholics and \naddicts that are intended to be humorous or derogatory, and only \nreinforce the biases against people who have problems with drug and \nalcohol addiction. I cannot imagine this type of portrayal of someone \nwho has another kind of chronic illness, a heart problem, or who \nhappens to carry a gene that predisposes them to diabetes.\n\n[[Page S9530]]\n\n  It has been shown that some forms of addiction have a genetic basis, \nand yet we still try to deny the serious medical nature of this \ndisease. We think of those with this disease as somehow different from \nus. We forget that someone who has a problem with drugs or alcohol can \nlook just like the person we see in the mirror, or the person who is \nsitting next to us at work or on the subway, or like someone in our own \nfamily. In fact, it is likely that most of us know someone who has \nexperienced drug and alcohol addiction, within our families or our \ncircle of friends or coworkers.\n  Alcoholism and drug addiction are painful, private struggles with \nstaggering public costs. A study prepared by The Lewin Group for the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholism, estimated that the total economic cost of alcohol \nand drug abuse to be $246 billion for 1992. Of this cost, $98 billion \nwas due to drug addiction to illicit drugs and other drugs taken for \nnon-medical purposes. This estimate includes addiction treatment and \nprevention costs, as well as costs associated with related illnesses, \nreduced job productivity or lost earnings, and other costs to society \nsuch as crime and social welfare programs. The study also determined \nthat these costs are borne primarily by governments (46 percent), \nfollowed by those who abuse drugs and members of their households (44 \npercent). According to this same study, private health and life \ninsurance companies bear only 3.2 percent of the costs of drug abuse \nand 10.2 percent of the costs of alcohol abuse.\n  The health effects resulting from alcohol addiction can be very \nserious, even fatal. A 1996 article in Scientific American estimated \nthat excessive alcohol consumption causes more than 100,000 deaths in \nthe U.S. each year. Of these deaths, twenty-four per cent are due to \ndrunken driving, eleven percent are homicides, and eight percent are \nsuicides. Alcohol contributes to cancers of the esophagus, larynx, and \noral cavity, which account for seventeen percent of these deaths. \nStrokes related to alcohol use account for another nine percent of \ndeaths. Alcohol causes several other ailments, such as cirrhosis of the \nliver. These ailments account for eighteen percent of the deaths.\n  We know that addiction to alcohol and other drugs contribute to other \nproblems as well. Addictive substances have the potential for \ndestroying the person who is addicted, their family, and their other \nrelationships. We know, for example, that fetal alcohol syndrome is the \nleading known cause of mental retardation. If the woman who was \naddicted to alcohol could receive proper treatment, fetal alcohol \nsyndrome for her baby would be 100 percent preventable, and more than \n12,000 infants born in the U.S. each year would not suffer from fetal \nalcohol syndrome, with its irreversible physical and mental damage. We \nknow too of the devastation caused by addiction when violence between \npeople is one of the consequences. A 1998 SAMHSA report outlined the \nlinks between domestic violence and substance abuse. We know from \nclinical reports that 25-50% of men who commit acts of domestic \nviolence also have substance abuse problems. The report recognized the \nlink between the victim of abuse and use of alcohol and drugs, and \nrecommended that after the woman's safety has been addressed, the next \nstep would be to help with providing treatment for her addiction as a \nstep toward independence and health, and toward the prevention of the \nconsequences for the children who suffer the same abuse either \ndirectly, or indirectly by witnessing spousal violence.\n  People who have the disease of addiction can be found throughout our \nsociety. According to the 1997 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse \npublished by SAMHSA, nearly 73 percent of all illegal drug users in the \nUnited States are employed. This number represents 6.7 million full-\ntime workers and 1.6 million part-time workers. Although many of these \nworkers could and should have insurance benefits that would cover \ntreatment for this disease, they do not.\n  In addition to the health problems resulting from the failure to \ntreat the illness, there are other serious consequences affecting the \nworkplace, such as lost productivity, high employee turnover, low \nemployee morale, mistakes, accidents, and increased worker's \ncompensation insurance and health insurance premiums--all results of \nuntreated addiction problems. Whether you are a corporate CEO or a \nsmall business owner, there are simple, effective steps that can be \ntaken--including providing insurance coverage for this disease, ready \naccess to treatment, and workplace policies that support treatment--\nthat can reduce these human and economic costs.\n  We know from the outstanding research conducted at NIH, through the \nNational Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol \nAbuse and Alcoholism, that treatment for drug and alcohol addiction can \nbe effective. That is the major finding from a NIDA-sponsored \nnationwide study of drug abuse treatment outcomes. The Drug Abuse \nTreatment Outcome Study (DATOS) tracked 10,000 people in nearly 100 \ntreatment programs in 11 cities who entered treatment for addiction \nbetween 1991 and 1993. Results showed that for all four treatment types \nstudied, there were reductions in the use of cocaine, heroin, and \nmarijuana after treatment. Moreover, treatment resulted in other \npositive changes in behavior, such as fewer psychological symptoms and \nincreased work productivity.\n  We must do more to prevent this illness and to treat those who are \naddicted to drugs and alcohol. Over the past few years, the principle \nof parity in insurance coverage for alcohol and drug rehabilitation and \ntreatment has received the strong support of the White House, ONDCP \nDirector General Barry McCaffrey, Former Surgeon General C. Everett \nKoop, Former President and Mrs. Gerald Ford, the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, Kaiser Permanente Health Plans, and many leading figures in \nmedicine, business, government, journalism, and entertainment who have \nsuccessfully fought the battle of addiction with the help of treatment. \nHearings held last year by the Senate Appropriations Committee and the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions highlighted the \nrecent major advances in scientific information about the disease; the \nbiological causes of addiction; the effectiveness and low cost of \ntreatment; and many painful, personal stories of people, including \nchildren, who have been denied treatment.\n  We know that the failure of insurance companies to provide treatment \ncan sometimes have devastating results. The New York Times recently \nhighlighted the tragic suicide of a young man who desperately sought \ninpatient treatment care for his drug addiction and fought for 8 months \nto have the plan authorize the treatment that was in fact included in \nas part of his benefits. The authorization came through--but too late--\nhe had died three weeks earlier from a drug overdose. This kind of \ndenial of care for addiction treatment is not at all unique--the 1998 \nHay Group Report on Employer Health Care Dollars Spent on Substance \nAbuse showed that from 1988 through 1998 the value of substance abuse \ntreatment benefits decreased by 74.5%, as compared to a 11.5% decrease \nfor overall health care benefits.\n  Addiction to alcohol and drugs is a disease that affects the brain, \nthe body, and the spirit. We must provide adequate opportunities for \nthe treatment of addiction in order to help those who are suffering and \nto prevent the health and social problems that it causes. This \nlegislation will take an important step in this direction by requiring \nthat health insurance plans eliminate discrimination for addiction \ntreatment. The costs for this are very low. A 1999 study by the Rand \nCorporation found that the cost to managed care health plans is now \nonly about $5 per person per year for unlimited substance abuse \ntreatment benefits to employees of big companies. A 1997 Milliman and \nRobertson study found that complete substance abuse treatment parity \nwould increase per capita health insurance premiums by only one half of \none percent, or less than $1 per member per month--without even \nconsidering any of the obvious savings that will result from treatment. \nSeveral studies have shown that for every $1 spent on treatment, more \nthan $7 is saved in other health care expenses, and that these savings \nare in addition to the financial and other benefits of increased \nproductivity, as well as participation in family and community life. \nProviding\n\n[[Page S9531]]\n\ntreatment for addiction also saves millions of dollars in the criminal \njustice system. But for treatment to be effective and helpful \nthroughout our society all systems of care--including private insurance \nplans--must share this responsibility.\n  This legislation does not mandate that health insurers offer \nsubstance addiction treatment benefits. What it does is prohibit \ndiscrimination by health plans who offer substance addiction treatment \nfrom placing unfair and life-threatening limitations on caps, access, \nor financial requirements for addiction treatment that are different \nfrom other medical and surgical services.\n  We must move forward now to vigorously address the serious and life-\nthreatening problem of drug and alcohol addiction in our country. It is \nlong past time that insurance companies do their fair share in bearing \nthe responsibility for treating this disease.\n  I ask that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1447\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the payment amount for renal dialysis services furnished under \nthe Medicare program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            medicare renal dialysis fair payment act of 1999\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator \nFrist to introduce the Medicare Renal Dialysis Fair Payment Act of \n1999. This legislation takes important steps to help sustain and \nimprove the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries suffering from \nkidney-failure.\n  Nationwide, more than 280,000 Americans live with end-stage renal \ndisease (ESRD). In my state of North Dakota, the number of patients \nliving with ESRD is relatively small, just over 600 per year. However, \nfor these patients, and others across the country, access to dialysis \ntreatments means the difference between life and death.\n  In 1972, the Congress took important steps to ensure that elderly and \ndisabled individuals with kidney-failure receive appropriate dialysis \ncare. At that time, Medicare coverage was extended to include dialysis \ntreatments for beneficiaries with ESRD.\n  Over the last three decades, dialysis facilities have provided \nservices to increasing numbers of kidney-failure patients under \nincreasingly strict quality standards. However, it has come to my \nattention that reimbursement to dialysis facilities does not reflect \nthe more stringent quality requirements placed upon dialysis providers.\n  Since 1983, reimbursement to dialysis facilities has actually \ndeclined. Today, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n(MedPAC), dialysis facilities receive on average $122 per treatment, \ncompared with $138 per treatment that they received in 1983. Adjusting \nfor inflation, this means that dialysis providers are only receiving \nabout $42 per treatment (in 1983 dollars) to provide nursing, social \nwork and dietitian care, as well as the actual dialysis treatment.\n  I am concerned that a continued erosion in Medicare payments to \ndialysis facilities could jeopardize beneficiaries' access to dialysis \nservices. According to MedPAC, ``without an increase in the payment \n(i.e. composite rate) the quality of dialysis services may decline. \nTherefore, an update to the composite rate is recommended.'' Further, \nMedPAC has concluded that the majority of dialysis facilities now lose \nmoney on Medicare reimbursement and the problem is especially acute for \nsmall, rural, and non-profit dialysis facilities. In my state, we \nsimply cannot afford to lose rural providers--including providers of \ndialysis services.\n  This legislation will ensure dialysis facilities have the resources \nto continue offering critical dialysis services to individuals with \nkidney failure. I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 1450. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nconvey a National Defense Reserve Fleet vessel to the Glacier Society, \nInc., of Bridgeport, Connecticut; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     CONVEYANCE OF THE SHIP GLACIER\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would save a historic vessel from the scrap heap. The Glacier, a \n310 foot, 8,600 ton icebreaker was commissioned as a vessel of the U.S. \nNavy in 1955. It made 39 trips to the North and South poles; made the \ndeepest penetration of the Antarctic by sea in 1961; rescued explorer \nSir Vivan Fuchs; and was the largest icebreaker of its time. Currently, \nthe Glacier is part of the reserve fleet awaiting disposition as scrap \nor transfer to the Glacier Society, a group dedicated to restoring the \nGlacier.\n  This bill would simply convey the Glacier from the reserve fleet to \nthe Glacier Society. The Society is mainly composed of active and \nretired servicemen who served aboard the Glacier and is headed by Ben \nKoether, one of the ship's former navigators. The group envisions that \nthe Glacier will operate as a museum and scientific laboratory. Both in \nport and underway, the Glacier Society hopes to provide hands-on \ntraining to children and adults while teaching the history of Polar \nexploration.\n  By passing the title of the Glacier to the Glacier Society, Congress \nwill save taxpayers roughly $200,000 per year, enable the development \nof unique educational opportunities, contribute to the nation's \nmaritime heritage and preserve a piece of history. I look forward to \nthe day when the Glacier Society's vision for the Glacier is achieved. \nPassage of this bill would be the first step towards realization of \nthat vision.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Biden, and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 1451.

Mr. President, today I am introducing with Senator \nHollings, Senator Biden, and Senator Graham an important piece of \nlegislation that will help to protect and preserve Medicare. The bill \nis entitled the Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act of 1999.\n  For over ten years now, I have worked to combat fraud, waste and \nabuse in the Medicare program. As Chairman and now Ranking Minority \nMember of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee with oversight of the \nadministration of Medicare, I've held hearing after hearing and \nreleased report after report documenting the extent of this problem. \nWhile virtually no one was paying attention to our effort for many \nyears, we've succeeded in bringing greater attention and focus to this \nproblem in recent years.\n  Part of our effort has been to try to quantify the scope of the \nproblem. Several years ago, the General Accounting Office reported that \nup to 10 percent of Medicare funds could be lost to fraud, waste and \nabuse each year. Many questioned that estimate as too large. They said \nthe problem existed, but it wasn't nearly as big as 10 percent. A few \nyears ago, the Inspector General conducted the first-ever detailed \naudit of Medicare payments. That Chief Financial Officer Act audit \nfound that fully 14 percent of Medicare payments in 1996, or over $23 \nbillion, had been made improperly.\n  To combat these substantial losses, we have put into place the \nreforms embodied in the Health Insurance Portability Act and the \nBalanced Budget Act. HCFA, the Inspector General and the Justice \nDepartment also have continued to aggressively use new authority to \ncrack down on Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse. As a result, we have \nseen a dramatic decrease in these improper payments. According to the \nmost recent Inspector General's report, improper payments had been \nreduced from $23.2 billion in 1996, to $20.3 billion in 1997, to $12.6 \nbillion in 1998.\n  While I am very pleased with the successful efforts so far in \ncombating fraud, waste, and abuse, that still amounts to a nearly $13 \nbillion annual ``waste tax'' on the American people. Now is not the \ntime to rest on our laurels. We must now question, what is the best way \nto move forward and further cut this tax. I know there are no ``magic-\nwand'' solutions--this is a complex problem with many components. But \nbasically, you need four things: well thought out laws, adequate \nresources, effective implementation and the help of seniors and health \nproviders. We've made progress on each of these fronts over the last \ncouple of years, but much more remains to be done.\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\n  Mr. President, we have many thousands of dedicated health providers \nwho work very hard to improve the quality of life for all people. \nThrough their efforts, Americans have the best quality health care in \nthe world. But, unfortunately, there are a small minority of providers \nwho take advantage of our health care system. This legislation is \ndirectly designed to deal with those situations. Further, it is clear \nthat many mispayments to Medicare are the result of a simple lack of \nunderstanding of our often complex Medicare payment system. This \nlegislation also addresses this problem by providing increased \neducation and assistance for providers and by reducing the paperwork \nand administrative hassles that can often lead to innocent, but costly, \nbilling errors.\n  The primary goal of this legislation is simply this--to ensure that \nMedicare pays for all that it should pay for--and only what it should \npay for.\n  The Medicare Waste Tax Reduction Act I am introducing today will take \na number of important steps to stop the continued ravaging of Medicare.\n  This Bill for example, would direct HCFA to double and better target \naudits and reviews to detect and discourage mispayments. Currently only \na tiny fraction of Medicare claims are reviewed before being paid and \nless than 2 percent of providers receive a comprehensive audit \nannually. We must have the ability to separate needed care from bill \npadding and abuse.\n  Our bill would also give Medicare the authority to be a more prudent \npurchaser. As passed by the Senate, the Balanced Budget Act gave \nMedicare the authority to quickly reduce Part B payment rates (except \nthose made for physician services) it finds to be grossly excessive \nwhen compared to rates paid by other government programs and the \nprivate sector. In conference, the provision was limited to reductions \nof no more than 15 percent. This bill would restore the original Senate \nlanguage. In addition, to assure that Medicare gets the price it \ndeserves given its status as by far the largest purchaser of medical \nsupplies and equipment, Medicare would pay no more than any other \ngovernment program for these items. Finally, overpayments for \nprescription drugs and biologicals would be eliminated by lowering \nMedicare's rate to the lowest of either the actual acquisition cost or \n83% of the wholesale cost.\n  Our bill would also give the Secretary of Health and Human Services \ngreater flexibility in contracting for claims processing and payment \nfunctions on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries and providers. It would \nupdate Medicare contracting procedures and bring it more in line with \nstandard contracting procedures already used across the Federal \nGovernment and therefore allow Medicare the ability to get much better \nvalue for its contracting dollars.\n  The Medicare Waste Tax reduction Act of 1999 would also ensure that \nMedicare does not pay for claims owed by other plans. Too often, \nMedicare pays claims that are owed by private insurers because it has \nno way of knowing a beneficiary is working and has private insurance \nthat should pay first. This provision would reduce Medicare losses by \nrequiring insurers to report any Medicare beneficiaries they insure. \nAlso, Medicare would be given the authority to recover double the \namount owed by insurers who purposely let Medicare pay claims they \nshould have paid.\n  Additionally, coordination between Medicare and private insurers \nwould be strengthened. Often, those ripping off Medicare are also \ndefrauding private health plans. Yet, too little information on fraud \ncases is shared between Medicare and private plans. In order to \nencourage better coordination, health plans and their employees could \nnot be held liable for sharing information with Medicare regarding \nhealth care fraud as long as the information is not false, or the \nperson providing the information had no reason to believe the \ninformation was false.\n  Our bill would also expand the Medicare Senior Waste Patrol \nNationwide. Seniors are our front line of defense against Medicare \nfraud, waste and abuse. However, too often, seniors don't have the \ninformation they need to detect and report suspected mistakes and \nfraud. By moving the Waste Patrol nationwide, implementing important \nBBA provisions and assuring seniors have access to itemized bills we \nwill strike an important blow to Medicare waste.\n  Another critical component of any successful comprehensive plan to \ncut the Medicare waste tax is to focus on prevention. Most of our \nefforts now look at finding and rectifying the problems after they \noccur. While this is important and we need to do even more of it, we \nall know that prevention is much more cost effective. The old adage ``A \nstitch in time saves nine'' was never more true. A major component of \nan enhanced prevention effort would be the provision of increased \nassistance and education for providers to comply with Medicare rules.\n  Further, a great deal of the mis-payments made by Medicare are the \nresult not of fraud or abuse, but of simple misunderstanding of \nMedicare billing rules by providers. Therefore, this bill provides $10 \nmillion a year to fund a major expansion of assistance and education \nfor providers on program integrity requirements. This bill would also \nensure the reduction of paperwork and administrative hassle that could \nprove daunting to providers. Health professionals have to spend too \nmuch time completing paperwork and dealing with administrative hassles \nassociated with Medicare and private health plans. In order to reduce \nthis hassle and provide more time for patient care, the Institute of \nMedicine would be charged with developing a comprehensive plan by no \nlater than June 1, 2000. Their recommendations are to include the \nstreamlining of variations between Medicare and other payers.\n  Mr. President, while we have made changes to medicare in attempts to \nextend its solvency thru the next decade, we urgently need to take \nother steps to protect and preserve the program for the long-term. We \nshould enact the reforms in this bill to weed out waste, fraud and \nabuse as a first priority in this effort. I urge all my colleagues to \nreview this proposal and hope that they will join me in working to pass \nit yet this year.\n  Mr President, I also ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1451\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to modernize the requirements under the National \nManufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 and \nto establish a balanced consensus process for the development, \nrevision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety \nstandards for manufactured homes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n\n\n                 MANUFACTURING HOUSING IMPROVEMENT ACT.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a \nbipartisan bill with my colleagues, Senators Bayh, Bryan, Rockefeller \nand Bingaman. Entitled the ``Manufactured Housing Improvement Act,'' \n(MHIA) this bill is designed to modernize the requirements under the \nNational Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of \n1974 and to establish a balanced consensus process for the development, \nrevision, and interpretation of Federal construction and safety \nstandards for manufactured homes.\n  Many do not realize that the majority of new manufactured homes of \ntoday are completely different from those of twenty or even ten years \nago, and that this is the fastest growing segment of the housing \nindustry. Today nearly one out of four new single family homes is a \nmanufactured home, and the industry recently set a twenty-year sales \nrecord. There are good consumer-oriented reasons for this tremendous \ngrowth--manufactured homes offer quality and aesthetically pleasing \nhousing at an average cost of $41,100, excluding the land. Today, \nmanufactured housing has lowered the threshold to the American Dream of \nhome ownership for millions of Americans, including first-time home \nbuyers, senior citizens, young families, and single parents.\n  With 5.3 million American households in need of affordable housing, I \nbelieve it is imperative to update the laws that regulate the private \nsector solution to affordable housing. In order for the manufactured \nhousing industry to remain competitive, Congress must modernize the \nNational Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of \n1974.\n  My bill would do just that. MHIA would establish a consensus \ncommittee that would submit recommendations to the Secretary of Housing \nand Urban Development (HUD) for developing, amending, and revising the \nFederal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards. In \naddition, the committee would be authorized to interpret the standards \nand recommend appropriate regulations. Consumers will still be \nprotected by HUD because the Secretary will have absolute authority to \nreject any recommendations, for any reason, submitted by the consensus \ncommittee.\n  The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act would authorize the \nSecretary of HUD to use industry label fees for the administration of \nthe consensus committee and the hiring of additional HUD staff in order \nto assure adequate consumer protection. The Secretary of HUD would also \nbe authorized to use industry label fees to facilitate the availability \nand affordability of manufactured homes.\n  This legislation is a very significant step forward in that both \nconsumer and industry groups such as the Seniors Coalition, 60 Plus, \nand the Council for Affordable and Rural Housing, the National \nAssociation of Affordable Housing Lenders, the North American Steel \nFraming Alliance, and the Community Associations Institute, along with \nthe Manufactured Housing Institute and the Manufactured Housing \nAssociation for Regulatory Reform, have endorsed this legislation.\n  The industry participants have modernized the quality and technology \nof manufactured housing. It's time for Congress to modernize the laws \nthat regulate an industry that provides affordable housing and \ncontributes more than $33 billion annually to our nation's economy.\n  Similar legislation passed the House at the end of last Congress on a \nbipartisan basis under suspension of the\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\nrules and has been introduced again this year. I hope this year the \nSenate will take the lead and send the MHIA to the House as soon as \npossible.\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, to introduce the Manufactured \nHousing Improvement Act. This important legislation is designed to \nensure that the manufactured housing industry continues to provide \nsafe, affordable housing by modernizing the requirements under the \nNational Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of \n1974. The bill also provides the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) with the resources necessary to meet its obligations \nto manufactured homeowners.\n  Manufactured housing has evolved significantly in the last twenty-\nfive years; it's no longer the stereotypical mobile home. In fact, the \nvast majority of manufactured homes installed today are never moved \nonce they have been sited. At an average cost of $40,000 for a new \nmanufactured home, excluding land, manufactured housing is the fastest \ngrowing sector of the housing industry. One in every four new single \nfamily homes sold in the United States is a manufactured home. \nManufactured housing provides many American families with the \nopportunity to not only own their own homes, but to live in safe, \ncomfortable, and affordable housing. In addition, improvements in \nconstruction have led to the development of aesthetically pleasing \nhomes. Most manufactured homes built today are manufactured to resemble \ntraditional site built homes and are enjoyed by an array of Americans, \nincluding first time home buyers, senior citizens, and single parent \nfamilies. Manufactured housing is an industry that not only provides \naffordable housing but also creates jobs. In my home state of Indiana, \nthe manufactured housing industry employees more than 20,000 Hoosiers \nand has a total economic impact in my state of nearly $3 billion per \nyear.\n  The Manufactured Housing Program at HUD, which oversees the industry, \nhas faced many administrative challenges in the last decade. Lack of \nresources has prevented the program from keeping up with the changing \nneeds of manufactured housing. While the industry has voluntary \nimplemented numerous code changes in recent years, many requests to \nreview standards or regulations currently await action by HUD or have \ntaken numerous years to process, because of inadequate resources at the \nDepartment. Ten years ago, the number of HUD employees assigned to this \nprogram was 34. Today, only 8 HUD employees are responsible for this \nprogram. With the rapid growth in housing technology, it is imperative \nthat HUD not only address these standards but do so in a timely \nfashion, allowing the industry to remain competitive while providing \nhomeowners with the most advanced housing technology.\n  Our legislation will remedy this situation by modernizing the program \nby implementing procedures in which all proposed construction and \nsafety standards are addressed and considered in a reasonable time \nframe. The Manufactured Housing Improvement Act requires that action on \nany proposed standard or regulation be taken within one year after it \nhas been proposed to the Secretary. This is an important provision. It \nrequires the Secretary to act, but protects consumers by authorizing \nthe Secretary to reject any proposal which is deemed to be adverse to \nconsumers.\n  Finally, through the use of industry labeling fees, this legislation \nprovides economic resources to the Secretary for the hiring of \nadditional HUD program staff. The costs of operating this program and \nthe re-staffing of the manufactured housing program will continue to be \nborne by the manufactured housing industry, not the taxpayer. I note \nthat the industry is willing to bear this expense in order to improve \nthe efficiency of the regulatory system.\n  As we strive to ensure that all Americans have access to safe, \naffordable, and quality housing, we need to ensure that best practices \nare applied to the housing industry and that we support the \nmodernization of housing technology. Manufactured housing is a valuable \nhousing resource and provides access to home ownership for many \nAmericans. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation.\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, Once again, I am joining \nSenator Shelby and other colleagues to introduce legislation intended \nto strengthen the manufactured housing industry. Manufactured housing \nprovides a major source of affordable housing for American families, \nincluding seniors. This industry represents almost thirty percent of \nnew single-family homes sold in the United States. In my state of West \nVirginia, manufactured housing represents over 60 percent of new homes.\n  Manufactured housing should play a strong role to increase the \navailability of affordable housing. This issue will be especially \nimportant to seniors who, according to a national survey, forty-five \npercent of households living in manufactured homes are headed by a \nperson over 50 years old.\n  Manufactured housing is affordable housing, and it is the fastest \ngrowing type of housing nationally. The average cost of a new \nmanufactured home without land in 1997 was $38,400, and even with land \nand installation fees this cost is well below the typical costs of a \nnewly constructed site-built home.\n  But this industry faces challenges. Unlike other housing, \nmanufactured housing is regulated by the 1974 National Manufactured \nHousing Construction and Safety Standards Act by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, (HUD). Because of reform in HUD \nmanagement, the federal officials overseeing manufactured housing have \ndeclined from 34 staff members at its peak to less than a dozen \nprofessional staff now. This decline in staff has occurred at the same \ntime that the industry has grown. Unfortunately, due to a lack of \nstaff, HUD cannot keep pace with the need to update the code on a \nconsistent basis and timely manner. In fact, between 1989 and 1996, a \nconsensus committee made 140 suggestions to HUD about changes for the \nfederal codes on manufactured housing, and 80 of these provisions are \nstill pending in the Department. For example, the 1999 National \nElectrical Code has new, state-of-the-art standards but given staffing \nshortage, how long will it take to update the electrical standards? \nShouldn't we address the staffing shortage, and get action on the \nlingering recommendations?\n  In 1990, Congress established a National Commission on Manufactured \nHousing, and pushed the commission to forge consensus on key issues for \nthis important industry, unfortunately that effort collapsed in 1994.\n  This legislation is a new effort to address the challenges facing the \nindustry. Introduction of the bill is just a first step. We all \nunderstand that the legislative process is designed to seek consensus \nand improve legislation. I believe that we must work hard to forge \nconsensus among the industry and the consumers. This will be a \nchallenge, but the potential rewards can be great for both sides. The \nindustry can win and prosper with a more effective, streamlined \nregulatory process that keeps pace with improvements and standards. \nConsumers will win if safety standards and regulations are adopted more \nefficiently. Also, if the industry uses new standards to provide better \nhousing, manufactured housing could be designed to meet a wider variety \nof needs including modules for assisted living.\n  The current system of regulations and oversight is not working for \nthe industry, nor is it working as well as it should for consumers, \naccording to a survey by seniors. But when there are problems and \nconcerns, all groups need to work together on a strategy for change.\n  This legislation is intended to promote reform that will help both \nthe industry and the consumers of manufactured housing. My hope is that \nall sides will work together to forge consensus about reform.\n  We should use this as an opportunity to come together and develop a \nnew, improved strategy for manufactured housing. Affordable housing is \na major issue for families and communities. Manufactured housing is \nplaying a key role in affordable housing, but more could and should be \ndone. To achieve success, we need to develop a bipartisan, consensus \napproach. We need to help the industry and assure consumers that safety \nand standards will be retained and improved, not weakened. This is \nworth our combined effort to provide more affordable housing.\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as a \ncosponsor of the Manufactured Housing Improvement Act. This Act has \ncome about as a result of much negotiation between buyers of \nmanufactured housing, the Housing and Urban Development Agency and \nmanufacturers and dealers of manufactured housing. I commend the \nindustry for coming to Congress with its plan to modify the Federal \nManufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Over \ntwenty years has elapsed since we comprehensively addressed the topic \nof safety and manufactured housing. Manufactured housing has changed \nsignificantly in the past twenty years. With the rise in the number of \nbuyers of manufactured housing, it is time we ensure that safety \nstandards are up-to-date and adequate to address consumers' concerns.\n  The Senate bill has eleven sections that cover everything from the \nestablishment of a Consensus Committee to a section encouraging \nsecondary market securitization programs for FHA manufactured home \nloans and other loan programs. The new Consensus Committee will consist \nof 25 voting members and one non-voting member representing the \nSecretary of HUD. The Committee will represent a wide spectrum of \ninterested parties, including but not limited to, home producers, \nretailers, lenders, insurers, consumers, consumer organizations, local \npublic officials, and fire marshals. The Committee will be responsible \nfor recommending amendments to the current safety standards and \nenforcement regulations to HUD.\n  Most notably, there is no funding being authorized in this bill. The \nSecretary of HUD is authorized to use the industry label fees to carry \nout the responsibilities under the Act and to administer the Consensus \nCommittee.\n  Not only does manufactured housing provide an affordable housing \noption for New Mexicans, the overall economic impact of the \nmanufactured housing industry on New Mexico is significant. In 1998, \nthe total economic impact on the state was over $264 million. Although \nmost New Mexicans are familiar with the 157 retailers in the state, \nmany are not aware that we also have two manufacturers located in the \nstate. Last year, these manufacturers produced over 1,000 homes and the \nentire industry was responsible for employing more than 2,000 people. \nAnyone driving the highways of New Mexico is familiar with the site of \na manufactured home moving across Interstate 40 or Interstate 25. \nHowever, many New Mexicans may not know that almost 7,000 homes were \nshipped into the state in 1998 alone.\n  Manufactured housing serves an important role in New Mexico. With the \nrising cost of homes in the metropolitan areas, and even in the smaller \nnorthern communities, manufactured housing that have an average cost of \nonly $42,900 enable many more individuals and families to become \nhomeowners. Currently, 41.8% of the housing in New Mexico is \nmanufactured housing.\n  I think this bill is important not only to New Mexico but to all \nowners of manufactured housing. With a focus on construction safety \nstandards, consumers will be safer and more secure in their new homes. \nBoth the manufactured Housing Industry and the Congress need to take \nthe concerns raised in the survey conducted by the American Association \nof Retired Persons seriously. The Consensus Committee created by this \nbill will play an important role in raising the standards for \nconstruction and safety. I hope the Committee thoroughly evaluates the \nconstruction concerns and safety issues raised by those responding to \nAARP's survey. It is critical to the success of this program that the \nowners, the builders and the regulators work together to achieve a \nhigher level of safety and consumer satisfaction.\n  I thank Senator Shelby for introducing this bill and I encourage the \nSenate to take up this bill and pass this worthwhile \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 1453. A bill to facilitate relief efforts and a comprehensive \nsolution to the war in Sudan; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                            sudan peace act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, the United States has a tradition of \ndefining our national interests overseas to reflect our values: freedom \nfrom persecution, freedom from religious intolerance, and the \ninalienable rights of self-determination and economic opportunity. In \nthe twentieth century alone, we have sacrificed so much to defend those \ninterests worldwide, based on the belief that freedom is truly an \ninalienable right, not simply for Americans, but for all peoples. Even \nnow, in Kosovo and in Bosnia, we have been the world leaders in \ndefending against tyranny and oppression, believing that, although far \naway, injustice must be met with resolve.\n  Our response to the tragedy and injustice in Sudan has not been quite \nso aggressive. The radical Islamic regime in power in Sudan has \ncoordinated a systematic campaign of terror against southern Sudan \nwhich includes calculated starvation, slavery, and the killing of \ninnocent women and children. The war of low-level ethnic cleansing in \nSudan has ground on for 16 years, claiming the lives of nearly 2 \nmillion and displacing over 4 million. That staggering number \nrepresents more dead than the wars in Bosnia, Kosovo, Somalia, \nAfghanistan, and Chechnya combined. In terms of loss of life, it has \nbeen the costliest war this century since the Second World War. After \n10 years of feeding the starving, with the war no closer to resolution \nthan it was in 1983 when it began, we must change our approach. While \nwe have been very generous as a Nation in terms of humanitarian relief, \nwe have done little to address the causes of the war.\n  Along with my colleagues, Senator Feingold, Senator Brownback, and \nSenator Lieberman, I am introducing the ``Sudan Peace Act,'' which aims \nto strengthen American policy and resolve to end the status quo.\n  The timing of this initiative is critical. The Government of Sudan \nhas publicly announced that they will use incoming oil revenues to \nincrease the tempo and lethality of the war. An increase in the \nlethality and tempo of the war would translate into more death and \ndestruction, more shattered lives and more slaves. Thus, time is of the \nessence in supporting efforts to reach a comprehensive conclusion to \nthe hostilities. Even under such grim circumstances, a glimmer of \nopportunity to push for a comprehensive solution to the conflict may be \nat hand. We must take full advantage of that chance, for without the \nleadership of the United States, the war will certainly drag on for \nmany more years.\n  International relief operations have been in existence for 10 years \nwith little change. The current arrangement allows Khartoum to \nmanipulate our food donations as a weapon of mass destruction by \nvetoing United Nations' relief flight plans in areas of rebel activity. \nAlso, at a cost of over $1 million per day, the effort is wrought with \nthe potential for extreme donor fatigue.\n  We need a new policy using all points of pressure and directing all \nefforts toward a comprehensive negotiated solution. Reinvigorating and \npursuing a peace process based on the Declaration of Principles, signed \nby the combatants in 1994, is the best means we have to push for a \ncomprehensive solution at this time. So far, the Government of Sudan \nhas refused to negotiate in good faith, choosing instead to continue \nthe brutal war and create political diversions to any credible, binding \nprocess.\n  With a set of new or strengthened political and humanitarian tools, \nthis legislation aims to push all players toward a comprehensive \nnegotiated solution.\n  The Government of Sudan has long abetted the practice of slavery. \nAdditionally, it has helped organize and coordinate militia, Popular \nDefense Forces, and paramilitary holy warriors (``muraheleen'') to \nterrorize and sometimes enslave traditional agricultural and \npastoralist tribes in the south and in the Nuba Mountains.\n  The legislation condemns the gross violations of human rights in \nSudan--including slavery, the use of the denial of access to food as a \nweapon of mass destruction, and targeting of civilians--and increases \npressure for action in the United Nations Security Council and for UN \nhuman rights monitors to be deployed in contested areas.\n  The effort to stop the conflict in Sudan has the best chance of \nsuccess if\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\nit is a multinational effort. The shameful lack of resolve among the \ninternational community to pressure the combatants has been a factor in \nthe perpetuation of the conflict.\n  The legislation does more than simply highlight the shameful lack of \nresolve internationally, it seeks to change our own policy to address \nthe causes of the famine and the war.\n  The legislation gives the Secretary of State clear authority to \ncommit all necessary diplomatic efforts toward reinvigorating the \nInter-governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) peace process, \nincluding any necessary support for implementation of a settlement. It \ncalls upon the leadership of the members of IGAD and the IGAD Partners \nForum (IPF--a grouping of donors and multilateral organizations) to \ngive all necessary support.\n  The combination of a Declaration of Principles on which a peace \nprocess should be based and the engagement of the IGAD Partners' Forum \nbodes well for a reinvigoration of what has been a foundering process. \nThe fact that IGAD is a credible regional organization adds to its \npotential success. The Declaration of Principles provides a first \ncritical, measurable step to which the combatants can be held \naccountable.\n  The legislation supports the President's sanctions against Sudan, \ncodifying them into law and protecting them from piecemeal erosion \nuntil Sudan makes substantial and verifiable progress toward peace. The \nexisting sanctions must be used as a pressure point for peace.\n  The United States must maintain or strengthen every possible point on \nwhich to pressure Sudan to engage in a meaningful peace process. Any \nrelaxation of any portion of the sanctions would essentially be a \nreward to Khartoum.\n  The legislation also requires the President to report to Congress on \nthe status and means of financing the new oil fields in Sudan and that \nfinancing's relationship to the sanctions, the number and circumstances \nof bombings of civilian targets by the Government of Sudan, the extent \nto which humanitarian operations are being compromised, and whether \nprogress is being made toward peace by all parties.\n\n  The issue of financing oil fields is especially important. The \nrevenues from the new sources of oil will add a new source of hard \ncurrency to finance the war. A key player in making that influx of hard \ncurrency into Khartoum is a Canadian company that is listed on the New \nYork Stock Exchange. Considering the wording of the sanctions in the \nPresident's Executive order of 1997, such a financial instrument would \nseem to be something the United States would not be able to legally \nfacilitate. It is certainly not something the United States should want \nto facilitate.\n  The United Nations-coordinated relief effort in Sudan, known as \nOperation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), was founded in 1989 in response to the \nstarvation deaths of 250,000 people in southern Sudan. In March and \nApril 1998 the Government of Sudan denied OLS access to much of Bahr el \nGhazal in an effort to starve out rebels. The ban caused severe famine.\n  The ability of the Government of Sudan to veto OLS relief flight \nplans has allowed Khartoum to use food as a weapon of mass destruction. \nIt indiscriminately targets combatants and noncombatants alike. Only \nwith the cooperation and pressure from the members of the Security \nCouncil and those countries which continue normal trade relations with \nSudan can we ever hope to achieve success on this point. Having a \nviable alternative to OLS would not only allow for the distribution of \nrelief should a flight ban be imposed, it will immediately discourage \nKhartoum's use of flight bans as an instrument of war.\n  This legislation continues to press for reform of all humanitarian \nassistance in Sudan. The bill includes measures to press for reform of \nOLS, for the continued use of relief organizations outside OLS to \ndeliver the United States' relief assistance, and directs the \nAdministration to develop a possible alternative organization to \ndeliver relief, should Khartoum again place bans on relief flights.\n  The use of non-OLS groups to distribute relief has two primary \nbenefits. First, it fills in holes where OLS is prohibited from \noperating either by Khartoum or by its own security concerns. It can \nalso strengthen the hand of OLS with respect to flight bans because \nKhartoum is reluctant to exercise its veto power when it clearly \nstrengthens organizations outside its control.\n  The legislation provides new and expanded authority for the Sudan \nTransition Assistance for Rehabilitation (STAR) program, which seeks to \nbuild the basic civil and economic institutions in areas devastated by \nthe war.\n  The move away from providing only disaster assistance toward \nproviding development assistance is critical. STAR seeks to build the \nbasic administrative and social institutions in areas outside of \ngovernment control essential for a self sustaining Sudan: civil \nadministration, civil society, agricultural extension services, courts, \netc. One of the greatest advantages Khartoum enjoys is a destroyed \nsociety in the south. Again, a stronger society and economy in the \nsouth serves to disabuse Khartoum of the notion that it can win \noutright on the battlefield and is thus a pressure point to push for \ncommitment to a viable peace process. The reconciliation efforts \nbetween the Dinka and Nuer peoples is arguably the most significant \ndevelopment in recent years in terms of strengthening the areas outside \nof the government's control and putting pressure on Khartoum to come to \nthe table. Support for those efforts are critical. Finally, this \nposition makes no assumption nor policy statement with regard to the \neventual political status of the south.\n  The legislation also provides for an independent assessment of the \nhumanitarian needs of certain regions in Sudan, which are heavily \ncontested and thus excluded from most multilateral humanitarian \noperations. The Nuba Mountains and its unique and fast-disappearing \npeople and culture is especially vulnerable.\n  In an effort to reduce the diversion of food assistance to \ncombatants, to strengthen the targeted population's ability to defend \nthemselves, and to provide for separation of combatants from ongoing \nhumanitarian operations and the personnel who run them, the bill gives \nthe President authority to provide direct food assistance to those \nforces protecting noncombatants from attacks by government or \ngovernment-sponsored forces. However, such a program may only be \nconducted completely separate from current or future humanitarian \noperations and without compromising them.\n  Currently, the majority of relief agencies, both within and outside \nOLS, provide assistance only to noncombatants. As a consequence, hungry \nrebel forces routinely divert food aid away from delivery areas, either \nby taxation, or by taking the food outright. The result is that normal \nfood distribution is disrupted and any reasonable separation between \ncombatants and noncombatants is breached. Providing a separate \nmechanism to feed combatants--who will be receiving food aid in one \nform or another, regardless of the distribution scheme--hOLSs the \npossibility of reducing diversions, maintaining a clear separation \nbetween combatant and noncombatants, and thus helping to minimize risk \nto relief agency personnel. Additionally, the necessity of pursuing \nfood has seriously undermined the effectiveness of those forces to \ndefend the population in areas outside of government control, as they \nmust often demobilize for long periods of time to exact food from \nrelief supplies or tend to farming or herding responsibilities. The \nAdministration should make a determination on the potential for such a \nprogram to meet the goals outlined in the section. This legislation \ngives the President the authority to do so, with strong provisions to \nprotect current humanitarian operations. Like other capacity building \nmeasures in this legislation, enhancing the ability of those in areas \noutside of government control to defend themselves from government \naggression will ultimately help to dissuade the government from \ncontinued prosecution of the war and will thus strengthen the push to \nengage in a comprehensive peace process.\n  These are all critical measures and opportunities which the United \nStates must seize. Our policy has not done enough to change the status \nquo. Our generous response, which began in 1989, has grown and \ncontinued to feed more of the starving, yet as a response to the war, \nit has grown tepid. Unless we do all we can to end the conflict in \nSudan,\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\nwe are part of the problem. For sixteen years we have witnessed the \ndestruction of a nation and the loss of millions of lives, ground into \ndust as the world misses opportunity after opportunity to stop \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROBB (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Lincoln, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Akaka):\n  S. 1454.

Mr. President, I have come before this chamber on numerous \noccasions to urge our colleagues to find a way to give states and \nlocalities the additional resources they so urgently need to build and \nrenovate our nation's schools. In January, Senator Lautenberg and I, \nwith several other colleagues, introduced the Public School \nModernization Act of 1999. In March, Senators Lautenberg, Harkin, and I \nwere successful in offering an amendment to this year's budget \nresolution which called for $24.8 billion in zero-interest bonds as \nwell as direct grants for school construction and repair. That \namendment passed the Senate unanimously. Regrettably the Senate Finance \nCommittee tax bill includes only minimal school infrastructure \nassistance, despite the opportunity we had in Committee to include much \nmore substantial infrastructure relief.\n  Proposals regarding school construction have been offered from both \nsides of the aisle. Unfortunately, however, the debate about education \ninfrastructure needs and the federal role to address those needs has \ntoo often been partisan and has been characterized by an inability or \nan unwillingness to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all \nsolution to the school construction dilemma facing many of our nation's \nschool districts.\n  So today, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Lautenberg, Conrad, \nHarkin, Kennedy, Daschle, Reid, Murray, Levin, Cleland, Dodd, \nTorricelli, Schumer, Lincoln, Johnson, Wellstone, Kerry, Kerrey, and \nAkaka in introducing legislation designed to combine various bipartisan \nschool construction proposals to create a menu of school construction \nfinancing options. The Public School Modernization and Overcrowding \nRelief Act of 1999 will help school districts build new schools to \naccommodate the record enrollments of elementary and secondary students \nwe know are coming. It will also help modernize schools to ensure that \nour children have the benefit of modern technology. And it will help \nrepair old schools which have become outdated and unsafe.\n  Mr. President, 14 million children attend schools in need of \nextensive repair or replacement. Twelve million attend schools with \nleaky roofs, and 7 million attend schools with safety code violations. \nThe President of the Maine Education Association testified before the \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee recently and stated \nthat there are schools in Maine that actually turn the lights out when \nit rains because the electrical wiring is exposed under their leaky \nroofs.\n  Compounding the safety problem is the significant overcrowding in the \nnation's schools. Across the country, there are thousands and thousands \nof trailers used for instruction--over 3,000 are in use in Virginia \nalone. So instead of attending science class equipped with the latest \ntechnology to conduct biology experiments, our children are going to \nclass in poorly-ventilated portable trailers that can actually be \nharmful to their health.\n  Mr. President, Loudon County, Virginia will need to build 22 new \nschools over the next six years to accommodate its enormous population \ngrowth. Despite the help that our own Virginia General Assembly has \napproved, the state will only provide two to three percent of \nVirginia's total school infrastructure needs. This isn't just a \nVirginia phenomenon; it's a national crisis. The National Center for \nEducation Statistics estimates that by 2003, the nation will need to \nbuild 2,400 new schools to accommodate record enrollments in our \nelementary and secondary schools.\n  In short, school boards should not be forced to choose between hiring \nan additional teacher or fixing a leaky roof. School superintendents \nshould be installing computer labs, not basic air conditioning. And \nstudents should attend schools of the future, not relics of the past.\n  The legislation we offer today will allow school districts to issue \ntax-exempt bonds for school construction. Localities will be able to \nsave significant amounts of money on capital improvement projects, as \nthe federal government would give bondholders a tax credit in the \namount of the interest that the locality would otherwise be required to \npay. The legislation also knocks down a statutory hurdle which \ncurrently hinders more private sector involvement in public education \nby allowing private entities to pool resources with states and \nlocalities to build and renovate school buildings. Furthermore, if a \nstate or locality has previously issued bonds at a time when interest \nrates were high, this legislation would allow them to essentially \nrefinance that debt to take advantage of today's lower interest rates. \nThe legislation will also make it easier for small communities to issue \na greater number of bonds without being subject to onerous arbitrage \nrequirements. All of these provisions provide states and localities \nwith choices. Under this legislation, our states and localities will be \nable to avail themselves of those provisions that best suit their \nfinancial needs. The bill creates a menu of options through which \nstates and localities can assemble their own financing packages.\n  Mr. President, as a former governor, I acknowledge that education is \nprimarily a state and local responsibility. The federal government, \nhowever, can be a helpful partner in education by helping to defray the \ncost of capital improvements without interfering with the substantive \ndecisions that states and localities are struggling to make regarding \ntheir academic reform efforts. Providing a variety of financing options \nto fund capital improvements, therefore, is an imminently constructive \nrole for the federal government to play. For our public education \nsystem to be the best in the world, all three levels of government--\nlocal, state, and federal--will have to work together.\n  I thank my colleagues who have co-sponsored this legislation, and I \nlook forward to working with them to pass it. It's flexible. It's \nsensible. And it provides the most financing options of any school \nconstruction proposal to date. I hope this legislation brings us one \nstep closer to the compromise I know we can reach.\n  Mr. President, in the 1930's and again in the 1950's, our \ngrandparents and parents summoned the political will to build the vast \nmajority of our nation's existing school buildings. It is my hope that \nwe can summon that will again. Our nation's students and families \ndeserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 1455. A bill to enhance protections against fraud in the offering \nof financial assistance for college education, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n          the college scholarship fraud prevention act of 1999\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, to introduce the College Scholarship Fraud \nPrevention Act of 1999. This legislation will prevent unscrupulous \nbusinesses from defrauding students seeking to finance a college \neducation.\n  Students in Michigan and across the nation are targeted by corrupt \ncompanies preying on their hopes and dreams of a college education. A \ncollege diploma is the key that opens the door to many of today's \ncareer opportunities, but the reality is that this diploma is becoming \nmore and more expensive to obtain. A number of organizations have \nsprung up to address this problem, and many of them perform an \ninvaluable\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\nservice in providing student financing, or in providing information to \nstudents concerning institutions to which those students may apply for \nfinancial assistance. Unfortunately, however, a growing number of \nindividuals are turning student need into a scam opportunity, taking \nfinancial advantage of students in need of assistance.\n  Each year, individuals and businesses send thousands of letters out \nto hopeful students, offering bogus scholarships. The tactics used by \nthese con-artists vary, but they nearly always involve \nmisrepresentation and fraud. Some exclusively use the mails to conduct \ntheir illegal activities, while others, like the National Scholarship \nFoundation have sent hundreds of thousands of postcards to potential \ncollege students, encouraging them to call an ``800'' number for ``free \nmoney''. Students calling the NSF number were told that they were \nguaranteed $1000 or more in scholarships if they would pay a $189 \nprocessing fee, to be refunded if they did not receive the scholarship. \nStudents sending $189 to the NSF received only general information \nabout the college application process and the costs of a college \neducation--information readily available for free from other sources. \nNSF never provided refunds.\n  The Federal Trade Commission has been aware of this growing problem; \nand we have sought their input while drafting this legislation. In \n1996, the FTC initiated ``Project $cholarship- $cam,'' a nationwide \ncrackdown on fraudulent scholarship search services. But although the \nFTC is dedicated to stopping these con artists, it can only pursue \ncivil remedies; the Justice Department is responsible for prosecuting \nthese scam-artists criminally upon FTC referral, and unfortunately, \nsuch prosecutions are a rare occurrence.\n  Even when the Justice Department does prosecute scholarship scam-\nartists, the penalties are so light as to provide little deterrent \neffect. For example, this past May a federal jury in Maryland convicted \nChristopher Nwaigwe of defrauding more than 50,000 college students of \nmore than $500,000. Mr. Nwaigwe had mailed letters to students \nannouncing scholarship offers of $2,500 to $7,500, in exchange for \nwhich students were requested to send Mr. Nwaigwe a $10 processing fee. \nIn reality, after the students sent the check, they waited in vain for \na response.\n  Nwaigwe was ordered by the U.S. Postal Service to stop sending \nmisleading letters in 1993, yet, he chose to ignore this warning and \ncontinue to defraud students. In 1996, Nwaigwe was the subject of a \ncivil action in U.S. District Court, in which he was permanently \nenjoined from using materials to solicit money from students. Yet it \nwas only in May--six years after the first official action taken \nagainst him--that he finally faced a jury. And the maximum penalty he \nfaces for his long course of fraudulent conduct is five years' \nimprisonment and a fine of $250,000--half the dollar amount we know to \nbe the minimum he gained through his fraud.\n\n  Mr. President, the rapid spread of scholarship scams such as \nChristopher Nwaigwe's makes it imperative that we step up prosecutions \nand impose tougher sentences. My legislation would encourage the \nJustice Department of pursue and prosecute more scholarship scam-\nartists, by providing an additional ten years' imprisonment and \nadditional fines in fraud cases which involve the offering of \neducational services.\n  In addition, this legislation would improve the FTC's ability to \nenforce orders for disgorgement and redress to consumers. Senator \nFeingold and I have been briefed by the FTC on its current problems \nenforcing judgments, and one particularly offensive example involves an \nabuse of consumer bankruptcy protections. Often, scholarship scam-\nartists use their fraudulent gains to buy expensive homes. When hit \nwith disgorgement and redress orders, they file for bankruptcy. And \nbecause most states exempt at least a portion of the value of \nresidential property from bankruptcy estates, these con-artists are \nable to retain their ill-gotten gains in the form of their trophy \nhomes. After the bankruptcy proceeding clears their debts, the scam-\nartists may then sell their estates, keeping the money they have \ndefrauded from students.\n  Our legislation would prevent con-artists from using their technique \nto avoid paying court judgments in this fashion. Residential property \nexemptions from bankruptcy estimates are intended to aid law-abiding \npeople who find themselves in financial difficulty; they were not meant \nto help scam-artists launder and protect ill-gotten gains. This \nlegislation takes a cue from Congress' response to the savings and loan \ncrisis, and amends the bankruptcy code so that debts derived from \ncollege financial assistance fraud would be excluded from homestead \nbankruptcy exemptions. Legitimate homeowners will still be protected by \nthe bankruptcy laws. But con-artists will no longer be able to use \nthese laws for their own, fraudulent ends.\n  In addition to these punitive and deterrent measurers. Mr. President, \nthis legislation also includes measures to help student and their \nfamilies obtain financing help from legitimate organizations. We need \nto make it easier for students and their families to differentiate \nlegitimate companies from con-artists. The FTC currently warns students \nabout fraudulent scholarship services; while this is commendable, \nhowever, in my view, the larger number of students who visit the \nDepartment of Education web site to find out about financing option \nmakes it the logical choice for an anti-scam public relations \ninitiative. To that end, this legislation would call on the Secretary \nof Education to maintain a web page on the Department's web site \nlisting legitimate sources of scholarship information. To ensure that \nthis web page is not misused by unscrupulous companies and individuals, \nand other provision would require the Education Department to consult \nwith the FTC before including any name on its list.\n  No organization would be listed on the web page if it or its operator \nhas been prosecuted by the FTC and convicted of using unfair or \ndeceptive practices.

Mr. President, on July 31, friends and colleagues \nwill gather at the U.S. Naval War College to honor Colonel Stephen \nMcCartney, Lieutenant Colonel Jack McMahon, and First Sergeant Thomas \nScalavino who are retiring from Marine Corps Reserves. Accordingly, I \nwant to pay tribute to these three distinguished gentlemen from Rhode \nIsland as they embark on the next phase of their private lives.\n  As many know, I had the privilege of commanding a marine rifle \ncompany in Korea in the fall of 1951 and winter of 1952. During that \ntime, I came away with tremendous respect for each officer and enlisted \nman. They were courageous and displayed extraordinary endurance. I have \nnever forgotten the confidence they had in themselves, and their \nwillingness to go into harm's way. If there was dangerous work to be \ndone, they were willing to do it. Colonel McCartney, Lieutenant Colonel \nMcMahon, and First Sergeant Scalavino have displayed that same \ncommitment and valor to our country.\n  After graduating from the Marine Corps Platoon Leader's Course in \n1968, Stephen McCartney was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the \nMarine Corps in 1969 and assigned as an infantry officer. In this \ncapacity, he served with the 1st Marine Division in the Republic of \nVietnam and participated in three major combat operations against Viet \nCong and North Vietnamese army units until 1971. In 1973, Colonel \nMcCartney left active duty but remained involved in the Marine Corps \nReserve, serving with the 25th Marines. However, his tour did no end \nthere.\n  During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, then Lieutenant \nColonel McCartney and his battalion were activated and assigned to the \n1st Marine Division. There he participated in direct combat operations \nagainst Iraqi forces in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. In 1992, McCartney was \npromoted to his present rank. In his nearly thirty years of active and \nreserve service, Colonel McCartney has served in a variety of other \nimportant Marine Corps billets with consistent and meritorious service. \nIndeed, Colonel McCartney's services have ranged from infantry officer \nto the Providence Police Department where he retired with the rank of \nMajor, to his most recent appointment as Chief of Police for the \nWarwick Police Department.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Jack McMahon is retiring from the Marine Corps \nReserve after serving our country for over twenty years. During these \nyears, Lieutenant Colonel McMahon's reserve and active duty experience \nincluded service as a judge advocate, as well as a commanding officer \nof Rhode Island's Marine Corps Reserve transportation unit in Fields \nPoint and at the u.S. Naval War College.\n  Throughout his career, Lieutenant Colonel McMahon has been the \nrecipient of numerous commentary letters and awards, including the \n``Junior Officer of the Year'' award in 1979. He has been recommended \nfor the Navy Achievement, two Navy Commendations, a Meritorious Service \nMedal, and\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\nthe Navy-Marine Corps Medal. Finally, Lieutenant Colonel McMahon has \nserved as a prosecutor in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office \nfor the past nineteen years.\n  A native of Sicily, First Sergeant Thomas Scalavino came to the \nUnited States in 1960 and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1965. Without \nmuch time to spare, First Sergeant Scalavino participated in eighteen \noperations in the Republic of Vietnam from 1966 to 1967 as a rifleman \nin such military actions as Operations Big Horn and Operation Coyote.\n  In 1971, First Sergeant Scalavino was honorably discharged, but could \nnot stay away for long. He reenlisted in 1981 at Transport Company in \nProvidence, Rhode Island at the rank of Corporal. His responsibilities \nincluded: Administrative Chief, Platoon Sergeant, Platoon Commander, \nand Company First Sergeant. Later, First Sergeant Scalavino was sent to \nSouthwest Asia where he participated in Operation Desert Shield, \nOperation Desert Storm, and Operation Cease Fire. First Sergeant \nScalavino also has received the ``Navy Achievement Medal'' for his \nefforts as Motor Transport Officer in Ocean Venture 93.\n  Mr. President, I join with all Rhode Islanders in extending to \nColonel McCartney, Lieutenant Colonel McMahon, and First Sergeant \nScalavino our best wishes. Their contributions certainly will be \nremembered for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9622-1", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              140TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GALENA POST OFFICE\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a \nhistoric institution in the State of Illinois and the nation. On July \n30, 1999, the Galena Post Office will celebrate its 140th anniversary \nmaking it the longest continuously owned and operated post office in \nAmerica.\n  When the post office was founded, Galena was a thriving mining and \nport community in northwestern Illinois. The streets were bustling with \nminers, traders, dock workers, and trappers. Though a great deal has \nchanged since then, many of the original buildings remain standing in \nGalena's historic downtown district. Among these structures is the post \noffice.\n  The idea of the Galena Post Office was initiated by Congressman Elitu \nB. Washburne, a pre-Civil War era politician from Illinois. The funds \nfor the facility were authorized and appropriated by Congress on August \n18, 1856. Construction of the building began in 1857, when the first \nlimestone shipments for the edifice arrived via tow-boat. Upon the \ncompletion of the building's structure on August 3, 1859, the Weekly \nNorthwestern Gazette predicted, ``it will last 1,000 years with only \ntwo forces capable of destroying it, one being an earthquake and the \nother a mob.'' This newspaper was prophetic. The Galena Post Office has \noutlived every other United States post office. It continues to thrive \ntoday with a delivery area of more than 2800.\n  One hundred and forty years later, the Galena Post Office stands \nproudly in the center of town in the same condition as it was in 1859. \nIts 5947 square foot interior was the grand vision of architect Arni B. \nYoung. The two-story building is highlighted by an impressive limestone \nexterior. Mr. Young's plans included a civic meeting place with a grand \ncast-iron stairwell, mahogany interior, and arched windows to \ncomplement the lobby area.\n  The Galena Post Office served as not only a post office and a social \ncenter but also as a vital part of the community. The Smithsonian \nNational Postal Museum has bestowed Galena's post office with yet \nanother honor, The Great American Post Office Award. This month the \nmuseum will host an exhibit commemorating Galena's Post Office for its \noutstanding architectural features, historical significance to the \ncommunity, and outstanding record of service.\n  Mr. President, on Friday I will have the honor to share in the \ncelebration of the 140th anniversary of the Galena Post Office. It is \ntruly a remarkable accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/07/28/senate-section/article/S9622-2", "month": "07", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO THE HONORABLE ALAN KARCHER\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a man \nwho was a good friend and an extraordinary political mentor. I will \nmiss the opportunity to consult with him on matters important to \ngoverning. His contribution to me was a valuable one and it is deep in \nmy thought and functioning as a U.S. Senator. He was a superb role \nmodel for public service and I followed his judgement often. I am \nhonored to offer this tribute to former New Jersey Assembly Speaker \nAlan Karcher, his indomitable spirit, his unshakeable conviction, his \nwidespread talents, his love for politics in the widest sense, and his \ndevotion to the people of New Jersey.\n  Alan's death on July 27 at too young an age, was not totally \nunexpected--he had been battling cancer for several years--but the \nreality of it shocks all of us who knew him. And there are a lot of us \nwho fought in the trenches of New Jersey politics alongside him, as \nwell as those who fought in opposition. Alan used his considerable wit, \nintellect and spirit to master New Jersey politics, and all of us \nrespected him as the consummate politician. Alan was political in the \nmost classical sense of that word, with all of its ties to the Greek \nconcepts of the body politic, the people and citizenship, and he was \npolitical in the most modern sense of the word--sagacious, prudent, \nshrewd, and artful.\n  Alan saw elected office as public service and an honored and \nhonorable family tradition. Both his father, Joseph Karcher, and a \ngreat-uncle, John Quaid, also served in the New Jersey Assembly. When \nAlan followed them in 1974, he honed the practice of legislating to a \nfine art, serving as both Assembly Majority Leader and as Speaker \nduring his sixteen-year career. He was a master of strategy in the \nservice of the principal of the common good. He was articulate, \npassionate, and so often right, that more times than not he was able to \nconvince both natural allies and skeptics alike.\n  Alan was a fiercely proud Democrat who believed wholeheartedly that \n``government'' and ``the people'' were virtually synonymous concepts. \nHe knew how to keep his ``eye on the prize,'' and he understood that \n``the prize'' was responsive, responsible government. Alan did nothing \nby halves and when he believed in something it was with total \nengagement. His interests and his talents spanned an extraordinary \nrange. This most political of men was also a sensitive and accomplished \nmusician, a cellist and an opera-lover who could sing Italian arias \nperhaps not as well as Pavarotti, but certainly as energetically.

The text follows:\n\n                                 S. 305\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Professional boxing differs from other major, \n     interstate professional sports industries in the United \n     States in that it operates without any private sector \n     association, league, or centralized industry organization to \n     establish uniform and appropriate business practices and \n     ethical standards. This has led to repeated occurrences of \n     disreputable and coercive business practices in the boxing \n     industry, to the detriment of professional boxers nationwide.\n       (2) Professional boxers are vulnerable to exploitative \n     business practices engaged in by certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies which dominate the sport. Boxers do not \n     have an established representative group to advocate for \n     their interests and rights in the industry.\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\n       (3) State officials are the proper regulators of \n     professional boxing events, and must protect the welfare of \n     professional boxers and serve the public interest by closely \n     supervising boxing activity in their jurisdiction. State \n     boxing commissions do not currently receive adequate \n     information to determine whether boxers competing in their \n     jurisdiction are being subjected to contract terms and \n     business practices which may be violative of State \n     regulations, or are onerous and confiscatory.\n       (4) Promoters who engage in illegal, coercive, or unethical \n     business practices can take advantage of the lack of \n     equitable business standards in the sport by holding boxing \n     events in states with weaker regulatory oversight.\n       (5) The sanctioning organizations which have proliferated \n     in the boxing industry have not established credible and \n     objective criteria to rate professional boxers, and operate \n     with virtually no industry or public oversight. Their ratings \n     are susceptible to manipulation, have deprived boxers of fair \n     opportunities for advancement, and have undermined public \n     confidence in the integrity of the sport.\n       (6) Open competition in the professional boxing industry \n     has been significantly interfered with by restrictive and \n     anti-competitive business practices of certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies, to the detriment of the athletes and the \n     ticket-buying public. Common practices of promoters and \n     sanctioning organizations represent restraints of interstate \n     trade in the United States.\n       (7) It is necessary and appropriate to establish national \n     contracting reforms to protect professional boxers and \n     prevent exploitative business practices, and to require \n     enhanced financial disclosures to State athletic commissions \n     to improve the public oversight of the sport.\n       (8) Whereas the Congress seeks to improve the integrity and \n     ensure fair practices of the professional boxing industry on \n     a nationwide basis, it deems it appropriate to name this \n     reform in honor of Muhammad Ali, whose career achievements \n     and personal contributions to the sport, and positive impact \n     on our society, are unsurpassed in the history of boxing.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to protect the rights and welfare of professional \n     boxers by preventing certain exploitative, oppressive, and \n     unethical business practices they may be subject to on an \n     interstate basis;\n       (2) to assist State boxing commissions in their efforts to \n     provide more effective public oversight of the sport; and\n       (3) to promoting honorable competition in professional \n     boxing and enhance the overall integrity of the industry.\n\n     SEC 4.
