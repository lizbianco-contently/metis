The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n96, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between and among the \n     several States by providing for the orderly resolution of \n     disputes arising out of computer-based problems related to \n     processing data that includes a two-digit expression of the \n     year's date.\n\n  Pending:\n       McCain amendment No. 608, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Bennett (for Murkowski) amendment No. 612, to require \n     manufacturers receiving notice of a Y2K failure to give \n     priority to notices that involve health and safety related \n     failures.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased with the progress we have \nmade thus far on this bill. We have limited the number of remaining \namendments, and I am hopeful we will be able to reach agreement as to \ntime agreements on the remaining amendments so we can conclude \nconsideration of this important legislation.\n  I am also pleased we have turned back two attempts to emasculate the \nlegislation. Those critical votes encouraged me that the Senate will be \nable to pass meaningful and effective legislation regarding the top \npriority issue for the broadest possible cross-section of the Nation's \neconomy.\n  The ongoing fight between the welfare of the Nation's economy and the \ntrial lawyers is going to reach additional crucial votes on amendments \ntoday and in final passage. Over the past few weeks, I have waited to \nhear rational, logical reasons for defeating this legislation or for \ngutting it with more compromises. I have heard none.\n  S. 96, with the substitute amendment offered, represents a reasonable \nand effective means of addressing this important issue. It represents a \nsignificant compromise from the version of S. 96 which passed out of \nthe Commerce Committee, and even greater departure from H.R. 775 which \nwas recently passed by the other body. It truly incorporates bipartisan \ndiscussion, negotiation, and compromise. While ensuring it is not mere \nwindow dressing or mirage, there is nothing in this bill which should \nbe objectionable to any of my colleagues who truly want a solution to \nthe Y2K problem rather than an excuse to protect the litigation \nindustry. This matter is of utmost importance to the broadest cross-\nsection of American commerce imaginable. Accounting, banking, \ninsurance, energy, utilities, retail, wholesale, high tech, large and \nsmall, all support this effort to prevent and remedy Y2K problems and \nto avoid a disastrous litigation quagmire. They are unanimous and \nsteadfast in their support for S. 96 with the Wyden and Dodd \nagreements.\n\n  As opponents, we have the trial lawyers, a cost center in our \neconomy. The interests of the trial lawyers are clearly to assure a \ncontinued income stream from Y2K litigation. I have been told that over \n500 law firms have established practice specialties to handle\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nY2K litigation. Many of these firms are reportedly touring the country \ndredging for clients. Opportunistic legislation costs the economy \nmoney, time, and resources which then cannot be expended on value-added \nproductivity.\n  As I have stated several times during this debate, the cost of \nsolving the Y2K problem is staggering. Experts have estimated that \nbusinesses in the United States alone will spend $50 billion in fixing \naffected computers, products, and systems. But what experts have also \nconcluded is that the real problems in costs associated with Y2K may \nnot be the January 1 failures but the lawsuits filed to create problems \nwhere none exist.\n  An article in USA Today on April 28 by Kevin Maney sums it up. I \nquote:\n\n       Experts have increasingly been saying the Y2K problem won't \n     be so bad, at least relative to the catastrophe once \n     predicted. Companies and governments have worked hard to fix \n     the bug. Y2K-related breakdowns expected by now have been \n     mild to nonexistent. For the lawyers, this could be like \n     training for the Olympics, then having the games called off. \n     The concern, though, is that this species of Y2K lawyer has \n     proliferated and now it's got to eat something. If there \n     aren't enough legitimate cases to go around, they may dig \n     their teeth into anything. In other words, lawyers might make \n     sure Y2K is really bad even if it's not.\n\n  I am looking forward to continued debate on the merits of this bill \nwith those who do object to it. I look forward to voting on other \namendments and bringing this critical legislation to a successful \nconclusion.\n  I believe the two votes we took yesterday, one on the Kerry amendment \nand one on the Leahy amendment, clearly indicate the position of the \nsignificant majority of this body, because those two were very critical \namendments. Both of them would have had a significant effect on this \nlegislation--obviously, in my view, a significant weakening effect.\n  I thought the debate we had yesterday, especially with the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts but also with others, was a very important and \nvaluable debate and contributed to the knowledge and information of all \nMembers of the Senate. We intend very soon to propose a couple of \namendments that have been agreed to by both sides, but at this time, \nwith the absence of the minority in the Chamber, we will wait for that \nto happen.\n  I want to quote from a statement of ``Administration Policy'' \nconcerning this legislation.\n\n       The administration strongly opposes S. 96 as reported by \n     the Commerce Committee, as well as the amendment intended to \n     be proposed by Senators McCain and Wyden as a substitute. The \n     administration's overriding concern is that S. 96 is amended \n     by the McCain-Wyden amendment . . .\n\n  Actually, it is McCain-Wyden-Dodd--\n\n     . . . will not enhance readiness, and may in fact decrease \n     the incentives organizations have to be ready to assist \n     customers and business partners to be ready for the \n     transition of the next century. This measure would protect \n     defendants in Y2K actions by capping punitive damages and by \n     limiting the extent of their liability to their proportional \n     share of damages, but would not link these benefits to those \n     defendants' efforts to solve their customers Y2K problems \n     now. As a result, S. 96 would reduce the liability these \n     defendants may face, even if they do nothing, and accordingly \n     undermine their incentives to act now when the damage due to \n     Y2K failures can still be averted or minimized.\n\n  I have to admit, as a member of the opposition, that I have seen some \nfairly tortured logic associated with messages of veto threats by the \nadministration. I am not sure I have ever seen such tortured logic as \nis embodied in this particular paragraph I just described.\n  One of the fundamental facts that has been ignored--obviously must \nhave been ignored in this message from the Executive Office of the \nPresident, OMB--is that these companies and corporations that are all \nsupporting this legislation are both plaintiffs and defendants. In \nother words, many of these companies will be bringing suit themselves \nor seeking to have others fix their Y2K problems and may bring it to \ncourt if that is not the case.\n  When we are talking about this legislation, at least according to the \nadministration, S. 96 would reduce the liability these defendants face, \neven if they do nothing, and accordingly undermine their incentives to \nact now. One would have to have one's curiosity aroused as to why \npeople who are prospective plaintiffs would limit their ability \nwillingly to seek redress and to repair any problems associated with \ntheir business.\n  From the Clinton administration there is a ``Background Paper'' from \nPPI, the Progressive Policy Institute, entitled ``Avoiding the Y2K \nLawsuit Frenzy, Ensuring Y2K Liability Fairness.'' I would like to \nquote from that. The authors are Robert Atkinson and Joseph Ward.\n\n       While the Clinton Administration has voiced support for \n     some of the broad goals found in these bills, it has \n     expressed serious reservations about certain provisions, in \n     part on the grounds that their scope is unprecedented and \n     that it is not fair to limit liability for firms in this or \n     any circumstance. As discussed below, some of its concerns \n     should be addressed in revised legislative language, but the \n     overall concept of a fair liability regime is still very \n     necessary in this case. It is important to recognize that the \n     Year 2000 is a one-time event that appropriately deserves a \n     one-time solution.\n\n  That seems to have been ignored by the administration. In three \nyears, this legislation sunsets. Then we go back. No matter how zealous \nan advocate I happen to be for raw tort reform and product liability \nreform, the fact is that this legislation will be over 3 years from \nnow.\n\n       The goal of public policy in cases like this should be the \n     side of innovation and economic growth, and not on the side \n     of predatory legal practices that seek to harvest the fruits \n     of others' labor. In this regard, the bills mentioned above \n     are similar to the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act \n     that the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI) supported in \n     1995, which sought to reduce litigation that would harm \n     economic growth or raise the cost of goods and services for \n     most Americans. However, while PPI believes that some Y2K \n     liability-limiting legislation is needed and that these bills \n     provide a useful framework for action, there are certain \n     aspects in each of the bills that appear to err too far in \n     favor of potential defendants. In particular, it appears that \n     some of the restrictions on who can recover both punitive \n     damages and compensatory damages for economic loss may \n     exclude individuals who suffer losses resulting from a \n     defendant's reckless disregard or fraudulent behavior. In \n     order to ensure that effective liability-limiting legislation \n     passes Congress with required bipartisan support, both sides \n     of the aisle should work together to responsibly and fairly \n     address these issues.\n\n  Which we did address, thanks to Senator Wyden and Senator Dodd.\n  They:\n\n       Encourage remediation over litigation and the assignment of \n     blame;\n       Enact fair rules that reassure businesses that honest \n     efforts at remediation will be rewarded by limiting \n     liability, while enforcing contracts and punishing \n     negligence;\n       Promote Alternative Dispute Resolution; and\n       Discourage frivolous lawsuits while protecting avenues of \n     redress for parties that suffer real injuries.\n\n  Clearly, thanks to not just the original legislation but the changes \nthat we gladly accepted from Senator Wyden and Senator Dodd, we have \naddressed those concerns.\n  They go on to say:\n\n       The effects of abusive litigation could be further curbed \n     by restricting the award of punitive damages. Punitive \n     damages are meant to punish poor behavior and discourage it \n     in the future.\n\n  Everybody knows we will not have this problem again.\n\n       However, because this is a one-time event, the only thing \n     deterred by excessive punitive damages in Y2K cases would be \n     remediation efforts by businesses.\n       Except in cases of personal injury, punitive damages should \n     be awarded only if the plaintiff proves by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly acted with \n     ``reckless disregard.''\n\n  Except in cases of personal injury, punitive damages should be \nawarded only if the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence \nthat the defendant knowingly acted with reckless disregard.\n\n       In his last State of the Union Address, President Clinton \n     urged Congress to find solutions that would make the Y2K \n     problem the last headache of the 20th century, rather than \n     the first crisis of the 21st. Year 2000 liability legislation \n     needs to be a part of that effort. By promoting Y2K \n     remediation rather than unsubstantial and burdensome \n     litigation, we can begin the next millennium focused on \n     continuing this period of unprecedented economic growth, \n     instead of unproductively squabbling over the errors of the \n     past.\n\n  I want to point out again that already we are seeing a significant \ndrain on our economy just fixing these problems associated with Y2K. \nLater on I will include in the Record some of the expenses that a \nnumber of major corporations and small businesses have already been \nrequired to expend that otherwise could have been spent on far\n\n[[Page S6817]]\n\nmore productive and beneficial efforts, such as research and \ndevelopment, et cetera.\n  But if we add this burden, I am convinced, as are most economists, \nthat we can have a definite deadening effect on this unprecedented \neconomic prosperity we are experiencing thanks to the very nature of \nwhat we are trying to fix. Had it not been for this incredible \ninformation technology revolution we are going through, I know we would \nnot be in this period of unprecedented economic prosperity. That is why \nI think this legislation is so important. I think in some respects you \ncould rank this legislation among the most important that the Congress \nwill address this year.\n  Again, I thank my friend, Senator Wyden, and others on the other side \nof the aisle for joining together so we could obtain a significant \nmajority that I believe will now give us room for optimism that we can \npass this legislation today or, at the latest, early next week.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to pick up on a couple of points made by Chairman \nMcCain, and particularly on this matter of tackling the issue in a \nbipartisan way.\n  Certainly, when a consumer business gets flattened early in the next \ncentury as a result of a Y2K failure, they are not going to ask, is it \na Democratic failure or a Republican failure? They are going to say: I \nhave a problem. What is being done to fix it?\n  The central point we have been trying to make--Chairman McCain, and \nSenator Dodd, who is the Democratic leader of the Y2K effort, and I--is \nthat we have spent many weeks trying to tackle this in a bipartisan \nway.\n  The fact of the matter is that when the bill came out of the Senate \nCommerce Committee, we were not at that time able to come before the \nSenate and say we did in fact have a bipartisan bill.\n  As a result of the negotiations that have taken place for many weeks \nnow--led by Senator Dodd, our leader, Senator Feinstein of California \nwho has great expertise in this matter, and a variety of Democrats--we \nhave now a bill that has 11 major changes that assist consumers and \nplaintiffs in getting a fair shake with respect to any litigation which \nmay develop early in the next century.\n  These were all areas where a number of Members on the Democratic side \nof the aisle thought that the original Senate Commerce Committee bill \ncame up short. We went to Chairman McCain, and we said we would like to \nget a good bill; we would like to get a bill the President of the \nUnited States could sign; we would like to get a bipartisan bill.\n  We said we had a few bottom lines. One of them was that we were not \ngoing to change jurisprudence for all time; this was going to be a \ntime-limited bill. Chairman McCain agreed to our request that this last \nfor 36 months. This is a sunsetted piece of legislation. We insisted \nthis bill not apply to anybody who suffers a personal injury as a \nresult of a Y2K failure. If you are in an elevator or you suffer some \nother kind of grievous bodily injury as a result of a Y2K failure, all \nexisting tort remedies apply.\n  We took out all the vague defenses that some people in the business \ncommunity earlier thought were important. We said we are not going to \ngive somebody protection if they just say they made a reasonable effort \nto go to bat for a plaintiff or the consumer.\n  Those 11 major changes were made to try to be responsive to what the \nWhite House and a variety of consumer groups feel strongly about.\n  Frankly, the area I am most interested in, in public policy, is \nconsumer rights. I started with the Gray Panthers. I was director of \nthe Gray Panthers for 7 years before I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives, making sure that consumers got a fair shake and that \nthe little guy was in a position, if they got stuck in the marketplace, \nto have remedies. That is at the heart of my public service career.\n  I believe this is a balanced bill. This forces defendants to go out \nand cure problems for which they have been responsible. It also tells \nplaintiffs we would like them to mitigate damages; we would like them \nto figure out ways to hold down the cost; we should direct as much as \nwe possibly can to alternative dispute systems. Picking up on the theme \nof Chairman McCain, that is a bipartisan proposition. I think we have \nbeen responsive to key concerns that have been made by those with \nreservations about this bill.\n  There are some areas where we cannot go. I will emphasize as we move \nto today's debate a couple of those big concerns. We cannot allow under \nour legislation the creation of new Y2K torts that are not warranted on \nthe basis of the facts. We believe, in areas like the economic loss \nissue which was debated so intensely yesterday, that the appropriate \nremedies involve State contract law. When consumers are faced with \neconomic losses, we want to see them get a fair shake in this area, and \nwe believe State contract law should govern.\n  What we are not able to do is allow those who believe State contract \nlaw is inadequate with respect to economic losses, we cannot support \nthem repackaging those claims as new Y2K torts. We favor the status \nquo. With respect to economic losses, we want to see consumers \nprotected in the right of contract. However, this Member of the Senate \nthinks it would be a big mistake to create on the floor of the Senate \ntoday and in the days ahead new Y2K torts, new tort claims, that don't \nexist today under current law.\n\n  I am very hopeful that we are able to finish this legislation today. \nIt is bipartisan legislation now as a result of the 11 changes that \nhave been made. I am very hopeful the White House will not veto this \nlegislation. I have said repeatedly that to veto a responsible bill is \njust like lobbing a monkey wrench into the technology engine that is \ndriving the Nation's prosperity. That is what is going to be the real \neffect of vetoing a responsible bill in this area.\n  We continue to remain open to ideas and suggestions from colleagues. \nWe want this bill signed. We have made, as I say, 11 major changes \nsince this bill left the Senate Commerce Committee on a bipartisan \nbasis under the leadership of Senator Dodd, who is the Democratic \nleader on the Y2K issue. There are areas where we cannot go, such as \nthe creation of new Y2K torts in this area.\n  I look forward to today's debate and am anxious to continue to work \nwith colleagues in a bipartisan way. I am very optimistic that the bill \nthe Senate hopefully will pass today will get the support of the White \nHouse.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 612, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Murkowski, I send a \nmodification to amendment No. 612.\n  It is my understanding this amendment is acceptable to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment will be so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 612), as modified, is as follows:\n       Section 7(c) of the bill is amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       (5) Priority.--A prospective defendant receiving more than \n     1 notice under this section may give priority to notices with \n     respect to a product or service that involves a health or \n     safety related Y2K failure.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 612), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I move to table the motion.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, there is no question that the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the distinguished \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, have done yeomen work in alerting the \nland with respect to the potential Y2K changeover as of January 1, \n2000. Pursuant to their diligent work, we have had hearings in\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\nseveral of the committees. We have had laws passed now that allowed the \nparties to communicate with each other without fear of antitrust \nviolations so they could go ahead and work to make sure that everyone \nwas Y2K compliant.\n  I only came to the floor just momentarily, hearing about predatory \nlaw exercises, exercises of predatory law practices and otherwise you \nget what you get under the contract. The atmosphere or environment is \ntotally out of sorts. We are hearing about a litigious society. The \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut again and again said, and I \nnoted the expressions I was looking for in the morning Record: \n``running to the courthouse,'' ``race to the courthouse,'' ``rushing to \nthe courthouse,'' on and on. Again: ``shopping around to find someone \nwith deep pockets,'' ``glitches.''\n  I have a glitch on my computer right now, and I know they have deep \npockets, but I am not rushing to the courthouse. People who have \ncomputers want to do business. They rely on the computers for the \nprocedures and the progress of their interests. Having practiced law \nactively in the courtroom for 20 years, I can tell you nobody rushes to \nthe courthouse. Try a rush beginning this afternoon and you will find \nyourself standing in line. All the civil dockets and criminal dockets \nare full.\n  This panorama and environment painted by the proponents of this \nlegislation is all out of sorts with reality. Tort claims are down. All \nthe surveys we have had at the hearings show that tort claims are down. \nIt is a litigious society. Everybody is suing everybody for sex \ndiscrimination or age discrimination or racial discrimination and \nvarious other suits that were unheard of 30 years ago and are now \nabundant on the docket. But with respect to claims, tort claims, if \nthis afternoon I brought a summons and complaint on behalf of my \ndistinguished chairman, I would be lucky if I could get to the \ncourthouse during the year 1999. That is the reality.\n  Incidentally, the cases they talk about--litigious, frivolous cases \nand spurious charges and those kinds of things--and trial lawyers, they \ntry to fit trial lawyers in there like they prey; ``predatory'' is the \nword used by my chairman. Trial lawyers have no time for fanciful or \nspurious claims whatsoever. They know when they get the client, the \nclient does not have any money for billable hours. On the contrary, the \nclient principally has to rely on the lawyer's faith in the claim of \nthe client in order to take care of all the charges, all the expenses \nof interrogatories, discovery, the pleadings, the filings, the motions, \nthe trial itself. And when you come to verdicts, mind you me, those who \nbring the claim have to get all 12 jurors by a greater weight or the \npreponderance of the evidence making that finding; 11 to 1 is a \nmistrial. So you have to get all 12 and you have to be sure there is no \nerror within the trial.\n  All along, the expenses are taken care of. That is what nonpluses \nthis particular individual Senator, in the sense I am surrounded here \nin the District of Columbia with 60,000 billable hour boys running \naround talking about ``litigious society,'' ``predatory practices,'' \n``rushing to the courthouse,'' ``racing to the court,'' ``running to \nthe courthouse,'' ``shopping around.'' Here is 59,000 lawyers \nregistered to practice in the District of Columbia who will never see a \ncourthouse. They will see a Congress. They will see you and me, the \njurors. We are supposed to be fixed, so they work on fixing juries and \nrunning around spreading rumors and doing a favor here and getting a \nfavor there. So that is the real world we live in.\n  But to paint this legislation as doing away with predatory practices \nand racing to the courthouse and running to the courthouse? You have a \n$10,000 or $20,000 computer, if you are a doctor and you have a \ncomputer, and you want it fixed. You do not want a trial. They have \nmade it so you are bound to go out of business and not get a lawyer, if \nyou cannot get any damages, economic damages.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oregon, again and again and again, \nsays: Get what the contract says, get what the contract says, billable \nhours, get what the contract says. If you go buy a computer and get a \nwarranty--and that is the contract--it is only for a certain period of \ntime and everybody reads that warranty quick. Who says anything about \neconomic damages? It will say something about a sound article for a \nsound price and they will give you some repairs after you stand in \nline, and so forth. But with respect to your standing in line and \nwaiting, under this bill for 90 days, you are broke. You are out of \nbusiness. You are closed down. You have lost your customers. This is a \nfast-moving world in which we live and small business, with all the \ncompetition, does not have in-house counsel on retainer, on billable \nhours, just as all the computer companies do that are force-feeding \nthis particular measure.\n  That is why the Senator from South Carolina gets annoyed with the \nentire thrust of the measure.\n  With respect to its needs, let's go to the record. Under the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, all publicly listed companies, \nthrough their 10(k) reports to the SEC, give notice to the stockholders \nof the state of readiness, the worst case scenario, or the risk \ninvolved, the contingency plans to comply with any potential Y2K \nproblem, and the cost. Many of them, most all of them--I do not know \nany privately. I talked with the gentleman from Yahoo. Four years ago, \nhe was a Stanford student, and now he is well along the way. I admire \nhim because, unlike AOL, America Online, that everybody is hugging and \nloving around here, dining and wining and traveling out to Virginia, \nYahoo does not charge. America Online is trying for a monopoly. The \ncable folks have around 300,000 to 400,000; America Online has 17 \nmillion, and their push for openness, openness, openness means: Let me \nmake sure I retain my monopoly.\n  In any event, all of these are publicly held companies and they are \nburdened with that duty, and this has been going on. We act like \neverything with Y2K is going to happen tomorrow. The bill gives them 90 \ndays. We are going to give them 180 days. Tell them to go ahead and fix \nit. Call up everybody now; test it; find out if it is Y2K compliant.\n  I look forward to meeting some of these company people later today. \nCisco Systems, as of December 1998, a year and a half ago: Current \nproducts are largely compliant in their 10(k) report to the SEC.\n  Yes, here it is. Dell Computer. Here is a distinguished gentleman who \nhas made a tremendous success. He deserves every bit of credit. I am \nnot talking in a cursory or derogatory fashion. I am talking in an \nadmiring fashion. I love success and particularly business success. I \ngive him every bit of respect. Dell Computer, as of December 14, 1998, \nin their report: All products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K \ncertified, I say to the Senator from Oregon. I want him to hear that. \nWe have it here. Dell Computer, one of the best, as of December 14, \n1998, all products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K certified.\n  General Electric: A complete analysis of the microprocesses; Y2K \ncompliant as of November 12, 1998.\n  Intel Corporation: The company has assessed the ability of its \nproducts to handle the Y2K issue and developed the list, published it \nand support follows. As of November 10, 1998, they will be in \ncompliance. Deployment, integration tested, will be completed by mid-\n1999.\n  I do not have their mid-1999 report, but that is what they reported \nto their stockholders. That is where lawyers look at these things.\n  Incidentally, this Senator voted for the Securities and Exchange \nCommission reform with respect to the excessive reading of these \nfilings and bringing any and every charge as a result of 10(k) filings. \nWe did not want to require the filing and just lay the groundwork for \npredatory legal practices. I helped the distinguished Senator, Nancy \nKassebaum, pass the airplane tort liability bill. I have been on both \nsides of this fence. But they have me categorized, and I love it.\n  The truth is, Yahoo systems are currently Y2K compliant in all \nrespects. That is February 26, 1999.\n  Even writing a book with respect to this is very interesting. The \nbook, to be published later on this summer, by Eamonn Fingleton, is \n``In Praise of Hard Industries.'' I quote from page 65:\n\n       A major part of the problem is that corporate America's top \n     executives have not been monitoring their information \n     technology departments as closely as they should. As Paul A. \n     Strassmann has pointed\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\n     out, the millennium problem, for instance, is stunning \n     evidence of ``managerial laxity.'' In his book, The \n     Squandered Computer, Strassmann comments: ``There is \n     absolutely no justification for allowing this condition to \n     burst to executive attention at this late stage.''\n       According to Strassmann, a former chief information officer \n     of Xerox Corporation, the computer software industry should \n     have started getting ready for the new millennium by the \n     early 1970s, if not the mid-1960s. He gives short shrift to \n     the software industry's excuse that the millennium bug arose \n     because programmers were legitimately concerned about \n     economizing on computer space. He maintains that such \n     economizing was justifiable only in the very earliest days of \n     computerization, the era of punched cards, which ended in the \n     mid-1960s. ``The insistence on retaining for more than thirty \n     years a calendar recording system that everyone knew would \n     fail after December 31, 1999, is inexcusable management.''\n\n  There you go. Here they come up with Chicken Little, the sky is \nfalling, predatory law practice, racing to, running to the courthouse, \nwhoopee to the courthouse, a total fanciful background that does not \nexist.\n  Let me come up to date. What is this? I never have read it before, \nbut I learn. The May 1999 issue of Institutional Investors. This crowd \ndoes nothing but make money and sit around and punch. The article, on \npage 31, ``Y2K? Why not?''.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                             Y2K? Why Not?\n\n       The millennium draws near, with no shortage of dire \n     prognostications. The Y2K computer bug, depending on which \n     Cassandra is consulted, may bring widespread power outages, \n     transportation foul-ups, even economic hardship. Duetsche \n     Bank Securities chief economist Edward Yardeni, for example, \n     believes there's a 70 percent chance that a recession--most \n     likely severe and yearlong--will hit in 2000, all because so \n     many computers will, at the stroke of midnight, think they're \n     entering the 20th century.\n       These worries notwithstanding, most U.S. companies appear \n     to believe they have the Y2K problem licked. A resounding \n     88.1 percent of the chief financial officers responding to \n     this month's CFO Forum expect that their companies will make \n     the transition to the next century without any computer \n     problems. Just as important, CFOs know that outside contacts \n     must be ready as well, and 95.2 percent say they have worked \n     with suppliers to that end. Nearly 73 percent of respondents \n     are convinced that their suppliers and clients will be \n     prepared for the year 2000; only 4.8 percent worry that \n     suppliers or clients won't be ready.\n       Such is the CFO's confidence that 62.7 percent of \n     respondents believe that fears of a millennial computer \n     crisis are overblown. And as for those predictions of \n     economic recession, not a single CFO responding to the survey \n     agrees. Admits economist Yardeni, ``I seem to be the only one \n     on this planet who thinks we'll have any chance of a \n     recession, let alone a severe one.'' He suspects that CFOs \n     are relying too much on their tech departments' reassurances. \n     ``I wish there was more verification of these happy tales the \n     CFOs are reporting.''\n       Time will tell.\n       Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are \n     prepared to make the year-2000 transition without problems?\n       Yes: 88.1%\n       No: 6.0%\n       Not sure: 6.0%\n\n       Have you done a dry run of your computer systems for the \n     year-2000 transition?\n       Yes: 80.2%\n       No: 19.8%\n\n       If yes, how did they fare?\n       No problems: 12.1%\n       Few problems: 86.4%\n       Major problems: 1.5%\n\n       What have you done to prepare for the year-2000 transition?\n       Tested all systems: 87.3%\n       Rewrote computer code: 81.9%\n       Hired consultants: 75.9%\n       Bought new software: 86.7%\n       Bought new hardware: 74.7%\n       Worked with suppliers to ensure preparedness: 95.2%\n       Alerted customers to your preparations: 81.9%\n       Informed the Securities and Exchange Commission of your \n         actions: 62.7%\n       Solicited legal advice: 47.0%\n\n       Do you think most of your company's suppliers or clients \n     will make the year-2000 transition without trouble?\n       Yes: 72.6%\n       No: 4.8%\n       Not sure: 22.6%\n\n       What parts of your financial operations are vulnerable to \n     year-2000 problems?\n       Billing and payment systems: 66.0%\n       Accounting and financial reporting: 58.5%\n       Cash management: 60.4%\n       Foreign exchange: 22.6%\n       Pension management: 34.0%\n       Payment to bondholders or shareholders: 13.2%\n       Risk management: 20.8%\n       Corporate growth and acquisitions: 13.2%\n       Capital-raising plans: 5.7%\n\n       How much money has your company spent preparing for the \n     year-2000 transition?\n       Less than $500,000: 11.0%\n       $500,000 to $999,999: 6.1%\n       $1 million to $2.49 million: 4.9%\n       $2.5 million to $4.9 million: 20.7%\n       $5 million to $9.9 million: 12.2%\n       $10 million to $14.9 million: 8.5%\n       $15 million to $19.9 million: 4.9%\n       $20 million to $29.9 million: 11.0%\n       $30 million to $50 million: 11.0%\n       More than $50 million: 9.8%\n\n       Did the cost of preparing for the year-2000 transition have \n     a material impact on your company's business or financial \n     performance in 1998?\n       Yes: 16.9%\n       No: 83.1%\n\n       Do you expect it to have a material impact in 1999?\n       Yes: 10.8%\n       No: 85.5%\n       Don't know: 3.6%\n\n       Do you expect Y2K transition problems to have a material \n     impact on your company's business or financial performance \n     next year?\n       Yes: 3.6%\n       No: 89.2%\n       Don't know: 7.2%\n\n       Do you think the fears of a year-2000 crisis are overblown?\n       Yes: 62.7%\n       No: 21.7%\n       Don't know: 15.7%\n\n       What effect do you think year-2000 transition problems will \n     have on U.S. business and the U.S. economy overall?\n       Relatively no effect: 14.3%\n       A few weeks of headaches: 44.2%\n       A few months of headaches: 37.7%\n       A minor drop in GDP: 3.9%\n       A major drop in GDP: 0.0%\n       Economic recession: 0.0%\n\n       The results of CFO Forum are based on quarterly surveys of \n     a universe of 1,600 chief financial officers. Because of \n     rounding, responses may not total 100 percent.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n       These worries notwithstanding, most U.S. companies appear \n     to believe they have the Y2K problem licked. A resounding \n     88.1 percent of the chief financial officers responding to \n     this month's CFO Forum expect that their companies will make \n     the transition to the next century without any computer \n     problems. Just as important, CFOs know that outside contacts \n     must be ready as well, and 95.2 percent say they have worked \n     with suppliers to that end. Nearly 73 percent of the \n     respondents are convinced that their suppliers and clients \n     will be prepared for the year 2000; only 4.8 percent worry \n     that suppliers or clients won't be ready.\n\n  Now we are going to change 200 years of tort law for 4.8 percent that \nstill have 180 days, and the law does not give them but 90. So they \nmust think something can happen in 90 days. We can double that. You \nlike 90; I give you 180. Start right now. You don't have to do that. \nThe market will take care of it, as Business Week says it is doing.\n  I quote further:\n\n       Such is the CFOs' confidence that 62.7 percent of \n     respondents believe that failures of a millennial computer \n     crisis are overblown. And as for those predictions of \n     economic recession, not a single CFO responding to the survey \n     agrees.\n\n  This prediction had been made some months back, last year sometime by \nYardeni, a respected economist. I remember the gentleman because I was \nat the hearings when he used to be with Chase Manhattan. He talked that \nit could even cause a recession.\n\n       Not a single CFO responding to the survey agrees with that. \n     Admits economist Yardeni, ``I seem to be the only one on this \n     planet who thinks we'll have any chance of a recession, let \n     alone a severe one.''\n\n  Tell Yardeni to come to the Congress. The majority around here knows \nwe are going to have a recession--predatory practices, racing to the \ncourthouse. There would just be a jam to get the business.\n  I quote:\n\n       He suspects that CFOs are relying too much on their tech \n     departments' reassurances. ``I wish there was more \n     verification of these happy tales * * *.''\n       Time will tell.\n\n  Here is the question that is printed in the particular article:\n\n       Do you feel your company's internal computer systems are \n     prepared to make the year-2000 transition without problems?\n\n  The answer is: 88.1 percent said yes; 6 percent said no.\n  Next question:\n\n       Have you done a dry run of your computer systems for the \n     year-2000 transition?\n\n  The answer is: 80.2 percent said yes; 19.8, no.\n  So four-fifths have already been testing as a result of the fine work \nby the Senator from Utah and the Senator\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nfrom Connecticut and, of course, our distinguished Senator on the \nJudiciary Committee, Chairman Hatch, and Senator Leahy of Vermont.\n  Then you go down there:\n  What have you done?\n  They have all kinds of things down here: 86 percent bought new \nsoftware. You see Dell and Intel and everybody else, they are \ncertifying that when the purchase is made, this is Y2K compliant. \nBusiness is business. They cannot be playing around with monkey shines \nwaiting on politicians in Washington to change the tort law. They have \ngood sense. That is why they are successful.\n\n       Do you expect the Y2K transition problems to have a \n     material impact on your company's business or financial \n     performance next year?\n\n  The answer: 3.6 percent said yes; 89.2 percent said no.\n\n       Do you think the fears of a year-2000 crisis are overblown \n     [in the business world]?\n\n  They give you a long list. You know how chambers of commerce work. \nThey are stupid enough, by gosh, to give me a medal this year for last \nyear when they are opposing me in the election. So don't tell me about \nthe Chamber of Commerce. You are looking at the fellow with the \nEnterprise Award from the National Chamber of Commerce. But last year I \ngot the stinkbomb. I can tell you that right now.\n  They send around letters and leaches and everything that I was \nterrible for business. So don't listen to all the letters about all of \nthose places. None of those State chambers of commerce is complaining. \nI notice they got one from South Carolina. They don't know from sic'em \ndown there about Y2K. That is one place.\n  You don't have to worry about what the State of North Carolina does. \nThey will be ready come next month. They had a recent article--just \nyesterday morning; I should have brought that to the floor--that they \nare all in shape and ready to go. But for all the cases, the best I \nhave heard, as my distinguished chairman mentioned, 80 cases--I have \nnot been able to find that. The best authority has said that is mixed \nin with some other cases.\n  The most recent information--and brought right up to date --is the \nletter a month ago by Ronald Weikers who appeared before our committee, \nan attorney at law. Let me qualify him. The gentleman says here in this \nletter:\n\n       I have studied the Y2K problem carefully from the legal \n     perspective, and have written a book entitled ``Litigating \n     Year 2000 Cases'', which will be published by West Group in \n     June. I frequently write and speak about the subject. I do \n     not represent any clients that have an interest in the \n     passage or defeat of any proposed Y2K legislation. Feel free \n     to call me, should you have any questions.\n\n  He starts off the letter:\n\n       Thank you for speaking with me earlier. Thirteen (13) of \n     the 44 Y2K lawsuits--\n\n  This is as of April 26--\n\n     Thirteen (13) of the 44 Y2K lawsuits that have been filed to \n     date have been dismissed entirely or almost entirely.\n\n  There is a court system, undescribed, or improperly described, by \nSenators on the floor of the Senate. The court generally does not have \nstumblebums just sitting up there and all rushing to the courtroom: Let \nme give you 12 people, and here is your money, and let's go. They test \nthe truth of all the allegations, and even agreeing with all your \nallegations, you still do not have a case in court.\n  Thirteen of them have already been dismissed.\n  Twelve (12) cases have been settled for moderate sums or for no \nmoney.\n  They are not deep-pocket cases.\n\n       The legal system is weeding out frivolous claims, and Y2K \n     legislation is therefore unnecessary.\n       Thirty-five (35) cases have been filed on behalf of \n     corporate entities, such as health care providers, retailers, \n     manufacturers, service providers and more. Nine (9) cases \n     have been filed on behalf of individuals. This trend will \n     continue. Thus, the same corporations that are lobbying \n     for Y2K legislation may be limiting their own rights to \n     recover remediation costs or damages.\n\n  That is signed by Ronald N. Weikers. We asked yesterday, and he has \nupdated the 44 to 50. He has added six more since that time, which we \nhave here for the record.\n  So there is all the law and the Securities and Exchange Commission \nrequiring that you notify your stockholders about any and all problems, \nand what are you doing about it, and the potential costs. And there is \nall of the debate in Congress, and the special law passed this year, \nand everything else like that.\n  Those who usually are on the side of corporate America--even the \nWashington Post says let's not just be jumping around passing laws. \nThat is the most irritating thing. I cannot get anything done with the \nbudget. Here we are spending over $200 billion more than we are taking \nin, and everybody is talking about: The surplus, the surplus, the \nsurplus. It is not just the $127 billion from Social Security, it is \nthe money from the Senators' retirement fund, the civil service \nretirement fund, the military retirees, the highway trust fund, the \nairport trust fund, the Federal Financing Bank. Medicare moneys are \nbeing used for Kosovo. Think of that, Senators.\n  But everybody is talking about whether we are going to have a \nspending cut or spending increase or tax cut because of the fat \nsurpluses. I hope they will bring that thing up. I cannot get anything \ndone about that. I can't get anything done about campaign finance. I \nwas here when we passed it in 1974, 25 years ago. It was a good law. It \ndid away with soft money, no cash, everything on top of the table, and \nlimited spending in elections. Senator Thurmond and I could have had \nabout 670,000 registered voters. Let's double it to 1\\1/2\\ million, 2 \nmillion. I just had to spend $5.5 million to come back here and make \nthis talk.\n  I can tell you here and now, this thing is outrageous, because I am \nspending all my time racing around the country. Talk about small \nbusiness. Raise in a year and a half to 2 years 5\\1/2\\ million with \nshares of stock in general at $100 a share. That is a pretty good \nbusiness. Don't tell this politician about small business. I am a small \nbusinessman. We had to raise that money, but it is a disgrace.\n  We can't get anything done. Fortunately, I supported McCain-Feingold. \nSenator McCain now has joined me on my constitutional amendment, one \nline: The Congress is hereby empowered to regulate or control spending \nin Federal elections. In fact, the States like it so much we added the \nStates are able to control spending in State elections. Thereby, we \nimmediately go back and we make constitutional the original act, or \nwhatever they want to do. It doesn't disturb McCain-Feingold. We can \nstill proceed with that and not hear the argument of the Senator from \nKentucky about whether it is issue oriented or candidate oriented. All \nthat is subjective. We will know, once we pass McCain-Feingold, it is \nconstitutional; that we hadn't wasted time.\n  That is what I want. Just give the Congress its will to get rid of \nthis cancer on the body politic. We can't get that done.\n  You can't get anything for the Patients' Bill of Rights. You can't \nget anything for the ultimate solution to Social Security. You can't \nget anything done about anything, but they come up with a nonproblem \nthat everybody, corporate America and everybody else, says, look, we \nhave been moving on. We have cut off our suppliers and everything else \nof that kind. Then you come to the floor with the overreach.\n  Well, last year we protected the consumers, and yesterday afternoon \nwe said no protection for the consumers. They said they won't get a \nlawyer. I can guarantee you, they won't get a good lawyer. A lawyer who \nis really working for a living would say: Wait a minute, businessman. \nYou come in here, you have to wait. You came in too quick. You have to \nwait 90 days before you really come in and get anything done.\n  In the meantime, they have been given notice so they are hiding all \nthe records. They learned something from Rosemary Woods and President \nNixon, I can tell you that. So the records are not around. They have \ncleaned up their records. So they know.\n  Otherwise, having waited that time, then you have to file; then you \nhave to get in line. You are waiting another year. Who is the lawyer \nwho is going to carry those expenses? He has other work to do.\n  So they are not going to be bringing any cases. You are not going to \nbe able to get a lawyer with this bill. That is what is going to \nprevent you from getting a lawyer, because there is no economic damage. \nThe economic damage, the real loss is not the $10,000 for the computer. \nIt is the million-dollar loss\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\nof customers and goodwill and the ability to serve and the loss of \nadvertising revenues and everything else going down.\n  My friend from Oregon says: Well, we give you what the contract says; \nthis bill will give you what the contract says.\n  Sure, it gives what the contract says. That is an oxymoron. We know \nit gives you what the contract says. But the contract doesn't contract \nfor economic loss. We are talking about misrepresentation, wrongful \nacts, fraudulent representation, tort--not contract. So don't give me \nthis stuff about the contract, and we are giving you exactly what the \ncontract says.\n  That is our complaint. We want what States all over the Nation, all \n50 States, give you right now, and we do not want to repeal that.\n  When we don't repeal it, then they come in in the next 180 days, the \nnext 6 months, and they go to work and they start getting something \ndone, because they realize this bill has either been killed in the \nCongress or vetoed by the President. They have to get right with the \nmarket world or get out of the way. That is the way free enterprise \nworks. It is a wonderful thing. We all talk about it.\n  By the way, don't give me this thing about the computer world created \nall of this productivity. Sure, it increases productivity. But what \nreally created this economy--we are not going to stand here and listen \ntime and time again--is the 1993 economic plan. Don't give the award to \nBill Gates; give it to Bob Rubin.\n  We were there. We had to struggle to get the votes. We had to bring \nin the Vice President to get the vote. They were saying over at the \nWhite House and at the Economic Council: Let us have a stimulus; we \nhave to have a stimulus. Rubin says: No, pay the bill.\n  What did we do? We paid the bill. We started paying off the bill. \nWith what? Increased taxes. With increased taxes on what? Social \nSecurity.\n  I voted for it. The Senator from Texas said: You voted for increased \ntaxes on Social Security. They will hunt you down in the streets and \nshoot you like dogs. That is what he said.\n  The other Senator, Mr. Packwood, said: I will give you my house, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, if this thing works.\n  Kasich, who is running for President, I am trying to find John. I \ndon't know whether he is running as a Democrat or Republican, because \nhe said: If this plan works, I will change parties and become a \nDemocrat.\n  We have the record. They are trying to subterfuge this as this \ncomputerization is moving overseas and asking for what? They want all \nthe special laws. They want capital gains. They are making too much \nmoney. So they have the onslaught: Wait, estate taxes, we ought not to \ndie and be taxed at the same time. So we have to change the formula for \nestate taxes. No, excuse me, immigrants. Don't pay Americans, just \nbring them all in. Let's have an exemption from the immigration laws. \nLet's have an exemption from the State tort laws. Let's do everything. \nLet's upset the world for the idle rich.\n  Come on, 22,000 millionaires for Bill Gates. I employ, by gosh, \ninstead, 200,000 textile workers at the mill. I would much rather have \nthat crowd. Fine for the IQ group, but I am talking about working \nAmericans, middle America, the backbone of our democratic society.\n  So what we have here is an onslaught for the computer world, for \ncapital gains, immigration laws, estate taxes, Y2K exemptions, any and \nevery thing. They have money. They have contributions. We would like to \nget their contributions. So Democrats and Republicans are falling all \nover each other trying to show what goody-goody boys we are. We will \nchange the State laws. We will take the rights away from consumers and \ninjured parties. We will destroy small businesses that bought a \ncomputer. They won't even be able to get a lawyer with all of this \nstringout of how to bring a case and everything else of that kind.\n  Saying, don't worry about it, it is only for 3 years, 3 years it will \nbe gone--if there is a crisis on January 1, it shouldn't exist for over \na year. Everybody will know within a year whether they are Y2K \ncompliant and be able to file. But no, they want to use this for \nfurther argument, and I gainsay the way they are shoving it now, not \nagreeing to economic damages in the Kerry amendment, turning down the \nLeahy amendment for consumers rights. I am afraid what I said was a \nfootprint for the Chamber of Commerce, but rather I think they really \nare on a forced drive for a veto because they can use that. Who vetoed \nproductivity, the great industry that brought all of this productivity \nto America? Who vetoed it?\n  I can see Vice President Gore trying to get up an answer to that one. \nThat is going to be very interesting.\n  Senator Hatch led the way with his bill last year, and we got \ntogether and started confronting this particular problem. As I speak--\nand I am ready to yield now to my distinguished colleague from North \nCarolina--they have not 90 days, but we are giving them twice that \namount. Put everybody on notice, this thing they tell me is on C-SPAN \nso everybody ought to know to get Y2K compliant, try it out, test your \nset. If it is not, go down and, by gosh, get it fixed now. Don't run to \nthe courthouse. Run to the computer salesman who sold you the thing, \nbecause they--Dell, Intel, Yahoo, all the rest of them--are coming in \nand saying that everything is Y2K compliant. We can't wait around for \nCongress to change all the tort laws.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I can't help but note the Senator from \nSouth Carolina mentioned Mr. Gates has 2,000 employees for \nmillionaires.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Twenty-two thousand. That is in Time magazine, the \nyear-end report. It is a wonderful operation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. There are 22,000 millionaires. I know our respective \nstaffs feel like millionaires for having had the opportunity of working \nhere in the Senate with us. I know I speak for all of our staffs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6821-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 886\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 619 to Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 619.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike Section 12 and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 12. DAMAGES IN TORT CLAIMS.\n\n       ``A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may only \n     recover for economic losses to the extent allowed under \n     applicable state or federal law in effect on January 1, \n     1999.''\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to deal \nwith section 12 of the McCain-Dodd-Wyden bill. Let me read it first to \nmake it clear what the amendment deals with. I am quoting from the \namendment now, and this would replace section 12 in the existing bill:\n\n       A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may only \n     recover for economic losses to the extent allowed under \n     applicable State or Federal law in effect on January 1, 1999.\n\n  We have drawn this amendment in the narrowest possible fashion, and \nwe did that for a number of reasons. Number one, there has been great \nconcern voiced on the floor of the Senate about allowing and continuing \nto enforce existing contracts under contract law. This amendment has no \nimpact on that whatsoever. The provisions in the McCain bill that \nprovide for the enforcement of contract law remain in place.\n  I also say to my colleagues that if this amendment is adopted in the \nvery narrow form in which it has been presented, all of the following \nthings, which I think many Members of the Senate want to support, \nremain present in this bill.\n  Punitive damages will remain capped. The bill will continue to apply \nto everyone--consumers and businessmen and businesswomen. Joint and \nseveral liability is completely gone. In other words, proportionate \nliability, which has been a subject of great discussion, remains in \nplace. The duty to mitigate remains in place. The 90-day waiting period \nremains in place. The limitations on class actions remain in place. The \nrequirements of specificity and materiality in pleadings remain in \nplace.\n  All of the things that have been discussed at great length and have \nbeen at the top of the list of what these folks have been trying to \naccomplish on behalf of the computer industry remain in place.\n  What this amendment is intended to do is close a loophole. It is a \nloophole that is enormous. Here is the reason. We will enforce, under \nthe provisions of the McCain bill, a contract. The problem is, there \nare millions and millions of computer sales that occur in this country \nevery year that are subject to no contract; there is no contract \nbetween the parties. Under the provisions of the McCain bill, as it is \npresently, if a consumer or a small businessperson purchases a \ncomputer, there is no written contract between the parties, which will \nbe true in the vast majority of cases; so there is no contract to \nenforce, there is no agreement between the parties on the specific \nterms of what can be recovered and what the limitations of those \nrecoveries are.\n  Let's suppose, in my example, that a blatant, fraudulent \nmisrepresentation has been made to the purchaser. Unless we do \nsomething to amend this section, since there is no contract in place, \nwe will put the purchaser in the position of being able to recover \nabsolutely nothing but the cost of their computer. For example, a small \nfamily-run business in a small town in North Carolina--Murfreesboro, \nNC--buys a computer system. There is no written contract of any kind \nbetween the parties. What happens is, their computer system doesn't \nwork; it is non-Y2K compliant. It turns out that the people who sold it \nto them knew it was non-Y2K compliant and, in fact, misrepresented when \nthey made the sale that it was Y2K compliant. So we have, in fact, what \nprobably is a criminal act in addition to everything else, a fraudulent \nmisrepresentation.\n  Unless this amendment is adopted, if that family business has lost \nrevenues, lost income, lost profits, while they continue to incur \noverhead, they are unable to recover even their out-of-pocket losses--\nthe money they have to actually pay as a result of their computer being \nnon-Y2K compliant--simply because there is no contract between the \nparties. That would be true even under the most egregious situation, \ni.e., where a fraud has occurred, where a misrepresentation has \noccurred, where a criminal act has occurred, even under those extreme \ncircumstances.\n  Unless this amendment is adopted in its very narrowly drawn form, \nthat purchaser, small businessperson or consumer, is limited to the \nrecovery of the cost of their computer, even though their family-owned \nbusiness, which has been in business forever, has been put out of \nbusiness, even though they have lost thousands of dollars in revenue, \neven though they have had to pay out of their pocket for losses that \nhave occurred as a result of a fraud committed against them. Even if \nthe defendant can be put in jail for their conduct, this small \nbusinessperson is out of business, and what they can recover against \nthis defendant is the cost of their computer.\n  There is a huge, huge loophole that exists in this bill as presently \ndrafted, and that loophole is for all those cases across America where \nthere is no contract. That is going to be true in the vast majority of \ncases. Most people don't have contracts. They go to the computer store \nand they buy a computer. Some computer salesman comes to their business \nor home and sells them a computer. So what we are left with is what \nhappens to those folks--the folks who don't have a contract, which is \ngoing to be the vast majority of Americans, businessmen, businesswomen, \nconsumers who have purchased computers. They are not going to have a \ncontract.\n  I will tell you who will have a contract. The folks who will have \ncontracts--therefore, their remedies will be clearly defined in the \ncontract--will be big businesses. That will be true of the computer \ncompanies who sell their products because they can afford to hire a big \nteam of lawyers to represent them and draft contracts for them. That \nwill be true of big corporate purchasers of computer systems who need \nthem in the operation of their business, such as Kaiser-Permanente and \nother big companies that use computers. The lawyers get together and \ndraft the contracts and everybody knows from the beginning what the \nresponsibilities of both the seller and the buyer are.\n  The problem we have is that it is not going to be the big guys who \nare going to be protected. It is the little guy who has absolutely no \nprotection. The only conceivable remedy they have is in tort.\n  What we did in this very narrowly drafted provision is say they can \nrecover economic losses only to the extent allowed already under State \nlaw or Federal law, which means that to the extent in Arizona there may \nbe a limitation, or in Utah, or in Oregon, a limitation on what folks \ncan recover and what they have to prove. There are some States that \nonly allow pure out-of-pocket losses to be recovered--not lost profits. \nThere are many States that have limitations on these things.\n  We create absolutely no cause of action, no tort claim. We create \nnothing that does not already exist. But we close the loophole. The \nloophole we close is for those millions and millions of Americans who \nwill not have a contract. It is just that simple. All the other \nprotections in this bill remain in place.\n  I want to say to my colleagues who have voted already against Senator \nKerry's amendment, who intend to vote on final passage for the McCain \nbill, that you can vote for this amendment very narrowly drawn which \ncloses the loophole that exists and still vote for the bill on final \npassage. I will not be doing that myself, because I think there are \nother problems in the bill. But this amendment does not create any \nproblem with that.\n\n[[Page S6823]]\n\n  I just want to point out a couple of things which were said yesterday \nduring the debate by my friend, Senator Wyden from Oregon.\n  He said:\n\n       I just think it would be a mistake given the extraordinary \n     potential for economic calamity in the next century to change \n     the law with respect to economic loss. We are neither \n     broadening it nor narrowing it. We are keeping it in place.\n\n  That is a verbatim quote.\n  This amendment couldn't be any clearer. All it does is keep existing \nState law in place for those people who do not have a contract. It is \nthat simple. If they have a contract, the contract is going to control \nbecause the section immediately preceding section 11 specifically \nrequires that the courts enforce the existing contract. But for all \nthose folks out there who do not have a contract and who may have been \nlied to, or who may have had misrepresentations made to them and are \nmaybe subject to criminal conduct, they have no remedy whatsoever under \nthis bill. That is the reason we have drawn it so narrowly.\n  Again, Senator Wyden pointed out yesterday that he believes they \nshould recover exactly what they are entitled to today, that the law is \nexactly what they are entitled to recover today, and there are numerous \nquotes throughout the day where Senator Wyden spoke to this issue.\n  What I say to my friend Senator Wyden is what I really believe we are \ndoing here. I know he expressed concern yesterday about creating causes \nof action, creating force in Senator Kerry's bill, and I understood \nthose concerns. What we have done is draft this in a way that can't \npossibly create anything. What it says is they may only recover for \neconomic losses to the extent allowed already under existing State \nor Federal law.\n\n  When you put that combination in with the provision immediately \npreceding it that requires contracts to be enforced, then I think what \nwe have done is closed a loophole, closed it in the narrowest possible \nfashion. Leave all the restrictions that already exist on economic \nrecovery in this country in place, deal with those millions of \nAmericans who could have been the subject of fraud, abuse, and \nmisrepresentation and allow them to recover, because otherwise they \nhave no possible way of recovering. They have no contract. But to the \nextent folks have a contract, we are going to enforce that contract. We \nare going to require that the courts enforce that contract.\n  I think this really dovetails perfectly with what I believe to be the \nintent of the McCain-Wyden bill.\n  The bottom line on this amendment is this: It is narrowly drawn. \nThose folks who intend to vote on final passage for the McCain bill can \nvote for this amendment perfectly consistent with their desire to do \neverything they can to protect the computer industry. But for that \nclass of people who have no contract, who have no cause of action \nwhatsoever, this creates nothing. It simply allows under existing law \nfor them to pursue whatever claim they have--only those people who have \nabsolutely no contract. If they have a contract, the contract is going \nto be enforced, and it ought to be enforced. I have no problem with \nthat whatsoever.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It is narrowly drawn. \nI think it is consistent entirely with the purposes of the McCain bill. \nIt leaves all the protections in place that the folks who support the \nMcCain bill believe in. It closes an enormous loophole that exists in \nthis law at the present time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my colleague, \nand I appreciate what he is trying to do. This bill is trying to \nresolve what really are unlimited litigation possibilities. If we don't \npass this bill, that could really wreck our computer industry and wreck \nour country and would make it even more difficult to get the computer \nindustry and everybody involved in Y2K problems to really resolve these \nproblems in advance of the year 2000.\n  I rise to oppose the Edwards amendment, which basically strikes the \neconomic loss section of S. 96, the Y2K bill.\n  I have followed carefully the debate of the bill. And, as of now, it \nis the Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Wyden substitute, S.1138, that we \nare now debating.\n  My observation is that during this debate there has been much \nconfusion over the economic loss section.\n  Let me attempt to clarify this matter.\n  It is important to note that the economic loss rule is a legal \nprinciple that has been adopted by the U.S. Supreme Court and by most \nStates.\n  The rule basically prevents ``tortification'' of contract law, the \ntrend that I view with some alarm.\n  The rule basically mandates that when parties have entered into \ncontracts and the contract is silent as to ``consequential damages,'' \nwhich is the contract term for economic losses, the aggrieved party may \nnot turn around and sue in tort for economic losses. Thus, the \nexpectation of the parties are protected from undue manipulation by \ntrial attorneys. The party under the rule may sue under tort law only \nwhen they have suffered personal injury or damage to property other \nthan the property in dispute.\n  The economic loss rule exists primarily or principally because of the \nimportance of enforcing contractual agreements. If the parties can \ncircumvent a contract by suing in tort for their economic losses, any \ncontract that allocates the risk between the parties becomes worthless.\n  The absence of the economic loss rule would hurt contractual \nrelations and create an economic and unnecessary economic cost to \nsociety as a whole. It would encourage suppliers to raise prices to \ncover all of the risks of liability and would encourage buyers to \nforego assurances as to the quality of the product or service. If \nanything goes wrong, simply sue the supplier under tort law.\n  The economic loss rule also reflects the belief that the parties \nshould not be held liable for the virtually unlimited yet foreseeable \neconomic consequences of their actions, such as the economic losses of \nall the people stuck in traffic in a car accident.\n  In light of this, most States apply the rule without regard to \nprivity, and the vast majority of States that have considered the rule \nhave applied it not only to products but to the services as well with \nsome exceptions for ``professional services,'' such as lawyers and \n``special relationships''.\n  Why then should Congress codify the economic loss rule with regard to \nY2K actions or litigation?\n  First, adopting the economic loss rule helps identify which parties \nhave the primary responsibility of ensuring Y2K compliance. It is one \nof the major goals of the Y2K legislation to encourage companies to do \nall they can to avoid and repair Y2K problems, and adoption of the \neconomic loss rule helps us to do exactly that.\n  Second, adoption of the economic loss rule preserves the parties' \nability to enter into meaningful contractual agreements and preserves \nexisting contracts. Parties who suffer personal injury or property \ndamage, other than to the property at issue, could still sue in tort, \nor in contract, while those suffering only economic damages would be \nable to sue in contract.\n  Third, adoption of the rule would strengthen existing legal \nstandards. We have the rule in this bill, and there is very good reason \nto have it in this bill.\n  By strengthening existing legal standards, we would avoid costly and \npotentially abusive litigation as a result of the Y2K failures.\n  That is what we are trying to avoid.\n  This bill only lasts 3 years. It then sunsets. The bill's purpose is \nto get through this particularly critical time without having the \nFederal courts and the State courts overwhelmed by litigation, yet at \nthe same time providing people with a means of overcoming some of these \nproblems. That is the whole purpose of this bill.\n  If this amendment is adopted, that whole purpose will be subverted. \nIt is not a loophole at all, as Senator Edwards contended. If we change \nthis rule and adopt this amendment, we surely will have courts clogged, \nwe surely will have undue and unnecessary litigation, and in the end we \nsurely are not accomplishing what we need to accomplish--encouraging \nthe companies to do what is right and to get the problems solved now. \nThat is what we want to do. This bill will do more toward getting that \ndone than anything I can think of.\n\n[[Page S6824]]\n\n  Lastly, adoption of the economic loss rule would establish a uniform \nnational rule applicable to Y2K actions. This would help to avoid the \npatchwork of State legal standards that would otherwise apply to Y2K \nproblems and actions. The subtle and complex idiosyncrasies and the \nrule's applications by the various States strongly indicate the need \nfor a uniform national rule with regard to Y2K actions.\n  Without a uniform rule, which we have in this amendment, every issue \nconcerning Y2K liability may have to be litigated in each different \nState. This increases the already enormous costs of Y2K litigation.\n  As I stated, the Supreme Court has adopted and endorsed the economic \nloss rule, which has greatly influenced State law. The leading case is \nEast River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc. In that case, the \ncompany that chartered several steamships sued the manufacturer of the \nship's turbine engines in tort for purely economic damages, including \nrepair costs and lost profits caused by the failure of the turbines to \nperform properly. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court denied \nrecovery in tort under the economic loss rule. The Court's ruling was \nbased in large part on the propriety of contract law over tort law in \ncases involving only economic loss.\n  The Court goes on to say:\n\n       The distinction that the law has drawn between tort \n     recovery for physical injuries and warranty recovery for \n     economic loss is not arbitrary and does not rest on the \n     ``luck'' of one plaintiff in having an accident causing \n     physical injury. The distinction rests, rather, on an \n     understanding of the nature of the responsibility a \n     manufacturer must undertake in distributing his products. \n     When a product injures only itself the reasons for imposing a \n     tort duty are weak and those for leaving the party to its \n     contractual remedies are strong . . . Contract law, and the \n     law of warranty in particular, is well suited to commercial \n     controversies of the sort involved in this case because the \n     parties may set the terms of their own agreements. The \n     manufacturer can restrict its liability, within limits, by \n     disclaiming warranties or limiting remedies. In exchange, the \n     purchaser pays less for the product . . .\n\n  The Court's ruling was also based on the fact that allowing recovery \nin tort would extend the turbine manufacturer's liability indefinitely:\n\n       Permitting recovery for all foreseeable claims for purely \n     economic loss could make a manufacturer liable for vast sums. \n     It would be difficult for a manufacturer to take into account \n     the expectations of persons downstream who may encounter its \n     product. In this case, for example, if the charterers--\n     already one step removed from the transaction [which included \n     the shipbuilder in between]--were permitted to recover their \n     economic losses, then the companies that subchartered the \n     ships might claim their economic losses from delays, and the \n     charterers' customers also might claim their economic losses, \n     and so on. ``The law does not spread its protections so \n     far.''\n\n  Let me turn to state law cases. The leading case on this issue is \nHuron Tool and Engineering Co. v. Precision Consulting Services, Inc., \n532 N.W.2d 541 (Mich. Ct. App. 1995). In Huron, the Michigan Court of \nAppeals held that the Economic Loss Rule barred plaintiff's fraud claim \nagainst a computer consulting company to recover purely economic loss \ncaused by alleged defects in a system provided under contract. The \ncourt explained:\n\n       The fraudulent representations alleged by plaintiff concern \n     the quality and characteristics of the software system sold \n     by defendants. These representations are indistinguishable \n     from the terms of the contract and warranty that plaintiff \n     alleges were breached. Plaintiff fails to allege any \n     wrongdoing by defendants independent of defendant's breach of \n     contract and warranty. Because plaintiff's allegations of \n     fraud are not extraneous to the contractual dispute, \n     plaintiff is restricted to its contractual remedies under the \n     UCC. The circuit court's dismissal of plaintiff's fraud claim \n     was proper.\n\n  Hotels of Key Largo, Inc. v. RHI Hotels, Inc., 694 So.2d 74, 77 \n(Fla.Ct. App. 1997), holding that the Economic Loss Rule barred \nplaintiff's fraud claim seeking to recover economic loss caused by the \ndefendant's failure to promote the plaintiff's hotel per contractual \nagreement, says: ``[W]here the only alleged misrepresentation concerns \nthe heart of the parties' agreement simply applying the label \n`fraudulent inducement' to a cause of action will not suffice to \nsubvert the sound policy rationales underlying the economic loss \ndoctrine.''.\n  Raytheon Co. V. McGraw-Edison Co., Inc., 979 F Supp. 858, 870-73 \n(E.D. Wisc. 1997), holding that the Economic Loss Rule barred tort \nclaims, including strict-responsibility, negligent, and intentional \nmisrepresentation claims, brought by purchaser of real property against \nseller to recover purely economic loss caused by environmental \ncontaminants in the soil says: ``[T]he alleged misrepresentations \nforming the basis of Raytheon's fraud claims are inseparably embodied \nwithin the terms of the underlying contract . . . [Therefore,] Raytheon \ncannot pursue its fraud claims.''\n  AKA Distributing Co. V. Whirlpool Corp., 137 F.3d 1083, 1087 (8th \nCir. 1998), holding under Minnesota law that the Economic Loss Rule \nbarred plaintiff's fraud claim based on defendant's statements that the \nplaintiff would be engaged as a vacuum-cleaner distributor for a long \ntime despite one-year contract says: ``[I]n a suit between merchants, a \nfraud claim to recover economic losses must be independent of the \narticle 2 contract or it is precluded by the economic loss doctrine.''\n  Standard Platforms, Ltd v. Document Imaging Systems Corp., 1995 WL \n691868 (N.D. Cal. 1995, an unpublished opinion holding that the \nEconomic Loss Rule barred plaintiff's fraud claim based on defects in \nJukebox disk drives manufactured by defendant says: ``In commercial \nsettings, the same rationale that prohibits negligence claims for the \nrecovery of economic damages also bars fraud claims that are subsumed \nwithin contractual obligations. . . . [Plaintiff's] fraud claim is \nprecluded because it does not arise from any independent duty imposed \nby principles of tort law.''\n  This rule regarding intentional torts is not new but is in fact a \nrestatement of old principles separating contract law from tort law. In \ngeneral, breach of contract, intentional or otherwise, does not give \nrise to a tort claim; it is simply breach of contract. Thus many courts \nin addition to those above have held, without mentioning the Economic \nLoss Rule, that claims such as fraud emerging only from contractual \nduties are not actionable. See, e.g., Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. V. \nRecovery Credit Services, Inc., 98 F.3d 13 (2d Cir. 1996), holding \nunder New York law that plaintiff's fraud claim against a collection \nagency to recover funds collected by the defendant under contract with \nthe plaintiff was not actionable where the fraud claim merely restated \nthe plaintiff's claim for breach of contract: ``[T]hese facts amount to \nlittle more than intentionally-false statements by [the defendant] \nindicating his intent to perform under the contract. That is not \nsufficient to support a claim of fraud under New York law.''\n  In sum, the application of the Economic Loss Rule to intentional \ntorts, such as fraud, is best summarized by the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Eighth Circuit in AKA Distributing Co., listed above:\n\n       A fraud claim independent of the contract is actionable, \n     but it must be based upon a misrepresentation that was \n     outside of or collateral to the contract, such as many claims \n     of fraudulent inducement. That distinction has been drawn by \n     courts applying traditional contract and tort remedy \n     principles. It has been borrowed (not always with \n     attribution) by courts applying the economic loss doctrine to \n     claims of fraud between parties to commercial transactions.--\n     AKA Distributing Co., 137 F.3d at 1086 (internal citations \n     omitted).\n\n  In sum, the economic Loss provision in the Y2K act is not a radical \nprovision or change in law. That is why I oppose its removal from the \nbill, which in essence the Edwards amendment would accomplish.\n  This is not a simple problem. This is something that we have given a \nlot of thought to. For those who believe we should have unlimited \nlitigation in this country because of alleged harms, this is not going \nto satisfy them. For those who really want to solve the Y2K problem and \nto save this country trillions of dollars, the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from North Carolina will not suffice.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Carolina, attempts to freeze \nthe State law of economic losses--freeze it in place. However, the \nStates are not uniform in this area.\n  One of the things we want to accomplish with this Y2K bill --which is \nonly valid for 3 years, enough to get us through this crisis--is to \nhave uniformity of the law so everybody knows what the law is and \neverybody can live within the law and there will be incentives for \npeople to solve the problems in advance, which is what this bill is all \nabout.\n\n[[Page S6825]]\n\n  The purpose of the Y2K Act is to ensure national uniformity. A \nnational problem needs a national solution. That is why we need the \nnational economic loss doctrine or rule, based on the trends in State \nlaw towards them. We do need uniformity if we are going to solve this \nproblem, or these myriad of problems, in ways that literally benefit \neverybody in our society and not just the few who might want to take \nadvantage of these particular difficulties that will undoubtedly exist. \nWe all know they will exist.\n  The remediation section of this bill gives a 3-month time limit to \nresolve some of these problems. We hope we can. On the other hand, we \ndon't want to tie up all of our courts with unnecessary litigation.\n  I have to emphasize again that this bill has a 3-year limit. This \nprovision ends in 3 years. That is not a big deal. It is a big deal in \nthe sense of trying to do what is right with regard to the potential of \nunnecessary litigation that this particular Y2K problem really offers.\n  Let me just mention, I know the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina is aware that his own State has adopted the economic loss \nrule. Let me raise one particular case in North Carolina, the MRNC \ncase.\n  Let me offer a few comments on this case.\n\n       Specifically, with respect to what losses are recoverable \n     in the products liability suit, North Carolina's court \n     recognized that the state follows the majority rule and does \n     not allow the recovery of purely economic losses in an action \n     for negligence.\n\n  It cites a number of cases which I ask with unanimous consent be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n       At issue in this case is whether MRNC suffered economic \n     loss. Central to the resolution of this issue is what \n     constitutes economic loss. The court noted that when a \n     product fails to perform as intended, economic loss results. \n     Economic loss is essentially ``the loss of the benefit of the \n     users bargain.'' ``[T]he distinguishing central future of \n     economic loss is . . . its relation to what the product was \n     supposed accomplish.'' So economic loss should be available \n     for only contract claims. Tort law should not be allowed to \n     skirt contract law. In other words, contract law should not \n     be ``tortified.'' This is what the Y2K Act codifies. Economic \n     loss should not be allowed in cases where a contract exists. \n     This is the law of North Carolina and most states.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent these matters be printed in the Record at \nthis particular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      AT Corporation, Plaintiff,\n\n                                   v.\n\n   Medical Review of North Carolina, Inc., Defendant and Third-Party \n                               Plaintiff,\n\n                                   v.\n\n   Carolina Telephone & Telegraph Company and Northern Telecom Inc., \n                        Third-Party Defendants.\n\n                          No. 5:94-CV-399-BR1.\n\n   United States District Court, E.D.

(``NTI''): (1) motion to \n     dismiss, and (2) motion to stay discovery proceedings. \n     Defendant and third-party plaintiff Medical Review of North \n     Carolina, Inc. (``MRNC'') filed a response to the motion to \n     dismiss and NTI replied. As the issues have been fully \n     briefed, the matter is now ripe for disposition.\n\n                                I. Facts\n\n       In 1990, MRNC purchased a new phone system from third-party \n     defendant Carolina Telephone & Telegraph Company (``Carolina \n     Telephone''). Included within this system, among other \n     things, was a Meridian Voice Mail System, manufactured by \n     NTI. Carolina Telephone installed the phone system and \n     entered into an agreement with MRNC to provide maintenance \n     for the system.\n       Plaintiff AT & T Corporation (``AT & T'') provided certain \n     long distance services to *93 MRNC. AT & T has calculated \n     charges that MRNC allegedly owes for June 1992 in the amount \n     of $93,945.59. MRNC claims that unauthorized users gained \n     access to outside lines via the Meridian Voice Mail System \n     and placed long distance calls. MRNC contends these \n     unauthorized charges comprise part of the June 1992 bill.\n       AT & T filed a complaint against MRNC to recover these \n     charges which were past-due. Subsequently, MRNC filed a \n     counterclaim against AT & T and a third-party complaint. As \n     part of its third-party complaint, MRNC alleges NTI, as the \n     manufacturer of the Meridian Voice Mail System, was negligent \n     and breached an implied warranty. MRNC seeks to recover of \n     NTI charges, interest, costs and expenses it may incur as a \n     result of the action brought by AT & T.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n                             II. Discussion\n\n       [1][2] Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), NTI has filed a \n     motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which \n     relief can be granted. With such a motion, ``the issue is not \n     whether a plaintiff will ultimately prevail but whether the \n     claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support the \n     claim.'' Revene v. Charles County Comm'rs, 882 F.2d 870, \n     872 (4th Cir.1989) citing Scheuer v. Rhodes (416 U.S. 232, \n     236, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1686, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974)). The \n     complaint's allegations are construed in favor of the \n     pleader. Id.\n       [3] MRNC contends North Carolina's Products Liability Act \n     pertains to its claims. This act applies to ``any action \n     brought for or on account of personal injury, death or \n     property damaged caused by or resulting from the manufacture \n     . . . of any product.'' N.C.Gen.Stat. Sec. 99B-1(3). Among \n     other things, the Act defines against whom a claimant may \n     bring an action. See id. Sec. 99B-2. ``The Act, however, does \n     not extensively redefine substantive law.'' Charles F. \n     Blanchard & Doug B. Abrams, North Carolina's New Products \n     Liability Act: A Critical Analysis, 16 Wake Forest L. Rev. \n     171, 173 (1980). When an action does not fall within the \n     scope of the Act, common law principles, such as negligence, \n     and the Uniform Commercial Code still apply; but, they apply \n     without any alteration by the Act, which might otherwise \n     occur had the Act applied. See Gregory v. Atrium Door and \n     Window Co., 106 N.C.App. 142, 415 S.E.2d 574 (1992); Cato \n     Equip. Co. v. Matthews, 91 N.C.App. 546, 372 S.E.2d 872 \n     (1988).\n\n                          A. Negligence Claim\n\n       [4][5][6] In its first claim against NTI, MRNC alleges NTI \n     negligently failed ``to change the standard preset dialing \n     access code in the [system] prior to delivery and \n     installation at MRNC'' and negligently failed to give \n     appropriate instructions and warnings concerning alteration \n     of the standard preset dialing access code. The elements of a \n     products liability claim for negligence are ``(1) evidence of \n     a standard of care owed by the reasonably prudent person in \n     similar circumstances; (2) breach of that standard of care; \n     (3) injury caused directly or proximately by the breach; and \n     (4) loss because of the injury.'' Travelers Ins. Co. v. \n     Chrysler Corp., 845 F.Supp. 1122, 1125-26 (M.D.N.C. 1994) \n     (quoting McCollum v. Grove Mfg. Co., 58 N.C.App. 283, 286, \n     293 S.E.2d 632, 635 (1983)). Specifically, with respect to \n     what losses are recoverable in a products liability suit, \n     North Carolina follows the majority rule and does not allow \n     the recovery of purely economic losses in an action for \n     negligence. Chicopee, Inc. v. Sims Metal Works, Inc., 98 \n     N.C.App. 423, 432, 391 S.E.2d 211, 217, review denied and \n     granted, 327 N.C. 426, 395, S.E.2d 674, and reconsideration \n     denied, 327 N.C. 632, 397 S.E.2d 76 (1990), and appeal \n     withdrawn, 328 N.C. 329, 402 S.E.2d 826 (1991). At issue in \n     this case is whether MRNC suffered economic loss. Central to \n     the resolution of this issue is what constitutes economic \n     loss.\n       Before determining the nature of economic loss, examining \n     the reasoning behind the majority rule disallowing recovery \n     for such loss is instructive. The rule's rationale rests on \n     risk allocation. See 2000 Watermark Ass'n v. Celotex Corp., \n     784 F.2d 1183, 1185 (4th Cir.1986) (analyzing whether South \n     Carolina courts would adopt the majority position).\n       Contract law permits the parties to negotiate the \n     allocation of risk. Even where the law acts to assign the \n     risk through implied warranties, it can easily be shifted *94 \n     by the use of disclaimers. No such freedom is available under \n     tort law. Once assigned, the risk cannot be easily \n     disclaimed. This lack of freedom seems harsh in the context \n     of a commercial transaction, and thus the majority of courts \n     have required that there be injury to a person or property \n     before imposing tort liability.\n       The distinction that the law makes between recovery in tort \n     for physical injuries and recovery in warranty for economic \n     loss is hardly arbitrary. It rests upon an understanding of \n     the nature of the responsibility a manufacturer must \n     undertake when he distributes his products. He can reasonably \n     be held liable for physical injuries caused by defects by \n     requiring his products to match a standard of safety defined \n     in terms of conditions that create unreasonable risks of harm \n     or arise from a lack of due care.\n       Id. at 1185-86. The manufacturer can insure against tort \n     risks and spread the cost of such insurance among consumers \n     in its costs of goods. Id. at 1186.\n       Some courts examining the nature of the claimant's loss \n     focus on whether the damages result from a failure of the \n     product to perform as intended or whether they result from \n     some peripheral hazard. See, e.g., Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. \n     Cos. v. Burns Elec. Sec. Servs. Inc., 93 Ill.App.3d 298, 48 \n     Ill.Dec. 729, 417 N.E.2d 131 (1980); Arell's Fine Jewelers v. \n     Honeywell, Inc., 170 A.D.2d 1013, 566 N.Y.S.2d 505 (1991). \n     When some hazard occurs which the parties could not \n     reasonably be expected to have contemplated, the result is \n     noneconomic loss. Fireman's Fund Am. Ins. Cos., 48 Ill.Dec. \n     at 731, 417 N.E.2d at 133. Yet, when a product fails to \n     perform as intended, economic loss results. Id. Economic loss \n     is essentially ``the loss of the benefit of the user's \n     bargain.'' Id. ``[T]he distinguishing central feature of \n     economic loss is . . . its relation to what the product was \n     supposed to accomplish.'' Id.\n       The Fourth Circuit apparently views physical harm as a \n     distinguishing factor between noneconomic and economic \n     losses. See 2000 Watermark Ass'n, Inc., 784 F.2d at 1186. \n     ``The UCC is generally regarded as the exclusive source for \n     ascertaining when the seller is subject to liability for \n     damages if the claim is based on intangible economic loss and \n     not attributable to physical injury to person or to a \n     tangible thing other than the defective product itself.'' Id. \n     (citing W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on Torts \n     Sec. 95A, at 680 (5th ed. 1984))\n       The application of either approach--the benefit of the \n     bargain approach or the physical harm approach--which North \n     Carolina might adopt would lead to the conclusion that MRNC \n     has suffered pure economic loss. MRNC alleges it suffered \n     harm as a result of NTI's failure to change the standard \n     preset dialing access code before delivery and installation \n     at MRNC and as a result of NTI's failure to provide \n     instructions and warnings concerning the alteration of the \n     access code. The harm is in the form of monetary loss, if \n     MRNC is required to pay AT & T. Clearly, MRNC's allegations \n     center on the product's failure to meet MRNC's expectations, \n     or in other words, failure to perform as intended. That \n     someone might gain access to the system and place \n     unauthorized calls could reasonably be expected to be within \n     the parties' minds. In addition, no physical injury has \n     occurred. The only injury MRNC asserts is damage to its \n     financial resources. Based on the foregoing reasons, MRNC \n     seeks to recover purely economic loss and such loss in not \n     recoverable under tort law in a products liability action in \n     North Carolina. North Carolina's Products Liability Act does \n     not change this result, and the applicability of the Act is \n     not at issue as to the claim. Therefore, NTI's motion to \n     dismiss the negligence claim is GRANTED.\n\n                  B. Breach of Implied Warranty Claim\n\n       [7] MRNC contends NTI breached an implied warranty by \n     failing to inform MRNC of the system's susceptibility to toll \n     fraud if certain precautionary measures, such as changing the \n     access code, were not taken. North Carolina's Product \n     Liability Act relaxes the privity requirement with respect to \n     a claim for breach of implied warranty. See Sharrard, McGee & \n     Co. v. Suz's Software, Inc., 100 N.C.App. 428, 432, 396 \n     S.E.2d 815, 817-18 (1990).\n       *95 A claimant who is a buyer, as defined in the Uniform \n     Commercial Code, of the product involved . . . may bring a \n     product liability action directly against the manufacturer of \n     the product involved for breach of implied warranty; and the \n     lack of privity shall not be grounds for dismissal of such \n     action.\n       N.C.Gen. Stat. Sec. 99B-2(b). This section applies to a \n     ``product liability action'' as that term is defined in the \n     Product Liability Act, Chapter 99B. See id. As noted \n     previously, a ``product liability action'' is ``any action \n     brought for or on account of personal injury, death or \n     property damage caused by or resulting from the manufacture . \n     . . of any product.'' Id. Sec. 99B-1(3). In the instant case, \n     the issue is whether MRNC's breach of implied warranty claim \n     is a ``product liability action'' under the Act, thereby \n     abrogating the necessity of privity between MRNC and NTI.\n       [8][9] The Act is inapplicable to claims ``where the \n     alleged defects of the product manufactured by the \n     defendant caused neither personal injury nor damage to \n     property other than to the manufactured product itself.'' \n     Reece v. Homette Corp., 110 N.C. App. 462, 465, 429 S.E.2d \n     768, 769 (1993); see Cato Equip. Co., 91 N.C. App. at 549, \n     372 S.E.2d at 874. When the claim does not fall within the \n     Act, privity is still required to assert a claim for \n     breach of an implied warranty where only economic loss is \n     involved. Gregory, 106 N.C. App. at 144, 415 S.E.2d at 575 \n     (quoting Sharrard, McGee & Co., 100 N.C. App. at 432, 396 \n     S.E.2d at 817-18 and questioning whether this rule is \n     still good policy); see Arell's Fine Jewelers, Inc., 566 \n     N.Y.S.2d at 507.\n       Here, MRNC does not deny that privity does not exist \n     between itself and NTI. MRNC claims it is entitled to \n     maintain an action under the Products Liability Act and, \n     thus, would fall within the exception to the privity \n     requirements in the context of breach of implied warranty. \n     However, MRNC does not allege the defects in the Meridian \n     Voice Mail System resulted in any physical injury or property \n     damage. It has only alleged economic loss. See supra part \n     II.A. In such a situation, the general rule regarding privity \n     remains intact. Without privity, MRNC cannot maintain its \n     breach of implied warranty claim. Therefore, NTI's motion to \n     dismiss the breach of implied warranty claim in GRANTED.\n\n                            III. Conclusion\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, third-party defendant NTI's \n     motion to dismiss is GRANTED as to both claims, and as to \n     this party the action is DISMISSED. This ruling moots NTI's \n     motion to stay discovery proceedings and, thus, such motion \n     is DENIED.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I understand what the distinguished Senator \nfrom North Carolina is attempting to do. He is a very skilled lawyer, \nand a very good lawyer, and from my understanding primarily a \nplaintiffs' lawyer in the past. I have been both a defense and \nplaintiffs lawyer, and I presume maybe he has also, and I have a lot of \nrespect for him and I understand what he is trying to do.\n  The fact of the matter is, we have a 3-year bill here, that sunsets \nin 3 years,\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\nthat is trying to solve all kinds of economic problems in our country \nthat could cripple our country and cause a major, calamitous drop in \neverything if we do not have this bill, plus it could destroy our \ncomplete software and computer industry in a short period of time if we \nget everything tied up in litigation in this country because we are \nunwilling to pass this bill with this amendment on, that we have worked \nso hard, with Senator Dodd, to bring about.\n  If we do not pass this bill with this amendment, as amended by this \namendment, the Dodd-McCain-Hatch-Feinstein-Wyden amendment--and \nSessions amendment--I apologize for leaving out Senator Sessions' name. \nHe has worked hard on this bill. But if we don't pass this bill with \nthis language in it, then I predict we will have undermined the very \npurposes we are here to try to enforce.\n  This bill is an important bill. This bill assures every aggrieved \nparty his day in court. It does not end the ability to seek \ncompensation. What it does, however, is to create procedural incentives \nthat for a short time delay litigation in order to give companies the \nability to fix the problem without having to wait for a judgment from \nsome court--which could take years. But in this particular case, I want \nto remind all that the bill sunsets in 3 years. It is limited in a way \nthat prevents what would be catastrophic losses in this country, \nunnecessary losses if this bill is enacted. That is why we should quit \nplaying around with this bill and get it passed.\n  I don't care that the President of the United States says, he is not \ngoing to veto this bill. He would be nuts to veto it. This is a \nbipartisan bill. This amendment is a bipartisan amendment, and it has \nbeen worked out over a very long period of time and through a lot of \ncontentious negotiations. We finally arrived at something here that can \nreally solve these problems.\n  Sincerely motivated as is the distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, I hope our colleagues will vote this amendment down, because \nit will really undermine, at least in my opinion and I think in the \nopinion of many others, what we are trying to do here. What we are \ntrying to do here is in the best interests of our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. If I can respond briefly to the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, first I say to Senator Hatch I am \nabsolutely willing, and the people of North Carolina are willing, to \nlive with the law in North Carolina. What my amendment does is leave \nall existing law in place in this very narrow area.\n  The problem is that, for example, I know under North Carolina law, if \na fraudulent misrepresentation--if a crime--is committed, if somebody \nmakes a fraudulent misrepresentation and as a result somebody is put \nout of business, they are entitled to recover their economic losses, \nbecause there is an exception for intentional fraud, there is an \nexception for a criminal act.\n  The McCain bill has no such exception. It has no exceptions at all.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. The McCain bill doesn't affect that. If fraud is committed \nconsumers in most states will be able to recover even economic losses \nunder state statutes. This is not altered by the Y2K Act. So, if there \nis fraud committed or a criminal act committed, you are going to be \nable to have all your rights, even in States like North Carolina, where \nthey codify the economic loss rule. So that is not affected by this \nbill at all.\n  The only thing that will be affected by this bill, if your amendment \nis adopted there will be an increase of wide open and aggressive \nlitigation. Without your amendment, we will not have a uniformity of \nrule that will help us to get to the bottom of this matter. So with \nregard to the count on fraud, with regard to real fraud, or statutory \nfraud, with regard to criminal acts, the defendants will still be \nliable for what the distinguished Senator believes they should be \nliable for.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I say to Senator Hatch I respectfully disagree with \nthat. If you look at the section, it has no exceptions of that nature \nin it at all. It has no exception. There is a powerful limitation on \nthe recovery of economic loss, essentially eliminating the right to \nrecover for economic loss. And there is no exception in that section \nfor intentional, there is no exception for fraud and misrepresentation, \nthere is no exception for egregious, reckless conduct. None of those \nthings is excepted from the limitation on economic loss.\n  I might add, to the extent we are looking for uniformity when we are \ngoing to enforce contracts--there has been a great deal of discussion \nabout contract law--we are going to enforce contracts under State law. \nSo whatever the State law is, in the various States across the country, \nis going to be enforced under State law.\n  So what I respectfully disagree with the Senator about is what I \nbelieve my amendment does, which is, in a very narrow fashion, it works \nin concert with the section immediately preceding it, and the section \nimmediately preceding it requires every court in this land to enforce \nany existing contract. So if there is a contract, that contract will be \nenforced. It cannot be subverted by any kind of tort claim.\n  What my amendment does, is it allows a remedy to all those millions \nof people who could have been the victims of fraud, who could have been \nthe victims of reckless conduct, who could have been the victims of \ncarelessness and negligence, who have absolutely no remedy; they cannot \nrecover any of their out-of-pocket losses or any of those things. What \nmy amendment does is it creates no new torts, no causes of action, no \nanything. When you talk, at great length, about the economic loss rule, \nthe Supreme Court, and how various States have adopted it, it simply \nleaves that law in place. That is all it does, and only for those folks \nwho have no other remedy because they have no contract.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I will.\n  Mr. HATCH. That is what the Senator's amendment does. But in this \ntotal, overall bill, there is a statutory compensation, statutory \nexemption.\n  Most States--in fact, I think virtually all States--have consumer \nfraud statutes that provide for the right to sue that allow for \neconomic loss if there is an intentional fraud or criminal violation.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Will the Senator yield for a question on that?\n  Mr. HATCH. The underlying bill does not change that. It does provide \nfor an exception for statutory law. Where a State has a statutory \nprovision, this bill does not change that.\n  The Senator's position that intentional torts and common law fraud \nwould not be remedied under this bill is incorrect.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Only with respect to economic loss, which is what we are \ntalking about.\n  In any event, my belief is, what we are dealing with is a situation \nwhere anybody, any little guy in the country who has no contract \nbasically has no remedy. They cannot do anything.\n  To the extent we talk about this being just a 3-year bill, that 3-\nyear period, in the nature of the Y2K problem, is going to cover every \nsingle Y2K problem that exists in the country. This problem is going to \nerupt in the year 2000. Three years is plenty of time to cover every \nsingle problem that is going to occur in this country. To the extent \nthe argument is made that it is a limited bill, it is going to cover \nevery single Y2K loss that will occur in this country.\n  What I am trying to do with this amendment, which is very narrowly \ndrawn, is create no new claims, no new causes of action, to have a \nprovision that works in concert with the requirement that contracts be \nenforced. But for all those folks who have no contract, if their State \nallows them to recover for out-of-pocket losses, then they would be \nallowed to do that. If they have been the victim of fraud, if they have \nbeen the subject of criminal conduct, if they have been the victim of \nsimple recklessness or negligent conduct, only if their State allows \nthat would they be allowed to recover that loss.\n  Every other limitation in this bill stays in place: No joint and \nseveral, caps on punitive damages, duty to mitigate, 90-day waiting \nperiod, alternative dispute resolution, limitation\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\non class action, specificity of pleadings and materiality--all those \nthings stay in place.\n  We are simply saying for those little guys across America who do not \nhave a team of lawyers representing them drafting contracts, they ought \nto have a right to recover what they had to pay out of pocket as a \nresult of somebody being irresponsible with respect to a Y2K problem.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 620 to Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask that the previous amendment be set \naside and I send another amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 620 to amendment No. 608.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 7 (7), line 12 (12), after ``capacity'' strike \n     ``.'' and insert:\n     ``; and\n       ``(D) does not include an action in which the plaintiff's \n     alleged harm resulted from an actual or potential Y2K failure \n     of a product placed without reasonable care into the stream \n     of commerce after January 1, 1999, or to a claim or defense \n     related to an actual or potential Y2K failure of a product \n     placed without reasonable care into the stream of commerce \n     after January 1, 1999. However, Section 7 of this Act shall \n     apply to such actions.''\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is very \nsimple. It is to provide that this bill, which provides many \nprotections to those people who sell computer products for Y2K \nproblems, not apply after January 1 of 1999, after this bill began its \nprocess of consideration in the Congress, because it is absolutely \nobvious that everybody in the country has known about this problem for \nmany years and has been documented. It has actually been known for a \nperiod of 40 years and intensely watched over the last few years. \nCertainly every computer company in the world knew about Y2K before the \nbeginning of January 1, 1999, when we began consideration of this \nlegislation. There is a reason that this amendment is needed and \nnecessary. Let me give an example.\n  There are 800 medical devices that are produced by manufacturers \nacross this country that are date sensitive and critical to the health \ncare of people in this country, because a malfunction can cause injury \nto people.\n  Approximately 2,000 manufacturers sell these medical devices. About \n200 of those manufacturers, 10 percent, have yet to contact the FDA \nabout whether their medical devices are Y2K compliant. After being \nasked numerous times by the FDA, they have given no response. These are \npeople who have been on notice for a long time about this problem.\n  It is really a very simple amendment. What the amendment says is, \nbeginning in 1999, when everybody on the planet knew that this was a \nhuge problem, if you kept selling non-Y2K-compliant products, you \ncertainly should not have any of the protections of this bill, with one \nexception: We still keep in place the 90-day cooling off or waiting \nperiod because we think it is reasonable for the manufacturer or the \nseller to have that period of time to look at the problem and work with \nthe purchaser to see if it can be resolved, even if they put a product \nin commerce unreasonably knowing that this problem existed.\n  The amendment says that folks who kept selling, beginning in 1999, \nnon-Y2K-compliant products, knowing full well that this problem \nexisted, knowing that the Congress was about to consider legislation on \nthis issue and knowing that they were acting irresponsibly, should not \nhave the protection of the McCain bill. That is the purpose and reason \nfor this amendment.\n  The FDA example is a perfect example. We have 200 companies out there \nwho are unwilling to tell the FDA they have even looked to determine \nwhether their medical products that involve the safety and lives of \npeople are Y2K compliant.\n  There is nothing in the McCain bill that prevents companies from \ncontinuing--I mean through today--selling non-Y2K-compliant products. I \nknow in the spirit in which this bill was offered and intended that my \ncolleagues would not have intended that we continue to allow, as a \nnation and as a Congress, people to engage in reckless, irresponsible \nconduct without holding them accountable for that, even today, knowing \nfull well this problem exists. It simply excises from protection of \nthis bill all those folks who continue, even today, to sell non-Y2K-\ncompliant products unreasonably; that is, knowing that they are selling \nnon-Y2K-compliant products.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Does this amendment \nmodify the prior amendment; does it supersede the prior amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The previous amendment was set aside, and this \nis a separate amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this amendment basically is, in my opinion, \ntoo broad and too vague to provide guidance. It would cause more \nlitigation, and what we are trying to do is prevent litigation that \nliterally is unjustified.\n  This amendment does not take into account the practical reality that \nthe standard of care is determined as part of the case. Thus, how would \na plaintiff know what the pleading requirements are under S. 96 for \nspecificity? How would they know that? If it simply depends on the \nallegation of the plaintiff, then no plaintiff would fall under the \nrequirements of this bill. This could result in tremendous abuse. Talk \nabout loopholes, this would be the biggest loophole of all in the bill. \nThe fact of the matter is, what we are trying to do in this bill is \navoid litigation.\n  The distinguished Senator from North Carolina talks about protecting \nthe little guy out there, and the way that is done generally is through \nclass actions, where the little guy gets relatively little, but those \nin the legal profession make a great deal. That is what we are trying \nto avoid, a pile of class actions that are unjustified under the \ncircumstances where the manufacturers and all these other people go \ninto the bunkers and get a bunker mentality rather than resolving these \nproblems in advance. The whole purpose of this bill is to get problems \nresolved, to get our country through what could be one of the worst \neconomic disasters in the country's history.\n\n  The Y2K bill before us sets an important criteria for fixing the \nproblems. There needs to be specificity in plaintiffs' pleadings--in \nfact, both plaintiffs' and defendants' pleadings--so glitches can be \nfixed before litigation.\n  This amendment would allow ``reasonable care standards,'' which must \nbe shown in negligence cases. It does not have to be pleaded with \nspecificity. This would defeat the very purpose of this act, which is \ntrying to get us to be more specific so those who have problems will be \nable to rectify those problems and remediate those problems.\n  The goal here is to solve problems, not allow any one side or the \nother to get litigation advantage. We are not trying to give the \nindustries litigation advantage. We are not trying to give big \ncorporations litigation advantage. We are trying to solve problems. I \ncommend all of those on this bill who have worked so hard to do so.\n  If we accept this amendment, my gosh, we will not only not solve \nproblems, we will not have specificity in pleadings, we will never know \nwhat is really going on, and we will have massive class actions all \nover this country that will tie this country in knots over what really \nare glitches that possibly could be corrected in advance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank Senator Hatch for his very important and \npersuasive input in this debate. I appreciate it very much.\n  I did want to save a few minutes for Senator Sessions to make his \nremarks. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The opponents have 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I associate myself with the excellent analysis by \nSenator Hatch. He chairs the Judiciary Committee. He has had hearings \non this very problem. I think he has explained the situation very well.\n  We need, in the course of dealing with computer Y2K problems, a \nuniform national rule. That is what we are attempting to do here. One \nof the great problems for the computer industry is that they are \nsubject to 50 different State laws. The question is, Can they be \nunfairly abused in the process of massive litigation? I suggest that \nthey could be, and actually that the entire industry could be placed in \nserious jeopardy.\n  I recall the hearings we had in the Judiciary Committee on asbestos. \nThere were 200,000 asbestos cases already concluded, and 200,000 more \nare pending. Some say another 200,000 may be filed. What we know, \nhowever, is that in that litigation 70 percent of the asbestos \ncompanies are now in bankruptcy. We do not have all the lawsuits \ncompleted yet.\n  We also know that only 40 percent of the money they paid out actually \ngot to the victims of this asbestos disease. That is not the way to do \nit, and that is what is going to happen in this case.\n  What the Senator from North Carolina is basically arguing is for each \nState to keep its own economic loss rule, as I would understand his \nargument. But the problem with this is that a clever State could run \nout tomorrow and change its economic loss rule, or the court could rule \nand allow a few States to drain this industry, while other States are \nmaintaining the national rule.\n  First and foremost, the economic loss rule is a traditional rule of \nlaw. This statute basically says that. We will use a national rule for \neconomic loss. It is a significant issue because we are blurring the \ndifferences between tort and contract.\n  Alabama used to have common law pleading in which they were very \ncareful about how you pled a case. You had to plead in contract or you \nhad to plead in tort. If you pled in contract, you were entitled to \ncertain damages. If you pled in tort, you were entitled to other \ndamages. But you had to prove different elements under each one to get \na recovery. The courts have said certain actions are not tort and \ncertain action are not contract--they are only one.\n  This legislation that is proposed would say, let's accept the \nnational rule, the rule that has been clearly approved by the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Senator Hatch quoted from the U.S. Supreme Court in a \nunanimous verdict in approving this economic loss rule.\n  I think it would be a big mistake for us to go back to the 50-State \nrule instead of the uniform rule so that we can get through this one \nproblem, the Y2K problem, and limit liability and focus our attention \non fixing the problem rather than lawsuits. If we have lawsuits in \nevery single county in America, we are not going to have 200,000, we \nare going to have 400,000, or more. We have to end that. I know my time \nis up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the opponents has expired.\n  The Senator from North Carolina has--\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from Connecticut is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Alabama said it. Look, this is one of \nthose issues where we have legislators, as Senators, who are constantly \ntrying to find compromise. Reaching a 100-vote consensus, I guess, is \nthe ideal representation of that. But occasionally there is just a \ndivision here. You have to make a choice on where you are going to go \nwith this.\n  This is a 36-month bill to deal with a very specific, real problem. I \njust left a hearing this morning on the medical industry. We are not \ntalking about personal injuries here, but to give you some idea, there \nare some serious problems in terms of compliance we are seeing across \nthe country. You have to decide here whether or not you want to expand \nlitigation, which is a legitimate point.\n  There are those who think the only way to deal with this is to rush \nto court. I respect that. I disagree with it, but respect it. Or do you \ndecide for 36 months we are going to try to fix the problem to try to \nreduce the race to the courthouse?\n  Those of us who are in support of this bill come down on that side. \nThe only way you are going to do it is to have some uniform standards \nacross the country. We all know, as a practical matter--any first-year \nlawyer would tell you--you would run to the State that has the easiest \nlaws and get into court.\n  If you disagree, you ought to vote for the Edwards amendment. If you \nthink we ought to fix the problem, we think you should reject it so we \ncan solve this over the next 36 months.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. I say to my friend, Senator Dodd, he and I actually \nagree about the vast majority of what he just said. I think this bill \nin place, if it passes, will do all the things the computer industry \nwants to protect them against Y2K problems.\n  Joint and several liability is gone. There is a cap on punitive \ndamages. The duty to mitigate isn't present. There is a 90-day waiting \nperiod, cooling off period. We have the 36 months. We have class action \nlimitations. We have specificity and materiality of pleading.\n  This is a very narrow, simple thing that we are trying to accomplish \nwith this first amendment. We will enforce contracts as they exist. \nThat is what these folks have been talking about at great length, and \nthat is exactly what we should do.\n  The problem is with those folks who do not have a contract, which is \ngoing to be the vast majority of Americans. When Senator Sessions says \nthat the economic loss rule is a traditional rule, he is right about \nthat. What my amendment says is that traditional rule stays in place \nexactly as it is.\n  The problem is, the provision in this bill, in the McCain bill, is \nnot the traditional rule. It contains no exceptions of any kind--no \nexceptions for fraud, no exceptions for reckless conduct, no exceptions \nfor irresponsibility. The result of that is, regular people who buy \ncomputers--small businessmen, small businesswomen, consumers, folks who \ndo not have an army of lawyers who went in and crafted contracts on \ntheir behalf--have no remedy. They simply have no remedy; they cannot \nget anything, not even their out-of-pocket loss. That is what the \nMcCain bill does.\n  What I have done in the narrowest conceivable fashion is drawn an \namendment that allows those folks to recover only what their State law \npermits them to recover. It is just that simple. That is on the first \namendment.\n\n  On the second amendment, I just can't imagine what the argument is \nagainst this, although I heard the distinguished Senator from Utah \nargue against it. The very idea that people who are today, in 1999, \nselling non-Y2K-compliant products irresponsibly--and that is what is \nrequired--if they sell it without knowing about it, then they are still \ncovered by the bill. Under my amendment, if they sell it knowingly, if \nthey sell it irresponsibly in 1999, today, it simply says: Surely the \nCongress of the United States is not going to protect you. You have \nknown about this forever. We are not going to continue to protect you.\n  It is not going to create a flood of litigation. I have to \nrespectfully disagree with my friend, Senator Hatch. That makes no \nsense at all. If the consumer didn't buy the product in 1999, and they \ncan't show the product was sold and put into the stream of commerce \nirresponsibly in 1999, then the McCain bill is going to apply to them. \nSurely my colleagues do not want to provide this Congress's, this \nSenate's protection, stamp of approval for people to keep selling \nnoncompliant Y2K products, including, in my example, people who sell \nmedical devices that can cause injury and death to people. I just don't \nbelieve my colleagues on either side of the aisle want their stamp on \nallowing people to keep doing this, even though they are fully aware of \nit.\n  That is simply what my amendment addresses. It says if you are still \nselling this stuff, and you are selling it non-Y2K compliant, and you \nknow what you are doing, you don't get the benefit of the McCain bill.\n  It couldn't be any simpler than that. I respectfully suggest to my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\nthey do not want to put their stamp on people who have known about this \nproblem forever and are doing nothing about it. Not only that, \nknowingly continuing to sell non-Y2K-compliant products that can cause \ninjury to business, and, in the medical device fields, can cause injury \nto people, I just do not believe my colleagues on either side of the \naisle would want to support that. This amendment cures that problem.\n  With that, I yield back the remainder of my time and ask for the yeas \nand nays on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered on both amendments.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 619\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 621 To Amendment No. 608\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that manufacturers provide Y2K fixes if available)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have an amendment which I send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 621 to amendment No. 608.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In section 7(e) insert at the end the following:\n       (5) Special rule.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a defendant that is a \n     manufacturer of a device or system (including any computer \n     system and any microchip or integrated circuit embedded in \n     another device or product), or any software, firmware, or \n     other set or collection of processing instructions to \n     process, to calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, \n     to store, to transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related \n     data that experienced a Y2K failure, the defendant shall, \n     during the remediation period provided in this subsection--\n       (i) make available to the plaintiff a repair or \n     replacement, if available, at the actual cost to the \n     manufacturer, for a device or other product that was first \n     introduced for sale after January 1, 1990 and before January \n     1, 1995; and\n       (ii) make available at no charge to the plaintiff a repair \n     or replacement, if available, for a device or other product \n     that was first introduced for sale after December 31, 1994.\n       (B) Damages.--If a defendant fails to comply with this \n     paragraph, the court shall consider that failure in the award \n     of any damages, including economic loss and punitive damages.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before I start to explain the amendment, I \nwonder if I may engage in a colloquy with the managers of the bill to \nmake sure we are on the same path.\n  As I understand it, after conversing with Senators Hollings and \nMcCain, there has been an agreement that we will have a vote at 2 \no'clock on this particular amendment--I want to make sure I am correct \non that--and that we will come back at 10 to 2 and each side will have \n5 minutes at that time.\n  Mr. GORTON. Unfortunately, we have been notified of an objection to \nthat request on this side. We cannot agree to it right now. We are \ngoing to try to work it out.\n  Mrs. BOXER. We will just start the debate and see how long it takes \nus.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important bill to the State of \nCalifornia. I want to put it in a certain perspective. I very much want \nto vote for a Y2K bill, and that is why I supported the Kerry \nalternative which I believe is a fair and balanced bill because, after \nall, what we are trying to do is get the problem fixed.\n  A lot of times I listen to this debate and it gets very lawyerly, and \nthat is fine. I am not an attorney. What I want to do is get the \nproblem fixed. What I want to do is be a voice for the consumer, the \nperson who wakes up in the morning and suddenly cannot operate his or \nher computer; the small businessperson who relies on this system, and, \nfrankly, a big businessperson as well. I want to make sure what we do \nhere does not exacerbate the problem. I want to make sure what we do \nhere gets the problem fixed. That is what all the Senators are saying \nis their desire: to get the problem fixed.\n  The reason I support the Kerry bill and think it is preferable to the \nunderlying bill is that I believe it is more balanced. If you are a \nbusinessperson and, as Senator Hollings has pointed out, many times you \nmake a decision based on the bottom line--most of the\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\ntime--what you will do is weigh the costs and the benefits of taking a \ncertain action. If you have a certain number of protections the Senate \nhas given you, and those protections mean you have a better than even \nchance in court of turning back a lawsuit, you are apt to say: Maybe I \nwill just gamble and not fix this problem, because I have a cooling off \nperiod.\n  Frankly, in the underlying bill, the only thing that has to be done \nby the manufacturer involved is, he has to write to the person who \nthinks they may be damaged. That is all they have to do. They do not \nhave to fix the problem. They do not even have to say they are going to \nfix the problem. They just have to say: Yes, I got your letter and I am \nlooking at the situation.\n  Then you look at the rest of the law, and the bar is set so high that \nI believe some businesspeople--certainly not all--will say: I am \nprobably better off not fixing the problem.\n  I go back to the original point. If your idea is to fix the problem, \nwe ought to do something that encourages the problem to be fixed.\n  I totally admit, each of us brings a certain set of eyes to the bill. \nWhen I look at the underlying bill, I see some problems. Others think \nit is terrific, that it will lead to a fix of the problem, and therein \nlies the debate.\n  Every time I listen to this debate, I hear colleagues of mine who \nsupport this bill talk about how much they love the high-tech industry, \nhow important the high-tech industry is to this country, how important \nit is that we do not do anything to reverse an economic recovery.\n\n  All I can say is, no one can love the high-tech industry more than \nthe Senator from California--I should say the Senators from \nCalifornia--because it is the heart and soul of our State. I do not \nhave to extol Silicon Valley, the genius of the place, the fact that it \nis now being replicated in other parts of California, in San Diego, for \nexample, in Los Angeles, where they have these high-tech corridors. It \nis wonderful to see what is happening.\n  The last thing I want to do is hurt that kind of industry and hurt \nthat kind of growth. But there is something a little condescending when \nmy colleagues who support the underlying bill stand up and say: You are \ngoing to hurt the industry if you do not support the underlying bill. I \nthink it is demeaning. I think it is demeaning to Silicon Valley.\n  This is a strong industry. This is an ethical industry. These are \ngood, decent people with good business sense and a sense of social \njustice, if you look at what they are doing in their local communities. \nTo make it sound as if they need special protections and they need to \nbe coddled is something that I do not ascribe to.\n  I think it is a lack of respect. Yes, we have a problem here. Let's \ntry to fix it. But to assume that this industry cannot stand up and fix \na problem somehow troubles me. It is not respectful of the industry. It \nsays there are some people who may need to have this special \nprotection, and not fix the problem of the consumers.\n  So when I look at the bill, I say, what really is in this bill that \nwill lead to a fix of the problem? I have to tell you, in my heart of \nhearts, I really do not see it. I support a cooling off period. I think \neverybody does--most people do, because we do not know exactly what is \ngoing to hit us. Let's have a cooling off period. But something ought \nto be done in the cooling off period--more than just simply having a \nletter.\n  If I write a letter to company X and say, ``I woke up this morning; \nmy computer failed me; I'm a small businessperson; I'm in deep trouble; \nfix it,'' you know what the McCain bill says? I have a right to get a \nletter back within 30 days telling me what the company is going to do. \nWhat does that do for my business? What does that do for me? What does \nthat do to help me get back on line? Nothing. As I read the bill, that \nis all that is required.\n  So I want to fix the problem. I want to do it fairly. Under this \nunderlying bill, suppose you bought the computer in 1998 or 1999. They \ncould charge you more for the fix than the computer itself. You might \njust say: I am just getting rid of this computer. I am going to go out \nand buy a new one. You know what. You might then go to court; you would \nbe so angry.\n\n  So I don't see what we are doing in this bill that is real. I want to \noffer something that is real. That is what I do in this amendment.\n  I want to tell you where I got the idea for this amendment, because I \nwant you to know I did not think it up, as much as I wish I did. The \nconsumer groups brought this to me--not the lawyers, not the high-tech \npeople, the consumer groups. They said: We really don't want to have to \ngo to court. We want to fight for a fix. We have this good idea. Guess \nwhere it was found, word for word, almost. Congressman Cox's and \nCongressman Dreier's original bill on Y2K contains this wonderful idea \nthat, in the cooling off period in the bill, after you write to the \ncompany or companies involved, they must write back to you. And if they \ndetermine there is a fix available--and it is their determination, \nnobody else's--they have to fix the problem.\n  What we have said in this amendment is, if the fix is on a system \nthat is between 1990 and 1995, they can charge you the cost of the fix. \nSo the company is out nothing, because we figure it may be a little \nmore complicated than the later models. If it is after 1995, to 1999, \nthen they have to do it for free, because--I have listened to Senator \nHollings, and perhaps he can help me out with this point--most of the \ncompanies knew about this problem a long time ago. And, more than that, \na vast majority of them are fixing the problem. They are doing it for \nnothing.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am delighted to.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am intrigued by the Senator's comments with respect \nto the industry itself. This Senator does not know of a lousy computer \nmanufacturer. It is the most competitive industry in the world. You \nhave to have the most brilliant talent around you. As they say, it \nchanges every other year. Or every year, and so forth, it is outdated. \nSo, that being the case, there are no real laggards or hangers-on.\n  Right to the point, does the Senator realize, for example, that they \nhave to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission what we call a \n10-Q report; namely, of the Y2K problem? Do they know of the problem? \nWhat is the potential risk under the problem? What is to be done in \norder to correct that particular problem, and otherwise? What is the \ncost to the company? The stockholders want to know this information.\n  The Securities and Exchange Commission requires it. Just looking at \nthe Boeing Company Y2K report under their 10-Q report: ``The State of \nReadiness. The company recognized the challenge early, and major \nbusiness units started work in 1993.''\n  Did the Senator realize that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I actually was not aware many of them started the fix \nthat early.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Well, going further, does the Senator realize, for \nexample--we are going to have lunch with the distinguished leader, Mr. \nDell of Dell Computer--as of December 14 of last year, in their 10-Q \nreport they state: ``All products shipped since January 1997 are Y2K-\ncertified. Upgrade utilities have been provided for earlier hardware \nproducts''?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I was not aware of that, that the Dells were Y2K-\ncompliant as of 1997.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Does the distinguished Senator realize ``no \nmaterial''--no material cost? So they are not looking for a bill.\n  I hope we do not pass a bill. Then, when the world ends, as some of \nthe Senators around here are saying, and the computer industry is \nruined, Dell will be the only one left. I will be all for them. That is \nreally the history of all of them. I have Yahoo. I have all the rest of \nthem here listed.\n  But I think that is the point the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia is making, who would know better than any, that this is a \nmost responsible industry. They are not trying to get rid of the old \nmodels.\n  This particular legislation, the Senator's amendment makes sure they \ndo not get rid of the old models. It is like a car company saying: We \nare going to bring out a new model come January 1, so all the old \nmodels that we sell all this year are going to have all kinds of \ngimmicks or glitches. But let's make them 90 days or let's let them get \na letter back or something else of that\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\nkind. If the automobile industry came to Washington and asked for that, \nwe would laugh them out of court.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to make a point. It is a very subtle point to \nmake. But by discussing minute after minute these special protections \nthat go beyond the fair protections that I believe are warranted--and, \nby the way, my friend from Oregon made this a much better bill; I give \nhim tremendous credit for that--but in my view, they still have special \nprotection that, frankly, the greatest business in the world does not \nreally need to have, because they are good people, because they are \nmaking the fixes, because their future depends upon how the consumer \nrates them.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. What I am fearful of is that in the end we are protecting \nthe bad apples. And I do not mean to use Apple Computer. Apple Computer \ngot this a long time ago. They are all compliant. But we will wind up--\nbecause so much of the industry cares about this, wants to make the \nfixes--protecting those few that are bad. I am very worried.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator makes an excellent point. I ask the \nSenator if she will yield for a question.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Because many people think this is a debate between the \ncomputer and software companies versus the trial lawyers; choose whose \nside you are going to be on. People forget we are talking about the \nconsumers of the products, the people who buy computers and software. \nThese are businesses, too. These are doctors and manufacturers and \nretail merchants who rely on computers to work.\n  This bill basically says, if you bought a computer that, it turns \nout, stops working come January 1 in the year 2000, we are going to \nlimit your ability to recover for wrongdoing by the person who sold it \nto you. We will limit it. Unlike any other category of defendants in \nAmerican courts, save one that I can think of, we are going to say this \nis a special class of people; those who make computers and software are \nnot going to be held accountable like the people who make automobiles, \nand the folks who make equipment, the folks who make virtually \neverything in the world, including all of us.\n  Everybody gathered here in this Chamber can be held liable in court \nfor our wrongdoing. If we make a mistake, we can be brought before a \njury, and they can decide whether our mistake caused someone damage. \nThis bill says: Wait a minute, special class of Americans here. \nAmerican corporations that make computers and software shall not be \nheld liable, or at least if they are going to be held liable, under \nlimited circumstances. So the losers in this process are not trial \nlawyers. The losers are other businesses that say, January 2, wait a \nminute, this computer is not working. I can't make a profit. I have \nhundreds of employees who counted on this, and now what am I supposed \nto do?\n\n  I say to the Senator from California, thank you for this amendment.\n  A couple questions. You make a point here that if we are going to \ngeneralize and say, well, there may be some bad actors in this industry \nthat sold defective products, that we are going to, in fact, absolve \nall manufacturers, it is a disservice to the companies which in good \nfaith have been doing everything in their power to bring everything up \nto speed. Just to make this point, is it the Senator's point that we do \nnot want to favor those bad actors at the expense of so many good \nactors from Silicon Valley and across the world?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I think this argument has not been made \nbefore. Something was troubling me, as I listened to the debate, \nbecause it seemed to me that the implied sense around here is that \nsomehow this wonderful industry can't stand up to this test. This is an \nindustry that has performed miracles for the people of this country, \nchanging the nature of the way we do business, the way we live, the \nincredible communications revolution. I think they can meet this \nchallenge. I do not think they need to have, as my friend puts it, this \nspecial carve-out, because I think in a way it is insulting to them.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will continue to yield, I can only think \nof two other groups in America that enjoy this special privilege from \nbeing sued: foreign diplomats----\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. --and health insurance companies, which happen to fall \nunder the provision in Federal law which says--we are debating this, \nincidentally, on the Patients' Bill of Rights--if they denied coverage \nto you, they only have to pay for the cost of the procedure, as opposed \nto all the terrible things that might have happened to them. As I \nunderstand this bill, from the amendment by the Senator from North \nCarolina, there are strict limitations here on what a person whose \nbusiness is damaged can recover.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I also ask the Senator, as I take a look at her \namendment, she is suggesting, if I am not mistaken, that if you bought \nyour computer back 10 years ago, which was light-years ago in terms of \ncomputer technology, for a 5-year period of time, 1990 to 1995, is that \ncorrect----\n  Mrs. BOXER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. --if you bought it during that period of time and there \nis a problem, then the company, of course, can charge you for the cost \nof bringing your computer up to speed, making sure it works?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. But after 1995, the Senator is arguing, the industry knew \nwhat was going on. They knew what the challenge was. If they continued \nto sell computers they knew were going to crash or did not take the \ntime to fix, then she is saying the customers, the businesses, the \ndoctors and engineers that bought the computers shouldn't be left \nholding the bag; it should be the expense of the computer company to \nfix it. Is that the Senator's amendment?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly right. Under the underlying bill, if you bought a \ncomputer in 1999, and it fails you a few days later, you get nothing in \nterms of a fix. You get a letter. We hope the letter says we are going \nto fix it. But you do not have any commitment that it would be for \nfree. You could get charged thousands of dollars. Our friend, Senator \nHollings, who has been so articulate in the opening moments of the \ndebate, talked about these doctors where the company said in order for \nthem to get a fix, it costs them more than the original system. Am I \nright, I say to the Senator?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly. He bought an upgrade just the year before, \nguaranteed for at least 10 years, for $13,000. In order to fix it, the \ncharge was $25,000. That is the testimony before a committee of the \nCongress. He had really not only written a letter and everything else, \nno response, he finally got a lawyer, but even that did not work. The \nlawyer was clever enough to put it on the Internet and, bam, there were \n20,000 similarly situated. Wonderful Internet. Immediately the company \nsaid: We will not only fix it, we will pay the lawyers' fees and \neverything. That is all he wanted. He wanted a fix. Otherwise, he was \nout of business.\n  People don't rush to the courthouse. They have to do business. If I \nfiled a claim for Senator Boxer this afternoon in the courts of \nCalifornia or South Carolina, I would be lucky to get into the \ncourthouse before the year 2000. I mean, the dockets are backed up that \nway. We live in the real world.\n  We are not looking for lawsuits. We are looking for results.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friends, that is so true. If you look at the \nnumber of lawsuits that are out there, the big explosion, and there has \nbeen one, has been business suing business. It is not the individual, \nand it is not the small guy, because it is cumbersome, and it is \nexpensive. You don't get your problem fixed really.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I am curious. I ask the \nSenator for her reaction on this. What if we said, instead of \ncomputers, we are going to deal with airplanes this way. If we said we \ndo not want people who make airplanes to be held liable if they fall \nout of the sky, America would say that is crazy, that is ridiculous. \nWe, of course, want to hold the manufacturers of products where we have \na lot at stake to a standard of care.\n  If you were going to absolve them, insulate them, then, frankly, as a \nconsumer I am going to have second thoughts about getting on the \nairplane.\n  I think what the Senator is saying with her amendment is those \ncompanies that have done the right thing,\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nhave established their reputation for integrity by stepping forward and \nsaying we are solving the Y2K problem, certified, as the gentleman from \nDell Computer did with the SEC, these companies that have gone that \nextra mile and want to stand behind that reputation will actually be \npenalized by this bill, because, frankly, all their hard work is not \nonly being ignored, it is being defied.\n  They are saying: We have to carve out a special treatment here for \nthose who didn't do a good job as businesspeople.\n  Coming back to the point I made earlier, the victims here are not \ntrial lawyers. The victims are businesses, small businesses as well as \nmedium-size businesses, trying to keep their employees at work, \nworrying that January 2 of the year 2000, they are going to have to \nclose down and send people home without a paycheck. Those are the folks \ndisadvantaged by the broad sweep of this bill.\n\n  I think the Senator from California is on the right track. The good \nactors, the ones that have worked hard to make this work, should be \nrewarded. Those that have not should not be protected by the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and all of \nthe interests that have come in here and said, let us provide special \ntreatment for those that have not met their responsibility.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friends for their comments, because as I \nlistened to them, I become more and more convinced of the importance of \nthis amendment. It levels the playing field between the good actors and \nthe bad ones.\n  Right now, if this bill passes without this amendment, nobody has to \ndo anything. The people who already have taken the move to fix the \nproblem are definitely at a disadvantage. Why? They spent money to do \nit. They worked hard to do it. Yet, we are protecting those who are \nsitting back and saying, wow, I can't believe this deal I am getting.\n  They are changing the law. It is only for 3 years, but it is enough \ntime. How many people are going to sit around and wait to get their \ncomputers fixed? They will throw them out, and that is hard for a lot \nof consumers. That is why the Consumers Union is so strongly behind \nthis and Public Citizen is so strongly behind this.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I hold in my hand an Institutional Investor. This is \nthe real official document, the investment industry. They had a survey \nof the Congressional Financial Officers Forum of all the large \ncorporations in the country. To the question, Do you feel your \ncompany's internal computer systems are prepared to make the year 2000 \ntransition without problems, do you realize that 88.1 percent said yes, \nand only 6 percent said no? So that is 6 percent that have another 6 \nmonths to take care of it. With respect to actually getting and working \nout with their suppliers, do you realize that 95.2 percent said they \nhave worked with their suppliers and are ironing out all the problems?\n  It really verifies exactly the astute nature of the computer \nindustry, as described by the Senator from California. You are right on \ntarget, and it hasn't been said on the floor as you are saying it, with \nauthority, too. I commend the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator. I can't be more proud of the Silicon \nValley. I can't be more proud of the high-tech industry that I see \nblossoming all throughout my State. I can't be more proud of them.\n  The facts the Senator put into the Record make me even more proud, \nbecause what he is saying is the vast majority are good actors. The \nvast majority understand their good practice of fixing the Y2K problem \nwill redound to their benefit as well as to the benefit of consumers. \nThey have a business conscience. They are good corporate actors. They \nhave a social conscience. They understand it.\n  In many ways, when you talk to some of these executives, they are \nvery democratic. And I don't mean in terms of their party affiliation; \nI mean democratic with a small ``d.'' They want to spread democracy. \nThey want each individual, through the power of the Internet and the \npower of their computer, to have the information, to have the \nknowledge. That is what excites them.\n\n  So they are good people making a wonderful product. They don't want \nit to fail. Yet, we have a bill here that essentially says to those who \nhaven't moved aggressively on this problem--and by the way, this is \ntaken from the Apple web site, I say to my friend. There is a great \nquote by Douglas Adams about the year 2000 readiness. His quote is:\n\n       We may not have gotten everything right, but at least we \n     knew the century was going to end.\n\n  Good point. They knew the century was going to end. They knew there \nmight be some problems.\n  So to sum up the argument I am making for this important amendment, \nit is the one amendment that I know of where the attorneys and the \nSilicon Valley were not even entered into the discussion. It is a hard, \nstraightforward, consumer rights amendment, brought to you by the \nconsumer groups, the people who really care about the individual \nbusiness and the individual. It was originally found in the Cox-Dreier \nlegislation, which was introduced in 1998. We practically take it word \nfor word. What does it require? It says in that remediation period, \nafter you have notified the company of your problems, if they determine \nthey have a fix to your problem, they have to fix it. It is as simple \nas that. Who decides if there is a fix? They decide. We are not having \nanybody come and look over their shoulder. If the company says we have \na fix, they fix it.\n  Guess what happens. Everybody is happy. The consumer is happy. They \ncan go back to work on their computers. The company is going to be \nhappy because they are going to have to satisfy the consumer. There \nwill be no lawsuit. Why? We fixed the problem.\n  In some very interesting way, the underlying bill, because it doesn't \nrequire any fix at all, even if your computer was bought 3 days before \nthe millennium, encourages companies not to do it. I just hope there \nwill be a unanimous vote for this amendment, and if there isn't, if we \ndon't win this amendment, it says to me the consumer isn't important in \nthis debate.\n  I can't imagine we are being so fair--if it is a really old computer, \nbefore 1990, the company could charge anything they want because we \nadmit maybe it is worthless. But if it is between 1990 and 1995, they \ncan charge you the cost. If it costs them $500 to fix the problem, you \nwill pay $500. If it is a newer computer, between 1995 and the year \n2000, they ought to do it for free because, as the Apple people said, \n``We may not have gotten everything right, but we knew the century was \ngoing to end.''\n  I have to tell you that by 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, if people \ndidn't know this was a problem, they had to be sleeping, because \neverybody knew this was a problem in the 1990s.\n  I am very hopeful to get the support of the Senator from Oregon and \nto get the support of the Senator from Arizona. I think this will be \nsomething that would make this bill more consumer friendly, despite the \nother problems.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I came over to the floor because I am in \nsympathy with what the Senator from California is trying to do. But \nthis bill has taken such a pasting in the last 15 or 20 minutes that I \nam going to take a couple of minutes to correct the Record before we \nactually get into the merits of what my colleague is trying to do.\n  For example, I have heard repeatedly that if you pass this bipartisan \nlegislation put together by the Senator from Arizona and the Democratic \nleader on technology issues, Senator Dodd, and myself, well, these \ncompanies won't have to do anything; they won't have to do anything at \nall.\n  Well, if they don't do anything at all, they are going to get sued. \nThat is what is going to happen to them. Then we heard that if they \nwere big and bad, they were going to get a free ride. I heard that \nseveral times here on the floor of the Senate in the last 15 or 20 \nminutes. If you are big and bad, you are going to get a free ride if we \npass this bill. I will tell you what happens if\n\n[[Page S6834]]\n\nyou are big and if you engage in egregious activity, if you rip people \noff; what happens is you get stuck for punitive damages because there \nis absolutely no cap on those, and joint and several liability applies \nto those people as well. That is what happens to the people who are big \nand bad under our legislation.\n  I think it is just as important that the Record be corrected. I also \nheard that businesses were going to be the victims and the like. Well, \nif that is the case, it is sort of hard to understand why hundreds and \nhundreds of business organizations are supporting this bill. I would be \nvery interested in somebody showing me a list of some business groups \nthat aren't supporting the bill because I would sure want to be \nresponsive to those folks.\n  Let me, if I might, talk specifically about the Boxer amendment. By \nthe way, apart from the last 15 or 20 minutes of discussion, my friend \nfrom California has been very helpful on a lot of technology issues \nthat this Senator has been involved in. I remember the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act that we worked on in the last session of the Congress, \nwhere the Senator from California was very helpful. I very much \nappreciated that.\n  The question that I have--and maybe I can engage in a discussion with \nthe Senator from California on this and try to see if I can get fixed \nin my mind how to make what the Senator from California is talking \nabout workable, because I think the Senator from California wants to do \nwhat is right. I am now just going to focus on her amendment and sort \nof put aside some of these other comments that I have heard in the last \n15, 20 minutes, which I so vehemently take exception to, and see if I \ncan figure out with the Senator from California how we can make this \nworkable. I want to tell her exactly what my concerns are. I come from \na consumer movement, and she comes from that movement, and I know what \nshe is trying to do is the right thing.\n  Let us say that you have a system where one chip out of thousands is \nout of whack. My colleague says it ought to be repaired or replaced, \nand the question that we have heard as we have tried to talk to people \nis: Does this mean replacing just a chip? Does it mean replacing the \noperating system? Who is responsible for the fix? Is it Circuit City, \nwhere you bought it? Is it Compaq Computer? Is it the chip maker?\n  What we have found in our discussions with people is that it wasn't \njust chips, but it was the software situation as well. Is it going to \nbe Lotus or Novell or the retired computer programmer who put the code \ntogether a few years ago? As far as I can tell, the responsible \ncompanies--and I think the Senator from California has been absolutely \nright in making the point that there are an awful lot of responsible \npeople out there. We are trying to do the right thing. The responsible \npeople seem to want to do the kinds of things that the Senator from \nCalifornia is talking about. I know I saw an EDS advertisement \nessentially in support of our bill that talked about how they have a \nsystem to try to do this.\n  If we can figure out a way, with the Senator from California, to do \nthe kinds of things she is talking about so as to not again produce \nmore litigation at a time when we are trying to constrict litigation, I \nwant to do it.\n  I have already had my staff put a lot of time into this. We are \nwilling to spend a lot more time, because I think the motivations of \nthe Senator from California are absolutely right. The question is how \nto deal with the kinds of bits, bytes, and chips, and all of the \nvarious technological aspects that go into this.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague and hear her thoughts on \nit.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my friend. I know it \nis hard, when you put so much work into the bill, when there is a \ndisagreement. I just want to say to my friend, in terms of my \nparticular bill, it focuses on that so-called remediation period. That \nis what I am focusing on, because, in my opinion, there is nothing that \nrequires any action to fix in that period. It requires communication \nback and forth. That was my only point.\n  This amendment--I am happy my friend is sympathetic to it, and I hope \nwe can work out our differences on it--actually says to the \nmanufacturer--the retailer is not involved in this. I say to my friend, \nif he reads my amendment, it just says if the manufacturer determines \nthat there is a fix, then they must make the fix.\n  In that 10-year period, we prescribe that if it is a newer part and a \nnewer system, he does it for nothing, because in 1995 he should have \nknown it, and prior to 1995, 1990 to 1995, we say at cost.\n  Again, I want to make sure my friend knows, we do not change one \npiece of the underlying bill in terms of the rest of the bill. The rest \nof the bill stands. We don't add any other court suits. We don't change \nany damages. All we say is fix it if you can. And if you cannot, the \nunderlying bill will apply. That is really all we are doing.\n  I think this sends a clear message to those manufacturers that have \nbeen lax to follow the lead of the good manufacturers that have been \nwonderful. And those are the ones I know and love from my State who \nhave said we are going to make the consumer whole, we are going to make \nthe consumer happy.\n  I want my friend to know that we add no new cause of action--nothing. \nIn the underlying bill, we just say remediation, period, instead of \njust saying it is a time for people to write bureaucratic lawyers a \nletter to each other, which is better than nothing. It is a cooling-off \nperiod. We say if you have a fix, make it work, because under the \nunderlying bill there is no such requirement. You could charge people \nmore than they even pay for the machine, et cetera, even if they got \nthe machine 3 days before the millennium.\n  I am happy to work with my friend. If she wants to put a quorum call \nin, perhaps, and sit down together to see if we can come up with \nsomething, Senator McCain said to me through staff that he thought we \ncould do this as a policy.\n  Frankly, we are writing legislation, and I think it is deserving of \nbeing included. But I would be delighted to work with my friend.\n  Mr. WYDEN. My colleague is constructive, as always. Here is the kind \nof concern I think the high-technology sector would have to focus on \nthe manufacturer. That deals with this issue of interoperability where, \nin effect, if you have one system or product that is Y2K compliant but, \nas a result of it being installed in a system that isn't already Y2K \nready, you may have in fact failures, or bugs, or defects, the Y2K-\nready product may get infected and not properly function. Then the \nquestion is, Who is responsible? Can you, in effect, have somebody take \nresponsibility for fixing a problem that isn't under their control?\n  If the Senator from California would like to put in a quorum call and \nget into the issue of interoperability and how to deal with these \nvarious issues, and sort of have all of the people talking at once, I \nthink that is very constructive. I am anxious to do it.\n  I think this is a discrete and important concept. Again, without \ngoing back to all the things that were said in the last 20 or 25 \nminutes, if you are a consumer, or a business, and you are getting \nstiffed, you can go out and sue immediately. You can go out and sue and \nget an injunction immediately. You don't have to wait 30 or 60 days, or \nwhatever. You can go immediately.\n  I would like to spend the time during the quorum call to try to focus \non what I think is a very sincere effort of the Senator from California \nto try to do something to help people who need a remedy, and need it \nquickly. We are going to have to get into some of these \ninteroperability questions and some of the questions of what happens \nwhen you have a problem that essentially gets into your system after it \nleaves your hands. I am anxious to try to do it. We can put it in the \ncontext of the kind of discrete, specific idea that the Senator from \nCalifornia was talking about rather than what I heard during the last \n20 or 25 minutes about how big and bad actors are going to get a free \nride, when in fact on page 13 of the bill it says that you are liable \nfor the problem that you cause. That is what is on page 13 of the bill. \nProportionate liability--you are liable for the portion of the problem \nyou caused. If you engage in intentional misconduct, if you rip people \noff, you are going to be stuck for the whole thing--joint and several, \npunitive damages, the works.\n  I would prefer to do what the Senator from California is now \nsuggesting,\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nwhich is to put in a quorum call, bring the good people from Chairman \nMcCain's office and from the office of the Senator from California and \nmyself, along with Senator Dodd's, into a discussion to see if we can \nfigure out a way to make this workable.\n  I am happy to yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I want to engage with my friend. I thank him for his \nusual willingness.\n  I want to make a point that I want my friend to understand. This is a \nvery business-friendly amendment, because this amendment says the \nmanufacturer has to determine if a fix is available.\n  In all the issues my friend raises--well, there is a part over here \nfrom that company, and a part over there--the question is, it has \nnothing to do with liability; it has to do with a fix available for the \nconsumer. If the manufacturer determines there is no fix, because there \nis little product in inside, and a company is out of business and they \ncan't replace the part, the manufacturer simply says there is no fix \navailable, and then the rest of the bill applies.\n  Again, I say to my friend, as he said, as he described the fact, of \ncourse, the bad actors will be called into court later. We want to \navoid that--both my friend and I.\n  I believe we have so many good actors out there, and my friend cited \none of the companies that has really taken care of this problem. I \nthink that is what the Senator from Oregon was talking to me about \nbefore when he said you know some of these companies are doing this. \nAbsolutely, they are. We ought to make that the model. We ought to say \nthat is wonderful, you take care of it, and everybody is happy, and \nthere is no lawsuit.\n  I am hopeful, because I don't see this as complicated. We worked very \nhard to make it simple. We didn't want to tell the manufacturer, ``You \ncan make the fix,'' if in fact they can't. If they in good faith say, \n``There is a part inside this mother board, and we can't fix it,'' then \nthey simply say, ``I am sorry, there is no fix available in this \ncircumstance,'' and then the underlying bill applies.\n  But we think the leadership by the really good people in this high-\ntech community ought to be followed. We believe if we don't put this \namendment in the bill that those who already have acted in such good \nfaith, in such good business behavior, and such good corporate \nresponsibility to fix the problem and are seriously at a disadvantage, \nbecause they scratch their head and say, ``You know, I should have \nwaited, maybe I didn't have to do all of this, and people would have \ndecided it is too much of a hassle, I will just throw out my computer \nand get a new one,'' I can tell my friend, I bet a lot of people will \nwind up doing that. That would be unfortunate, if a fix is available.\n  Whenever the Senator wishes to put in a quorum call, actually our \nfriend from Delaware has been waiting to speak on another very \nimportant topic.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I believe I have the time. I am going to wrap up in 2 \nminutes, maximum.\n  Mrs. BOXER. When the Senator yields the floor, the Senator from \nDelaware will take over, and the Senator from Oregon, Senator McCain, \nSenator Dodd, and I can meet.\n  Mr. WYDEN. We are going to have to look at some of these.\n  The question is, Is a fix available? If we are not careful, that \ncould be a lawyer's full employment program.\n  My colleague is absolutely right. In Oregon and California, we have \naccess to some of the best minds and most dedicated and thoughtful \npeople on the planet in this area. We should spend some time making \nsure we can get at this concept the Senator from California wishes to \naddress in a workable way so we don't have more litigation, rather than \nless. I know the Senator from California shares that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent to proceed in morning business for \n15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6835-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6835-S6837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PEACE AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak of the military \ntechnical agreement signed by NATO and Yugoslavia. That is a fancy way \nfor saying that we accepted the surrender of Slobodan Milosevic.\n  I just got off the phone with the Secretary of State who called me \nfrom Germany with another piece of very positive news. She indicated \nthat because the G-8 was meeting in Germany, they put together a group \nof Europeans to flesh out in detail a Southeastern Europe Stability \nPact, which is an idea generated by the German Government.\n  The objective of that pact is to encourage democratic processes in \nsoutheastern Europe, in the Balkans, and to reduce tensions in the \narea. They have set up a very elaborate but clear timetable, and what \nthey call ``regional'' tables, to promote democracy, economic \nreconstruction, and security. They have involved as the lead group the \nEuropean Union, plus the OSCE, the United Nations, NATO, and to a \nlesser extent, the United States.\n  The reason I bother to mention this is that the hard part is about to \ncome. I hope we will have the patience that we did not show on this \nfloor to win the peace. We have won the war, notwithstanding the fact \nmany thought somehow we should be able to do this in less than 78 days.\n  I think it is astounding that we talked about how this ``dragged \non.'' We will probably find that close to 10,000 paramilitary and \nSerbian troops were killed. Only 2 Americans were lost in a training \nexercise--as bad as that is. Yet, we began to lose patience, because it \nwasn't done in a matter of 24 hours.\n  If we have the patience, we can win the peace, because unlike \npursuing the war, the bulk of the financial responsibility, \norganizational effort, and guidance will come from the Europeans. The \nEuropean Union will take on the major portion of the responsibility for \nrebuilding the region, reconstructing the area.\n  The American people should know that the President of the United \nStates has tasked the Secretary of State to see to it--we will hear \nphrases such as ``mini Marshall Plan''--that the United States of \nAmerica is not going to bear the brunt of the financial burden in \nreconstructing southeastern Europe. It is fully within the capacity of \nthe Europeans. It is their responsibility. It is in their interest, and \nthey are prepared to do it.\n  On the military side, the first part is in place. The Yugoslav \nGovernment has capitulated on every single point NATO has demanded. The \nlast several days of discussions between NATO and Yugoslav military \ncommanders were not about negotiation. They were about the modalities \nof meeting the concessions made by Milosevic's government on every \nsingle point NATO demanded. It took some time to work that out.\n  ``Modalities'' is a fancy foreign policy word. Translated, it means: \nHow in the devil are they going to leave the country? In what order are \nthey going to leave the country? What unit goes first? When do NATO \nforces, KFOR, move in so that no vacuum is created? By ``vacuum,'' I \nmean when there are no Yugoslav forces in Kosovo.\n\n  That is what was going on. I got sick of hearing commentators on the \nair talking about how negotiations were going on between NATO and \nMilosevic. There were no negotiations. It was a total, complete \nsurrender by the Yugoslavs, as it should have been.\n  There is now a firm, verifiable timetable for withdrawal of all \nYugoslav and Serbian military, and all special police--those thugs who \nhave roamed the countryside in black masks, raping women, executing \nmen, and wreaking havoc on a civilian population. Those thugs--half of \nwhom are war criminals themselves, and should be indicted as such, like \nMilosevic--are required to leave. The worst of all are the \nparamilitaries. They all are also required to leave. If they do not \nleave, they will be killed or forcibly expelled.\n  As I speak, this withdrawal has begun, although I trust Mr. Milosevic \nand the Serbian military about as far as I could throw the marble \npodium behind which the Presiding Officer sits. I am not worried, \nbecause even if they default, I am convinced of the resolve of NATO. We \nwill pursue them. General Clark said 78 days ago that we would pursue \nthem and hunt them down. And we did. And we will again, if necessary.\n  The fundamental goal of NATO's air campaign has been achieved, \nnotwithstanding all the naysayers on this floor, all the talking heads \non television, and all the columnists.\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n  There has been an agreement for the return of all internally \ndisplaced persons and all Kosovar refugees who fled abroad. This is a \nmonumental achievement, as it involves well over 1 million people. Some \ncommentators have hesitated to call it a victory, but I do not. I \nunderstand why they hesitate to call it a victory. They called it a \nmistake up to now. So why would they call it a victory now?\n  It is a victory--a victory for NATO, a victory for the United States \nof America, a victory for Western values, a victory for human rights, \nand a victory for the rule of law. In personal terms, it is a victory \nfor President Clinton and his administration, which, despite \nunrelenting and often uninformed criticism that began almost \nimmediately, stayed the course.\n  I had some tactical disagreements with the way the administration \nproceeded. I don't think the President should have said at the outset \nthat ground forces were off the table. He had to move back on that and \nmake it clear that everything was on the table. That is susceptible to \ncriticism.\n  I point out, however, that the President of the United States of \nAmerica never once wavered on his commitment to do whatever it took to \nend this ethnic cleansing.\n  But, above all, it is a victory for the brave fighting men and women \nof NATO who carried out this air campaign, a majority of whom were \nAmericans. Conversely, it is an unmitigated defeat for an indicted war \ncriminal, the Yugoslav President, Slobodan Milosevic.\n  Just in case anyone wonders, he did not just become a war criminal. \nHe was already a war criminal in 1993 when I spoke to him. He was a war \ncriminal for his actions in Krajina. He was a war criminal for his \nactions in Bosnia. He is a war criminal for his actions in Kosovo. Had \nhe not been stopped, he would have continued his vile ethnic cleansing.\n  By the way, I encourage my colleagues to read the Genocide \nConvention. I will not take the time now to recount it, but what has \nbeen perpetrated by Milosevic in Kosovo is genocide.\n  Our victory, I suggest, shows that patience and resolve can pay off. \nIt should leave no doubt in the minds of the people throughout Europe \nand elsewhere in the world of the ability of a unified NATO to achieve \nits objectives. Now we have to move more swiftly to the second stage of \nthe Kosovo campaign--peace implementation.\n  I read with some dismay today in the major newspapers that the House \nof Representatives is considering denying the funds to allow any U.S. \nparticipation in the implementation of peace. They seem determined to \ncompound the mistake they made just several weeks ago. The \nreconstruction of Kosovo, as I said, and confirmed by my conversation \nwith the Secretary of State from Germany a half-hour ago, is primarily \nthe responsibility of the European Union.\n  I met with Helmut Kohl, the former Chancellor of Germany, just before \nthe 50th anniversary summit of NATO. We met over at the Library of \nCongress for the better part of an hour and had a lengthy discussion. \nHe is a very knowledgeable man and until last fall was the longest \nserving leader in Europe. He pointed out that there were 12 million \nrefugees in Europe after World War II, and that the Europeans were able \nto handle the problem. He pointed out that the fifteen countries of the \nEuropean Union have a combined gross domestic product larger than that \nof the United States of America. Anything remotely approaching a mini \nMarshall Plan is fully, totally, completely within the financial \ncapability of our European friends, and it is primarily their \nresponsibility. We should and must and will participate. But as I said \nto the President of the EU, as well as to the chancellor, and as well \nto every front-line state leader and every leader of the NATO alliance \nwith whom I met, the sharing of the reconstruction burden in \nsoutheastern Europe should not be as it is in NATO, roughly 75-25. It \nshould be more like 90-10. It is primarily their responsibility, and \nthey understand they will greatly benefit from a reconstructed and more \nunified southeastern Europe. I wish them well and hope their initiative \nwill succeed.\n  This ratio, as I said, should be juxtaposed with the heavy \nresponsibility we bore militarily in the Yugoslav campaign. The \noverwhelming majority of airstrikes when ordinance was dropped was \ncarried out by our forces, and we have footed the lion's share of the \nbill. We have done this as the leader of NATO and as the only military \npower in the alliance capable of shouldering the burden. I do not \ncomplain about America's shouldering more of the burden when no one \nelse is capable. But I do and will complain when others are equally or \nmore capable than we are, and they do not take the lion's share of the \nresponsibility. But in this case there is no argument, because the \nEuropeans understand their obligation in economic reconstruction, and \nthey are able and willing to carry it out. As I mentioned, they have \nalready demonstrated the willingness to take the lead by proposing a \nStability Pact for southeastern Europe, which at a later date I will \ndiscuss in detail. The European Union plan, in my view, should be \ncoordinated with our own ongoing SEED program, which has already \naccomplished much in economic and democratic reconstruction in the \nformer Communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe.\n  But the key question is the reconstruction of Serbia. There should be \nno reconstruction of Serbia as long as an indicted war criminal is \nYugoslavia's President, as long as he is on the political scene. Once \nthe Serbian people remove him, the Western World will be ready, \nwilling, and able to come to the aid of Serbia and do it gladly. I hope \nthat we will have the nerve to arrest Milosevic, send him to the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal at the Hague, and God willing, see him \nconvicted. Only then, only when Serb people understand the extent of \nthe atrocities Milosevic is responsible for, will they face up to the \nharsh reality of what they, quite possibility unintentionally, but \nnonetheless enabled to happen. It is time to end the perpetuation of \nthe myth that Serbia is a victim.\n  I do not propose to be able to say exactly when and how Milosevic \nwill leave office, but I predict there will be no Milosevic in power at \nthis time next year. I think his days are numbered for three reasons.\n  First of all, most Serbian citizens realize if Milosevic had accepted \nthe Rambouillet accords last February, they would have had \nsubstantially the same result but without having their country crippled \nby 11 weeks of bombing.\n  Second, as the troops return from Kosovo, the word will spread of the \nhorrible casualties the Serbian troops have suffered. They do not know \nthat yet because of the repressive Milosevic regime that manipulates \nthe news. The number of Serbian military, paramilitary and police \ncasualties will, I predict, total nearly 10,000. When the Serbian \npeople learn of this carnage, I predict they will be angry, not merely \nat NATO but at Milosevic for bringing this upon them. Ten thousand \nSerbian soldiers and special police were killed, many of them \nslaughtered in B-52 raids in the last days of the war when Milosevic \nwas stalling on signing the military technical agreement. When the \nextent of Serbian combat losses sinks in, there will be fury against \nMilosevic and his cronies.\n  Third, as KFOR--that is the acronym for the NATO implementation \nforce--occupies Kosovo, I am convinced that every prediction I made \nhere about the atrocities that were taking place will unfortunately be \nproven correct. You will be stunned at the evidence that will be \nuncovered of the brutality and the atrocities committed by the Serbians \non a mass scale, far greater than the horrible massacres we already \nknow about. These revelations, I believe, will further alienate the \nmany decent Serbs who rallied behind Milosevic as their patriotic duty \nduring the bombing campaign.\n  We know that KFOR's task will be a daunting one. Millions of mines \nmust be removed. All booby traps must be found and disposed of. And--I \ndo not know how it can be avoided--surely some NATO forces will be \nkilled. I pray to God that this will not happen. I pray to God that \nKFOR turns out as successful in that category as the military campaign \nhas, but I do not think we can count on that.\n  All armed locals and irregulars in Kosovo must be intimidated into \nsubmission. The KLA must be turned into\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\na demilitarized police force under civilian control.\n  All these will be difficult tasks, but I am confident that they can \nbe accomplished if we maintain resolve. Nothing, however, that happens \nfrom this point on can detract from the magnitude of the victory we \nhave achieved.\n  Had President Clinton heeded the call to negotiate with Milosevic, it \nwould have been a disaster.\n  Had President Clinton heeded the call to stop the bombing, it would \nhave been a disaster.\n  Had President Clinton heeded the call to run roughshod over our NATO \nallies and disregard their wishes, the alliance would have fractured \nand that, too, would have been a disaster. This place, including \nDemocrats, would have run out from under him faster than I can walk \nfrom here to the door of the Chamber. It is remarkable how he was able \nto keep the alliance together. Most importantly, had President Clinton \nnot stayed the course and achieved this victory, our geopolitical \nposition in North Korea, in Iraq, and in many other parts of the world \nwould have suffered grievously. I ask my colleagues to think about what \nat this moment Saddam Hussein is thinking. Had we listened to those who \nsaid: Cease and desist, partition, stop bombing, negotiate with \nMilosevic, cut a deal--what do you think would be happening in Baghdad \nnow?\n  But the President did stay the course, and our magnificent fighting \nmen and women performed in an exemplary way. Because we have succeeded \nin the military campaign, and because we have the ability to succeed in \nthe civilian reconstruction that will follow, the world has seen that \nthe President of the United States, the American people,, and a united \nNATO have the will to respond to crises and successfully defend Western \nvalues and interests.\n  I will be taking the floor again many more times in the following \nweeks on this issue. I know my colleagues are probably tired of my \nspeaking on this. It has been something I have been discussing since \n1990. But we are finally finding our sea legs.\n  I will conclude by saying that in the case of Kosovo and Yugoslavia, \nAmerican interests are at stake, the cause is just, the means are \navailable, and the will was present. For Lord's sake, let's not now, \nout of some misguided sense of isolationism or partisanship, do \nanything other than finalize this victory and secure our interests.\n  Think about it: the removal from Kosovo of the Serbian troops means, \nat a minimum, that Slobodan Milosevic's goons will no longer be able to \nharass, rob, rape, expel, or kill over a million Kosovars. I believe he \nhas lost his ability to overthrow the Montenegrin Government, and \ncertainly to overthrow Macedonia's government and to fundamentally \ndestabilize Albania, Romania, and Bulgaria. This is a significant \naccomplishment, but most importantly, it demonstrates that not only \nthis President, but also the next President, whether he or she is a \nRepublican or a Democrat, is going to be faced with very hard choices. \nI respectfully suggest that he or she should not underestimate the \nwill, the grit, the patience, or the common sense of the American \npeople. They know what we did was right.\n  I was in Macedonia. I have been in the region a half a dozen times. I \nhave also had the displeasure of meeting alone for almost 3 hours with \nSlobodan Milosevic, at which meeting, in early 1993, he asked what I \nthought of him. I told him then that I thought he was a damn war \ncriminal and should be tried as such. He looked at me as if I had said, \n``Lots of luck in your senior year.'' It did not phase him a bit. Even \nsome of my staff said as we were leaving: You said that to a President \nof a country.\n  I said: I don't care. He is a war criminal.\n  The justification of what we did was best summed up on my last trip a \nfew weeks ago. I was sitting in the airfield outside of Skopje in \nMacedonia. I walked into a tent where there were about 15 young \nAmericans ranging in age from 18 to 30, all noncommissioned officers. \nThey were the crew that was gathered together from all over the world \nto make that airfield compatible for our Apache helicopters and for the \nlarge C-130s that were flying in with food deliveries.\n  I walked in, and we started talking. They were taking a break. We \nwere sitting on cots. I thanked them for what they were doing. I said: \nYou know, I am getting a lot of heat back home. Some of my colleagues, \nincluding some of my seatmates, refer to this as ``Biden's war.'' Some \nof my friends are telling me this is another Vietnam. What are you \nguys--there was actually one woman--what do you all think about that? \nDo you think this is another Vietnam?\n  One, I believe a sergeant about 24 years old, looked at me and \nanswered: Senator, let me ask you a question. When you were 24 years \nold, if they had called you up and sent you here, would you have had \nany doubt about the justice of what you were doing?\n  All of a sudden it became clear to me. They had no doubt. Our young \nfighters have no doubt about the justness of what they have undertaken. \nThey knew it was right. We did the right thing.\n  I pray to God that we have the courage and the patience and the \nability to resist our partisan instincts on both sides and stay the \ncourse. Because if we do, we can bend history just a little, but bend \nit in a way that my grandchildren will not have to wonder about whether \nor not they will have to fight in Europe in the year 2020 or the year \n2025.\n  I congratulate the Senate for, at the end of the day, every day, \nhaving done the right thing in this war. I congratulate the President \nand his administration for having had the political courage to stay the \ncourse. I plead with my colleagues in the House to do the right thing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6837-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6837-S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have to rise to express my frustration \nwith our current circumstances. I have been doing all I could to assure \nthat we could bring this bill to closure.\n  We agreed to a limited number of amendments. We agreed to time limits \non those amendments. We have agreed to try to accelerate the \nconsideration of this bill in every way, shape, and form. Now we are \ntold we cannot have a vote on final passage until Tuesday.\n  That is totally inexplicable. We have been told over and over and \nover again this bill is so important and time-sensitive. We have been \ntold it cannot wait. We have been told we cannot take up other \nlegislation because we do not have time.\n  We have been on this bill for a couple of days. We have addressed \nevery concern Senators have raised. We have offered amendments. We have \nno reason this bill could not be completed today--no reason at all.\n  It is very hard for me to understand why, after all of this effort to \nbring us to this point, to have completed our work on the bill, we \ncannot bring this bill to closure, we cannot move on to other \nlegislation. There is just no reason for it.\n  I am very disappointed. It is very hard to ask my colleagues day \nafter day to cooperate, day after day to try to figure out a way to \ncomplete work on bills, and then be told: Well, we have changed our \nmind. We don't want to complete work on a bill. We are going to bump \nthis bill into next week. And, by the way, we are going to make up \nreasons to have votes.\n  That is not the way to run the Senate. It is not the way to do \nbusiness. It makes it very difficult to go back to colleagues and say: \nNow we have changed our mind again. We are going to try to finish this \nbill in 2 days. We are going to try to take something else up and work \nit through, but we want your cooperation.\n  That is unacceptable. I do not know why we cannot have the final \nvote. I do not know why we cannot finish the legislation. I do not know \nwhy we cannot find a way to resolve all the other outstanding issues \nthere are with regard to this bill this afternoon. We can do it this \nafternoon. It is only 2 o'clock.\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\n  I am told that all we have left only two or three. That is all we \nhave. We are told by the Republicans that there is no more time, that \nwe will not be allowed to go to final passage today.\n  As I say, it leaves me mystified. I am absolutely puzzled, \nexasperated. I do not understand. I just wish we had been told, because \nthere have been a lot of other amendments we could have offered on our \nside had we known we would have all this time. We were told: No. We \ndon't have time. Let's get this bill done, and let's get it to \nconference.\n  We are now not going to get to conference--not now, not tomorrow, not \nuntil next week.\n  There is no excuse.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that we have been pressed on getting \nthis bill to the floor for weeks and weeks; is that not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The deputy Democratic leader is right. There are \nabsolutely as many references to that in the Record as any legislation \nI know of this year, especially from the other side. The Senator from \nConnecticut has been so diligent and so arduous in recognizing how \nimportant this bill is and urging us to move through this and get it \ndone. He is on the floor. I am sure he would be more than happy to vote \non final passage this afternoon, but that will not happen.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask this question of the leader. We did not oppose \nthe motion to proceed; the minority did not oppose the motion to \nproceed. But I am of the impression and belief that there are a lot of \nother things due. The Patients' Bill of Rights, for example, isn't that \nsomething that we need to move forward on?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We certainly do need to move forward on that. We have \nsuggested 20 amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Recognizing \nthat there could be 60 or 70 amendments, given the way many Senators \nfeel about that important piece of legislation, we have said not 60, \nnot 50, not 40, but 20 amendments, and time limits on those amendments. \nThe answer was, well, there may not be time to do 20 amendments.\n  Here we are today. We were told that there wasn't time to do 15 \namendments on this bill.\n  I have to give great credit to our ranking member, the manager on our \nside. He could have filibustered this legislation. I know how he feels \nabout it. He could have been out here making the Senate go through all \nthe hoops. We have talked about this. In the interest of expediting the \nlegislation, moving this through, the Senator graciously has \nacknowledged that there will be another day. We will work through this \nin conference. The Senator has said that more than anybody. Ironically, \nthe one man who could have held this thing up for weeks, if not months, \nis sitting here ready to vote. It is really an irony, it seems to me, \nthat in spite of all the attention about expediting this bill, in spite \nof all the pressure and all the effort made to express the urgency of \ngetting this done, we sit here this afternoon, at 2 o'clock, waiting \nfor final passage.\n  Mr. REID. One final question to the leader. We have, as I understand \nit, about 203 days left until the Y2K date arrives. If we wait now \nuntil Tuesday to vote on this, we are going to have less than 200 days \nto get this legislation passed, to get it to conference, to get it to \nthe President. Each day that goes by, it seems to me, is very critical \nto the passage of this legislation. Is that not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That was the whole reason we agreed to be as expeditious \nas possible. I am going to vote against final passage. I hope a number \nof my colleagues will join me in doing that. But that doesn't mean I do \nnot want a bill. I have said repeatedly on the Senate floor I want a \nbill, but I want the right bill. The only way we are going to get to \nthe right bill is to continue to work on it. We are not going to do \nthat this afternoon. We are not going to do that tomorrow. We are not \ngoing to do that Monday. We are now going to have to wait \nuntil Tuesday. So that just delays for another week the prospects of \nmeaningful compromise and meaningful resolution of the outstanding \nquestions.\n\n  Mr. REID. But the leader and other Senators voted for a version of \nthis bill yesterday; is that not true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Absolutely. We voted for a version the President can \nsign yesterday. He said he would sign it. I am very hopeful he will \nsign a bill. We can't go through the rest of this year without some \nresolution to this issue. But it is disappointing to me that we are not \nin a position to resolve this matter today, this afternoon, so that he \ncan sign the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the distinguished leader is manifestly \ncorrect.\n  I was told, let's not even have a cloture vote, because looking at \nthis measure, there could be three more cloture votes. And viscerally, \nnot next Tuesday, I hope we do not vote until Tuesday 2001, the way I \nfeel about it. But I entered public service to get some things done. \nYou win some; you lose some. You have to go along.\n  This is embarrassing to the body. Here we are, the Senate, talking \nabout all the important things to get done and everything else of that \nkind. So we yield. We talk Senators into not offering their amendments. \nWe finally get time agreements on all of the amendments on this side so \nno one has been in a proliferation or stretchout or extended debate. We \nwere even forced to vote early last night to make sure we cleared the \nway to finish this afternoon.\n  All we have is Senator Sessions' amendment and Senator Gregg's \namendment, two amendments that could be disposed of in the next hour. \nIn fact, the manager and our chairman, Senator McCain, has been \nyielding back his time and ready to vote. So it could be less than an \nhour. By 2:30 this afternoon, we could be finished with the bill.\n  My question is, why do we want to wait and palaver and waste time and \nnot go on to some of these important measures this afternoon? We are \nhere and we are ready to go.\n  I thank the minority leader and the whip for their particular \ncomments, because we have been riding all the Senators pretty hard to \nlimit the amendments and to have time agreements. Let's get moving. \nSenator McCain wanted to move the bill. We said so. I know the \nRepublican screen all week long said they are going to finish this \nafternoon. I can't understand the change of pace now, to do nothing but \ntalk to each other all afternoon. What a distressing situation this is, \nand no votes tomorrow and on Monday and just wait until Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we continue to attempt to negotiate a way \nin which to deal with the Boxer amendment in a way that we hope can be \nworked out, Senators Gregg and Sessions then be recognized to offer \nthose amendments, and that the bill be advanced to third reading, \nsubstitute the House bill for it and then vote on final passage at 2:15 \non Tuesday. We will then begin on Monday, as I have been given to \nunderstand it, to do the energy and water appropriations bill, which we \nmay very well be able to complete on Monday.\n  I do find it interesting that the Senator from South Carolina, who \nsuccessfully, on two occasions, prevented this current bill from coming \nup at all by filibusters and saw to it that cloture could not be \ninvoked, is now so anxious to finish it.\n  We think this is a very good bill. I said yesterday I hoped that it \nwas stronger, but it is the result of negotiations that have involved \nMembers of both parties. To let the country and the industry look at it \nover the weekend and to allow both sides on the outside of the Senate \nto communicate their desires to Senators is a highly appropriate method \nof dealing with the bill. We will soon propound a unanimous consent \nproposal to the end that I have just described, and we hope that that \nunanimous consent will be granted.\n  We will finish most of the debate, I suspect, the debate on all of \nthe amendments to this bill, before this evening, and then go forward \nwith final passage on Tuesday.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n[[Page S6839]]\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, as I understand the Senator from \nWashington, he has not propounded the request. Listening to the \nrequest, this Senator is perfectly willing to go along with every \nelement of it, save and excepting right after the disposition of the \nSessions and Gregg amendments, we then vote on final passage.\n  I don't understand the delay, because those two amendments can easily \nbe handled within the hour. So we can vote early this afternoon and go \non with the business of the Senate. We have very important work to do. \nYes, I was the one who held it up, but it didn't hold up any \nconsideration of other things, I can tell you that. They immediately \nkept filing cloture, as they will to other measures. I don't feel badly \nabout that, because it wasn't really a holdup.\n  When they finally persuaded me they had the votes and they were going \nto really move with this thing, then I got into a movement disposition \nand persuaded our colleagues on this side of the aisle to limit their \namendments, to give time agreements. Now we are ready to go, and here \nat the last minute, for no good reason at all, other than the \nbemusement of the distinguished Senator from Washington, he won't agree \nto vote when we get through with all amendments, which will be the \nSessions and the Gregg amendments. Once they are disposed of, let's go \nright ahead to final passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6839-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6839-S6840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SENATOR STEVENS' 12,000TH VOTE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last afternoon, Senator Stevens cast his \n12,000th rollcall vote. Many of my colleagues joined in commending \nSenator Stevens on this very worthwhile and considerable \naccomplishment. I was not on the floor at that time. Today, I join in \ncommending Senator Stevens on having cast his 12,000th vote.\n  Since arriving in the U.S. Senate on December 24, 1968, Senator \nStevens has worked tirelessly on matters relating to defense and \nnational security. Having served in World War II, as a pilot in the \nChina-Burma-India theater, Senator Stevens was awarded the \nDistinguished Flying Cross twice, two air medals, and the Yuan Hai \nmedal awarded by the Republic of China.\n  He joined the Appropriations Committee on February 23, 1972, and 3 \nyears later he began service on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, where he has served continuously since that time, and \nserved with great distinction. Since he became chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee in 1981, Senator Stevens has served either \nas chairman or ranking member of that vitally important subcommittee. \nAs of January 1997, Senator Stevens assumed additional responsibilities \nthat come with being named chairman of the Committee on Appropriations.\n  I have worked by his side on many, many occasions on subcommittees, \nparticularly on the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I have served \nwith him on matters that have come before the Committee on \nAppropriations, where I now serve as his ranking member. In addition, \nfor many years, I have been privileged to have the honor of serving \nwith Senator Stevens on the Arms Control Observer Group, as well as on \nthe British-American Parliamentary Group.\n\n  Senator Stevens works indefatigably to ensure that his State of \nAlaska receives appropriate consideration in all matters that come \nbefore the Senate. He does that work and does it well. The people of \nAlaska can be preeminently proud of the service that their Senator, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee of the Senate, performs. He \nworks for Alaska every day, and he works for the Nation every day.\n  Not only do I consider him one of the most distinguished and one of \nthe most capable Senators with whom I have served in more than 41 years \nnow, I also count him as a dear and trusted friend. I was in the Middle \nEast when Ted Stevens was in the airplane crash in which he lost his \nwife, and I called him from the plane in which I was flying in the \nMiddle East on that occasion. He was in the hospital. I talked with him \nand, of course, I was glad that he had survived the tragic accident.\n  Ted Stevens is a friend who can be always trusted. A handshake with \nTed Stevens is his bond, and his word is his bond. I have always found \nhim to be very trustworthy. I have always found him to be very fair, \nvery considerate. He is a gentleman. I think all of my colleagues on my \nside on the Appropriations Committee treasure their friendship with Ted \nStevens. So I congratulate him on his new milestone and what has been \nand continues to be a most remarkable career in public service.\n  There are many things about Ted Stevens that we can admire. I admire \nhis spunk. I was saying to someone on my staff today that he would be \none whale of a baseball team manager. He would take on all of the \numpires if he thought they didn't call the plays right. He sticks up \nfor what he believes. He has the courage of his convictions, and I \ncertainly would not want to be a player on his team in the locker room \nif I lost a ball game through some error on my part.\n  He is a hard driver. He works hard every day. He represents his \npeople in the Senate, and he reverences the Senate and, perhaps best of \nall, he is, as I have already said, a gentleman. He thinks, as I do, \nthat there are some things more important than political party. The \nU.S. Senate happens to be one of them, as far as I am concerned, and, I \nbelieve, as far as he is concerned.\n  Let me now say that I am extremely proud of Ted Stevens. He is a \nwonderful family man. He loves his family; he loves his daughter, Lily, \nand his other children.\n  Let me close by what I think is an appropriate bit of verse written \nby William Wordsworth. The title of it is, ``Character of the Happy \nWarrior.'' I will not read the entire poem, but extracts from it I \nthink will be useful in this regard:\n\n     Who is the happy Warrior? Who is he\n     That every man in arms should wish to be?\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     'Tis he whose law is reason; who depends\n     Upon that law as on the best of friends;\n     Whence, in a state where men are tempted still\n     To evil for a guard against worse ill,\n     And what in quality or act is best\n     Doth seldom on a right foundation rest,\n     He labors good on good to fix, and owes\n     To virtue every triumph that he knows:\n     --Who, if he rise to station of command,\n     Rises by open means; and there will stand\n     On honorable terms, or else retire,\n     And in himself possess his own desire;\n     Who comprehends his trust, and to the same\n     Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;\n     And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait\n     For wealth, or honors, or for worldly state;\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law\n     In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;\n     Or if an unexpected call succeed,\n     Come when it will, is equal to the need:\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n     `Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,\n     Conspicuous object in a Nation's eye,\n     Or left unthought-of in obscurity--\n     Who, with a toward or untoward lot,\n     Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not--\n     Plays, in the many games of life, that one\n     Where what be most doth value must be won:\n     Whom neither shape of danger can dismay,\n     Nor thought of tender happiness betray;\n     Who, not content that former worth stand fast,\n     Looks forward, preserving to the last,\n     From well to better, daily self-surpassed:\n     Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth\n     Forever, and to noble deeds give birth,\n     Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,\n     And leave a dead unprofitable name--\n     Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;\n     And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws\n     His breath in confidence of Heaven's applause:\n     This is the happy Warrior; this is He\n     That every Man in arms should wish to be.\n\n  That, Mr. President, in my judgment, is Ted Stevens, ``The Happy \nWarrior.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is his misfortune, the Senator from \nAlaska, to not be here on the floor to listen to those eloquent and \ngracious remarks of the Senator from West Virginia. So I think it falls \nto me, inadequate as I am, to thank the Senator from West Virginia for \nthose thoughts and to say that it reminds those of us who have not been \nhere quite so long of the magnificence of the personal relationships \nthat are created here by broad-minded Members like the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senator from Alaska\n\n[[Page S6840]]\n\nover the years, even though I suspect that during many of those 12,000 \nrollcalls--literally thousands of them--they voted on opposite sides, \nsometimes with views that were very strongly held.\n  I think it is only the Senator from West Virginia and perhaps the \nPresident pro tempore who will cast more votes than Senator Stevens, \nwho I note now is here, and I would rather he speak for himself.\n  But I say, Mr. President, through you to the Senator from Alaska, \nthat I was privileged to hear the eloquent remarks about the Senator \nfrom Alaska on this occasion that the Senator from West Virginia made. \nThey do great credit to him, and they do equal credit to the Senator \nwho made them.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nWashington for his very gracious remarks.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am embarrassed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My daughter just graduated from high school. We had a \nlittle event. They called to tell me that my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia, was making remarks about my \nhaving followed him to this floor for 12,000 times. We have been \npartners for a long time. I am grateful to the Senator from West \nVirginia for his comments. I look forward to reading them. I am sad \nthat I was not here to listen to them. But knowing the Senator, I know \nthey were eloquent, and I am proud to be the recipient of his comments.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, let me thank and join in with the \ncomments made by our distinguished leader, Senator Byrd from West \nVirginia.\n  No one knows the history and appreciates the history of the Senate \nbetter than Senator Byrd and the compliment thereof. He reminded me, \nwhen he talked about the fatal crash that Senator Stevens was involved \nin, I had just traveled with Senator Stevens and his first wife, Annie. \nWe were in Cairo, Egypt, out on the Nile to a conference with Anwar \nSadat. We stopped in Madrid. I will never forget it. My wife and Annie \ntook a quick trip, as we were being briefed. There was the purchase of \na cut-glass bowl, and Annie Stevens had that in her lap, and that plane \nwent head over heels. It broke Senator Stevens' arm, and it cost her \nlife, but there was not a crack in the bowl.\n  I can tell you from the early days when I first got up here in 1966 \nthat I used to hold the hearings for Senator Bob Bartlett up there in \nSeattle with Dixie Lee Ray and John Lindberg and all on oceanography \nand what have you, and then go up to Alaska to Point Barrow.\n  There is no closer friend in the Senate to me than Ted Stevens of \nAlaska. I am his admirer. I like his fights. Senator Byrd was more \ntactful about describing it, but I am telling you right now, when he \ngets worked up, get out of the way right now, because he is going to \nget it done one way or the other, and he is not yielding. He has that \nconviction of conscience that really guides all of us in our service up \nhere.\n  Over the many years, we visited, we traveled, we worked together, and \nwe have been identified both on the Appropriations Committee and on the \nCommerce Space Science Transportation Committee. Senator Stevens long \nsince could have been chairman of that Commerce Space Science \nTransportation Committee, but he elected to take over at the \nappropriations level. As a result, Alaska is well served. I can tell \nyou that. It is filled up.\n  They used to say about my backyard with Mendel Rivers that if he got \none more facility, Charleston, SC, was going to sink below the sea. I \nthink second in line for that kind of result would be Alaska as a \nresult of the diligence for the local folks.\n  I will never forget; we traveled up to Point Barrow. The Natives had \nerected a cross and a statue to Annie Stevens who was lost in that \nwreck.\n  I want to emphasize that more than anything else--of course, his \nwonderful wife, Catherine, and his daughter, Lily--that he might make \n12,000 votes, but he will miss votes, I can tell you, to be there with \nLily. In fact, we had planned during the August break to take another \nsurvey trip, and he said: Oh no. Lily goes to Stanford then. We have to \nput it off until later.\n  You have to admire that about an individual, as busy as we get and as \nwound up as we get with the important affairs of state, to never forget \nthe personal responsibilities, and the love and that Ted has for his \nfamily, and, of course, for each of us in the Senate. He is most \nrespectful. He works both sides of the aisle. As a result of that, he \nis most effective.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6840-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6840-S6843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from California \nis now back on the floor, and we are dealing with her amendment.\n  There was an extensive effort to reach agreement on a form of that \namendment. Regrettably those efforts were not successful. There simply \nis a significant difference of opinion on the policies that it \npropounds. I intend to speak for a relatively short period of time in \nopposition to the amendment. I am certain that the Senator from \nCalifornia would like to speak for her amendment. I know the Senator \nfrom Connecticut is here, and I know the Senator from California wishes \nto speak.\n\n  Shortly after that succession is completed, if there is no one else \nwho wishes to participate in the debate, there will be a motion to \ntable the Boxer amendment.\n  The Boxer amendment requires, as a part of the remediation, that a \nmanufacturer make available to a plaintiff a repair or replacement at \ncost for any product first introduced after January 1, 1990, and at no \ncharge under the same circumstances for a product first introduced for \nsale after the end of 1994.\n  The amendment is overwhelmingly too broad. For example, the Internal \nRevenue Service allows, at most, 5, and in many cases only 3, years in \nwhich to write off the cost of products of this nature, determining \nthat is their useful life. If they are used in a business, therefore, \nthey have been depreciated to a zero value in every case--not every \ncase covered by this matter, but in the vast majority of the cases \ncovered by this amendment.\n  In many of these cases, under the second subsection, it simply means \nthat the plaintiff is entitled to absolutely free replacement. That \ncomputer, if it is a home computer, may long since have been relegated \nto the attic, unused. Yet the original manufacturer would have to \nreplace it. In many cases, the new parts would not work. A 1990 \ncomputer is not very readily upgradeable. It does not have the speed or \nthe memory of a 1999 computer. Y2K problems are probably the least of \nthe problems with which such a manufacturer is faced.\n  I spoke yesterday on the bill as a whole, the tremendous way in which \nour lives and technology have been changed by this revolution; 1990 is \nseveral generations ago with respect both to hardware and to software. \nHow do we go about doing this? Precisely what products are covered?\n  We simply have a situation in which the amendment is too broad and \nmissing in specificity. We have an attempt to amend a bill that is \ndesigned to discourage litigation and to limit litigation that, if \nadopted, will significantly increase the amount of litigation and the \nnumber of causes of action that would take place without any \nlegislation at all.\n  In other words, this amendment would create new causes of action that \nprobably do not exist anywhere under present law. Under those \ncircumstances, while we should certainly encourage remediation and \nfixes, this might well have exactly the opposite impact. We have all \nkinds of duties listed in here with respect to manufacturers--and to \nothers, for that matter. It is not only unnecessary to add this new \nduty and this new potential for causes of action, this proposal is 180 \ndegrees in opposition.\n  Therefore, with regret and sorrow that we were not able to work it \nout, I must for myself, and I suspect for a majority of the Senate, \nobject to the amendment and trust we will soon have a vote on that \nsubject.\n\n[[Page S6841]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nnot moving to table at this time so I have an opportunity to respond to \nhis comments.\n  I want the Senate to understand those who are supporting this bill \ncame back to this Senator with a suggestion on how I could change the \namendment so it would be agreeable to them. We agreed with their \nchanges. We said fine, we are willing to back off a little bit.\n  Guess what happened? My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nstill would not accept it.\n  It is not the Senator from California who was unwilling to make the \namendment more workable to the other side. It was the other side who \nrecommended a change. When we said OK, they decided it was still \nunacceptable.\n  I don't quite understand it. Now there is going to be a motion to \ntable this amendment.\n  I see the Senator from Illinois is on the floor. I wanted to make \nsure he understood we were negotiating to try to reach an agreement. We \nwere offered some changes. Even though we did not think they were \nperfect, we accepted them. The other side, however, continues to \nresist.\n  I don't know whom they checked with, but it was not the consumers, \nbecause this is the only proconsumer amendment that I thought had a \nchance to make it into this bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Did I understand the Senator from California to say this \nwas part of the original legislation on this subject, the idea that the \nbusinesses which bought the computers and the software that didn't work \nwould at least have some help in repairing it so they could keep their \nbusinesses going and not shut down and cost jobs? Is it correct that \nthis was originally part of the proposal?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Senator is exactly right.\n  The proposal I had in the form of this amendment was taken almost \nverbatim from a bill that was offered by two Republican House Members, \nChris Cox and David Dreier, very good friends of the business \ncommunity. The concept for my amendment was essentially taken from that \nbill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the gentlelady yield?\n  I think the Senator makes a very good point. The Senator said at \nvarious times this is a consumer amendment, this is a probusiness \namendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. No question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We are talking about small and medium-sized businesses, \ndependent on computers, that discover, January 2, the year 2000, they \nhave a serious problem.\n  What the Senator from California is suggesting is, if it is an old \ncomputer, one that goes back over 5 years, they would have to pay the \ncost of whatever the repair; if it has been purchased in the last 5 \nyears--a period of time when everyone generally sensed this problem was \ncoming--the computer company would fix it without charge.\n  A lot of businesses would retain the ability to keep going, making \ntheir products and keeping their people working.\n  This is not just proconsumer, this is probusiness. It troubles me to \nsee so many business groups lined up against this amendment. It seems \nto me counterintuitive.\n  I think what the Senator from California is doing is showing \nsensitivity that virtually all friends of business should show in this \nlegislation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  I think the amendment pending--which, unfortunately, the other side \nis going to move to table--is a proconsumer, probusiness, pro-ordinary \nperson amendment. It is a commonsense amendment.\n  It simply says to the manufacturer, if you have a fix available and \nyou determine you do, then fix the problem. We are only talking about \ncomputers that were made in the last 10 years. We are exempting all the \nrest.\n  We are not adding an undue burden. There are a lot of good people out \nthere who are making the fixes. We are saying to the rest of business, \nemulate that, fix the problem, and there will be no lawsuits, no \nwaiting at the courthouse door; you will be able to get your computer \nback in operation, you will be able to keep your business going and \ngrowing.\n  For some reason, the other side cannot see their way clear to \naccepting this.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Will the Senator yield?\n  I want to credit Senator Durbin for educating this Senator. These \nfellows have to come over from the House and tell Senators how to act. \nI never heard ``gentlelady,'' but now I like it.\n  If the distinguished gentlelady will yield, I have been here since, \nof course, the beginning of the debate. It has been what they call \npredatory legalistic, predatory legal practices, lawsuits, racing to \nthe courthouse, running to the courthouse, picking out someone down the \nline with deep pockets.\n  The distinguished Senator, as I understand it, is only asking for a \nfix. The amendment is not asking to race to the courthouse, but to race \naway from the courthouse.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just get a fix.\n  And now they don't even want to agree on fixing the thing.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Maybe if we keep to this debate long enough, they, on \nthe other side of the aisle, will ask us to send money to the poor \ncomputer industry. We ought to take up contributions. We have to change \nthe laws for them. All we want to do is get the computer fixed, but now \nthey even oppose that.\n  Is that the case? Isn't that the amendment, really--to get it fixed? \nIt has nothing to do with bringing a legal proceeding or economic loss \nor any of that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is so right. We do not touch one thing in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I see. I thank the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. As it relates to lawsuits, it has the same exact \nprovisions. All we say is, if a manufacturer has a fix available, do \nthe fix. Be a good actor. Be good corporate citizens. Do what most of \nthe fine companies are doing up and down the State of California and \nthroughout the country. They knew this problem was coming, and the good \nones have done something about it. This amendment, frankly, was brought \nto me by the consumer groups. They said: You know, no one is really \ntalking about fixing the problem. They are all talking about legalisms \nhere. It made so much sense to me.\n  It was brought to me by the consumer groups, taken straight out of \nthe Chris Cox-David Dreier original Y2K legislation. But we cannot even \nget ourselves here to support this very simple matter.\n  As a matter of fact, Cox-Dreier went even further than my amendment. \nLet me tell you what they said. They said, if you do not do the fix and \nyou had the fix, you do not get the protections of the underlying bill. \nImagine. David Dreier and Chris Cox. And when I looked at that, I said, \nthat is a little tough on my computer people; I am not going to go that \nfar. All we say is, if you have a fix and you do not do it, then if you \ndo sue, the judge has to consider all these facts when he or she \ndetermines the damages to be awarded, if any.\n  So here we have a proconsumer amendment. My friends on the other side \ncome back with some changes to it. I say: Fine, I am willing to do it. \nAnd they say: Oh, never mind, never mind.\n  If we vote down this amendment, I say to my friends, there is nothing \nin this bill, that I see, that does anything for consumers. There is \nnothing in this bill that helps them. There is nothing in this bill \nthat helps, by the way, the good corporate actors out there who are \nalready doing the right thing. All this is about is protecting the bad \nactors, the bad folks who are not doing the right thing, who, if they \nare listening to this debate and if they are smart--and believe me, \nthey are smart--what are they hearing? Hey, if you are really fixing \nmatters now, cool it. Why do it? Why spend any money? Under this \nunderlying bill, you do not have to do a thing.\n  I am just a normal person here, not a lawyer, OK? Maybe that is part \nof my problem. They call it a remediation period: 30-day notice. You \nnotify the manufacturer that you have a problem. They have to write \nback. Good, that is\n\n[[Page S6842]]\n\nthe McCain bill. They have to write back.\n  Then you have a 60-day remediation period, but nothing is required of \nyou. What are you remediating? We say, if there is a remediation \nperiod, let's make that terminology mean something: Remediate. It is a \n60-day period. We ought to fix the problem.\n  The Boxer amendment, supported by Senators Durbin and Hollings and \nTorricelli and others, simply says let's make the remediation period \ntrue to its name.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. As I look at this legislation which we are considering, \nthe underlying bill, it is hard to argue with it. It starts out saying:\n  The majority of responsible business enterprises in the United States \nare committed to working in cooperation with their contracting partners \ntowards the timely and cost-effective resolution of the many \ntechnological, business and legal issues associated with the Y2K date \nchange.\n\n  That is the first paragraph of this bill. It is a perfect description \nof the Senator's amendment, because it says responsible businesses will \nbe working to solve problems. In my colleague's situation, she is \nproviding a means of resolving the problem short of going to court. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Exactly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So those who are truly interested in the damage done to \nbusinesses must really step back and say the Boxer amendment is one \nthat really addresses the damage that businesses will face--repeating, \nagain: These are businesses depending on computers that may shut down \nbecause the computer they purchased is not proper, is not ready to deal \nwith the new century.\n  That is what this legislation, the amendment, is all about: Find a \nway to help these people stay in business. Responsible businesses \ndealing with responsible businesses, not racing off to court, not \nplaying with lawyers. I am stunned that at this point the amendment by \nthe Senator from California just has not been adopted. It troubles me \nwhen I think about it in the context of the underlying bill.\n  If the people who are bringing this bill to the floor do not care \nthat much about small and medium-sized businesses that will face the \ndelays, face the layoffs, because of Y2K problems, this is not a \nprobusiness bill. This is for an elite group of bad actors in an \nindustry who have not done their homework and do not want to be held \nresponsible for their bad conduct. That, to me, is not what we should \nbe doing on the floor of the Senate.\n  I think the Senator from California, when you take a look at the \nfirst paragraph of this bill, really has an amendment that addresses \nthe bottom line.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my friend.\n  As we pointed out earlier in this debate, when I hear people get up \nand talk about the high-tech industry and how great the high-tech \nindustry is, I know it firsthand because I come from Silicon Valley \ncountry. I meet these people. I am in awe of them. And they are good. \nThey are good at what they do. The vast majority of them are taking \ncare of this problem. They ought to be encouraged to continue taking \ncare of this problem. We should not reward those who are not taking \ncare of the problem, who are riding along as if they did not know.\n  I just love that quote from the Apple people. I do not have it here \nin front of me, but it is something like:\n  We may not know a lot of things, but we knew the century was ending.\n  At some point people said, ``Whoops, there is going to be a \nproblem.'' I guarantee it was well before 1990. But I think we are \nbeing very careful in this amendment not to place an undue burden on \nthese people. We are saying you can recover your costs from 1990 to \n1995; prior to that, you can charge anything you want. We really are \nbeing fair in this amendment.\n  I am stunned we did not get this amendment accepted. I cannot tell \nyou the feeling I have. I am amazed, because when I think about the \nbeginnings of this bill--I remember being excited I was going to be the \nChair on the Y2K problem, because I was in line to take that. I asked \nSenator Dodd if he could do it, because it was a tough time for me; I \nhad an election, and I had my regular job. I knew I could not do it \njustice. I knew this was going to be a problem, and I wanted to make \nsure we could help consumers fix the problem and we could do it in a \nway that was fair to business.\n  The 90-day cooling off period is a good idea, in my opinion. That is \nwhy I supported the Kerry bill, and I hope eventually that will be the \nbill that will become law. But the 90-day cooling off period does not \nmean you sit there with a fan. That is not my idea of a 90-day cooling \noff period.\n  A 90-day cooling off period should be a time for everyone to sit \nback, see what the problem is, fix it, and remediate the problem.\n  I have to ask my friend, Senator Hollings, who knows this bill like \nthe back of his hand far better than I do, I keep reading to see what \nthe requirement is in this cooling off period for the businesses. All I \ncome up with, and please correct me if I am mistaken, is that once a \ncompany is notified that a consumer has a problem, under this bill, to \nget the protections of this bill, all that company has to do is write \nback to the consumer and say: Yes, I got your letter; I am looking at \nthe problem; I don't know what I am going to do, but I will stay in \ntouch with you.\n  That is my understanding of what you have to do to meet the \nrequirements to be protected by this, essentially, rewrite of the laws \nof our land. I want to know if I am correct or incorrect.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The distinguished Senator from California is manifestly \ncorrect. We all live in a real world, and then what really happens, as \nwe learned from Rosemary Woods, if you want to get rid of evidence, if \nyou want to lay the blame--I am the lawyer for the computer company, \nand when I am notified about this particular claim and it comes across \nmy desk, let's find out now why this thing really occurred, and if we \ncan put it off and save the company some money on that part made in \nIndia, then we will get on to that or we will move it around here.\n  What that does is it gives them 60 days to prepare all the defenses \nand even engage in interrogatories and depositions, which you are not \nallowed to do because you are the one required under this bill to stand \nback and cool off; whereas, I can come immediately then with my \ninterrogatories and my depositions and pretty well have the case lined \nup during that 3-month period. Then I will know whether it pays for the \ncompany, because I am the lawyer, and I want to stay on it as a lawyer, \nmy game is to save the company money. I say: Look, don't worry about \nthat; we are going to send them to India to try that case and let them \nkeep on making motions, because it is going to cost you $30,000 to fix \nit.\n  They just sent a doctor in New Jersey $25,000 as a fix for a purchase \nhe made the year before for only $13,000. That is why it is silent. \nEverybody knows how they draw up these bills and what really occurs. \nThe company is allowed to engage in all kinds of shenanigans--\ndepositions, interrogatories, prepare defenses--and the poor plaintiff, \nthe injured party, is going out of business; he is losing his \ncustomers. He tells his employees: I cannot make this monthly payment. \nI am not getting any money. I am closing down.\n  The employees are angry. What the Senator from California has in her \nbill is just perfect: a fix. That is all we want. Out with the lawyers, \nin with the fix. That is the Boxer amendment. The way the bill reads, \nthe Senator has it analyzed correctly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Basically, what we are saying is the amendment is: \nRemediate and you will not need to litigate. That is basically this \namendment. Remediate and you will not have to litigate. Just fix the \nproblem, and let's get on with our lives.\n  I want to ask my friend another question. Let's say in this year, \ntoday, I am a small businessperson. I run a small travel agency, say, \nout of my home. I am very computer dependent. I go to a store. I buy a \ncomputer. They say it is Y2K compliant; it is not going to be a \nproblem. I have it just a few months, say, 6 months. I wake up on that \nday and it is down, and it is down the next day, and it is down the \nnext day.\n  I want to talk about what happens under the McCain bill. What do I \ndo? As I understand it, I write to the company, and I say: I am \nstunned. I bought it 6 months ago. I spent $15,000 for it, and it isn't \nworking.\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\n  Under this bill, as I understand it, if they do not accept this Boxer \namendment, which clearly they are not, and if it is not adopted, which \nit probably will not be, as I understand it, all the company has to do \nis write back and say: We got your notification; we will stay in touch \nwith you.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right? Now they qualify for the special protections under \nthis law. They do not have to fix it. They certainly do not have to fix \nit for free.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Exactly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. If they fix it, they can charge more than what the \ncomputer costs. My friend has proof of that; does he not?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is exactly right. That came out at the hearings. \nWitnesses have attested to it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. The bottom line is, if we do not adopt this Boxer \namendment, then what is in this bill to encourage fixing the problem? \nThis is ironic, because the idea is to stop the litigation, fix the \nproblem, have a cooling off period where we remediate the problem.\n  David Dreier and Chris Cox in 1998 understood it. They put it in \ntheir bill. My friends on the other side, having indicated they would \nbe inclined to take this amendment with some changes, I agreed to those \nchanges. Yet, we were still unable to reach an agreement.\n  I am perplexed, I say to my friend. What are we doing here anyway? \nWhat is this about? Is this about protecting the consumer? Is this \nabout getting things fixed? Is this about standing proud of the good \ncomputer companies that are making the fix?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. The last thing a computer purchaser, a user wants to \nget involved with is law. That is the last thing. That is what they are \nsaying in the bill. The intent of the McCain measure provides you do \nnot get into racing to the courthouse.\n  The answer to the Senator's question is, that is exactly what is \nrequired; namely, I am a computer purchaser and user and it goes on the \nblink. I am trying to get in touch with them, and they know the laws. I \nnever heard of the law. They will not hear of it, whatever it is. I \nhave written a letter, and I keep calling, and like the doctor from New \nJersey who testified before the Commerce Committee said, he called at 2 \nweeks, 3 weeks and nothing happened. They like that, because the \ncomputer operator and purchaser do not know anything about these \nspecial laws and provisions of the McCain measure.\n  What happens is, it puts them into a bunch of legal loopholes. It \nactually engages a consumer in a bunch of laws that are unique only to \nhim, and he never has heard of and he is going to have to learn the \nhard way about putting a letter in, certain days to cool off, then do \nthis, and all these other measures.\n  Heaven's above, it is so clearly brought out in Senator Boxer's \namendment that all we want to do is get the blooming thing fixed and \nget away. Out with the lawyers and in with the fix. That is what the \nSenator is saying, but they do not even accept it.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know, and I am just completely astounded. I have to \nbelieve the people who vote against this amendment may not want to be \naround here on January 3, or whenever it is we get back. People are \ngoing to be calling. They are going to say: We heard all about this Y2K \nbill; didn't you fix our problem?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. No, we created a problem.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Right. They are going to call up their Senator: Senator \nso and so, you were proud to stand here for that Y2K bill. What did it \ndo?\n  I view it as an insult to the good people in the Silicon Valley, to \nthe good people in San Diego, to the good people in Los Angeles who \nwork at this night and day, who knew the century was going to end and \ntook steps to prepare for this day, who are making fixes.\n  Now what happens? The people who were irresponsible are getting a \nloud message from this Senate, particularly when they vote down this \nBoxer amendment: Oh, boy, we did the right thing by not fixing \nanybody's computer. We did the right thing just to sit back and see \nwhat happens. We have been protected by the most deliberative body in \nthe world; they protected us from not doing the right thing.\n\n  I just do not get it around here. Sometimes I wonder for whom we are \nhere. I do not get it, because to not have this amendment accepted, the \nonly people you are helping are the people who do not want to make the \nfix. It is outrageous to me. This amendment is probusiness, it is pro \nthe good businesspeople, the good corporate citizens. I just do not get \nit. It would reward those who have not done the fixes.\n  I have run out of arguments. I have a hunch that minds are made up. I \ndon't know how I get that feeling. But I have a feeling that minds are \nmade up on this, that this is going to be tabled. We will have a bill, \nthen, that has not one thing in it for the consumers of this country. I \nhave news for the people who are not going to vote for this: Every \nsingle American is a consumer, bottom line. I hope they rethink their \nposition. I was willing to compromise and get a good amendment through, \nbut, unfortunately, the other side could not agree to that. Let's get \non with the vote. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it constantly amazes me, whether the \nsubject is education or business regulation or computer software, that \nMembers in this Chamber know much more about the subject than do those \nwho are in the business. It is the very companies the Senator from \nCalifornia so praises is doing things right that have felt, in order to \nconcentrate on fixing Y2K problems, rather than having run the gauntlet \nset for them by trial lawyers, that this legislation is necessary.\n  It is simply because they prefer to fix the problem in the real world \nthan to face endless litigation that we are here today. That same group \nof highly responsible organizations thinks this amendment will actually \ncreate more litigation, that it ought to be entitled ``The Free \nComputer Act of 1999,'' because really the only way to make sure you \nare not sued will be to replace the computer lock, stock, and barrel, \neven if it is three generations out of date, even if it is in the \nattic.\n  So the reasons to oppose this amendment are quite easy to determine. \nThey are that we want the problem fixed, we want the problem fixed in \nthe real world, not for years and years thereafter, after expensive \nlitigation, punitive damages, consequential damages, everything that \nafflicts our legal system today.\n  I had hoped we would complete the debate and begin the vote at this \npoint. We have, however, taken too much time. There is now a markup of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee that involves both me and two of \nthe three other Senators on the floor at the present time. In order to \nnot disrupt that markup, I announce that a motion to table will be made \nimmediately after that Appropriations Committee markup has been \nconcluded.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for \n10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6843-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6843-S6844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THE SETTLEMENT IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to very briefly speak about the \nsettlement in Kosovo. I speak with a sense of relief that we now have \nmoved toward a diplomatic settlement. At the very beginning, I think it \nwas a very difficult vote for all of us as to whether or not to \nauthorize airstrikes. We had pretty close to an equal division of \nopinion. I voted to do so.\n  I had hoped that we would be able to stop the slaughter. I thought \nthat it was a certainty that Milosevic would move into Kosovo and \npeople would be slaughtered. We were not able to really do that with \nairstrikes, not in any way that I had hoped we would be able to, but I \ndo think--and I want to give some credit where credit is due--there are \ntwo things that have happened that are very important for the world.\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n  One of them is that Milosevic has been indicted as a war criminal. \nThat is a huge step forward for human rights in the world.\n  The second thing that has happened is our actions have made it clear \nthat a Milosevic or someone like a Milosevic should not be able to \nmurder people with impunity.\n  There are many challenges ahead, but I want to just say that as a \nSenator from Minnesota, I am very pleased that we did put such a focus \non trying to reach a diplomatic solution. I would like to especially \nthank Strobe Talbott for his work. I think it is extremely important \nnow that we meet a number of really tough challenges.\n  I am not the expert in the Balkans; I do not pretend to be, but I do \nknow this: It is very important that we continue to keep our focus on \nthe humanitarian crisis and make sure the Kosovars can, indeed, go \nhome, the sooner the better.\n  I think an all-out effort ought to be made to make sure they can go \nback to their homes. If we are going to do the weatherizing and all the \nthings in the infrastructure for people to have a home to live in, then \nit is better to do it back in their own country. I hope we can do so. I \nhope we can move as quickly and as expeditiously as possible.\n  Second, I think it is going to be real important that all parties to \nthis settlement live up to their word. I think that includes the KLA. \nThere will be an understanding, kind of determination on the part of \nKosovars and the KLA for vengeance. Who can blame them? But I do think \nwe have to make sure that we do put an end to this conflict and that \nthe Serbs who live in Kosovo will also be protected and that somehow we \nwill be able to make sure there is some peace in this region.\n  Finally, I want to say, as a Senator who supported airstrikes but who \nworried about some of the focus of our airstrikes, in particular, I \nthought there was too much of a focus on the civilian infrastructure. I \nthought and still believe there were opportunities to move forward with \ndiplomacy at an earlier point in time. I always believe that is the \nfirst option, always the first option, with military conflict being the \nlast option. I do want to say that I think the President and the \nadministration should be proud of the fact that they have now been able \nto effect a diplomatic solution and that this solution, indeed, will \nmean that the Kosovars will be able to go home.\n  It will mean there will be an international force. It will be a \nmilitarized force. There will be a chain of command that makes sense. \nIt is a huge challenge ahead for us. My guess is that we are going to \nbe committed to the Balkans for quite some period of time. I think we \nshould be very realistic about that. I think that we owe that to the \nKosovars. We owe it to these people. I think that is part of what our \ncountry is about. It looks as if the European countries are going to \ntake up most of the challenge of the economic aid for reconstruction, \nand I think that is as it should be. I think our part of this \ninternational militarized force would be somewhere at 14, 15 percent. \nBut certainly it won't be the United States carrying this alone.\n\n  I worry about the landmines. I worry about our military and, for that \nmatter, the men and women from other countries who are trying to do the \nright thing now, being in harm's way. But to now no longer be involved \nin airstrikes, to see the Serbs leaving, the slaughter being stopped, \nthe Kosovars now having a chance to go back to their homes and to be \nprotected, I think we are at a much better place than we were. Now I \nhope and I pray that our country will be able to make a very positive \ndifference in the lives of the Kosovars.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6844-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6844-S6849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I just was trying my best to give \ncolleagues a summary of State action on Y2K problems. This is pretty \nwell up to date. Seven States have passed Y2K government immunity \nlegislation; that is, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, Virginia, \nOklahoma and Wyoming. Twelve States have killed Y2K government immunity \nproblems: Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Kansas, \nMississippi, Montana, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and \nWest Virginia. One State has passed the Y2K business immunity bill; \nthat is Texas. Whereas 10 States have killed Y2K business immunity \nbills: Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, \nOklahoma, West Virginia and Washington. Two States have killed the \nbankers immunity bill, originally the year 2000 computer problem: \nArizona and Indiana. Two States have killed the Computer Vendors \nImmunity Bill; that is California and Georgia. One State has killed the \nbill to limit class action suits; that is Illinois, the distinguished \nPresiding Officer's State. And 38 States have miscellaneous pending Y2K \nbills at this time.\n  I think the distinguished Senator from California wanted to point out \nan interesting provision in the State of Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my friend for yielding. I thank \nhis staff for doing just a tremendous job of ferreting out all these \nvarious laws.\n  I have something to tell the Senate that I hope will sway them in \nfavor of the Boxer amendment. In the research that was done by Senator \nHollings' staff, we find out that the law in Arizona, which was signed \non April 26, Senate bill 1294, includes in it stronger language than \nthe Boxer amendment. I repeat: The Senator from Arizona, whose bill we \nare debating, cannot agree to the Boxer amendment which simply says if \nyou have a way to fix the problem for the consumer, be they individual \nor business, then do it. He can't accept that. But in his own State, \nthe law says if you want to take advantage of a particular new set of \nlaws that they have passed to protect these businesses, here is what \nyou have to do. You have to unconditionally offer at no additional cost \nto the buyer either a repair or remedial measures. If you do not do \nthat, you cannot take advantage of these new laws that will protect \nbusiness.\n\n  Let me put that in a more direct fashion. In the State of Arizona, \nthe State of Senator McCain, who has the underlying bill, a company \ncannot take advantage of the new Y2K laws, which will help them, unless \nthey have offered to fix the problem. They have to prove that they \nunconditionally offered at no additional cost to the buyer a repair or \nother remedial measures.\n  I want to engage my friend from South Carolina in a little discussion \nhere, ask him a question. Does it not astound the Senator that we have \nan amendment before us that will not be accepted by the Senator whose \nown State has a tougher provision than the Boxer provision, that we \ncan't go even halfway toward the State of Arizona law which says in \norder to take advantage of the new legal system you have to \nunconditionally offer to fix the problem?\n  I ask my friend, who is very knowledgeable in this, if this doesn't \nstrike him as being very strange?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is astounding, because in getting this information \nup and looking at the glossary of State action, we all say: After all, \ndon't you remember in 1994, the Contract with America, we got the tenth \namendment, the best government is that government closest to the \npeople, let us respect the States on down the line. They had all these \nparticular provisions. Here comes an assault with respect to actually \nkilling all the State action and everything else, when they probably \nhad a more deliberate debate than we have had at the local level, and \nthey have all acted.\n  Here you put in a provision which responds, generally speaking, to \nthe action taken by all the States, and yet they say, no, we know \nbetter than the States now and that we are not going to have a fix.\n  It is astounding to this particular Senator the course this bill has \ntaken. Here I am trying to get a vote. I know my distinguished \nchairman, Senator McCain, worked like a dog here in the\n\n[[Page S6845]]\n\nwell. He said: I want to make sure we get rid of this thing, and I am \nworking on Senator Sessions and Senator Gregg to get these amendments \nup and have them considered so we can dispose of the bill. So I know he \nis not the holdup.\n  The press listens, and they are sending the word down to me that they \nhave a computer software conference or something at the beginning of \nthe week, and they would like to have this as sort of part of the \ncomputer software program. You cannot even intelligently debate the \nthing. It has gotten to be on message so that you have to have the \nmessage at the right time.\n  This is disgraceful conduct on the part of the Senate, if that is the \ncase. I like to cooperate. I went right over to my distinguished friend \nfrom Alaska and I said, look, I am trying to get a vote, but I know \nthey are headed to the Paris airshow. If your plane is leaving or \nwhatever it is, I understand. I will yield and let's go ahead then and \nwe will have a Tuesday vote. I was trying to find a reason, a good \nlogical reason. It was logical to me to indulge the needs of my friend \nfrom Alaska, because it is an important conference they are going to. \nHe said, no, we don't leave until late this evening. So it wasn't that. \nThen I asked over here, and it isn't this. It isn't Senator McCain. I \nkeep going around trying to find out, and here we are trying to agree \nin order to get the bill passed and they won't agree to agree.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, I have been on my feet since I think \n12:30--about 12, I think.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I asked the Senator to only take 10 minutes, does she \nremember that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. When the Senator came to the floor, I said, ``Senator, \nSenator McCain wants to get rid of it, and I do. Will you agree to 20 \nminutes, 10 to a side? Senator McCain is ready to yield back his 10 \nminutes.''\n  Now, that is the way it was at noontime today. Here now, at quarter \npast 3, we are running around like a dog chasing his tail trying to \nfind out why in the world, when they are having an ice cream party all \nover the grounds around here, you and I are trying to get the work of \nthe Senate done, and they can't give us a good excuse. When you say, \n``All right, I will amend it,'' and you are bound to agree, so we can \nmove on, they say, ``No, no, we don't want to agree to agree.''\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, I remember that the Democrats were being criticized \nand they were saying: You are not letting us get this Y2K bill up for a \nvote, because we wanted to do--I remember this very clearly--some \nsensible gun amendment. We were told we were holding up Y2K. We said: \nWe can get those things done. And, thanks to the majority leader, we \nmoved to the juvenile justice bill, and with bipartisan help we got \nsome good, sensible gun amendments through, and we went right to Y2K.\n  I want to say to my friend, the ranking member on the committee, who \nhas some real problems with the bill--more problems than this Senator \nhas--didn't object to proceeding to the bill. He said: OK, we will \nproceed. He asked me to please make my case. I said: I will settle for \nany time agreement. I said I didn't need a vote. I said: Take my \namendment. I agreed to the other side's recommendations. Then they \nsaid: Oh, we can't do it.\n  I don't understand why they can't take this amendment. I keep coming \nback to that. Every time I work my way into my best closing argument, \nbecause I think there is going to be a vote--I had my best closing \nargument at 1:55, because I thought we were voting at 2. Then I had to \nrev up again at 2:30, and I got another good closing argument. Now they \nsay we are going to have a vote at 3:30. I don't see anybody here yet. \nI hope they come here, because I think it is important.\n  The amendment pending before the Senate is a consumer amendment, \nbecause it says fix the problem. It is weaker than the consumer \namendment that is included in the Arizona law. This is incredible. In \nthe Arizona law, which is a beautiful law, which passed overwhelmingly, \nthey say--and this is important; it defines the affirmative defenses \nthat will be established if you do certain things. You have to do \ncertain things to help people. If you do these things in good faith, \nyou get a little more protection at the courthouse. What are they?\n\n       The defendant has to notify the buyer of the product that \n     the product may manifest a Y2K failure. And the notice shall \n     be supplied by the defendant explaining how the buyer may \n     obtain remedial measures, or providing information on how to \n     repair, replace, upgrade, or update the product. The \n     defendant [meaning the company] has to unconditionally offer, \n     at no additional cost to the buyer, to provide the buyer the \n     repair or the remedial measures.\n\n  All we say in the Boxer amendment is, you don't even have to do it \nfor free--only for free if it is the last 5 years. Prior to that, from \n1990 to 1995, at cost; before that, you can charge whatever you can \nget. The Boxer amendment doesn't even say you have to do this to avail \nyourself of these new laws. It simply says if you don't do it, the \njudge--if there is a court case--has to take into consideration the \nfact of these cases. I cannot believe this wasn't accepted in a \nheartbeat. It is weaker than the Arizona law.\n  What has become of us here? I don't know. I cannot figure it out. I \nlove high-tech companies, software companies. They are the heart and \nsoul of my State. They are good people. They are good corporate \ncitizens. Most of them--the vast majority--are doing the right thing. \nThey are doing these things already. So whom do we protect in this bill \nthat was so important that we were supposed to rush to it, and now they \nare not going to vote on it until next week? What happened to all the \nrhetoric that this is an urgent problem? If we went to the \nCongressional Record, it would be embarrassing for people who were \nsaying, ``Vote next week,'' just a couple of weeks ago, who said, \n``This is urgent.'' I heard one of my colleagues on the other side say \nthis is an emergency. I am baffled by it.\n\n  So I think what I will do is yield the floor, because I don't know \nwhat else I can say to convince my colleagues, who I am sure are \nlistening to every word from their offices, that this amendment is the \nright thing to do for the people we represent, the people who vote for \nus.\n  I am going to tell my friends in the Senate, if you don't vote for \nthis amendment, the phone calls will start coming in on January 1, 2, \n3, 4, and 5, saying, ``I thought you took care of Y2K. You had so much \nfanfare about the bill. What can I do now?''\n  There will be nothing they can do, because without this Boxer \namendment there is no requirement to fix the problem during the \nremediation period, or ``cooling-off period.'' The only thing required, \nto repeat myself, is a letter: Oh, yes, I got your letter. I know you \nhave a problem. I will get back to you. That is it. You don't have to \ndo the fix. It doesn't have to be for free. You can do whatever the \nmarket will bear, and you get the protections of the bill.\n  It is not right, my friends. It is not right. We can make it better.\n  When I go back home and talk to my friends in Silicon Valley and they \nsay, ``Senator why didn't you support the underlying bill?'' I am going \nto be honest and say, ``This bill is an insult to you; it is an insult \nto you. It is assuming you are too weak to do the right thing. It is \nassuming you are a bad corporate actor.''\n  I can't do that to the people I represent. They are too good, too \nimportant, too successful to have this kind of treatment. That is how I \nsee it.\n  So, again, hope against hope that we will have a change of heart \nhere, and maybe they will take this amendment or try to go back to the \noffer they gave us a little while ago. Otherwise, I guess we will just \nhave to wait for the motion to table.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, you learn to study these things. You \nlook closely, and you finally realize what is happening.\n  I remember an old-time story about the poll tax days and the literacy \ntesting of minorities in order to vote. In South Carolina, a minority \ncame to the poll prepared to vote, and a man presented him with a \nChinese newspaper. He says, ``Here, read that.'' He takes the paper and \nturns it around all kinds of ways, and he says, ``I reads it.'' The man \nasks him, ``What does it say?'' The minority says, ``It says ain't no \npoor minority going to vote in South Carolina today.''\n  They know how to get the message. In turn, I can get this message. \nThis goes right to what is really abused as\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\nan expression, ``Kill all the lawyers.'' To Henry VI, Dick Butcher \nsaid, ``We have to kill all the lawyers.'' What they were trying to do \nwas foster tyranny, and they knew they could not do it as long as they \nhad lawyers available to look out for the individual and individual \nrights.\n  Say I am the lawyer and I have a lot of work. Generally speaking, I \nam a successful lawyer. And someone comes to me in January or February \nwith a Y2K problem, and I am saying I am not handling those cases, you \nought to try to see so-and-so, wherever we can find somebody, because \nthe entire thrust is in order to really get anything done and get a \nresult I know that I am limited. I can't take care of the poor small \nbusinessman and the lost customers. I can't take that small businessman \nand his employees that have had to take temporary leave because his \nbusiness is down. I can't take care of the other economic damage like \nthe lost advertising which has come about while his competition takes \nover. I have to tell him it is the crazy law that they passed up there \nin Washington. But that is how things are getting controlled whereby \nyou just come in.\n  So I have to write a letter on your behalf, and after I write that \nletter, 30 days, then another 60 days is the so-called cooling-off \nperiod. Then, if nothing happens, which apparently you tried to get it \nfixed and nothing has happened, I have to draw pleadings and file and \neverything else. It all comes down to $5,000 or $10,000 for a computer. \nI have spent $5,000 of my time and costs, unless you are rich enough to \nstart paying me billable hours. I spend $5,000 for much of my costs and \nstaff and hours of work myself. The most I can do is get you back half \nof a computer.\n  It is a no-win situation. They have passed a law in essence not just \nfor rushing to the courtroom or courthouse, as they talk about, but to \nmake sure that nobody wants to handle a case of that kind because there \nis no way to make an honest recovery to make it partially whole. You \njust totally lose out.\n  They know what they are doing when they oppose the bill to get the \nthing fixed.\n  That is what I was thinking.\n  I know with all the State action and the moving forces behind it \nbecause I saw it last year. All you have to do is run for reelection \nand go from town to town and meeting to meeting all over your State. \nYou learn your State. You learn the issues. You learn the opposition. \nYou learn the movements afoot --or the NRA with respect to rifles. You \nlearn about the abortion crowd. You learn about the other groups that \nhave come in now with respect to any and every phase of lawyers.\n  It is sort of ``kill all the lawyers''--take away, holding up the \nlawyers for everybody to vote against. But the consumers are the ones \nwho suffer.\n  The distinguished Senator from California ought to really be \ncommended for finally bringing--after 3 days of debate--this into sharp \nfocus. Lawyers, one way or the other, are not going to be handling \nthese cases. Trial lawyers have bigger cases to handle.\n  But I can tell you here and now that consumers and small business are \ngoing to suffer tremendously.\n  Almost since I opposed the bill I have felt that it serves them \nright. Maybe I will prove I was right in the first instance, and maybe \nthey will start sobering up with this intense messianic drive that they \nhave on foot to ``kill all the lawyers.''\n  That looks good in the polls. That is why we don't do anything about \nSocial Security or campaign finance or budgets or deficits or Patients' \nBill of Rights and the important things. But if we can get that poll--\nand if that poll will show something about the lawyers--then we can get \na bill up here, take the time to amend it, and then when we want to cut \nit off and argue everybody into doing so, and then finally agree that \nwe can all agree and get rid of it, they say no way.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will my friend yield for just a moment?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am glad to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I appreciate it. I wanted to talk to him about it.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I can now send a modified amendment to the \ndesk.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 621, As Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I send a modified amendment to the desk to \nreplace my own amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 621), as modified, is as follows:\n       In section 7(e) insert at the end the following:\n       (5) Special rule.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a defendant that is a \n     manufacturer of a device or system (including any computer \n     system and any microchip or integrated circuit embedded in \n     another device or product), or any software, firmware, or \n     other set or collection of processing instructions to \n     process, to calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, \n     to store, to transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related \n     data that experienced a Y2K failure, the defendant shall, \n     during the remediation period provided in this subsection--\n       (i) make a reasonable effort to make available to the \n     plaintiff a repair or replacement, if available, at the \n     actual cost to the manufacturer, for a material defect in a \n     device or other product that was first introduced for sale \n     after January 1, 1990 and before January 1, 1997; and\n       (ii) make a reasonable effort to make available at no \n     charge to the plaintiff a repair or replacement, if \n     available, for a material defect in a device or other product \n     that was first introduced for sale after December 31, 1996.\n       (B) Damages.--If a defendant knowingly and purposefully \n     fails to comply with this paragraph, the court shall consider \n     that failure in the award of any damages, including economic \n     loss and punitive damages.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is it necessary that the clerk read it, or can I just \nproceed to explain it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not necessary to have the clerk report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much.\n  I wanted to explain to my friend what I have done to make this even \nmore palatable to the Senate. We are now saying the fix only has to be \nmade to small businesses and individuals.\n  So we have narrowed the scope of the repair. Now it becomes even \neasier for the companies to make these repairs. I say to my friend when \nhe talks about this attack on lawyers that I find it very interesting, \nbecause I read when Newt Gingrich was in power on the other side of the \naisle that they had a poll done. They had a document prepared which \neveryone was able to see at some point or other. Their pollsters said \nin order to divert attention from an issue, attack the lawyers. Just \ntake the attention away from what it is about.\n  In other words, if there is a dangerous product--let's say a crib--we \nhad these before where the slats in the cribs are made in such a way \nthat a child could die because they could fit their head through those \ncracks and choke to death--divert attention from the product, and say \nlook at that greedy lawyer, he made X million dollars.\n  What they do not understand is that all of these kinds of cases--we \nare not talking about personal injuries, because this bill doesn't \ninvolve personal injuries. But I am just making the point here that \nwhen a lawyer takes on such a case--I want to ask my friend to talk \nabout this because he knows this for a fact--they don't get paid unless \nthere is a recovery in the suit. They put out maybe sometimes years of \nwork and much expense, and they take a chance because they know the \ncompany is powerful and big and strong, and by the way, it has many \nlawyers. So they go to the people to divert attention from the tragedy \nthat occurred. This is what a lot of politicians do, and they say it is \nall about the lawyers in Washington.\n  I hope the people of the United States of America know that there is \na rule against frivolous lawsuits and that you can't bring a frivolous \nlawsuit because a judge can throw it out.\n  In addition, what lawyer would bring a frivolous lawsuit knowing that \nhe or she is going to be out of pocket for all of these expenses and \nknow that they only get paid if it was really an important lawsuit?\n  There are many lawyers out there who are not good citizens, who are \nnot good corporate citizens, who do not have social conscience, because \nit is just like any other profession--just like we are talking about \nthe software industry, or in the computer hardware industry. Most of \nthe people are wonderful, and there are some bad actors.\n  But let us not get to the floor of the Senate and turn these debates \ninto lawyers versus everybody else, because that is not what it is \nabout. It is about making sure that people have their\n\n[[Page S6847]]\n\nproblems resolved. If we start talking about lawyers, it isn't really \nrelevant to real people who are going to deal with this real problem on \nJanuary 1; they wake up, go to their computer and try to conduct \nbusiness, and find themselves in deep trouble.\n  I ask my friend if he would comment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, commenting with respect to the attention \nthat the Senator from California gives to consumers, and the comments \nmade about frivolous lawsuits, I am an expert witness on frivolous \nlawsuits. I can tell you categorically that the courts will take care \nof frivolous lawsuits quickly. You can see it. I could mention some \nthat have been in the news with respect to the computer people very \nrecently.\n  But the reason I say an expert witness is because I used to bring \nindividual injury suits with respect to the citizenry around my \nhometown and sometimes in bus cases. I had a good friend who was a \nprofessor at the law school when I was there, and thereupon the \nchairman of the board of the South Carolina Electric and Gas, which \noperated the city bus transit system, an event I said I had not been \ninvolved with, but that is wrong.\n\n  These corporate lawyers get really lazy. They get too used to the \nmahogany walls, the oriental rugs, somebody with a silver pitcher and \nsome young lady to run in and give them a drink of water.\n  Rushing to the courtroom and trying cases is work. I remember saying \nto a man named Arthur Williams: I could save you at least $1 million if \nI were your lawyer. Later on he retained me.\n  Right to the point: The first or middle of the month of November, \nwhat I call the Christmas Club started to develop. Nobody could get on \nthe transit bus who didn't slip on a green pea, get their arm caught on \na door, or the door didn't jerk open and they fell and hurt their back.\n  This is back in the late 1950s when we were trying these cases.\n  I said we should try these cases. The claims were around $5,000 to \n$10,000. The settlements were half, $2,500 or $5,000. The lawyers \nthought they were too important to go to court to try cases.\n  Let me tell about a lawyer who was willing to try cases. His name was \nJudge Sirica. He wrote a book. While he was writing that book, he was \nbeing driven around Hilton Head by myself.\n  He looked at me and said: Senator, don't ever appoint a district \njudge to the Federal bench who hasn't been in the pitch.\n  I said: Judge, you mean trying cases?\n  He said: That is right.\n  He said when he got out of law school he flunked the bar exam three \ntimes. When he finally passed that bar exam, he didn't have any \nclients, he had to go to magistrate court and take what trials he could \npick up. He said he got pretty good at it. He said after a few years, \nHogan and Hartson asked: Will you come on board and start trying our \ncases?\n  It is work. Frivolous cases--they are small cases, some of them \nwithout foundation, a lot of them with foundation--but lawyers with \nthis billable hour nonsense have gotten awfully lazy as a profession.\n  Talk about delays. When lawyers have billable hours, the opposition \nwants to play golf in the afternoon. We don't have to go to the judge, \nI will give you a continuance.\n  You agree, and the poor client is sitting there paying for the \nbillable hours.\n  In any event, Judge Sirica said when he walked in the first day and \nlistened to the witness, he told counsel to meet him in chambers. This \nis the first day of trial. When he got them back in chambers, he said: \nYou are lying, and I'm not going to put up with this nonsense in my \ncourtroom. He said: I could tell it from my trial experience. You are \nstarting tomorrow morning, and you are going to bring out the truth, \nand you are not going to put up with these kinds of witnesses. It is \nnot going to be just a citation and dock your pay. I will put you in \njail if you all don't straighten up and start trying the cases in the \nproper manner.\n  He said that broke Watergate. To this practitioner, that goes right \naround to the so-called frivolous cases that all the politicians are \nrunning around about. It is work. You don't run to the courthouse.\n  As I pointed out earlier today, if you filed a case this afternoon, \nyou would be lucky to get a trial in that courtroom in the year 1999, I \ncan tell you that. The civil docket is backed up that much. I don't \nknow of any court that can actually get to trial.\n\n  Who uses that? Not the fellow making the motions and paying the \nexpenses and time and the depositions and interrogatories. The \ncorporate billable hour lawyer, he likes that. He keeps a backup. It is \nto his interest you don't dispose of justice too quickly. All during \nthe year, he has money coming in. He knows he is a winner regardless of \nwhat happens to his client.\n  They are engaged in predatory practices, frivolous lawsuits, and are \nrunning to the courthouse.\n  The Senator from California is rendering a wonderful service. This is \nabout consumers. The amendment of the Senator from California seeks to \nget us away from the courthouse, get us away from lawyers, get us away \nfrom law, get away from legal loopholes, hurdles, and jumps.\n  The businesses say: Just give me a fix. I have to do business, and I \ndon't want to lose my customers, service, and reputation. So she \nrequires a fix--all for the consumer.\n  That is what the Senate and the entire Congress has heard.\n  There is no question, looking at the results at the State level, how \nthey have turned back all of these things, that is why they are coming \nto Washington after the ``turn backs.'' Look at all of the States that \nhave debated this issue. The only State in the glossary of State action \nthat passed a Y2K business immunities bill, the only State, is the \nState of Texas.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I seek recognition at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is 3:50. The Senator from Washington \nwas on the floor and said he would be here at 3:30 to table this \namendment.\n  I wonder if the ranking member knows what is going on around here. I \nwas told originally, when I offered my amendment at around the noon \nhour, we would have a vote at 2 o'clock. Then it was 2:30. Then my \nfriend from Washington State gave me the courtesy of announcing he was \nnot going to allow an up-or-down vote on my amendment; he was going to \nmove to table at 3:30. It is 10 to 4. Have they sent my friend any \nword?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They have not sent me any word. The press sent me word \nabout the software alliance.\n  I know the Senator from Arizona, the chairman of our committee, that \ndistinguished Senator, was intent on getting rid of this bill. He told \nme that early this morning. We got the witnesses lined up, we talked \ndown the witnesses, we made them get the time agreements, and he had an \nimportant commitment he made to leave around 12. He tried to extend it \nto 12:30.\n  During that half hour he said: I got us down to two amendments. I \nsaid: All I know of is the Boxer amendment.\n  I have now talked Senator Torricelli into not presenting his. I \nhasten to add, I am glad I did not talk Senator Boxer out of her \namendment, because it is the only amendment that really brings into \nissue the matter of consumers we are trying to defend today.\n  He said: Don't worry. He came back to me twice and said: I have it; I \nthink I worked that out; you go right ahead.\n  I said: I don't want to vote with you not here.\n  He said: Go ahead; these commitments have been made.\n  Everybody knows Senator McCain's position on the bill. We will have \nto have a conference when it passes. There will be a conference report.\n  I pressured Senator Boxer and told my colleagues we can vote. Several \nsaid: No; we have a lunch hour; let's vote at 2 o'clock. And then 2 \no'clock became 2:30, and 2:30 became 3 o'clock, and 3 o'clock became \n3:30. Now it is 10 minutes to 4.\n  I have tried to be diligent in managing the bill and moving the \nbusiness of the Senate. There is nothing more I can say. I am waiting \non the leadership. This is above my pay grade.\n  We can go ahead and call the roll. I am sure the distinguished \nstaffer on the other side of the aisle is ready to\n\n[[Page S6848]]\n\ncall the roll. He has worked hard. We are all ready.\n  This is above our pay grade.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if it is against the pay grade of one of \nthe most senior respected Members in the Senate, the ranking member on \nthe committee of jurisdiction, clearly it is way above my pay grade.\n  I get paid to do a job here, and the job is to represent the people \nof California. Make life better for them, make life easier for them, \ngive them a chance at the American dream, keep their environment \nbeautiful and clean, give them opportunity, fairness. What I am trying \nto do is take that set of values and apply it to this bill. I do not \nwant them waking up on the morning of January 1, 2000, and finding that \ntheir small business just crashed before them and they have no remedy \nwhen, in fact, a remedy exists and the manufacturer simply has to make \na simple fix.\n\n  Again, my breath is taken away when I read the law in Arizona--I \nmight say a Republican State--which says that before any manufacturer \ncould take advantage of the easier rules of the law to defend himself \nor herself against a claim, they have to do certain things \naffirmatively, including offering to fix at no cost. In other words, \nwhat you say in Arizona is: We are happy to help you, Mr. and Mrs. \nBusinessperson, but it has to be after you have affirmatively tried to \nfix the Y2K problem.\n  In the underlying bill, we require very little of a business before \nthey can get to the ``safe harbor,'' if I might use that term broadly, \nof this bill. What do they have to do? Write a letter:\n\n       Dear Friend: I got your letter. I know you have a Y2K \n     problem. I am studying it. I'll get back to you.\n\n  Then they qualify for the rest of the benefits of this law. Who does \nit help? It helps the bad actors. Who does it hurt? The consumers. Why \nare we doing it? God knows.\n  We could have done a good bill on this. The amendment I put before \nyou comes from a House bill that was proposed in 1998 by David Dreier \nand Chris Cox. This is not some provision written by a liberal Member \nof Congress. It was written by two Members with 100 percent business \nrecords. Why did they put it in the bill? Because I think when they sat \ndown to write the bill that was the object of the original Y2K \nproposal--a cooling off period, remediation period, get the fix done, \nstay out of court. I think, if this amendment is taken, if it is \napproved, I think that will be a good step forward for consumers. If it \nis not, there is nothing in this bill, in my opinion, that does one \nthing to cure the problem.\n  So, it is now 5 minutes to 4. Senator Gorton said he would be back at \n3:30 to table the Boxer amendment. I am perplexed at what our plans are \nhere, whether we are just going to not have any more votes today or \nwhether we are just whiling away the time or some Members had to go to \nsome other obligation. I do not know what is happening because I do not \nhave word. All I know is I have been here since 12 o'clock on this \namendment. It is a good amendment. I am hoping perhaps no news is good \nnews, I say to my friend. Maybe they are so excited about this \namendment they are trying to work it out somehow.\n  I see Senator Lieberman is here to make some remarks. I am happy to \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                Amendment (No. 621) As Further Modified\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for just one \nmore minute, I send a modification to the desk to replace the other one \nthat was sent in error.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 621), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       In section 7(e) insert at the end the following:\n       (5) Special rule.--\n       (A) In general.--With respect to a defendant that is a \n     manufacturer of a device or system (including any computer \n     system and any microchip or integrated circuit embedded in \n     another device or product), or any software, firmware, or \n     other set or collection of processing instructions to \n     process, to calculate, to compare, to sequence, to display, \n     to store, to transmit, or to receive year-2000 date-related \n     data that experienced a Y2K failure, the defendant shall, \n     during the remediation period provided in this subsection--\n       (i) make available to any small business or noncommercial \n     consumer plaintiff a repair or replacement, if available, at \n     the actual cost to the manufacturer, for a device or other \n     product that was first introduced for sale after January 1, \n     1990 and before January 1, 1995; and\n       (ii) make available at no charge to the plaintiff a repair \n     or replacement, if available, for a device or other product \n     that was first introduced for sale after December 31, 1994.\n       (B) Damages.--If a defendant fails to comply with this \n     paragraph, the court shall consider that failure in the award \n     of any damages, including economic loss and punitive damages.\n       (C) With respect to this section, a small business is \n     defined as any person whose net worth does not exceed \n     $500,000, or that is an unincorporated business, a \n     partnership, corporation, association, unit of local \n     government, or organization with fewer than 25 full-time \n     employees.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I see an opportunity here to make a few \ngeneral comments about the bill as we await the next procedural step. \nWith the Chair's permission, I will proceed with that, which is to say \nto add my strong support to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. President, Congress really needs to act to address the probable \nexplosion of litigation over the Y2K problem. It needs to act quickly. \nThis is a problem that has an activating date. It is nothing that will \nwait for Congress to act. It will be self-starting, self-arriving. \nTherefore, we must act in preparation for it.\n  Obviously we are now familiar, if we had not been before this \nextended debate, with the problem caused by the Y2K bug. Although no \none can predict with certainty what will happen at the turning of the \nyear into the new century and the new millennium, there is little doubt \nthat there will be Y2K-caused failures, possibly on a large scale, and \nthat those failures could bring both minor inconveniences and \nsignificant disruptions in our lives. This could pose a serious problem \nfor our economy, and if there are widespread failures, it will surely \nbe in all of our interests for American businesses to focus on how they \ncan continue providing the goods and services we all rely on in the \nface of those disruptions rather than fretting over and financing \ndefense of lawsuits.\n  Perhaps just as important as the challenge to our economy, the Y2K \nproblem will present a unique challenge to our court system, unique \nbecause of the possible volume of litigation throughout the country \nthat will likely result and because that litigation will commence \nwithin a span of a few months, potentially flooding the courts with \ncases and inundating American companies with lawsuits at precisely the \ntime they need to devote their resources to fixing the problem.\n  So I think it is appropriate for Congress to act now to ensure that \nour legal system is prepared to deal fairly, efficiently, and \neffectively with the Y2K problem, to make sure those problems that can \nbe solved short of litigation will be solved that way, to make sure \nthat companies that should be held liable for their actions will be \nheld liable, but to also make sure that the Y2K problem does not just \nbecome an opportunity for a few enterprising individuals to profit from \nwhat is ultimately frivolous litigation, unfairly wasting the resources \nof companies that have done nothing wrong, companies large and small, \nor diverting the resources of companies that should be devoting \nthemselves to keeping our economy going to fixing the problem.\n  To that end, I was privileged to work with the leadership of the \nCommerce Committee and the sponsors of this legislation, particularly \nSenators McCain, Wyden and Dodd, to try to craft a more targeted \nresponse to this Y2K problem.\n  Like many others here, I was actually uncomfortable with the scope, \nthe breadth, and the contents of the initial draft of this legislation \nbecause I thought it went beyond dealing with our concerns about the \nY2K potential litigation explosion and became a general effort to adopt \ntort reform. I took those concerns to the bill's sponsors, as others \ndid. Together I found them to be responsive and we worked out those \nconcerns. I am very grateful to them for that.\n  With the addition of the amendments offered by Senators Dodd, Wyden \nand others, we have a package now before us that I think we can really \nbe proud of and with which we can be comfortable because it is one that \nwill help\n\n[[Page S6849]]\n\nus fairly manage the Y2K litigation while protecting legal rights and \ndue process.\n  Provisions like the one requiring notice before filing a lawsuit will \nhelp save the resources of our court system while giving parties the \nopportunity to work out their problems before incurring the costs of \nlitigation and the hardening of positions the filing of a lawsuit often \nbrings.\n  The requirement that defects be material for a class action to be \nbrought will allow recovery for those defects that are of consequence \nwhile keeping those with no real injury from using the court system to \nextort settlements out of companies that have done them no real harm. \nAnd the provision in this bill keeping plaintiffs with contractual \nrelationships with defendants from seeking, through tort actions, \ndamages that their contracts do not allow them to get, will make sure \nthat settled business expectations, as expressed in duly negotiated and \nexecuted contracts, are honored and that plaintiffs get precisely but \nnot more than the damages they are entitled to under those contracts.\n  I also think it is important for everyone to recognize that the bill \nwe have before us today is not the bill that was originally introduced, \nnot even the bill that was reported out of the Commerce Committee. \nBecause of the cooperative efforts of Senators McCain, Dodd, Wyden, \nGorton, and so many others who are interested in seeing this \nlegislation move forward, this bill has been significantly tailored to \nmeet the urgent problems we may face.\n  I will conclude by saying that this legislation will not protect \nwrongdoers or deprive those deserving of compensation. What it will do \nis make sure that what we have in place is a fair and effective way to \nresolve Y2K disputes, one that will help make sure we do not compound \nany problems caused by the Y2K bug, even larger problems caused by \nunnecessary litigation.\n  This is good legislation, and I am optimistic that it will soon pass \nthe Senate and that we will, thereby, have dealt with a problem which \notherwise would be much larger than it should be.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have come to the floor to make a brief \nstatement about the Kosovo situation. I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside so I can speak as in morning business \nfor 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6849-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6849-S6850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, like many Americans, I am very pleased \nwith the recent agreement within the United Nations Security Council on \na plan that will end the conflict in Kosovo and achieve NATO's primary \nobjective of returning the people of Kosovo to their homes.\n  I take this opportunity to join with many others who have spoken on \nthis subject to thank the aircrews and the support personnel of our Air \nForce, our Navy, and our Marine Corps. These men and women have \ndemonstrated that American airpower can bring change in the course of \nhistory. Their dedication to duty and professionalism makes all of us \nproud.\n  We have just recently passed the defense appropriations bill, and I \nhad hoped to come to the floor, especially to speak to Nebraskans, who \nhave a big stake in this bill, not just because we are beneficiaries of \nthe security provided to us by the men and women who will benefit from \nthese appropriations, but also because we have significant numbers of \npeople in my State who are part of the effort to keep the United States \nof America safe.\n  These laws that we pass--the defense appropriations bill and the \ndefense authorization bill--are not merely words on a piece of paper; \nthese laws are converted into human action. While it is true that men \nand women have to be well-trained, they need to be patriotic in order \nto be willing to give up their freedoms to serve the cause of peace and \nfreedom throughout the world. It is also true that the beginning point \nis the kind of dream that we have in this Senate and in this Congress \nabout the way we want our Nation and our world to be.\n  Operation Allied Force was very dangerous and very expensive. It is \nnatural for us, at the moment, to want to celebrate a victory. However, \nI believe we must recognize the hard work is just beginning.\n  Two immense tasks now confront NATO. The first is to restore a \nrefugee people to their homeland, and the second is to make the Balkan \nregion a modern, democratic, and humane environment in which ethnic \ncleansing can never again occur. The first task may take a year, given \nthe destruction of homes and farms in Kosovo. The second will take \ngenerations and will never occur without democratic change in the \nYugoslavian Government.\n  At the outset of the NATO military action, I expressed my concern \nabout the effect the U.S. commitment to this operation would have on \nour ability to meet our global security obligations. Only the United \nStates of America has the ability to counter the threats that are posed \nby Iraq, North Korea, or the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction. The stability of this planet depends on the readiness of \nthe U.S. military, and thus we must avoid squandering our capabilities \non missions not vital to U.S. national security.\n  NATO has committed itself to provide a peace implementation force of \n50,000 troops. Of this force, the United States will supply about 7,000 \nmarines and soldiers. While I have concerns about the overcommitment of \nUnited States military forces, I am pleased our European allies have \nstepped forward and pledged to provide the vast majority of the \nimplementation force. We should work to lessen the United States \nmilitary involvement, with the goal of creating an all-European ground \nforce in Kosovo within a year.\n  In the meantime, we must be straightforward with the American people. \nThere are risks associated with this mission. This force will be \nresponsible for assisting the Kosovar refugees' return home, disarming \nthe Kosovo Liberation Army, and coping with the myriad issues, such as \nlandmines and booby traps, that will be left behind by the departing \nSerbian military. American casualties remain a very real possibility.\n\n  Out of this conflict, I see reason for us to be optimistic. First, \nour allies in Europe, led primarily by Britain and Germany, have played \na leading role in finding a solution to the conflict. It is in the \ninterest of the Europeans to build a peaceful and stable Balkans. Their \neffort to find a diplomatic agreement and to provide the majority of \nthe troops to enforce this agreement is a positive sign for the future.\n  Second, I am pleased with the constructive role that has been played \nby the Russians. There will not be a lasting Balkan peace without the \nactive participation of Russia. It is my hope the positive atmosphere \nthat has been created between Russia and the West will be carried \nforward and will reignite the relationship that has suffered over the \npast few months.\n  Finally, I hope we have begun to see the future of Balkan stability \nin a larger context. We cannot continue to fight individual Balkan \nfires. We must begin to look for preventive measures to avoid the next \nBalkan conflict before it begins.\n  The United States and our European allies have not done enough to \nbring the Balkans into the political and economic structures of Europe. \nWe have not done enough to support the latent forces of democracy that \nexist in the region.\n  Our challenge today is to extend to the Balkans the peace and \nstability that comes from a society based on democratic principles \nwhere the rights of all people are protected, a society based on the \nrule of law where legitimate grievances among people are honestly \nadjudicated, a society based on free enterprise where commerce is \nunleashed to create jobs and prosperity.\n  More than failed diplomacy, Kosovo should have taught us the \nconsequences of failed states. Multiethnic Balkan States are not \nimpossible, but to succeed, they must be free-market democracies.\n  I believe peace and stability is an achievable goal. First, we must \nwork with prodemocracy forces within the various Balkan States to \nstrengthen the emerging democracies and encourage the transition to \ndemocracy.\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\n  Second, we must begin a massive reconstruction effort. This project, \nled by the Europeans, should restore infrastructure damaged in the war, \ncreate opportunities for economic development, and establish conditions \nthat will allow for eventual membership in the European Union.\n  Finally, we should convene a conference of concerned nations that \nwill work together to address the long-term security needs of the \nBalkans.\n  Let me state that the objective of building a peaceful and stable \nBalkans will not be achieved as long as Slobodan Milosevic remains the \nPresident of Yugoslavia. A man who has started four wars in this \ndecade, killed and ethnically cleansed hundreds of thousands of \ncivilians, crushed democratic opposition, and presided over the \nruination of his country can never guide the kind of political, \neconomic, and social change that will be necessary to rebuild Serbia.\n  As long as Milosevic remains in power, he is a threat to peace. As \nlong as Milosevic remains in power, the politics of racism and ethnic \nhatred will prevail. As long as Milosevic remains in power, the West \nshould not prop up his regime by rebuilding Serbia.\n  In 1996, we missed our opportunity to help prodemocracy forces that \ngathered in the streets of Belgrade. When the protests began, we \nhesitated, and Milosevic used the opportunity to consolidate his \ncontrol by brutally repressing the opposition. Rather than seeing \nMilosevic as a tyrant and a threat to peace, we saw him as a partner in \nBosnia. We should no longer suffer the illusion that Milosevic can be a \npartner in peace. We should work with the people of Serbia to ensure a \nquick end to the Milosevic regime.\n  I believe the end could be near. Over 70 days of NATO airstrikes have \nloosened Milosevic's grasp on the instruments he uses to control his \npeople. It is my hope the democratic forces in Serbia--with Western \nassistance--will seize this opportunity to remove him. Only with a new \ndemocratic leadership will Serbia begin the process of rejoining the \ncommunity of nations.\n  At the end of a military conflict, it is natural to look back and to \nassess ways in which the use of force could have been avoided. While \nmany will find fault with U.S. diplomacy in the days and months leading \nup to the initiation of airstrikes, I believe our failure starts a \ndecade before by not working to extend to the Balkans the peaceful \ndemocratic revolutions that swept through Eastern Europe.\n  We must address the problems facing the Balkans by extending the \nbenefits of democracy, or face the prospect of continual ethnic \nconflict and instability.\n  In addition to praising the men and women of the aircrews of the Air \nForce and the Navy and the Marine Corps who fought and flew bravely \ninto great danger, and who deserve a great deal of credit for \ndelivering this success, I offer as well my congratulations and praise \nto the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, who held \nthe NATO alliance together, who persevered when there was considerable \ndoubt and criticism not only at home but abroad as well, and who must \nbe given great credit for delivering this successful agreement.\n  We have just begun the hard work of rebuilding democracy in this \nregion of the world.

CREDIT PROTECTION FROM YEAR 2000 FAILURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--No person who transacts business on \n     matters directly or indirectly affecting mortgage, credit \n     accounts, banking, or other financial transactions shall \n     cause or permit a foreclosure, default, or other adverse \n     action against any other person as a result of the improper \n     or incorrect transmission or inability to cause transaction \n     to occur, which is caused directly or indirectly by an actual \n     or potential Y2K failure that results in an inability to \n     accurately or timely process any information or data, \n     including data regarding payments and transfers.\n       (b) Scope.--The prohibition of such adverse action to \n     enforce obligations referred to in subsection (a) includes \n     but is not limited to mortgages, contracts, landlord-tenant \n     agreements, consumer credit obligations, utilities, and \n     banking transactions.\n       (c) Adverse Credit Information.--The prohibition on adverse \n     action in subsection (a) includes the entry of any negative \n     credit information to any credit reporting agency, if the \n     negative credit information is due directly or indirectly by \n     an actual or potential disruption of the proper processing of \n     financial responsibilities and information, or the inability \n     of the consumer to cause payments to be made to creditors \n     where such inability is due directly or indirectly to an \n     actual or potential Y2K failure.\n       (d) Actions May Resume After Problem Is Fixed.--No \n     enforcement or other adverse action prohibited by subsection \n     (a) shall resume until the obligor has a reasonable time \n     after the full restoration of the ability to regularly \n     receive and dispense data necessary to perform the financial \n     transaction required to fulfill the obligation.\n       (e) Section Does Not Apply to Non-Y2K-Related Problems.--\n     This section shall not affect transactions upon which a \n     default has occurred prior to a Y2K failure that disrupts \n     financial or data transfer operations of either party.\n       (f) Enforcement of Obligations Merely Tolled.--This section \n     delays but does not prevent the enforcement of financial \n     obligations.\n  Mr. GORTON. This is the Inhofe amendment referred to in my unanimous \nconsent request. It has to do with amnesty for certain regulatory \nactivities in its first part. The second part was suggested by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina and is designed to assure \nthat no one lose a home through a mortgage or any other similar kind of \nloss as a result of a Y2K failure or glitch.\n  The amendment has been cleared on both sides.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 622) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 623 to Amendment No. 608\n\n (Purpose: To permit evidence of communications with state and federal \n         regulators to be admissible in class action lawsuits)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative assistant read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 623.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place, add the following section:\n\n     SEC.   . ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE ULTIMATE ISSUE IN STATE COURTS.\n\n       Any party to a Y2K action in a State court in a State that \n     has not adopted a rule of evidence substantially similar to \n     Rule 704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence may introduce in \n     such action evidence that would be admissible if Rule 704 \n     applied in that jurisdiction.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this amendment simply provides that rule \n704 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which most States have adopted--\nas a matter of fact, I think no more than a handful have not adopted \nFederal Rules of Evidence, and most of those have adopted 704; it \nhappens that the State of Alabama did not adopt rule 704. Particularly \nwith regard to these Y2K cases, I think rule 704 would be an \nappropriate rule of evidence.\n  It allows the introductions of analyses and reports by parties to the \nlitigation that would indicate whether or not the entity that is \ninvolved had or had not taken adequate steps toward curing the Y2K \nproblem, whether or not they actually have moved in that direction in a \nsufficient way. It could be the defense or, on the other side, assist \nthe plaintiff.\n  I think this would be a good amendment and bring Alabama's law and \nperhaps a handful of other State laws into compliance, into uniformity \nin this Y2K bill.\n  We worked hard to have support across the aisle. I thank my \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, for their courtesy and \ninterest in dealing with this problem. I think we have developed \nlanguage, after a number of changes, that will leave most people happy. \nI hope this amendment will be accepted.\n\n[[Page S6852]]\n\n  I know some Members will want to review this amendment before next \nweek when we have a final vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. The amendment proposed by the Senator from Alabama \ncertainly seems highly reasonable to me.\n  He is, however, correct; a number of proponents and opponents have \nasked for an opportunity to examine the amendment in a little more \ndetail. That is why the unanimous consent agreement deferred final \nconsideration until Monday.\n  I am reasonably confident it will be accepted by voice vote, and I \ncertainly hope it will.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Washington, and I thank him \nfor his leadership on this important issue dealing with an economic \nproblem that could place one of America's greatest industries in \njeopardy. I believe this is an important piece of legislation.\n  I thank Senator Gorton for his leadership.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. SUSPENSION OF PENALTIES FOR CERTAIN YEAR 2000 \n                   FAILURES BY SMALL BUSINESS CONCERNS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' means any executive agency, as \n     defined in section 105 of title 5, United States Code, that \n     has the authority to impose civil penalties on small business \n     concerns;\n       (2) the term ``first-time violation'' means a violation by \n     a small business concern of a Federal rule or regulation \n     resulting from a Y2K failure if that Federal rule or \n     regulation had not been violated by that small business \n     concern within the preceding 3 years; and\n       (3) the term ``small business concern'' has the meaning \n     given such term in section 3 of the Small Business Act (25 \n     U.S.C. 632).\n       (b) Establishment of Liaisons.--Not later than 30 days \n     after the date of enactment of this section each agency \n     shall--\n       (1) establish a point of contact within the agency to act \n     as a liaison between the agency and small business concerns \n     with respect to problems arising out of Y2K failures and \n     compliance with Federal rules or regulations; and\n       (2) publish the name and phone number of the point of \n     contact for the agency in the Federal Register.\n       (c) General Rule.--Subject to subsections (d) and (e), no \n     agency shall impose any civil money penalty on a small \n     business concern for a first-time violation.\n       (d) Standards for Waiver.--In order to receive a waiver of \n     civil money penalties from an agency for a first-time \n     violation, a small business concern shall demonstrate that--\n       (1) the small business concern previously made a good faith \n     effort to effectively remediate Y2K problems;\n       (2) a first-time violation occurred as a result of the Y2K \n     system failure of the small business concern or other entity, \n     which affected the small business concern's ability to comply \n     with a federal rule or regulation;\n       (3) the first-time violation was unavoidable in the face of \n     a Y2K system failure or occurred as a result of efforts to \n     prevent the disruption of critical functions or services that \n     could result in harm to life or property;\n       (4) upon identification of a first-time violation, the \n     small business concern initiated reasonable and timely \n     measures to remediate the violation; and\n       (5) the small business concern submitted notice to the \n     appropriate agency of the first-time violation within a \n     reasonable time not to exceed 7 business days from the time \n     that the small business concern became aware that a first-\n     time violation had occurred.\n       (e) Exceptions.--An agency may impose civil money penalties \n     authorized under Federal law on a small business concern for \n     a first-time violation if the small business concern fails to \n     correct the violation not later than 6 months after initial \n     notification to the agency.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I offer an amendment that ensures that small businesses \nwhich are hit with Y2K problems will not be penalized by the Federal \nGovernment for activities they are unable to deal with as a result of \nthe Y2K problem.\n  An overzealous Federal Government bearing down on a small business \ncan be a very serious problem. I know all Members have constituents who \nhave had small businesses that have found the Federal Government to be \noverbearing.\n  It would therefore be uniquely ironic and inappropriate if the \noverzealousness of the Federal Government were to be thrown on top of a \nsituation which a small business had no control over, which would be \nthe failure of their computer system as a result of a Y2K problem. This \ndoes not get into the issue of liability, which may be the underlying \nquestion in this bill. It doesn't raise the question of whether or not \nthe computer company should be exempt from liability, which I know has \nbeen a genuine concern of the Senator from South Carolina. Rather, it \nsimply addresses the need for equity and fairness when we are dealing \nwith small businesses which, through no fault of their own, have \nsuddenly been hit with a Y2K problem and therefore fail to comply with \na Federal requirement or Federal regulation and end up getting hit with \na huge fine, all of which they had no control over.\n  This amendment is tightly drafted so a small business cannot use it \nas an excuse not to meet a Federal obligation or Federal regulation. It \ndoes not allow a small business to take the Y2K issue and use it to \nbootstrap into avoiding an obligation which it has in the area of some \nFederal regulatory regime. Rather, it is very specific. It says, first \noff, this must be an incident of a first-time regulatory violation, so \nno small business which has any sort of track record of violating that \nFederal regulation could qualify for this exemption. So it has to be a \nfirst-time event.\n  Second, the small business has to prove it made a good-faith effort \nto remedy the Y2K problem before it got hit with it. So it cannot be a \nsituation where the small business said: I have this Y2K problem coming \nat me, I have this Federal regulation problem coming at me, I am going \nto let the Y2K problem occur and then I will say that is my reason for \nnot complying. Small business must have made a good-faith attempt to \nremedy the Y2K problem.\n  Third, the Y2K problem cannot be used if the violation was to avoid \nor resulted from efforts to prevent disruption of a critical function \nor service.\n  Fourth, the small business has to demonstrate the actions to \nremediate the violation were begun when the violation was discovered. \nSo the small business has to show it attempted to address the problem \nas soon as it realized it had a Y2K problem, and it cannot allow the \nfact it has a Y2K problem, again, to go unabated and use that lack of \ncorrection of a problem as an excuse for not meeting the obligations of \nthe Federal regulation.\n  Fifth, that notice was submitted to the appropriate agency when the \nsmall business became aware of the violation and therefore knew it had \na Y2K problem.\n  The practical effect of this will be small businesses throughout this \ncountry, which are inadvertently and beyond their own capacity to \ncontrol a hit with a Y2K problem, will not be doubled up with a penalty \nfor not meeting a Federal regulatory requirement that they could not \nmeet as a result of the Y2K problem kicking in.\n  It is a simple amendment. It is a reasonable amendment. It really \ndoes not get into the overall contest that has been generated around \nthis bill which is: Should there be an exemption of liability for \nmanufacturers of the product which creates the Y2K problem? Rather, it \nis trying to address the innocent bystander who gets hit, that small \nbusinessperson who suddenly wakes up, realizes he has a Y2K problem, \ntries to correct the Y2K problem, can't correct the Y2K problem, and as \na result fails to comply with a Federal regulation, and then the \nFederal Government comes down and hits him with a big fine and there \nwas nothing the small business could do. It gets hit with a double \nwhammy: Its systems go down and they get hit with a fine.\n\n  This just goes to civil remedy, to remedies which involve monetary \nactivity, so it does not address issues where a business would be \nrequired to remedy through action. An example here might be OSHA. If \nthey had to\n\n[[Page S6853]]\n\ncorrect a workplace problem, they would still have to correct the \nworkplace problem whether or not they had the Y2K failure. If they had \nan environmental problem which required remedial action, such as a \nchange in their water discharge activities, again they would have to \nmeet the remedial action.\n  All this amendment does, it is very limited in scope, it just goes to \nthe financial liability the company might incur as a result of failing \nto meet a regulation. It is a proposal which is strongly supported by \nthe small business community. The NFIB is a supporter of this proposal \nand will be scoring this vote as one of its primary votes as it puts \ntogether its assessment of Members of Congress, and their support for \nsmall business.\n  It is a reasonable proposal. I certainly hope it will end up being \naccepted. In any event, I understand under the unanimous consent \nagreement which has been generated there will be a vote on it Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the amendment to the \nY2K Act sponsored by Senator Gregg and which cosponsored. This is an \nimportant amendment that will waive Federal civil money penalties for \nblameless small businesses that have in good faith attempted to correct \ntheir Y2K problems, but find themselves inadvertently in violation of a \nFederal regulation or rule despite such efforts. Most experts that have \nstudied the Y2K problem agree that regardless of how diligent a \nbusiness is at fixing its Y2K problems, unknowable difficulties are \nstill likely to arise that may place the operations of such businesses \nat risk. This amendment will ensure that the government does not \nfurther punish small businesses that have attempted to fix their Y2K \nproblems, but are nevertheless placed in financial peril because of \nthese problems.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on small Business, I have paid \nparticular attention to the problems that small businesses are facing \nregarding the Y2K problem. Small businesses are trying to become Y2K \ncomplaint, but face many obstacles in doing so. One of the major \nobstacles is capital. Small businesses are the most vulnerable sector \nof our business community, as many of them do not have a significant \namount of excess cash flow. Yet, a great number of small businesses are \nalready incurring significant costs to become Y2K compliant. Earlier \nthis year, Congress passed Y2K legislation that I authored to provide \nsmall businesses with the means to fix their own computer systems. Even \nsmall businesses that take advantage of that program, however, will see \ndecreased cash flow from their efforts to correct Y2K problems.\n  The last thing, therefore, this government should do is levy civil \nmoney penalties on small businesses that find themselves inadvertently \nconfronted with Y2K problems. Many of these businesses will already \nhave had their operations disrupted and may be in danger of going out \nof business entirely. The Federal Government should not push them over \nthe edge.\n  This amendment has been carefully crafted so that only those small \nbusinesses that are subject to civil money penalties through no fault \nof their own are granted a waiver. Under this amendment, a small \nbusiness would only be eligible for a waiver of civil money penalties \nif it had not violated the applicable rule or regulation in the last 3 \nyears. This provision will help to ensure that businesses that have \ncontinuing violations or that have a history of violating Federal rules \nand regulations will not be let off the hook.\n  Small businesses must also demonstrate to the government agency \nlevying the penalties that the business had previously made a good \nfaith effort to correct its Y2K problems. We must not provide \ndisincentives to businesses so that they do not fix their Y2K problems \nnow. This amendment does not provide such a disincentive. In addition, \nto receive relief, a small business must show that the violation of the \nFederal rule or regulation was unavoidable or occurred as a result of \nefforts to prevent the disruption of critical functions or services \nthat could result in harm to life or property. The amendment also \nprovides that, upon identification of a violation, the small business \nconcern must have initiated reasonable and timely efforts to correct \nit. Finally, in order to receive the relief provided by this amendment, \na small business must have submitted notice, within seven business \ndays, to the appropriate Federal agency.\n  What is clear from these requirements is that the amendment will only \napply to conscientious small businesses that have tried in good faith \nto prepare for the Y2K problem and that promptly correct inadvertent \nviolations of a Federal rule or regulation that nevertheless occur as a \nresult of such problem. It is critically important that these innocent \nvictims not be punished by the Federal Government for a problem that \nconfronts us all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is correct. \nHe has explained his amendment with great clarity. It may or may not be \nseriously contested. We simply are not going to know that until early \nnext week, so I thank him for his graciousness in waiting for a final \ndecision until then.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today there are 204 days left before \nthe Y2K problem becomes a concrete reality for any entity throughout \nthe world that has a computer system.\n  The Y2K issue has been publicized across this nation; sometimes to a \ngreater degree than necessary. Some Americans have even resorted to \nhoarding food and planning for the end of the world. While no one has a \nmagic answer as to what will happen on the first of the year, enough \neffort has been made by the public and private sector to ensure that \nAmericans are aware of this issue.\n  However, I am concerned that under the current version of S. 96, \ncompanies may continue sales of non-Y2K compliant products even after \nenactment of this act without disclosing non-Y2K compliance to \nconsumers. While I strongly support this important piece of \nlegislation, I am concerned that unscrupulous marketers may attempt to \ndeceive consumers by continuing to sell non-Y2K compliant products. A \ncomputer given for a Christmas gift isn't much of a gift when it stops \nworking 7 days later.\n  Thus I planned to offer an amendment to section 5(b)(3) that would \nlift the cap on punitive damages for products sold after the date of \nenactment of this act if the plaintiff could have established by clear \nand convincing evidence that the defendant knowingly sold non-Y2K \ncompliant products absent a signed waiver from the plaintiff. However, \nI have agreed to defer to the chairman so that this issue can be best \naddressed in conference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could inquire of my colleague from Alaska how his \noriginal amendment would have applied if, for example, a company bought \na Y2K-compliant computer server in November 1999, and that server has \nto interact with other software and networked hardware manufactured by \nother companies that may or may not be Y2K compliant.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend for his question. My amendment would \nhave imposed liability only if the manufacturer sold a server that was \nnon-Y2K compliant by itself after the date of enactment of this act. My \namendment would not apply to a Y2K compliant server that failed due to \nthe non-Y2K compliance of installed software or attached hardware \nmanufactured by other companies.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague for his clarification and will be \npleased to address his concerns in conference.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Arizona for his attention to \nthis issue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I appreciate all the hard work that has \nbeen done on this legislation by my colleagues. I know they are sincere \nin their concern about the effect of Y2K computer failures and in their \ndesire to do something to encourage solutions to those problems in \nadvance of the end of the year. But this bill is ill-considered\n\n[[Page S6854]]\n\nand ill-advised. As the Justice Department has noted with respect to \noriginal version of this bill, and I think the judgment remains \naccurate: this bill would be ``by far the most sweeping litigation \nreform measure ever enacted if it were approved in its current form. \nThe bill makes extraordinarily dramatic changes in both federal \nprocedural and substantive law and in state procedural and substantive \nlaw.''\n  For all the heated rhetoric we have heard on this floor over the past \nfew days, I have not seen evidence that legislation is needed to create \nincentives for businesses to correct Y2K problems. More importantly, I \ndo not agree that this bill actually creates those incentives. Indeed, \nI think that in many ways it does just the opposite. It rewards the \nworst actors with its damages caps and its prohibition of recovery for \neconomic loss, and it may even give incentives to delay corrective \naction with the cooling off period and the changes in class action \nrules.\n  A major concern that I have about this bill is the breathtakingly \nbroad and unprecedented preemption of state law that it contains. I \nsimply do not agree that we should overrule the judgment of state \nlegislatures and judges who have defined the law in their states for \ntraditional contract and tort cases. This bill benefits one class of \nbusinesses, those who sell products that may cause Y2K problems, over \nanother class of business, those who buy such products, and individual \nconsumers. It completely disregards whether state lawmakers and judges \nwould reach the same conclusions. I see no reason why Congress should \ndictate tort and contract law to the states. Protections for injured \nparties that have been developed through decades of experience are \nbeing summarily wiped out by the Congress, on the basis of a very thin \nrecord. Mr. President, that is not right.\n  Another serious problem with this bill has to do with the elimination \nof joint and several liability in the vast majority of Y2K cases. Mr. \nChairman, we all have heard many times the horror story of a poor deep \npocket defendant found to be only 1% liable who ends up on the hook for \nthe entire judgment in a tort case. Frankly, I am aware of few actual \nexamples of this phenomenon, but I know it is theoretically possible. A \nfar more frequent occurrence, however, is a case where two or three \ndefendants are found equally liable, but one or more of them is \nfinancially insolvent. The real question raised by joint and several \nversus proportionate liability is who should bear the risk that the \nfull share of damages cannot be collected from one defendant. Who \nshould have the responsibility to identify all potentially liable \nparties and bring them into the suit? Who should bear the risk that one \nof the defendants has gone bankrupt? Should it be the innocent \nplaintiff who the law is supposed to make whole, or a culpable \ndefendant? Mr. President, to me that question is easy to answer. \nSomeone who has done wrong should bear that risk. But states have \nreached different balances on this question, based on their own \nexperience of decades and decades of tort cases. How is it that we in \nthe Congress all of the sudden became experts on this issue? Where do \nwe get off overriding the judgment of state legislatures on this \ncrucial question of public policy?\n  Now I recognize that changes to the bill obtained by Senator Dodd \nwould limit the effect of the abrogation of joint and several liability \nin a narrow set of cases involving egregious conduct by defendants or \nparticularly poor plaintiffs. But I don't think this change goes far \nenough in protecting innocent victims from the harsh reality that \nsometimes the worst offenders have the least money. Section 6 of this \nbill eliminates joint and several liability in virtually every Y2K \ncase, and that is wrong.\n  Let me quote one of the bill's stated purposes from Section 2(b) of \nthe bill--``to establish uniform legal standards that give all \nbusinesses and users of technology reasonable incentives to solve Y2K \ncomputer date-change problems before they develop.'' But Mr. President, \nthis bill doesn't establish uniform standards. It preempts state law \nonly in one direction--always in favor of defendants and against the \ninterests of the injured party.\n\n  As I stated before, I don't agree that uniform standards are needed. \nI think our state legislatures and judges are due more respect than \nthis bill gives them. But if there is truly a compelling interest in \nuniformity, then I do not understand why this bill preempts state laws \nthat offer more protection to injured plaintiffs but not those state \nlaws that are less generous to the injured party. Yesterday, we even \nadopted, without debate, an amendment offered by Senator Allard that \nsays specifically that any state law that provides more protection for \ndefendants in Y2K cases than this bill does is not preempted. So \npreemption is a one-way street here. If you're in a state where the law \nis moving in the same direction as this bill and cutting back on the \ndamages that can be recovered in a Y2K suit, you're fine, but if your \nstate is going in the wrong direction, you get run over.\n  Mr. President, that is not fair. And it certainly is not consistent \nwith the bill's stated purpose of providing uniform national standards.\n  Let me give you one example. About 30 states have no caps on punitive \ndamages. Three other states have caps that are more generous than the \ncaps in this bill. In Y2K cases involving defendants who are small \nbusinesses as defined in this bill, those state laws would be \npreempted. About a dozen states have higher caps on some kind of cases \nand lower caps on others. This bill would partially preempt those state \nlaws, overriding the balance that the duly elected state legislatures \nin question decided was fair and just.\n  Six states do not allow punitive damages in tort cases, and one has \ncaps that are lower than those permitted under this bill. Those states \nwould be allowed to continue to apply the judgments of their \nlegislatures and courts in Y2K cases.\n  My state of Wisconsin has generally rejected imposing arbitrary caps \non punitive damages, instead trusting judges and juries to determine an \nappropriate punishment for defendants who act in a particularly harmful \nand intentional or malicious way. The state of Washington, to take an \nexample, has eliminated punitive damages. Why should the policy \ndecisions of the state of Washington be respected by this Congress more \nthan the policy decisions of Wisconsin--or Pennsylvania, or Arizona, or \nNew York, or the majority of states.\n  The one-sided tilt of this bill is very troubling. Punitive damages \ncaps of any kind are bad ideas I believe. Remember that in every state \npunitive damages can be awarded only in cases of intentional or \noutrageous misconduct. So the protection offered by these caps goes to \nthe very worst Y2K offenders--those who have acted intentionally or \nmaliciously to avoid fixing their Y2K problems. Where is the justice \nand balance in that?\n  Mr. President, because I think it's important for the Senate to take \nevery aspect of legislation into account in our debate here on the \nfloor, I have a few more facts I'd like to add--facts about how much \nmoney has been donated to the political parties and to candidates by a \ncouple of powerful groups that have a huge stake in this bill.\n  Now the dollar figures I'm about to cite, keep in mind, are only for \nthe last election cycle, 1997 to 1998. First there's the computer and \nelectronics industry, which gave close to $6 million in PAC and soft \nmoney during the last election cycle--$5,772,146 to be exact. And \nthere's also the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, which gave \n$2,836,350 in PAC and soft money contributions to parties and \ncandidates in 1997 and 1998.\n  As I said, I cite these figures so that as my colleagues weigh the \npros and cons of this bill, they, and the public, are aware of the \nfinancial interests that have been brought to bear on the legislation. \nThe lobbying efforts, as we know, have been significant, and so have \nthe campaign contributions. And the public can be excused if it wonders \nif those contributions have distorted the process by which this bill \nwas crafted.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Administration has indicated it \nwill veto this bill in its current form. I will support that veto as \nwell as voting against the bill. We need to encourage problem solving \nand remediation to avoid a disaster on January 1 in the Year 2000. But \nwe don't need to enact this bill. Indeed, while trying to address a \nsupposed litigation explosion,\n\n[[Page S6855]]\n\nwe may well have created an explosion of unfairness to people and \nbusinesses who are injured by the negligent or reckless behavior of \nthose who sell non-Y2K compliant products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6855-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I rise today both to pay tribute to and \nto thank the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) for \ntheir recent announcement to provide economic assistance to the Kosovar \nAlbanian refugees. These funds, some $300 million, represent a very \ngenerous gift and will prove invaluable to the displaced people of \nKosovo by helping them receive the food, shelter and clothing they need \nto survive in the refugee camps and later, when they return to their \nhomes in Kosovo. Furthermore, the aid from Taiwan will provide \nemergency medical assistance to the refugees, educational materials for \nthe displaced children and job training for those that need it. The \ngovernment of the ROC is even making it possible for some refugees to \nreceive short term accommodations and job training in Taiwan while they \nawait the rebuilding of their homes, businesses, schools, and \nhospitals.\n  The generosity of the government of the ROC is a tribute to the \nthoughtfulness and caring of the Taiwanese people and serves as a \nwonderful example for the entire international community. The current \npresident of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, typifies this compassion and I would \nlike to personally thank him and his foreign minister, Jason Hu, who is \na good friend of mine, for all they have done not only for the people \nof Taiwan but not for the people of Kosovo. Only through such \ngenerosity and compassion can the people of the Balkans begin to move \npast the horrors they have experienced over the past few months and \nbuild a better future for themselves and their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6855-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to require equitable coverage of prescription \ncontraceptive drugs and devices, and contraceptive\n\n[[Page S6858]]\n\nservices under health plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\n\n    Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Harry Reid, to reintroduce the Equity in Prescription \nInsurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act. We are back today, with the \nsupport of 30 Members of the Senate, to finish the work we began in the \nlast Congress.\n  Why are we back again this year? Because the need behind the Equity \nin Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act has not \nabated. There are three million unintended pregnancies every year--half \nof all pregnancies that occur every year in this country. And \nfrighteningly, approximately half of all unintended pregnancies end in \nabortion.\n  I am firmly pro-choice and I believe in a woman's right to a safe and \nlegal abortion when she needs this procedure. But I want abortion to be \nan option that a woman rarely needs. So how do we prevent this? How do \nwe reduce the number of unintended pregnancies?\n  The safest and most effective means of preventing unintended \npregnancies are with prescription contraceptives. And while the vast \nmajority of insurers cover prescription drugs, they treat prescription \ncontraceptives very differently. In fact, half of large group plans \nexclude coverage of contraceptives. And only one-third cover oral \ncontraceptives--the most popular form of reversible birth control.\n  When one realizes the insurance ``carve-out'' for these prescriptions \nand related outpatient treatments, it is no longer a mystery why women \nspend 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs. No \nwoman should have to forgo or rely on inexpensive and less effective \ncontraceptives for purely economic reasons, knowing that she risks an \nunintended pregnancy.\n  In last year's Omnibus Appropriations Bill, Congress instructed the \nhealth plans participating in the Federal Employees Health Benefit \nPlan--the largest employer-sponsored health insurance plan in the \nworld--to provide prescription contraceptive coverage if they cover \nprescription drugs as a part of their benefits package. The protections \nwe afford to Members of Congress, their staff, other federal employees \nand annuitants, and to the approximately two million women of \nreproductive age who are participating in FEHBP need to be extended to \nthe rest of the country.\n  Unfortunately, the lack of contraceptive coverage in health insurance \nis not news to most women. Countless American women have been shocked \nto learn that their insurance does not cover contraceptives, one of \ntheir most basic health care needs, even though other prescription \ndrugs which are equally valuable to their lives are routinely covered. \nLess than half--49 percent --of all large-group health care plans cover \nany contraceptive method at all and only 15 percent cover the five most \ncommon reversible birth control methods. HMOs are more likely to cover \ncontraceptives, but only 39 percent cover all five reversible methods. \nAnd ironically, 86 percent of large group plans, preferred provider \norganizations, and HMOs cover sterilization and between 66 and 70 \npercent of these different plans do cover abortion.\n  The concept underlying EPICC is simple. This legislation says that if \ninsurers cover prescription drugs and devices, they must also cover \nFDA-approved prescription contraceptives. And in conjunction with this, \nEPICC requires health plans which already cover basic health care \nservices to also cover outpatient services related to prescription \ncontraceptives.\n  The bill does not require insurance companies to cover prescription \ndrugs. What the bill does say is that if insurers cover prescription \ndrugs, they cannot carve prescription contraceptives out of their \nformularies. And it says that insurers which cover outpatient health \ncare services cannot limit or exclude coverage of the medical and \ncounseling services necessary for effective contraceptive use.\n  This bill is good health policy. By helping families to adequately \nspace their pregnancies, contraceptives contribute to healthy \npregnancies and healthy births, reduce rates of maternal complications, \nand reduces the possibility of low-birthweight births.\n  Furthermore, the Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive \nCoverage Act makes good economic sense. We know that contraceptives are \ncost-effective: in the public sector, for every dollar invested in \nfamily planning, $4 to $14 is saved in health care and related costs. \nAnd all methods of reversible contraceptives are cost-effective when \ncompared to the cost of unintended pregnancy. A sexually active woman \nwho uses no contraception costs the health care provider an average of \n$3,225 in a given year. The average cost of an uncomplicated vaginal \ndelivery in 1993 was approximately $6,400. And for every 100 women who \ndo not use contraceptives in a given year, 85 percent will become \npregnant.\n  Why do insurance companies exclude prescription contraceptive \ncoverage from their list of covered benefits--especially when they \ncover other prescription drugs? The tendency of insurance plans to \ncover sterilization and abortion reflects, in part, their long-standing \ntendency to cover surgery and treatment over prevention. Sterilization \nand abortion is also cheaper. But insurers do not feel compelled to \ncover prescription contraceptives because they know that most women who \nlack contraceptive coverage will simply pay for them out of pocket. And \nin order to prevent an unintended pregnancy, a woman needs to be on \nsome form of birth control for almost 30 years of her life.\n  The Equity in Prescription Insurance and Contraceptive Coverage Act \ntells insurance companies that we can no longer tolerate policies that \ndisadvantage women and disadvantage our nation. When our bill is \npassed, women will finally be assured of equity in prescription drug \ncoverage and health care services. And America's unacceptably high \nrates of unintended pregnancies and abortions will be reduced in the \nprocess.\n  The philosophy behind the bill is that contraceptives should be \ntreated no differently than any other prescription drug or device. It \ndoes not give contraceptives any type of special insurance coverage, \nbut instead seeks to achieve equity of treatment and parity of \ncoverage. For that reason, the bill specifies that if a plan imposes a \ndeductible or cost-sharing requirement on prescription drugs or \ndevices, it can impose the same deductible or cost-sharing requirement \non prescription contraception. But it cannot charge a higher cost-\nsharing requirement or deductible on contraceptives. Outpatient \ncontraceptive services must also be treated similarly to general \noutpatient health care services.\n  Time and time again Americans have expressed the desire for their \nleaders to come together to work on the problems that face us. This \nbill exemplifies that spirit of cooperation. It crosses some very wide \ngulfs and makes some very meaningful changes in policy that will \nbenefit countless Americans.\n  As someone who is pro-choice, I firmly believe that abortions should \nbe safe, legal, and rare. Through this bill, I invite both my pro-\nchoice and pro-life colleagues to join with me in emphasizing the \nrare.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with Senator \nSnowe, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of \n1999. Senator Snowe and I first introduced this bill in 1997.\n  The legislation we introduce today would require insurers, HMO's and \nemployee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to \ncover contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it \nwould require these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services \nif a plan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit \nthe imposition of copays and deductibles for prescription \ncontraceptives or outpatient services that are greater than those for \nother prescription drugs.\n  I hope that we have the success this year that we had last year in \ndirecting the Federal Health Benefit Plans to cover contraception. As \nmany of you recall, after a tough fight, Congresswoman Lowey and I were \nable to amend the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill so that Federal \nHealth Plans must cover FDA approved contraceptives.\n  EPICC is about equality for women, healthy mothers and babies, and \nreducing the number of abortions that are\n\n[[Page S6859]]\n\nperformed in this country each year. For all the advances women have \nmade, they still earn 74 cents for every dollar a man makes and on top \nof that, they pay 68 percent more in out of pocket costs for health \ncare than men. Reproductive health care services account for much of \nthis 68 percent difference. You can be sure, if men had to pay for \ncontraceptive drugs and devices, the insurance industry would cover \nthem.\n  The health industry has done a poor job of responding to women's \nhealth needs. According to a study done by the Alan Guttmacher \nInstitute, 49 percent of all large-group health care plans do not \nroutinely cover any contraceptive method at all, and only 15 percent \ncover all five of the most common contraceptive methods.\n  Women are forced to use disposable income to pay for family planning \nservices not covered by their health insurance--``the pill'' one of the \nmost common birth control methods, can cost over $300 a year. Women who \nlack disposable income are forced to use less reliable methods of \ncontraception and risk an unintended pregnancy.\n  If our bill was only about equality in health care coverage between \nmen and women, that would be reason enough to pass it. But our \nlegislation also provides the means to reduce abortions, and have \nhealthier mothers and babies. Each year approximately 3 million \npregnancies, or 50 percent of all pregnancies, in this country are \nunintended. Of these unintended pregnancies, about half end in \nabortion.\n  Reliable family planning methods must be made available if we wish to \nreduce this disturbing number.\n  Ironically, abortion is routinely covered by 66 percent of indemnity \nplans, 67 percent of preferred provider organizations, and 70 percent \nof HMO's. Sterilization and tubal ligation are also routinely covered. \nIt does not make sense financially for insurance companies to cover \nthese more expensive services, rather than contraception. But insurance \ncompanies know that women will bear the costs of contraception \nthemselves--and if they can not afford their method of choice, there \nare always less expensive means to turn to. Of course less expensive \nalso means less reliable.\n  This just seems like bad business to me. If a woman can not afford \neffective contraception, and she turns to a less effective method and \ngets pregnant, that pregnancy will cost the insurance company much more \nthan it would cost them to prevent it. According to one recent study in \nthe American Journal of Public Health, by increasing the number of \nwomen who use oral contraceptives by 15 percent, health plans would \naccrue enough savings in pregnancy care costs to cover oral \ncontraceptives for all users under the plan. Studies indicate that for \nevery dollar of public funds invested in family planning, four to \nfourteen dollars of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-\nrelated costs. Not only will a reduction in unintended pregnancies \nreduce abortion rates, it will also lead to a reduction in low-birth \nweight, infant mortality and maternal morbidity.\n  Low birth weight refers to babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds at \nbirth. How much a baby weighs at birth is directly related to the \nbaby's survival, health and development. In Nevada, during the past \ndecade, the percent of low birth weight babies has increased by 7 \npercent. These figures are important because women who use \ncontraception and plan for the birth of their baby are more likely to \nget prenatal care and lead a healthier life style. The infant mortality \nrate measures the number of babies who die during their first year of \nlife. In Nevada, between the years of 1995 and 1997, the infant \nmortality rate was 5.9, this means that of the 77,871 babies born \nduring this period, 459 infants died before they reached their first \nbirthday. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality \ndetermined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if \nall women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.''\n  It is vitally important to the health of our country that quality \ncontraception is not beyond the financial reach of women. Providing \naccess to contraception will bring down the unintended pregnancy rate, \ninsure good reproductive health for women, and reduce the number of \nabortions. It is a significant step, in my opinion, to have support \nfrom both pro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill. Prevention is \nthe common ground on which we can all stand. Let's begin to attack the \nproblem of unintended pregnancies at its root.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER:\n  S. 1201. A bill to prohibit law enforcement agencies from imposing a \nwaiting period before accepting reports of missing persons between the \nages of 18 and 21; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                             suzanne's law\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today \nto remedy what I believe is a significant shortcoming in federal law \nrelating to missing person reports. My bill is entitled ``Suzanne's \nLaw,'' to serve as a continuing reminder of the plight of Suzanne \nLyall. Suzanne, a resident of Ballston Spa, New York, disappeared last \nyear at age 19 during the course of her senior year at the State \nUniversity of New York at Albany. All indications are that her \ndisappearance was due to foul play. She has never been found, despite \ninvestigations by campus security, the local police, and the FBI. \nSuzanne's family, friends and relatives dearly miss her and have \nundertaken admirable efforts to secure improvements in campus security \nand in missing person reporting.\n  The Lyall family has brought it to my attention that federal law \ncurrently prohibits state and local law enforcement officials from \nimposing a 24-hour waiting period before accepting a report regarding \nthe disappearance of a person under the age of 18, yet it does not \nextend similar protection for reports of missing persons between the \nages of 18 and 21. This is an oversight that must be remedied. Prompt \naction on the part of law enforcement authorities is of the essence in \nmissing person cases. Thus, my bill would prohibit state and local law \nenforcement officials from imposing a 24-hour waiting period before \naccepting ``missing youth'' reports--defined as reports indicating that \na person of at least 18 years of age and less than 21 years of age was \nmissing under suspicious circumstances. Enactment of this legislation \nwould enhance the prospects for family reunification in missing person \ncases and may spare other families the pain and sacrifice experienced \nby the Lyalls.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1202. A bill to require a warrant of consent before an inspection \nof land may be carried out to enforce any law administered by the \nSecretary of the Interior; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                private property protection act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Private Property \nProtection Act of 1999.\n  This bill would require that Interior Department personnel obtain \neither the property owner's permission or a properly attained and legal \nsearch warrant before they enter someone's private property.\n  America's law abiding private property owners, especially our \nranchers and farmers, should not be subject to unwarranted trespassing \nand egregious random searches by federal bureaucrats. They deserve to \nbe treated fairly and according to the law, just like other Americans. \nThey deserve the same private property rights that other Americans \nenjoy.\n  Under our legal system, if appropriate sworn law enforcement officers \ncan demonstrate to a judge that there is probable cause to believe that \na person has broken the law, and that there is a justified need to \nenter a property, then those law enforcement officials can obtain a \nsearch warrant to enter and search a private property. This is \nreasonable, just and how it should be. I have a firsthand understanding \nof this from the time I served as a Deputy Sheriff.\n  However, all too often our ranchers, farmers and other private \nproperty owners are being denied these same basic legal property rights \nwhen it comes to federal employees operating under endangered species \nlaws. Interior Department employees are trespassing on private property \nwithout the owner's permission or a search warrant. Many of these \nInterior Department employees who are trespassing have no sworn legal \nauthority whatsoever.\n  Disturbing incidents of federal agency personnel operating outside of \nthe law, and willfully trespassing on private property without any \nlegal just\n\n[[Page S6860]]\n\ncause, threatens to erode our fundamental property rights. One \nparticular case that occurred in El Paso County, in my home state of \nColorado, stands as a prime example.\n  A February 5th, 1999 article entitled ``Federal employee pleads no \ncontest to trespassing'' in the AG JOURNAL illustrates this El Paso \nCounty case. Last fall, a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist \npleaded no contest to a charge of second degree criminal trespassing. \nThis individual is one of the many thousands employed by the Interior \nDepartment, and had no legal basis to be on a private ranch located \nnear Colorado Springs. His sentence included a $138 fine and 30 hours \nof community service.\n  I applaud the El Paso County District Attorney's Office for standing \nup to federal lawyers and pursuing this case to its rightful \nconclusion. It is a small but important victory for American private \nproperty owners. It also illustrates a disturbing ability of some \nfederal employees to act as though they are above the law.\n  Furthermore, the American taxpayers are picking up the tab for the \nlegal defense of these trespassers. When I inquired with both the \nInterior Department and the Justice Department as to how much taxpayer \nmoney was spent to defend the convicted U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \ntrespasser, they did not disclose the specific dollar amount. These \nagencies seem to be sending federal personnel the message: ``Go ahead \nand trespass on private property. If you get caught, we'll go ahead and \nfix it because we think that the benefits of trespassing outweigh the \ncosts of getting caught.'' This is not acceptable.\n  Unfortunately, the El Paso County incident is far from isolated. It \nis certain that every year, hundreds of private property owners, \nranchers and farmers are subject to trespassing by federal employees. \nWe will never know how many trespassing cases go unreported because \nAmericans feel that they can not beat the federal government's \nbureaucrats and lawyers, and fear that if they do, there may be \nretribution.\n  The Colorado Cattlemen's Association has written a letter of support \nfor the Private Property Protection Act of 1999. I appreciate their \nsupport for this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1202\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: Colorado Farm Bureau strongly \n     supports legislation to require officers or employees of the \n     Department of the Interior to obtain a warrant or consent of \n     the landowner before conducting inspections or search and \n     seizure of private property. While our Bill of Rights \n     contains protection for property owners, the provision is \n     largely ignored in regard to the regulatory actions of the \n     Department of the Interior.\n       Farm Bureau policy opposes allowing public access to or \n     through private property without permission of the property \n     owner or authorized agent. We support legislation that \n     requires federal officials to notify property owners and \n     obtain permission before going onto private lands.\n       Property rights protection for farmers and ranchers is \n     critical to the success of their operations and future well \n     being. Farm Bureau supports your efforts to protect \n     landowners from the Interior Department entering their land \n     without permission or a warrant.\n       Thank you for your continued support of agriculture.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Roger Bill Mitchell,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Dodd, Mrs. \n        Murray, and Mrs. Lincoln) (by request):\n  S. 1203. A bill to amend the Older Americans Act of 1965 to extend \nauthorizations of appropriations for programs under the Act through \nfiscal year 2004, to establish a National Family Caregiver Support \nProgram, to modernize aging programs and services, to address the need \nto engage in life course planning, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n                 older americans act amendments of 1999\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAdministration's proposal to reauthorize the Older Americans Act (OAA). \nThe Older Americans Act is a vital program that meets the day-to-day \nneeds of our nation's seniors. Through an aging network that involves \n57 state agencies on aging, 660 area agencies on aging, and 27,000 \nservice providers, the OAA provides countless services to our country's \nolder Americans. The OAA was last reauthorized in 1992 and its \nauthorization expired in 1995. The time is long overdue for Congress to \nreauthorize this program. That is why, as the Ranking Democrat on the \nSubcommittee on Aging, I am working with the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee to introduce a bipartisan bill in the Senate to \nreauthorize the OAA. That's why I am here today to introduce the \nAdministration's plan to reauthorize the Act as a courtesy and to \nremind my fellow colleagues about the importance of passing an OAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  Many Americans have not heard of the Older Americans Act. They've \nprobably heard of Meals on Wheels and maybe they know about the senior \ncenter down the street. But our country's seniors who count on the \nservices provided under the Act couldn't do without them. Whether it's \ncongregate or home delivered meals programs, legal assistance, the \nlong-term care ombudsman, information and assistance, or part-time \ncommunity service jobs for low-income seniors. This Act covers \neverything from transportation to a doctor's appointment to a hot meal \nand companionship at a local senior center to elder abuse prevention.\n  But we're not going to just settle for the status quo. We must make \nthe most of this opportunity to modernize and improve the OAA to meet \nthe needs of seniors. That's why I'm including the National Family \nCaregiver Support Program in this bill I'm introducing today. Through a \npartnership between states and area agencies on aging, this program \nwill provide information about resources available to family \ncaregivers; assistance to families in locating services; caregiver \ncounseling, training, and peer support to help them deal with the \nemotional and physical stresses of caregiving; and respite care. We \nmust get behind our nation's caregivers by helping those who practice \nself-help. Caregivers often put in a 36 hour day: taking care of the \nfamily, pursuing a career, caring for the senior who needs care, and \nfinding the information on care and putting together a support system. \nWe need to\n\n[[Page S6861]]\n\nsupport those who are providing this invaluable care.\n  I want to reauthorize the OAA this year before the new millennium \nwhen our population over age 65 will more than double. I'm pleased that \nour colleagues in the House are moving in this direction as well. I \nurge my colleagues here in the Senate to act promptly once a bill is \nvoted out of committee and support our nation's seniors by \nreauthorizing the Older Americans Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1204. A bill to promote general and applied research for health \npromotion and disease prevention among the elderly, to amend title \nXVIII of the Social Security Act to add preventative benefits, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 healthy seniors promotion act of 1999\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to announce the introduction \nof the Healthy Seniors Promotion Act of 1999.\n  This bill has a clear, simple, yet profoundly important message. That \nmessage is, ``Preventive health care for the elderly works.''\n  Regardless of your age, preventive health care improves quality of \nlife. And despite common misperceptions, declines in health status are \nnot inevitable with age. a healthier lifestyle, even one adopted later \nin life, can increase active life expectancy and decrease disability.\n  The Healthy Seniors Promotion Act of 1999 has a broad base of support \nfrom across the health care and aging communities, including the \nNational Council on Aging, the American Geriatrics Society, the \nAmerican Heart Association, the American Council of the Blind, the \nAmerican College of Preventive Medicine, the National Osteoporosis \nFoundation, and the Partnership for Prevention.\n  This bill goes a long way toward changing the fundamental focus of \nthe Medicare program from one that continues to focus on the treatment \nof illness and disability--a function which is reactionary--to one that \nis proactive and increases the attention paid to prevention for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  This bill has 4 main components: First, the bill establishes the \nhealthy Seniors Promotion Program. This program will be spearheaded by \nan interagency workgroup within the Department of Health and Human \nServices, including the Health Care Financing Administration, the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, the Agency for Health Care \nPolicy Research, the National Institute on Aging, and the \nAdministration on Aging.\n  This working group, first and foremost, will bring together all the \nagencies within HHS that address the social, medical, and behavioral \nhealth issues affecting the elderly, and instructs them to undertake a \nseries of actions which will serve to increase prevention-related \nservices among the elderly.\n  A major function of this working group will be to oversee the \ndevelopment, monitoring, and evaluation of an applied research \ninitiative whose main goals will be to study: (1) The effectiveness of \nusing different types of providers of care, as well as looking at \nalternative delivery settings, when delivering health promotion and \ndisease prevention services, and (2) the most effective means of \neducating Medicare beneficiaries and providers regarding the importance \nof prevention and to examine ways to improve utilization of existing \nand future prevention-related services.\n  Mr. President, this latter point is critical. The fact is that there \nare a number of prevention-related services available to Medicare \nbeneficiaries today, including mammograms and colorectal cancer \nscreening. But those services are seriously underutilized.\n  In a study published by Dartmouth University this spring--The \nDartmouth Atlas of health Care 1999--it was found that only 28 percent \nof women age 65-69 receive mammograms and only 12 percent of \nbeneficiaries were screened for colorectal cancer.\n  These are disturbing figures and they clearly demonstrate the need to \nfind new and better ways to increase the rates of utilization of \nproven, demonstrated prevention services. Our bill would get us the \ninformation we need to increase rates of utilization for these \nservices.\n  A second major portion of this bill is the coverage of additional \npreventive services for the Medicare program. The services that I am \nincluding focus on some of the most prominent, underlying risk factors \nfor illness that face all Medicare beneficiaries. This bill would \ninclude screening for hypertension, counseling for tobacco cessation, \nscreening for glaucoma, and counseling for hormone replacement therapy. \nAttacking these prominent risk factors would reduce Medicare \nbeneficiaries' risk for health problems such as stroke, osteoporosis, \nheart disease, and blindness.\n  How did we choose these risk factors? We turned to the experts. Based \non the recommendations of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, \nthese prevention services represent the recommendations of the Task \nForce which is the nationally recognized body in the area of clinical \nprevention services.\n  But simply screening or counseling for a preventive benefit is not \nenough. For example, to tell a 68-year-old woman that she ought to \nreceive hormone replacement therapy in order to reduce her risk or \nosteoporosis and bone fractures from falls, and then to tell her you \nwon't pay for the treatment makes no sense.\n  Since falls and the resulting injuries are among the most serious and \ncommon medical problems suffered by the elderly--with nearly 80-90 \npercent of hip fractures and 60-90 percent of forearm and spine \nfractures among women 65 and older estimated to be osteoporosis-\nrelated--to sit idly by and not take the extra steps needed would be \nirresponsible.\n  That is why, Mr. President, we are going the extra mile. The third \nmajor section of our bill includes a limited, prevention-related \noutpatient prescription drug benefit. This benefit directly mirrors the \nservices I just described, plus it provides coverage of outpatient \nprescription drugs for the preventive services added to the Medicare \nprogram as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--e.g., mammograms, \ndiabetes, colorectal cancer.\n  For example, if a 70-year-old smoker is counseled by his physician to \nstop smoking, that individual will now have access to all necessary and \nappropriate outpatient prescription drugs used as part of an approved \ntobacco cessation program.\n  By linking counseling and drug treatment, we increase the chances of \nsuccess tremendously. For example, there is a 60 percent higher \nsurvival rate among individuals who quit smoking compared to smokers of \nall ages. And because the number of older people at risk for cancer and \nheart disease is higher, tobacco cessation has the potential to have a \nlarger aggregate benefit among older persons.\n  Our bill also provides outpatient drugs for the treatment of \nhypertension, hormone replacement therapy, osteoporosis and heart \ndisease, and glaucoma. It also provides coverage of drugs stemming from \nthe preventive services added by the Balanced Budget Act.\n  While many of my colleagues would prefer to see a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit that is comprehensive in nature, the facts \nare that such a benefit is simply not affordable--$20+ billion per \nyear--at this point in time. This bill is a down payment to current and \nfuture Medicare beneficiaries and provides them access to prescription \ndrugs that will make a profound impact in their lives.\n  Important to note, this bill also states that if the Administration \nmoves forward with and prevails in its efforts to sue the tobacco \nindustry for the recovery of funds paid by Federal programs such as \nMedicare for tobacco-related illness, that half of those funds would be \nused to add additional categories of drugs to this limited benefit.\n  This bill would also instruct the Institute of Medicine to conduct a \nstudy that would, in part, create a prioritized list of prescription \ndrugs that would be used to add new categories of drugs to the program, \nif and when, tobacco settlement funds become a reality in the future.\n  Finally, the bill contains two important studies that will be \nconducted on a routine, periodic basis.\n  The first study would require MedPAC to report to Congress every two \nyears on how the Medicare program is, or is not, remaining competitive \nand modern in relationship to private sector health programs. This will\n\n[[Page S6862]]\n\ngive the Congress [information it doesn't now have] the ability to \nassess, on an ongoing basis, how Medicare is faring in its efforts to \nmodernize over time.\n  The second study will again be conducted by the Institute of \nMedicine. The Institute of Medicine, with input from new, original \nresearch on prevention and the elderly that we will be funding through \nthe National Institute on Aging, will conduct a study every 5 years to \nassess the preventive benefit package, including prescription drugs. \nThe study will determine whether or not the preventive benefit package \nneeds to be modified or changed based on the most current science. A \ncritical component of this study will be the manner in which it is \npresented to Congress.\n  To this end, I have borrowed a page from our Nation's international \ntrade laws (The Trade Act of 1974) and developed a fast track proposal \nfor the Institute of Medicine's recommendations. This is a deliberate \neffort, Mr. President, to finally get Congress out of the business of \nmicro-managing the Medicare program and the medical and health care \ndecisions within it. While limited to the preventive benefits package, \nthis will offer a litmus test on a new and creative approach to future \nMedicare decision making. This provision would put the substantive \ndecision making authority where it belongs, in the hands of the real \nexperts, not the politicians and not the lobbyists who come to our \noffices every day. Congress, after some deliberation, would either have \nto accept or reject the Institute of Medicine's recommendations. A \nchange, in my view, that would be a major, positive change in how we do \nbusiness in this body.\n  A few final thoughts. There are many here in Congress who argue that \nat a time when Medicare faces an uncertain financial future, this is \nthe last time to be adding benefits to a program that can ill afford \nthe benefits it currently offers. Normally I would agree with this \nassertion. But the issue of prevention is different. The old adage of \n``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'' is very relevant \nhere. Do preventive benefits ``cost'' money in terms of making them \navailable? Sure they do. But the return on the investment, the \navoidance of the pound of cure and the related improvement in quality \nof life is unmistakable.\n  Along these lines, a longstanding problem facing lawmakers and \nadvocates of prevention has been the position taken by the \nCongressional Budget Office, as they evaluate the budgetary impact of \nall legislative proposals, that only costs incurred by the Federal \ngovernment over the next ten years can be considered in weighing the \n``cost'' of adding new benefits. From a public health and quality of \nlife standpoint, this premise is unacceptable.\n  Among the problems with this practice is that ``savings'' incurred by \nincreasing the availability and utilization of preventive benefits \noften occur over a period of time greater than 10 years. And with the \naverage lifespan of individuals whom are 65 being nearly 20 years--and \nindividuals 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of the elder \npopulation--it only makes sense to look at services and benefits that \nimprove the quality of their lives and reduce the costs to the Federal \ngovernment for that 20-year lifespan and beyond.\n  In addition to increased lifespan, a ten-year budget scoring window \ndoesn't factor into consideration the impact of such services on the \nprivate sector, such as productivity and absenteeism, for the many \nseniors that continue working beyond age 65.\n  The bottom line is, the most important reason to cover preventive \nservices is to improve health. As the end of the century nears, \nchildren born now are living nearly 30 years longer than children born \nin 1900. While prevention services in isolation won't reduce costs, \nthey will moderate increases in the utilization and spending on more \nexpensive acute and chronic treatment services.\n  I want to leave you with these last thoughts, Mr. President. As \nCongress considers different ways to reform Medicare, several basic \nquestions regarding preventive services and the elderly must be part of \nthe debate.\n  (1) Is the value of improve quality of life worth the expenditure?\n  (2) How important is it for the Medicare population to be able to \nmaintain healthy, functional and productive lives?\n  (3) Do we, as a Nation, accept the premise that quality of life for \nour elderly is as important as any other measure of health?\n  (4) If we can, in fact, delay the onset of disease for the Medicare \npopulation by improving access to preventive services and compliance \nwith these services, how important is it to ensure that there is an \noverall saving to the system?\n  These are just some of the questions we must answer in the coming \ndebate over Medicare reform. While improving Medicare's financial \noutlook for future generations is imperative, we must do it in a way \nthat gives our seniors the ability to live longer, healthier and valued \nlives. I believe that by pursuing a prevention strategy that addresses \nsome of the most fundamental risk factors for chronic illness and \ndisability that face seniors, we will make an invaluable contribution \nto the Medicare reform debate and, more importantly, to current and \nfuture generations of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  I urge colleagues to support the Healthy Seniors Promotion Act of \n1999.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                   Partnership for Prevention,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: I am writing on behalf of Partnership \n     for Prevention to express support for ``The Healthy Seniors \n     Promotion Act of 1999.'' Partnership is a national non-profit \n     organization committed to increasing the visibility and \n     priority for prevention within national health policy and \n     practice. Its diverse membership includes leading groups in \n     health, business and industry, professional and trade \n     associations.\n       We believe prevention does work for all ages--a decline in \n     health status is not inevitable with age. A healthier \n     lifestyle adopted later in life can increase active life \n     expectancy and decrease disability. This is the time for \n     greater emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention \n     among older Americans. By delaying the onset of disease, we \n     expect to have a healthier elderly population living longer \n     lives and ultimately embracing Medicare's financial \n     stability.\n       In this bill, your focus on specific prevention measures is \n     well supported by the existing literature. For individuals \n     over 65, the United States Preventive Services Task Force \n     recommends tobacco cessation counseling with access to \n     appropriate nicotine replacement or other appropriate \n     products to help the individual combat nicotine addiction; \n     hormone replacement therapy and hypertension screening with \n     access to the appropriate drug therapy for both conditions.\n        A case can be made that dollar for dollar, prevention \n     services offer an invaluable return on the investment for the \n     Medicare eligible population especially when compared to \n     treatment costs. We need more information on these issues and \n     hope to work closely with the Institute of Medicine to \n     determine additional changes to the Medicare system in the \n     future.\n       I would like to highlight one additional issue. Partnership \n     for Prevention supports using a significant portion of any \n     funds recouped by the Federal Government from the tobacco \n     industry for tobacco control and prevention. Public and \n     private direct expenditures to treat health problems caused \n     by tobacco use total more than $70 billion annually and \n     Medicare pays more than $10 billion of that amount.\n       Applying a significant portion of this money will decrease \n     tobacco use and reduce the cost to the Medicare program in \n     the future.\n       Prevention services may moderate increases in health care \n     use and spending. We believe this country should be able to \n     reach a consensus around the importance of maintaining the \n     quality of life and social contribution of our seniors and we \n     applaud your initiative in moving this issue forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        William L.

Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The American Heart Association \n     applauds your efforts in the ``Healthy Seniors Promotion \n     Act'' to modernize the Medicare system by addressing both \n     coverage for preventative screening and counseling, as well \n     as access to prescription drugs for senior citizens.\n       Science continues to demonstrate the effectiveness of \n     preventative care. Because it has not kept pace with the \n     changing science, Medicare is an antiquated system to treat\n\n[[Page S6863]]\n\n     the sick, rather than a modern healthcare system to maintain \n     the health of the elderly. Counseling and drug therapy for \n     smoking cessation, hypertension screening and drug treatment \n     and counseling for hormone replacement therapy are important \n     services that the American Heart Association believes ought \n     to be included in a modern healthcare benefits plan. The \n     association believes that hormone replacement therapy \n     counseling is important because the science related to HRT \n     and cardiovascular risk is still evolving.\n       As you know, the American Heart Association is dedicated to \n     reducing death and disability from heart disease and stroke. \n     Each year, cardiovascular disease claims more than 950,000 \n     lives. In 1999, the health care and lost productivity costs \n     associated with cardiovascular disease are estimated to total \n     $286.5 billion.\n       To achieve our mission of reducing the burden of this \n     devastating disease, we are committed to ensuring that \n     patients have access to quality health care, including the \n     medical treatment necessary to effectively prevent and \n     control disease. For too long, senior citizens have had to \n     work with an outdated healthcare delivery system.\n       Thank you for your leadership in the fight to modernize \n     Medicare. The American Heart Association looks forward to \n     continuing to work with you to ensure that senior citizens \n     have access to preventive services and affordable \n     prescription drugs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Diane Canova, Esq.,\n     Vice President, Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The American Geriatrics Society,\n\n                                       New York, NY, June 9, 1999.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: The American Geriatrics Society (AGS) \n     strongly supports your bill, the Healthy Seniors Promotion \n     Act of 1999. The AGS thanks you for introducing this \n     important legislation that will provide comprehensive \n     preventive health benefits to the elderly.\n       The AGS is comprised of more than 6,000 physicians and \n     other health professionals that treat frail elderly patients \n     with chronic diseases and complex health needs.\n       As you know, preventive health care for the elderly can \n     improve quality of life and delay functional decline. \n     However, the current Medicare program does not cover \n     substantive preventive health services. Your bill authorizes \n     Medicare coverage of new preventive services as well as a \n     prevention-related outpatient drug benefit. In this way, your \n     bill would change the Medicare program from one that treats \n     illness and disability to one that focuses on health \n     promotion and disease prevention for Medicare beneficiaries. \n     As the organization that represents physicians that treat \n     only the elderly, we believe that this is a long overdue and \n     critical program reform.\n       We applaud your long interest in Medicare prevention and we \n     look forward to working with you on legislation that will \n     enable the elderly to live longer, more productive, and \n     healthier lives.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Jospeh G.

It is easier to prevent disease than it is to \n     cure it. The time has come to take action that would broaden \n     and further coordinate federal programs such as Medicare \n     related to health promotion.\n       Disease prevention, including access to health promotion \n     activities, protocols, and regimens for older and disabled \n     persons--should be included as an essential component \n     throughout the continuum of care.\n       NCOA supports expanding the Medicare program to include \n     coverage of a full range of preventive services, prevention \n     education, and counseling, as well as prescription drugs. \n     Your proposal is a significant step in achieving these \n     objectives on a cost effective basis, in a manner which will \n     dramatically improve the quality of the lives of millions of \n     older Americans.\n       We deeply appreciate your strong leadership in the area of \n     preventive care. NCOA looks forward to working with you and \n     your staff to pass the Healthy Seniors Promotion Act.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Howard Bedlin,\n     Vice President, Public Policy and Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Council of the Blind,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1999.\n     Senator Robert Graham,\n     Hart Senate Office Building\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham. The American Council of the Blind is \n     pleased to have the opportunity to support the Healthy \n     Seniors Promotion Act. This legislation contains provisions \n     for expanded Medicare coverage that are needed by a large \n     number of visually impaired persons in this country, namely, \n     coverage for glaucoma screening and medications.\n       The American Council of the Blind is a national \n     organization of persons who are blind and visually impaired. \n     Many of our members are seniors who have lost their vision \n     due to glaucoma, diabetes or macular degeneration. In fact, \n     this is the fastest growing segment of our membership. The \n     expansion of Medicare coverage proposed in this bill would \n     benefit these individuals by alleviating some of the \n     financial burdens faced by those who have already developed \n     conditions that cause vision loss, and giving peace of mind \n     to those who can still take measures to prevent the onset of \n     vision loss. We congratulate you for your foresight in \n     proposing these measures and look forward to working with you \n     to see that this legislation is approved by both houses of \n     congress and signed into law by the president.\n       Thank you very much.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                  Melanie Brunson,\n     Director of Advocacy and Governmental Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Osteoporosis Foundation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 1999.\n     Hon.

Your \n     introduction of this bill underscores what preventive \n     medicine professionals have known for many years, namely, \n     that the benefits of preventive services for older Americans \n     are just as great as for younger Americans. For many seniors, \n     access to high quality preventive services can add years to \n     life and life to years.\n       Your bill adds to the list of services covered by Medicare \n     several services that we know to be effective in preventing \n     serious disease. After an exhaustive and rigorous review of \n     the scientific literature, the U.S. Preventive Services Task \n     Force--considered by many to be the gold standard in \n     determining the effectiveness of clinical preventive \n     services--has identified a number of services for older \n     Americans that are effective in preventing disease. These \n     include tobacco cessation counseling, hypertension screening, \n     and counseling on the benefits and risks of hormone \n     replacement therapy--all of which would be covered under the \n     ``Healthy Seniors Promotion Act of 1999.''\n       Your bill also helps ensure that important research gaps \n     concerning preventive services for seniors are filled. It is \n     incumbent upon the Congress to ensure that Medicare's \n     preventive benefit package reflects the latest scientific \n     research on the effectiveness of preventive services.\n       Basing coverage decisions on what the science tells us is \n     effective is sound national health care policy. The American \n     College of Preventive Medicine, which represents physicians \n     concerned with health promotion and disease prevention, \n     stands ready to assist you in working toward passage of this \n     forward-looking and important bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                      George K. Anderson, MD, MPH,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1207. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to ensure \nthat income averaging for farmers not increase a farmer's liability for \nthe alternative minimum tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      the farmer tax fairness act\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Farmer Tax \nFairness Act, along with my farm state colleagues, Senators Burns and \nHagel. This legislation is a targeted provision that will help ensure \nthat farmers have access to tax benefits rightfully owed to them.\n  As you know, farmers' income often fluctuates from year to year based \non unforeseen weather or market conditions. Income averaging allows \nfarmers to ride out these unpredictable circumstances by spreading out \ntheir income over a period of years. Last year, we acted in a \nbipartisan manner to make income averaging a permanent provision of the \ntax code. Unfortunately, since that time, we have learned that, due to \ninteraction with another tax code provision, the Alternative Minimum \nTax (AMT), many of\n\n[[Page S6864]]\n\nour nation's farmers have been unfairly denied the benefits of this \nimportant accounting tool.\n  As you know, the AMT was originally designed to ensure that all \ntaxpayers, particularly those eligible for certain tax preferences, \npaid a minimum level of taxes. Due to inflation and the enactment of \nother tax provisions, more and more Americans are now subject to the \nAMT. While other reforms are required to keep the AMT focused on its \noriginal mission, our legislation addresses the specific concern of \nfarmers relying on income averaging. Under our legislation, if a \nfarmer's AMT liability is greater than taxes due under the income \naveraging calculation, that farmer would disregard the AMT and pay \ntaxes according to the averaging calculation. In this way, farmers \nwould still pay tax, but would also have access to tools designed to \nalleviate the inevitable ups and downs of the agricultural economy.\n  This provision is a modest and reasonable measure designed to ensure \nfarmers are treated fairly when it comes time to file their taxes. I \nurge my colleague to lend their support. Thank you.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1207\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Farmer Tax Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCOME AVERAGING FOR FARMERS NOT TO INCREASE \n                   ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX LIABILITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 55(c) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (defining regular tax) is amended by redesignating \n     paragraph (2) as paragraph (3) and by inserting after \n     paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) Coordination with income averaging for farmers.--\n     Solely for purposes of this section, section 1301 (relating \n     to averaging of farm income) shall not apply in computing the \n     regular tax.''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1208. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat reimbursements for costs of using passenger automobiles for \ncharitable and other organizations are excluded from gross income; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                           CHARITABLE MILEAGE\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to introduce modest legislation \nthat will eliminate controversy between the IRS and people who use \ntheir automobiles to perform charitable work.\n  Two years, ago I was successful in convincing my colleagues that the \nstandard mileage rate for charitable activities should be raised to 14 \ncents a mile. I would have preferred that the mileage rate would have \nbeen set higher, but at least this was a step in the right direction.\n  It has recently come to my attention that if a charity reimburses a \nvolunteer at a rate higher than 14 cents a mile, the volunteer must \ninclude such higher reimbursement in income. Thus, for example, if a \nperson uses his car for a voluntary food delivery program or for \npatient transportation and the charity reimburses the volunteer 25 \ncents a mile, the individual would have 11 cents of income. That is \nabsurd, Mr. President, especially when one considers that if a person \nwas performing the same service as an employee of a company, the person \ncould be reimbursed tax-free at the rate of 31 cents a mile.\n  I understand that there have been cases where volunteer drivers have \nbeen audited and subjected to back taxes, penalties, and interest \nbecause of unreported volunteer mileage reimbursement, even though that \nreimbursement did not exceed the allowable business rate and the dollar \namounts were quite small. Does IRS have nothing better to do than audit \nsuch individuals?\n  My bill would eliminate this problem. It provides that all charitable \nvolunteer mileage reimbursement is non-taxable income to the extent \nthat it does not exceed the standard business mileage rate and \nappropriate records are kept. It is important to note that my bill does \nnot increase the allowable deduction claimed by volunteers who are not \nreimbursed by a charity.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1208\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to restore \npension limits to equitable levels, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                Modifications to the Section 415 Limits\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \non behalf of workers who have responsibly saved for retirement through \ncollectively bargained, multiemployer defined benefit pension plans. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators Stevens and Santorum in sponsoring \nthis bill. This legislation would raise the Section 415 limits and \nensure that workers are not unfairly penalized in the amount they may \nreceive when they retire.\n  Under the current rules, for some workers, benefit cutbacks resulting \nfrom the current rules means that they will not be able to retire when \nthey wanted or needed to. For other workers, it means retirement with \nless income to live on.\n  The bill that I am introducing today will give all of these workers \nrelief from the most confiscatory provisions of Section 415 and enable \nthem to receive the full measure of their retirement savings.\n  Congress has recognized and corrected the adverse effects of Section \n415 on government employee pension plans. Most recently, as part of the \nTax Relief Act of 1997 (Public Law 105-34) and the Small Business Jobs \nProtection Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-188), we exempted government \nemployee pension plans from the compensation-based limit, from certain \nearly retirement limits, and from other provisions of Section 415. \nOther relief for government employee plans was included in earlier \nlegislation amending Section 415.\n  Section 415 was enacted more then two decades ago when the pension \nworld was quite different than it is today. The Section 415 limits were \ndesigned to place limits on pensions that could be received by highly \npaid executives. The passage of time and Congressional action has stood \nthis original design on its head. The limits are forcing cutbacks in \nthe pensions of middle income workers.\n  Section 415 limits the benefits payable to a worker in a defined \nbenefit\n\n[[Page S6865]]\n\npension plans to the lessor of: (1) the worker's average annual \ncompensation for the three consecutive years when his compensation was \nthe highest [the ``compensation-based limit'']; and (2) a dollar limit \nthat is sharply reduced for retirement before the worker's Social \nSecurity normal retirement age.\n  The compensation-based limit assumes that the pension earned under a \nplan is linked to each worker's salary, as is typical in corporate \npension plans. Unfortunately, that formula does not work properly when \napplied to multiemployer pension plans. Multiemployer plans, which \ncover more than ten million individuals, have long based their benefits \non the collectively bargained contribution rates and years of covered \nemployment with one or more of the multiple employers which contribute \nto the plan. In other words, benefits earned under a multiemployer plan \nhave no relationship to the wages received by a worker form the \ncontributing employers. The same benefits level is paid to all workers \nwith the same contribution and covered employment records regardless of \ntheir individual wage histories.\n  A second assumption underlying the compensation-based limit is that \nworkers' salaries increase steadily over the course of their careers so \nthat the three highest salary years will be the last three consecutive \nyears. While this salary history may be the norm in the corporate \nworld, it is unusual in the multiemployer plan world. In multiemployer \nplan industries like building and construction, workers' wage earnings \ntypically fluctuate from year-to-year according to several variables, \nincluding the availability of covered work and whether the worker is \nunable to work due to illness or disability. An individual worker's \nwage history may include many dramatic ups-and-downs. Because of these \nfluctuations, the three highest years of compensation for many \nmultiemployer plan participants are not consecutive. Consequently, the \nSection 415 compensation-based limit for the workers is artificially \nlow; lower than it would be if they were covered by corporate plans.\n  Thus, the premises on which the compensation-based limit is founded \ndo not fit the reality of workers covered by multiemployer plans. And, \nthe limit should not apply.\n  This bill would exempt workers covered by multiemployer plans from \nthe compensation-based limit, just as government employees are now \nexempt.\n  Section 415's dollar limits have also been forcing severe cutbacks in \nthe earned pensions of workers who retire under multiemployer pension \nplans before they reach age 65.\n  Construction work is physically hard, and is often performed under \nharsh climatic conditions. Workers are worn down sooner than in most \nother industries. Often, early retirement is a must. Multiemployer \npension plans accommodate these needs of their covered workers by \nproviding for early retirement, disability, and service pensions that \nprovide a subsidized, partial or full pension benefit.\n  Section 415 is forcing cutbacks in these pensions because the dollar \nlimit is severely reduced for each year younger than the Social \nSecurity normal retirement age that a worker is when he retires. For a \nworker who retires at age 50, the reduced dollar limit is now about \n$40,000 per year.\n  This reduced limit applies regardless of the circumstances under \nwhich the worker retires and regardless of his plan's rules regarding \nretirement age. A multiemployer plan participant worn out after years \nof physical challenge who is forced into early retirement is \nnonetheless subject to a reduced limit. A construction worker who, \nafter 30 years of demanding labor, has well earned a 30-and-out service \npension at age 50 is nonetheless subject to the reduced limit.\n  This bill will ease this early retirement benefit cutback by \nextending to workers covered by multiemployer plans some of the more \nfavorable early retirement rules that now apply to government employee \npension plans and other retirement plans. These rules still provide for \na reduced dollar limit for retirements earlier than age 62, but the \nreduction is less severe than under the current rules that apply to \nmultiemployer plans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The amendments made by this Act shall apply to years \n     beginning after December 31, 1999.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I join Senator Murkowski in \nintroducing a measure that will fix a problem with the pension limits \nin section 415 of the tax code as they relate to multiemployer pension \nplans.\n  This is a problem I have been trying to fix for years, and I hope we \ncan resolve this issue during this Congress.\n  Section 415, as it currently stands, deprives workers of the pensions \nthey deserve.\n  In 1996, Congress addressed part of the problem by relieving public \nemployees from the limits of section 415.\n  It is only proper that Congress does the same for private workers \ncovered by multiemployer plans.\n  Section 415 negatively impacts workers who have various employers.\n  Currently, the pension level is set at the employee's highest \nconsecutive 3-year average salary.\n  With fluctuations in industry, sometimes employees have up and down \nyears rather than steady increases in their wages.\n  This can skew the 3-year salary average for the employee, resulting \nin a lower pension when the worker retires.\n  I would like to offer an example of section 415's impact to \nillustrate how unfairly the current law treats workers in multiemployer \nplans.\n  Assume we are talking about a worker employed for 15 years by a local \nunion and her highest annual salary was $15,600.\n  The worker retires and applies for pension benefits from the two \nplans by which she was covered by virtue of her previous employment.\n  The worker had earned a monthly benefit of $1,000 from one plan and a \nmonthly benefit of $474 from the second plan for a total monthly income \nof $1,474, or $17,688 per year.\n  The worker looked forward to receiving this full amount throughout \nher retirement.\n  However, the benefits had to be reduced by $202 per month, or about \n$2,400 per year to match her highest annual salary of $15,600.\n  The so-called ``compensation based limit'' of section 415 of the Tax \nCode did not take into account disparate benefits, but intended only to \naddress workers with a single employer likely to receive steady \nincreases in salary.\n  Currently section 415 limits a worker's pension to an equal amount of \nthe worker's average salary for the three consecutive years when the \nworker's salary was the highest.\n  Instead of receiving the $17,688 per year pension that the worker had \nearned under the pension plans' rules, the worker can receive only \n$15,253 per year.\n  If the worker were a public employee covered by a public plan, her \npension would not be cut.\n  This is because public pension plans are not restricted by the \ncompensation-based limit language of section 415.\n  This robs employees of the money they have earned simply because they \nwere not a public employee.\n  We are always looking for ways to encourage people to save for \nretirement and we try to educate people of the fact that relying on \nSocial Security alone will not be enough.\n  Yet we penalize many private sector employees in multiemployer plans \nby arbitrarily limiting the amount of pension benefits they can \nreceive.\n  It is wrong, and it should be fixed.\n  In addition, by changing the law to allow workers to receive the full \npension benefits they are entitled to, we will see more money flowing \nto the treasury.\n  This is because greater pensions to retirees means greater retirement \nincome, much of which is subject to taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support us in fixing this problem once and \nfor all and I thank Senator Murkowski for working with me on this \nissue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE:\n  S. 1210. A bill to assist in the conservation of endangered and \nthreatened species of fauna and flora found throughout the world; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n          foreign endangered species conservation act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce a bill today \nthat will offer a new tool for the conservation of imperiled species \nthroughout the world. This legislation would establish a fund to \nprovide financial assistance for conservation projects for these \nspecies, which often receive little, if any, help.\n  The primary Federal law protecting imperiled species is the \nEndangered Species Act (ESA). Of the 1700 species that are endangered \nor threatened under the ESA, more than 560--approximately one-third--\nare foreign species residing outside the United States. However, the \ngeneral protections of the ESA do not apply overseas, nor does the \nAdministration prepare recovery plans for foreign species.\n  The primary multilateral treaty protecting endangered and threatened \nspecies is the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species \nof Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). CITES identifies more than 30,000 \nspecies to be protected through restrictions on trade in their parts \nand products. It does not address other threats facing these species.\n  Consequently, the vast majority of endangered or threatened species \nthroughout the world receive little, if any, funding by the United \nStates. Presently, three grants programs exist for specific species--\nAfrican elephants, Asian elephants, rhinos, and tigers. In FY 1999, \nthey received an aggregate of $1.9 million. Other small conservation \nprograms exist in India, Mexico, China, and Russia under agreements \nwith those countries. However, no program addresses the general need to \nconserve imperiled species in foreign countries.\n  This need could not be greater. Recently, much deserved attention has \nbeen given to the decline of primate populations in both Africa and \nAsia as a result of habitat loss and poaching to supply a trade of \nbushmeat. These species vitally need funding to arrest their serious \ndeclines.\n  Numerous other species in the same rainforests across Africa and \nAsia, as well as the rainforests of the Americas, also face threats \nrelating to habitat loss. Habitats as varied as the alpine reaches of \nthe Himalayas, the bamboo forests of China, and tropical coral reef \nsystems are all home to species facing the threat of extinction, such \nas the snow leopard, the panda and sea turtles. While the charismatic \nmega-fauna receive the most public attention, the vast multitude of \nspecies continue to\n\n[[Page S6867]]\n\nslip steadily towards extinction without even any public awareness.\n  A new grants program would be a powerful tool to begin to address the \ncritical needs of these species, and would fill a significant gap in \nexisting efforts. Such a program would be similar to the programs for \nelephants, rhinos and tigers, but would apply to any imperiled species. \nThe existing programs have proven tremendously successful, particularly \nin creating local, long-term capacity within the foreign country to \nprotect these species. The bill that I introduce today would build on \nthese successful programs.\n  Specifically, the bill establishes a fund to support projects to \nconserve endangered and threatened species in foreign countries. The \nprojects must be approved by the Secretary in cooperation with the \nAgency for International Development. Priority is to be given to \nprojects that enhance conservation of the most imperiled species, that \nprovide the greatest conservation benefit, that receive the greatest \nlevel of non-Federal funding, and that enhance local capacity for \nconservation efforts. The bill authorizes appropriations of $16 million \nannually for 4 years, 2001 to 2005, with $12 million authorized for the \nFish and Wildlife Service, and $4 million for the National Marine \nFisheries Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this worthwhile initiative. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1210\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Foreign Endangered Species \n     Conservation Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) numerous species of fauna and flora in foreign \n     countries have continued to decline to the point that the \n     long-term survival of those species in the wild is in serious \n     jeopardy;\n       (2) many of those species are listed as endangered species \n     or threatened species under section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) or in Appendix I, II, or \n     III of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered \n     Species of Wild Fauna and Flora;\n       (3) there are insufficient resources available for \n     addressing the threats facing those species, which will \n     require the joint commitment and effort of foreign countries \n     within the range of those species, the United States and \n     other countries, and the private sector;\n       (4) the grant programs established by Congress for tigers, \n     rhinoceroses, Asian elephants, and African elephants have \n     proven to be extremely successful programs that provide \n     Federal funds for conservation projects in an efficient and \n     expeditious manner and that encourage additional support for \n     conservation in the foreign countries where those species \n     exist in the wild; and\n       (5) a new grant program modeled on the existing programs \n     for tigers, rhinoceroses, and elephants would provide an \n     effective means to assist in the conservation of foreign \n     endangered species for which there are no existing grant \n     programs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to conserve \n     endangered and threatened species of fauna and flora in \n     foreign countries, and the ecosystems on which the species \n     depend, by supporting the conservation programs for those \n     species of foreign countries and the CITES Secretariat, \n     promoting partnerships between the public and private \n     sectors, and providing financial resources for those programs \n     and partnerships.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control \nAct to authorize additional measures to carry out the control of \nsalinity upstream of Imperial Dam in a cost-effective manner; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   COLORADO RIVER BASIN SALINITY CONTROL REAUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Reauthorization Act of 1999. \nThis legislation will reauthorize the funding of this program to a \nlevel of $175 million and will permit these important projects to \ncontinue forward for several years.\n  I do this because the Colorado River is the life link for more than \n23 million people. It provides irrigation water for more than 4 million \nacres of land in the United States. Therefore, the quality of the water \nis crucial.\n  Salinity is one of the major problems affecting the quality of the \nwater. Salinity damages range between $500 million and $750 million and \ncould exceed $1.5 billion per year if future increases in salinity are \nnot controlled. In an effort to limit future damages, the Basin States \n(Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming) \nand the Federal Government enacted the Colorado River Basin Salinity \nControl Act in 1974. Because the lengthy Congressional authorization \nprocess for Bureau of Reclamation projects was impeding the \nimplementation of cost-effective measures, Congress authorized the \nBureau in 1995 to implement a competitive, basin-wide approach for \nsalinity control.\n  Under the new approach, termed the Basinwide Program salinity control \nprojects were no longer built by the Federal Government. They were, for \nthe most part, to be built by the private sector and local and state \ngovernments. Funds would be awarded to projects on a competitive bid \nbasis. Since this was a pilot program, Congress originally limited \nfunds to a $75 million ceiling.\n  Indeed, the Basinwide Salinity Program has far exceeded original \nexpectations by proving to be both cost effective and successful. It \nhas an average cost of $27 per ton of salt controlled, as compared to \noriginal authority program projects that averaged $76 per ton. One of \nthe greatest advantages of the new program comes from the integration \nof Reclamation's program with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's \nprogram. By integrating the USDA's on-farm irrigation improvements with \nthe Bureau's off-farm improvements, very high efficiency rates can be \nobtained.\n  Because the cost sharing partners (private organizations and states \nand federal agencies) often have funds available at specific times, the \nnew program allows the Bureau of Reclamation to quickly respond to \nopportunities that are time sensitive. Another significant advantage of \nthe Basinwide program is that completed projects are ``owned'' by the \nlocal entity, and not the Bureau. The entity is responsible for \nperforming under the proposal negotiated with the Bureau.\n  In 1998, Bureau of Reclamation received a record number of proposals. \nWhile still working through the 1998 proposals, the Bureau also sought \nout 1999 proposals which are just now being received and evaluated. \nAlthough, not all proposals will be fully funded and constructed, \nfunding requirements for even the most favorable projects surpasses the \noriginal $75 million funding authority. In fact, if all proposals go to \ncompletion and are fully funded, the Bureau might find itself in the \nposition that no future requests for proposals can be considered until \nCongress raises the authorization ceiling. In an effort to prevent that \nfrom occurring, I am introducing this legislation today. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in this effort and I look forward to working on \nthis legislation with them.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1212. A bill to restrict United States assistance for certain \nreconstruction efforts in the Balkans region of Europe to United \nStates-produced articles and services; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n              kosovo reconstruction investment act of 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Kosovo \nReconstruction Investment Act of 1999.\n  This legislation would require that the United States foreign aid \nfunds committed to the reconstruction of Kosovo and other parts of the \nBalkans in the wake of the Kosovo conflict will be used to purchase \nAmerican-made goods and services whenever possible.\n  This legislation provides a win-win approach to reconstruction by \nhelping the people of Kosovo and others who live in the Balkans who \nhave suffered as a result of the Kosovo conflict while also looking out \nfor American workers.\n  The people of Kosovo and the Balkans will win by having new homes, \nhospitals, factories, bridges, and much more rebuilt. They will have \nroofs over their heads, places to go for health care and to work, and \nthe roads and bridges needed to get there.\n  The American people will win as a sizable portion of their hard-\nearned taxpayer dollars will come back to the United States in the form \nof new orders for American-made goods and services. New jobs will be \ncreated. With this legislation we can make the best out of a looming, \ncostly, and long-term burden on our Nation's budget.\n  This will be especially important for some of our key industries, \nsuch as agriculture and steel, that are facing hard times here at home. \nOther hard-working Americans from industries like manufacturing, \nengineering, construction, and telecommunications will also enjoy new \nopportunities to produce goods and services for the people of \nSoutheastern Europe.\n  For example, our ranchers and farmers, many of whom are being \nseverely harmed by a combination of tough\n\n[[Page S6869]]\n\ncompetition at home, cheap imports and closed markets overseas will \nbenefit. This bill will help provide them with the opportunity to \nstrengthen their share in Europe's Southeastern markets.\n  Our steel workers, many of whom are also in a tough situation, will \nbenefit as U.S. made steel is used to reconstruct homes, hospitals, \nfactories, and bridges. American engineers, contractors, and other \nservice providers will play a key role in rebuilding telecommunications \nand other necessary infrastructure projects.\n  To ensure that the Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act does not \nunduly hinder the reconstruction effort, it allows for American foreign \naid funds to be used to buy goods and services produced by other \nparties in cases where U.S. made goods and services are deemed to be \n``prohibitively expensive.''\n  The American taxpayers are already bearing the lion's share of waging \nthe war in Kosovo. To date, our nation's military has spent about $3 \nbillion Kosovo war effort. Our pilots flew the vast majority of the \ncombat sorties. In addition, the Foreign Operations supplemental \nappropriations bill that passed last month provided $819 million for \nhumanitarian and refugee aid for Kosovo and surrounding countries. It \nhas been estimated that peace keeping operations will cost an \nadditional $3 billion in the first year alone. This is just the \nbeginning. In the future, American taxpayers will be spending many tens \nof billions of dollars more as we participate in the apparently open-\nended peacekeeping effort.\n  Without this legislation, those countries who largely sat on the \nsidelines while we fought will be allowed to sweep in and clean up. The \nAmerican taxpayers' dollars should not be used as a windfall profits \nprogram to boost Western European conglomerates. The American people \ndeserve better. The Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act of 1999 would \nremedy this situation.\n  Yet another problem this bill would help alleviate is our exploding \ntrade deficit which is on track to an all time high of approximately \n$250 billion by the end of this year. In March of this year alone, the \nUnited States posted a record 1 month trade deficit of $19.7 billion.\n  Furthermore, many of the other industrialized countries that \nregularly distribute foreign aid do not distribute it with no strings \nattached. For many years now, countries like Japan have also required \nthat the foreign aid funds they distribute be used to buy products \nproduced by their domestic companies.\n  We also must face the reality that there is much more to rebuilding \nthis region than money can buy. The various ethnic groups residing \nthroughout the Balkans must realize that they have to change their \nhearts and ways if there is to be any lasting peace and prosperity. We \ncannot do this for them. They have to do it for themselves, as \ncommunities, families, and individuals.\n  If they commit themselves to rule of law, freedom of speech, free and \nopen markets, the primacy of the ballot box over bullets and a live and \nlet live tolerance of others, they will be well on their way as they \nhead into the new millennium.\n  Once again, here we are reconstructing a part of Europe. Once again, \nwe did not start the war, but we had to finish it and then were called \non to come in, pick up the pieces, and put them back together again.\n  If America's airmen, sailors, marines, and soldiers are good enough \nto win a war, then America's hard-working taxpayers, including farmers, \nsteel workers, and engineers are good enough to help rebuild shattered \ncountries. If we are called on to put the Balkans back together, we \nshould do it with a fair share of goods and services made in America.\n  The Kosovo Reconstruction Investment Act will help make sure that \nboth the victims of the Kosovo conflict and the American people win. I \nurge my colleagues to support passage of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1212\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n              indian child welfare act amendments of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \namend the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 to ensure stricter \nenforcement of timelines and fairness in Indian adoption proceedings. \nThe primary intent of this legislation is to make the process that \napplies to voluntary Indian child custody and adoption proceedings more \nconsistent, predictable, and certain. The provisions of this \nlegislation would further advance the best interests of Indian children \nwithout eroding tribal sovereignty and the fundamental principles of \nFederal-Indian law.\n\n  I thank the principal cosponsors, Senators Campbell and Domenici, for \ntheir continued support of this much-needed legislation. Let me also \npoint out that this bill is identical to legislation which passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent in 1996. It is the result of nearly two \nyears of discussion and debate among representatives of the adoption \ncommunity, Indian tribal governments, and the Congress that aimed to \naddress some of the problems with the implementation of ICWA since its \nenactment in 1978.\n  Mr. President, ICWA was originally enacted to provide for procedural \nand substantive protection for Indian children and families and to \nrecognize and formalize a substantial role for Indian tribes in cases \ninvolving involuntary and voluntary child custody proceedings, whether \non or off the Indian reservation. It was also supposed to reduce \nuncertainties about which court had jurisdiction over an Indian child \nand who had what authority to influence child placement decisions. \nAlthough implementation of ICWA has been less than perfect, in the vast \nmajority of cases ICWA has effectively provided the necessary \nprotections. It has encouraged State and private adoption agencies and \nState courts to make extra efforts before removing Indian children from \ntheir homes and communities. It has required recognition by\n\n[[Page S6870]]\n\neveryone involved that an Indian child has a vital, long-term interest \nin keeping a connection with his or her Indian tribe.\n  Nonetheless, particularly in the voluntary adoption context, there \nhave been occasional, high-profile cases which have resulted in \nlengthy, protracted litigation causing great anguish for the children, \ntheir adoptive families, their birth families, and their Indian tribes. \nThis bill takes a measured and limited approach, crafted by \nrepresentatives of tribal governments and the adoption community, to \naddress these problems.\n  This legislation would achieve greater certainty and speed in the \nadoption process for Indian children by providing new guarantees of \nearly and effective notice in all cases involving Indian children. The \nbill also establishes new, strict time restrictions on both the right \nof Indian tribes and birth families to intervene and the right of \nIndian birth parents to revoke their consent to an adoptive placement. \nFinally, the bill includes a provision which would encourage early \nidentification of the relatively few cases involving controversy and \npromote the settlement of cases by making visitation agreements \nenforceable.\n  Mr. President, nothing is more sacred and more important to our \nfuture than our children. The issues surrounding Indian child welfare \nstir deep emotions. I am thankful that, in formulating the compromise \nthat led to the introduction of this bill, the representatives of both \nthe adoption community and tribal governments were able to put aside \ntheir individual desires and focus on the best interests of Indian \nchildren.\n  This bill represents an appropriate and fair-minded compromise \nproposal which would enhance the best interests of Indian children by \nguaranteeing speed, certainty, and stability in the adoption process. \nAt the same time, the provisions of this bill preserve fundamental \nprinciples of Federal-Tribal law by recognizing the appropriate role of \ntribal governments in the lives of Indian children.\n  Mr. President, I believe these amendments would have been enacted \nseveral years ago had we been better able to dispel several \nmisconceptions about the bill's purpose. I want to directly address one \nof these misplaced concerns--that the adoptive placement preferences in \nthe underlying law, the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, would somehow \nlead an expectant mother seeking privacy to prefer abortion over \nadoption.\n  I want to be very clear when I say that it is my judgment, concurred \nin by Indian tribes, adoption advocates and many others involved with \nimplementing the Indian Child Welfare Act, that this bill has \neverything to do with promoting adoption opportunities for Indian \nchildren and nothing to do with promoting abortion. It is a terrible \ninjustice that such a misunderstanding has clouded the efforts of so \nmany who wish to simply improve the chances for Indian children to \nenjoy a stable family life.\n  Over the years, I have had a consistently pro-life record and have \nactively worked with many pro-life groups to try to reduce and \neliminate abortions at every possible opportunity. I firmly believe \nthat this bill would make adoption, rather than abortion, a more \ncompelling choice for an expectant birth mother. What could be more \npro-life and pro-family than to change the law in ways which both \nIndian tribes and non-Indian adoptive families have asked to improve \nthe adoption process? I strongly believe this bill, and the amendments \nit makes to the ICWA law, will work to the advantage of Indian children \nand adoptive families. It will encourage adoptions and discourage \nchoices which lead to the tragedy of abortion.\n  A recent editorial by George F. Will in the Washington Post (``For \nRight-to-Life Realists'') underscores the importance of promoting \nlegislative efforts, such as this bill, as good policy for protecting \nchildren and promoting families. He wrote:\n\n       Temperate people on both sides of the abortion divide can \n     support a requirement for parental notification, less as \n     abortion policy than as sound family policy.\n       . . . Republicans will be the party of adoption, removing \n     all laws and other impediments, sparing no expense, to \n     achieving a goal more noble even than landing on the moon--\n     adoptive parents for every unwanted unborn baby.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill has been thoroughly analyzed and debated in \nthe Senate, as well as among the adoption community and Indian tribal \ngovernments. I believe it is time for the Congress to act in the best \ninterests of Indian children by enacting these amendments to the \nvoluntary adoption procedures in the 1978 ICWA law. I urge my \ncolleagues to once again pass these amendments and invite the House to \ndo the same this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure the liberties of the people by promoting \nfederalism, to protect the reserved powers of the States, to impose \naccountability for Federal preemption of State and local laws, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, \nwith instructions that if one committee reports, the other committee \nhas 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n               THE FEDERALISM ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1999\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the \n``Federalism Accountability Act,'' a bill to promote and preserve \nprinciples of federalism. Federalism raises two fundamental questions \nthat policy makers should answer: What should government be doing? And \nwhat level of government should do it? Everything else flows from them. \nThat's why federalism is at the heart of our Democracy.\n  The Founders created a dual system of governance for America, \ndividing power between the Federal Government and the States. The Tenth \nAmendment makes clear that States retain all governmental power not \ngranted to the Federal Government by the Constitution. The Founders \nintended that the State and Federal governments would check each \nother's encroachment on individual rights. As Alexander Hamilton stated \nin the Federalist Papers, No. 28:\n\n       Power being almost always the rival of power, the general \n     government will at times stand ready to check the usurpations \n     of the state governments, and these will have the same \n     disposition towards the general government. The people, by \n     throwing themselves into either scale, will infallibly make \n     it preponderate. If their rights are invaded by either, they \n     can make use of the other as the instrument of redress.\n\n  The structure of our constitutional system assumes that the states \nwill maintain a sovereign status independent of the national \ngovernment. At the same time, the Supremacy Clause states that Federal \nlaws made pursuant to the Constitution shall be the supreme law of the \nland. The ``Federalism Accountability Act'' is intended to require \ncareful thought and accountability when we reconcile the competing \nprinciples embodied in the Tenth Amendment and the Supremacy Clause. \nCongress and the Executive Branch should not lightly exercise the \npowers conferred by the Supremacy Clause without also shouldering \nresponsibility. As the Supreme Court has been signaling in recent \ndecisions, where the authority exists, the democratic branches of the \nFederal Government should make the primary decisions whether or not to \nlimit state power, and they ought to exercise this power unambiguously.\n  We need to face the fact that Congress and the Executive Branch too \noften have acted as if they have a general police power to engage in \nany issue, no matter how local. Both Congress and the Executive Branch \nhave neglected to consider prudential and constitutional limits on \ntheir powers. We should not forget that even where the Federal \nGovernment has the constitutional authority to act, state governments \nmay be better suited to address certain matters. Congress has a habit \nof preempting State and local law on a large scale, with little thought \nto the consequences. Congress and the White House are ever eager to \npass federal criminal laws to appear responsive to highly publicized \nevents. We are now finding that this often is not only unnecessary and \nunwise, but it also has harmful implications for crime control.\n  Too often, federalism principles have been ignored. The General \nAccounting Office reported to our Committee that there has been gross \nnoncompliance by the agencies with the executive order on federalism \nthat has been law since it was issued by President Reagan in 1987. In a \nreview of over 11,000 Federal rules recently issued during a 3-year \nperiod, GAO found that the agencies had prepared only 5 federalism \nassessments under the federalism order. It is time for legislation to \nensure that the agencies take such requirements more seriously.\n  To be sure, we have made some inroads on federalism. The Supreme \nCourt has recently revived federalist doctrines. Congress passed the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act to help discourage the wholesale passage \nof new legislative unfunded mandates. Congress also gave the States the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, reduced agency micro-management, and provided \nblock grants in welfare, transportation, drug prevention, and--just \nrecently--education flexibility. Much of the innovation that has \nimproved the country began at the State and local level.\n  But unless we really understand that federalism is the foundation of \nour governmental system, these bright achievements will fade. As we \ncross into the 21st century, federalism must constantly illuminate our \npath. Our governmental structure is based on an optimistic belief in \nthe power of people and their communities. I share that view. It is my \nhope that the Federalism Accountability Act give a greater voice to \nState and local governments and the people they serve and reinvigorate \nthe debate on federalism.\n  The ``Federalism Accountability Act'' will promote restraint in the \nexercise of federal power. It establishes a rule of construction \nrequiring an explicit statement of congressional or agency intent to \npreempt. Congress would be required to make explicit statements on the \nextent to which bills or joint resolutions are intended to preempt \nState or local law, and if so, an explanation of the reasons for such \npreemption.\n  Agencies would designate a federalism officer to implement the \nrequirements of this legislation and to serve as a liaison to State and \nlocal officials. Early in the process of developing rules, Federal \nagencies would be required to notify, consult with, and provide an \nopportunity for meaningful participation by public officials of State \nand local governments. The agency would prepare a federalism assessment \nfor rules that have federalism impacts. Each federalism assessment \nwould include an analysis of: whether, why, and to what degree the \nFederal rule preempts state law; other significant impacts on State and \nlocal governments; measures taken by the agency, including the \nconsideration of regulatory alternatives, to minimize the impact on \nState and local governments; and the extent of the agency's prior \nconsultation with public officials, the nature of their concerns, and \nthe extent to which those concerns have been met.\n  The legislation also will require the Congressional Budget Office, \nwith the help of the Office of Management and Budget and the \nCongressional Research Service, to compile a report on preemptions by \nFederal rules, court decisions, and legislation. I hope this report \nwill lead to an informed debate on the appropriate use of preemption to \nreach policy goals.\n  Finally, the legislation amends two existing laws to promote \nfederalism. First, it amends the Government Performance and Results Act \nof 1993 to clarify that performance measures for State-administered \ngrant programs are to be determined in cooperation with public \nofficials. Second, it amends the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995\n\n[[Page S6873]]\n\nto clarify that major new requirements imposed on States under \nentitlement authority are to be scored by CBO as unfunded mandates. It \nalso requires that where Congress has capped the Federal share of an \nentitlement program, then the Committee report and the accompanying CBO \nreport must analyze whether the legislation includes new flexibility or \nwhether there is existing flexibility to offset additional costs.\n  Mr. President, this legislation was developed with representatives of \nthe ``Big 7'' organizations representing State and local government, \nincluding the National Governors' Association, the National Conference \nof State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the National \nLeague of Cities, the National Association of Counties, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and the International City/County Management \nAssociation. I am pleased that this legislation is supported by \nSenators Levin, Voinovich, Robb, Cochran, Lincoln, Enzi, Breaux, Roth, \nand Bayh. I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1214\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federalism Accountability \n     Act of 1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Constitution created a strong Federal system, \n     reserving to the States all powers not delegated to the \n     Federal Government;\n       (2) preemptive statutes and regulations have at times been \n     an appropriate exercise of Federal powers, and at other times \n     have been an inappropriate infringement on State and local \n     government authority;\n       (3) on numerous occasions, Congress has enacted statutes \n     and the agencies have promulgated rules that explicitly \n     preempt State and local government authority and describe the \n     scope of the preemption;\n       (4) in addition to statutes and rules that explicitly \n     preempt State and local government authority, many other \n     statutes and rules that lack an explicit statement by \n     Congress or the agencies of their intent to preempt and a \n     clear description of the scope of the preemption have been \n     construed to preempt State and local government authority;\n       (5) in the past, the lack of clear congressional intent \n     regarding preemption has resulted in too much discretion for \n     Federal agencies and uncertainty for State and local \n     governments, leaving the presence or scope of preemption to \n     be litigated and determined by the judiciary and sometimes \n     producing results contrary to or beyond the intent of \n     Congress; and\n       (6) State and local governments are full partners in all \n     Federal programs administered by those governments.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are to--\n       (1) promote and preserve the integrity and effectiveness of \n     our Federal system of government;\n       (2) set forth principles governing the interpretation of \n     congressional and agency intent regarding preemption of State \n     and local government authority by Federal laws and rules;\n       (3) establish an information collection system designed to \n     monitor the incidence of Federal statutory, regulatory, and \n     judicial preemption; and\n       (4) recognize the partnership between the Federal \n     Government and State and local governments in the \n     implementation of certain Federal programs.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act the definitions under section 551 of title 5, \n     United States Code, shall apply and the term--\n       (1) ``local government'' means a county, city, town, \n     borough, township, village, school district, special \n     district, or other political subdivision of a State;\n       (2) ``public officials'' means elected State and local \n     government officials and their representative organizations;\n       (3) ``State''--\n       (A) means a State of the United States and an agency or \n     instrumentality of a State;\n       (B) includes the District of Columbia and any territory of \n     the United States, and an agency or instrumentality of the \n     District of Columbia or such territory;\n       (C) includes any tribal government and an agency or \n     instrumentality of such government; and\n       (D) does not include a local government of a State; and\n       (4) ``tribal government'' means an Indian tribe as that \n     term is defined under section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450b(e)).\n\n     SEC. 5. COMMITTEE OR CONFERENCE REPORTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The report accompanying any bill or joint \n     resolution of a public character reported from a committee of \n     the Senate or House of Representatives or from a conference \n     between the Senate and the House of Representatives shall \n     contain an explicit statement on the extent to which the bill \n     or joint resolution preempts State or local government law, \n     ordinance, or regulation and, if so, an explanation of the \n     reasons for such preemption. In the absence of a committee or \n     conference report, the committee or conference shall report \n     to the Senate and the House of Representatives a statement \n     containing the information described in this section before \n     consideration of the bill, joint resolution, or conference \n     report.\n       (b) Content.--The statement under subsection (a) shall \n     include an analysis of--\n       (1) the extent to which the bill or joint resolution \n     legislates in an area of traditional State authority; and\n       (2) the extent to which State or local government authority \n     will be maintained if the bill or joint resolution is enacted \n     by Congress.\n\n     SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION RELATING TO PREEMPTION.\n\n       (a) Statutes.--No statute enacted after the effective date \n     of this Act shall be construed to preempt, in whole or in \n     part, any State or local government law, ordinance, or \n     regulation, unless--\n       (1) the statute explicitly states that such preemption is \n     intended; or\n       (2) there is a direct conflict between such statute and a \n     State or local law, ordinance, or regulation so that the two \n     cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together.\n       (b) Rules.--No rule promulgated after the effective date of \n     this Act shall be construed to preempt, in whole or in part, \n     any State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation, \n     unless--\n       (1)(A) such preemption is authorized by the statute under \n     which the rule is promulgated; and\n       (B) the rule, in compliance with section 7, explicitly \n     states that such preemption is intended; or\n       (2) there is a direct conflict between such rule and a \n     State or local law, ordinance, or regulation so that the two \n     cannot be reconciled or consistently stand together.\n       (c) Favorable Construction.--Any ambiguities in this Act, \n     or in any other law of the United States, shall be construed \n     in favor of preserving the authority of the States and the \n     people.\n\n     SEC. 7. AGENCY FEDERALISM ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The head of each agency shall--\n       (1) be responsible for implementing this Act; and\n       (2) designate an officer (to be known as the federalism \n     officer) to--\n       (A) manage the implementation of this Act; and\n       (B) serve as a liaison to State and local officials and \n     their designated representatives.\n       (b) Notice and Consultation With Potentially Affected State \n     and Local Government.--Early in the process of developing a \n     rule and before the publication of a notice of proposed \n     rulemaking, the agency shall notify, consult with, and \n     provide an opportunity for meaningful participation by public \n     officials of governments that may potentially be affected by \n     the rule for the purpose of identifying any preemption of \n     State or local government authority or other significant \n     federalism impacts that may result from issuance of the rule. \n     If no notice of proposed rulemaking is published, \n     consultation shall occur sufficiently in advance of \n     publication of an interim final rule or final rule to provide \n     an opportunity for meaningful participation.\n       (c) Federalism Assessments.--\n       (1) In general.--In addition to whatever other actions the \n     federalism officer may take to manage the implementation of \n     this Act, such officer shall identify each proposed, interim \n     final, and final rule having a federalism impact, including \n     each rule with a federalism impact identified under \n     subsection (b), that warrants the preparation of a federalism \n     assessment.\n       (2) Preparation.--With respect to each such rule identified \n     by the federalism officer, a federalism assessment, as \n     described in subsection (d), shall be prepared and published \n     in the Federal Register at the time the proposed, interim \n     final, and final rule is published.\n       (3) Consideration of assessment.--The agency head shall \n     consider any such assessment in all decisions involved in \n     promulgating, implementing, and interpreting the rule.\n       (4) Submission to the office of management and budget.--\n     Each federalism assessment shall be included in any \n     submission made to the Office of Management and Budget by an \n     agency for review of a rule.\n       (d) Contents.--Each federalism assessment shall include--\n       (1) a statement on the extent to which the rule preempts \n     State or local government law, ordinance, or regulation and, \n     if so, an explanation of the reasons for such preemption;\n       (2) an analysis of--\n       (A) the extent to which the rule regulates in an area of \n     traditional State authority; and\n       (B) the extent to which State or local authority will be \n     maintained if the rule takes effect;\n       (3) a description of the significant impacts of the rule on \n     State and local governments;\n       (4) any measures taken by the agency, including the \n     consideration of regulatory alternatives, to minimize the \n     impact on State and local governments; and\n\n[[Page S6874]]\n\n       (5) the extent of the agency's prior consultation with \n     public officials, the nature of their concerns, and the \n     extent to which those concerns have been met.\n       (e) Publication.--For any applicable rule, the agency shall \n     include a summary of the federalism assessment prepared under \n     this section in a separately identified part of the statement \n     of basis and purpose for the rule as it is to be published in \n     the Federal Register. The summary shall include a list of the \n     public officials consulted and briefly describe the views of \n     such officials and the agency's response to such views.\n\n     SEC. 8. PERFORMANCE MEASURES.\n\n       Section 1115 of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(g) The head of an agency may not include in any \n     performance plan under this section any agency activity that \n     is a State-administered Federal grant program, unless the \n     performance measures for the activity are determined in \n     cooperation with public officials as defined under section 4 \n     of the Federalism Accountability Act of 1999.''.\n\n     SEC. 9.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am happy to join Senators Thompson and \nVoinovich and a bipartisan group of our colleagues in introducing the \nFederalism Accountability Act of 1999. The bill would require an \nexplicit statement of Federal preemption in Federal legislation in \norder for such preemption to occur unless there exists a direct \nconflict between the Federal law and a State or local law which cannot \nbe reconciled. Enactment of this bill would close the back door of \nimplied Federal preemption and put the responsibility for determining \nwhether or not State or local governments should be preempted back in \nCongress, where it belongs. The bill would also institute procedures to \nensure that, in issuing new regulations, federal agencies respect State \nand local authority.\n  Mr. President, we want to ensure that the federal government works in \npartnership with our State and local government colleagues. One way of \nmaking sure this happens is that preemption occurs only when Congress \nmakes a conscious decision to preempt and it is amply clear to all \nparties that preemption will occur. In 1991, I sponsored a bill, S. \n2080, to clarify when preemption does and does not occur. I have since \nsponsored two similar bills. When I introduced S. 2080, I noted that \n``state and local officials have become increasingly concerned with the \nnumber of instances in which State and local laws have been preempted \nby Federal law--not because Congress has done so explicitly, but \nbecause the courts have implied such preemption. Since 1789, Congress \nhas enacted approximately 350 laws specifically preempting State and \nlocal authority. Half of these laws have been enacted in the last 20 \nyears. These figures, however, do not touch upon the extensive Federal \npreemption of State and local authority which has occurred as a result \nof judicial interpretation of congressional intent, when Congress' \nintention to preempt has not been explicitly stated in law. When \nCongress is unclear about its intent to preempt, the courts must then \ndecide whether or not preemption was intended and, if so, to what \nextent.''\n  In the ensuing time, there have been some changes, such as the \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act, which have strengthened the partnership \nbetween the federal, state and local governments. Unfortunately, in the \nbig picture, there has been little or no evidence of a change in the \ntrends that I attempted to address when I introduced S. 2080 in 1991. \nSometimes we enact a law and it is clear as to the scope of the \nintended preemption. Just as often, we are not clear, or a court takes \nlanguage that appeared to be clear and decides that it is not, and \nconstrues it in favor of preemption. Similarly, agencies take actions \nthat are determined to be preemptive whether their language is clear or \nnot.\n  Article VI of the Constitution, the supremacy clause, states that \nFederal laws made pursuant to the Constitution ``shall be the supreme \nlaw of the land.'' In its most basic sense, this clause means that a \nState law is negated or preempted when it is in conflict with a \nconstitutionally enacted Federal law. A significant body of case law \nhas been developed to arrive at standards by which to judge whether or \nnot Congress intended to preempt State or local authority--standards \nwhich are subjective and have not resulted in a consistent and \npredictable doctrine in resolving preemption questions.\n  If we in Congress want Federal law to prevail, we should be clear \nabout that. If we want the States to have discretion to go beyond \nFederal requirements, we should be clear about that. If, for example, \nwe set a floor in a Federal statute, but are silent on actions which \nmeet but then go beyond the Federal requirement, State and local \ngovernments should be able to act as they deem appropriate. State and \nlocal governments should not have to wait to see what they can and \ncannot do. Our bill would allow tougher State and local laws given \ncongressional silence.\n  In addition, the bill contains a requirement that agencies notify, \nand consult with, state and local governments and their representative \norganizations during the development of rules, and publish proposed and \nfinal federalism assessments along with proposed and final rules. Mr. \nPresident, it\n\n[[Page S6875]]\n\nshould not be necessary to enact legislation to accomplish these \nthings. Federal agencies should never issue rules without having the \nbest and most complete information possible. Our State and local \ngovernments are ready, willing, and able to provide their expertise on \nhow Federal rules will impact those governments' ability to get their \njobs done. Common sense dictates that they be notified and consulted \nbefore the federal government regulates in a way that weakens or \neliminates the ability of State and local governments to do their jobs, \nor duplicates their efforts.\n  The current Administration and previous ones have recognized the \nvalue of having federal agencies consult with State and local \ngovernments. However, as was amply demonstrated by a recent GAO report, \nExecutive Order requirements for federalism assessments have been \nignored. The bill would correct this noncompliance by the Executive \nBranch, and ensure that independent agencies, as well, will engage in \nsuch consultation and publish assessments along with rules.\n  Not only will the compilation and issuance of federalism assessments \nforce the agencies to think through what they are doing, they will \nbolster the confidence of the public and regulated entities in the \nregulatory process by assuring them that their governments are acting \nin concert and avoiding conflicting or duplicative requirements.\n  Our legislation also requires the Congressional Budget Office, with \nthe assistance of the Congressional Research Service, at the end of \neach Congress, to compile a report on the number of statutory and \njudicially interpreted preemptions. This will constitute the first time \nsuch a complete report has been done, and the information will be \nvaluable to the debate regarding the appropriate use of preemption to \nreach Federal goals.\n  Mr. President, legislation to clarify when preemption occurs and \notherwise strengthen the intergovernmental relationship has been \nendorsed by the major state and local government organizations. I would \nlike to thank Senators Thompson and Voinovich and their staffs for \ntheir hard work in this area.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, \nthe Federalism Accountability Act of 1999, along with my colleagues \nSenator Fred Thompson and Senator Carl Levin. Our legislation is the \nculmination of months of bipartisan effort that we believe will restore \nthe fundamental principles of federalism.\n  In my 33 years of public service, at every level of government, I \nhave seen first hand the relationship of the federal government with \nrespect to state and local government. The nature of that relationship \nhas molded my passion for the issue of federalism and the need to \nspell-out the appropriate role of the federal government with respect \nto our state and local governments. It is why I vowed that when I was \nelected to the Senate, I would work to find ways in which the federal \ngovernment can be a better partner with these levels of government.\n  I have long been concerned with the federal government becoming \ninvolved in matters and issues which I believe are best handled by \nstate and local governments. I also have been concerned about the \ntendency of the federal government to preempt our state and local \ngovernments and mandate new responsibilities without the funding to pay \nfor them.\n  In a speech before the Volunteers of the National Archives in 1986 \nregarding thee relationship of the Constitution with America's cities \nand the evolution of federalism, I brought to the attention of the \naudience my observations since my early days in government regarding \nthe course American government had been taking:\n\n       We have seen the expansion of the federal government into \n     new, non-traditional domestic policy areas. We have \n     experienced a tremendous increase in the proclivity of \n     Washington both to preempt state and local authority and to \n     mandate actions on state and local governments. The \n     cumulative effect of a series of actions by the Congress, the \n     Executive Branch and the U.S. Supreme Court have caused some \n     legal scholars to observe that while constitutional \n     federalism is alive in scholarly treatises, it has expired as \n     a practical political reality.\n\n  We have made great progress since I gave that speech more than a \ndozen years go.\n  An outstanding article last year written by Carl Tubbesing, the \ndeputy executive director of the National Council of State \nLegislatures, in State Legislatures magazine, outlined what he called \nthe five ``hallmarks of devolution''--legislation in the 1990's that \nchanged the face of the federal-state-local government partnership and \nreversed the decades long trend toward federal centralization.\n  These bills are the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, the Safe Drinking \nWater Reform Act Amendments, Welfare Reform, Medicaid reforms such as \nelimination of the Boren amendment, and the establishment of the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program.\n  Also, just this year, Congress has passed and the President has \nsigned into law two important pieces of legislation which enhance the \nstate, local and federal partnership. Those initiatives are the \nEducation Flexibility Act, which gives our states and school districts \nthe freedom to use their federal funds for identified education \npriorities, and the Anti-Tobacco Recoupment provision in the \nSupplemental Appropriations bill that prevents the federal government \nfrom taking any portion of the $246 billion in tobacco settlement funds \nfrom the states.\n  Although these achievements have helped revive federalism, it is \nclear that state and local governments still need protection from \nfederal encroachment in state and local affairs. It is equally clear \nthat the federal government needs to do more to be better partners with \nour state and local governments. As Congress is less eager to impose \nunfunded mandates, largely because of the commitments we won through \nthe Unfunded Mandates law, there is a growing interest in imposing \npolicy preemptions. The proposed federal moratorium on all state and \nlocal taxes on Internet commerce is just one striking example that \ncould have a devastating effect on the ability of States and localities \nto serve their citizens.\n  The danger of this growing trend toward federal preemption is the \nreason the Federalism Accountability Act is so important. The \nlegislation makes Congress and federal agencies clear and accountable \nwhen enacting laws and rules that preempt State and local authority. It \nalso directs the courts to err on the side of state sovereignty when \ninterpreting vague Federal rules and statutes where the intent to \npreempt state authority is unclear.\n  I am particularly gratified that this legislation addresses a \nmisinterpretation of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act as it applies to \nlarge entitlement programs. The Federalism Accountability Act clarifies \nthat major new requirements imposed on States under entitlement \nauthority are to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office as \nunfunded mandates. It also requires that where Congress has capped the \nFederal share of an entitlement program, the accompanying committee and \nCBO reports must analyze whether the legislation includes new \nflexibility or whether there is existing flexibility to offset \nadditional costs incurred by the States. This important ``fix'' to the \nUnfunded Mandates law is long overdue and I am pleased we are including \nit in our federalism bill.\n  The Federalism Accountability Act is a welcome and needed step toward \nprotecting our States and communities against interference from \nWashington. It builds upon the gains we have already made in restoring \nthe balance between the Federal Government and the States envisioned by \nthe Framers of our Constitution. I am proud to have played a role in \ncrafting it, and I hope all my colleagues will lend their support to \nthis worthy legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 1215. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs to furnish headstones or markers for \nmarked graves of, or to otherwise commemorate, certain individuals; to \nthe Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                    veterans headstones and markers\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nentitle each deceased veteran to an official headstone or grave marker \nin recognition of that veteran's contribution to this nation. Currently \nthe VA provides a headstone or grave marker upon request only if the \nveteran's grave is unmarked. This provision dates back to\n\n[[Page S6876]]\n\nthe Civil War when this nation wanted to ensure that none of its \nsoldiers was buried in an unmarked grave. Of course, in this day and \nage, a grave rarely goes unmarked, and the official headstone or marker \ninstead serves specifically to recognize a deceased veteran's service.\n\n  Unfortunately, this provision has not changed with the times. When \nfamilies go ahead and purchase a private headstone, as nearly every \nfamily does these days, they bar themselves from receiving the \ngovernment headstone or marker. On the other hand, some families who \nhappen to be aware of this provision request the official headstone or \nmarker prior to placing a private marker. As a result, the grave of \ntheir veteran bears both the private marker and the government marker.\n  All deceased veterans deserve to have their service recognized, not \njust those whose families make their requests prior to purchasing a \nprivate marker. The Department of Veterans Affairs is well aware of \nthis anomaly. VA officials receive thousands of complaints each year \nfrom families who are upset about this law's arbitrary effect.\n  A constituent of mine, Thomas Guzzo, first brought this matter to my \nattention last year. His late father, Agostino Guzzo, served in the \nPhilippines and was honorably discharged from the Army in 1947. Today, \nAgostino Guzzo is interred in a mausoleum at Cedar Hill Cemetery in \nHartford, but the mausoleum bears no reference to his service because \nof the current law. Like so many families, the Guzzo family bought its \nown marker and subsequently found that it could not request an official \nVA marker.\n  Thomas Guzzo then contacted me, and I attempted to straighten out \nwhat I thought to be a bureaucratic mix-up. I was surprised to realize \nthat Thomas Guzzo's difficulties resulted not from some glitch in the \nsystem, but rather from the law itself. In the end, I wrote to the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs regarding Thomas Guzzo's very reasonable \nrequest. The Secretary responded that his hands were tied as a result \nof the obscure law. Furthermore, the Secretary's response indicated \nthat, even if a grave marker could be provided for Thomas Guzzo, that \nmarker could not be placed on a cemetery bench or tree that would be \ndedicated to the elder Guzzo. The law prevented the Department from \nproviding a marker for placement anywhere but the grave site and thus \nprevents families from recognizing their veteran's service as they \nwish.\n  This bill is a modest means of solving a massive problem. It has been \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office at less than three million \ndollars per year. That is a small price to pay to recognize our \ndeceased veterans and put their families at ease. If a family wishes to \ndedicate a tree or bench to their deceased veteran, this bill allows \nthe family to place the marker on those memorials. We should give these \nmarkers to the families when they request them, and we should allow \neach family to recognize their deceased veteran in their own way.\n  This bill allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to better serve \nveterans and their families. I stand with thousands of veterans' \nfamilies and look forward to the day when this bill's changes will be \nwritten into law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 1216. A bill to amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 to \nestablish a Marine Mammal Rescue Grant Program, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                       MARINE MAMMAL RESCUE FUND\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto establish the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund. This legislation will amend \nthe Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 by establishing a grant \nprogram that Marine Mammal Stranding Centers and Networks can use to \nsupport the important work they do in responding to marine mammal \nstrandings and mortality events.\n  Since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, 47 \nfacilities nationally have been authorized to handle the rehabilitation \nof stranded marine mammals and over 400 individuals and facilities \nacross the country are part of an authorized National Stranding Network \nthat responds to strandings and deaths.\n  Mr. President, these facilities and individuals provide our country \nwith a variety of critical services, including rescue, housing, care, \nrehabilitation, transport, and tracking of marine mammals and sea \nturtles, as well as assistance in investigating mortality events, \ntissue sampling, and removal of carcasses. They also work very closely \nwith the National Marine Fisheries Service, a variety of environmental \ngroups, and with state and local officials in rescuing, tracking and \nprotecting marine mammals and sea turtles on the Endangered Species \nList. Yet they rely primarily on private donations, fundraisers, and \nfoundation grants for their operating budgets. They receive no federal \nassistance, and a very few of them get some financial assistance from \ntheir states.\n  As an example, Mr. President, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center \nlocated in Brigantine in my home state of New Jersey was formed in \n1978. To date, it has responded to over 1,500 calls for stranded \nwhales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles that have washed ashore on New \nJersey's beaches. It has also been called on to assist in strandings as \nfar away as Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Yet, their operating \nbudget for the past year was just under $300,000, with less than 6 \npercent ($17,000) coming from the state. Although the Stranding Center \nin Brigantine has never turned down a request for assistance with a \nstranding, trying to maintain that level of responsiveness and service \nbecomes increasingly more difficult each year.\n  Virtually all the money raised by the Center, Mr. President, goes to \npay for the feeding, care, and transportation of rescued marine \nmammals, rehabilitation (including medical care), insurance, day-to-day \noperation of the Center, and staff payroll. Too many times the staff \nare called upon to pay out-of-pocket expenses in travel, subsistence, \nand quarters while responding to strandings or mortality events.\n  Mr. President, this should not happen. These people are performing a \ngreat service to Americans across the country, and they are being asked \nto pay their own way as well. And when responding to mortality events, \nMr. President, they are performing work that protects public health and \nhelps assess the potential danger to human life and to other marine \nmammals.\n  I feel very strongly that we should be providing some support to the \npeople who are doing this work. To that end, Mr. President, the \nlegislation I am introducing would create the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund \nunder the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It would authorize funding at \n$5,000,000.00, annually, over the next five years, for grants to Marine \nMammal Stranding Centers and Stranding Network Members authorized by \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Grants would not exceed \n$100,000.00 per year, and would require a 25 percent non-federal \nfunding matching requirement.\n  I am proud to offer this legislation on behalf of the Stranding \nCenters across the country, and look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to ensure its passage. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1216\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 116\n\n       Whereas 13 Iranian Jews were arrested on accusation of \n     espionage, and have been detained since April, 1999;\n       Whereas the United States and Israel have dismissed the \n     charges as false, denying any connection to the detainees;\n       Whereas Germany, as the current president of the European \n     Union, has expressed its deep concern at the arrest of the 13 \n     Iranian Jews, and Joschka Fischer, German Foreign Minister, \n     has expressed his deep skepticism over the charges, and has \n     called for the release of the 13 detainees;\n       Whereas the 13 detainees are rabbis and religious teachers, \n     living in a Jewish community in a southern province of Iran, \n     with no apparent ties to any type of espionage;\n       Whereas more than half the Iranian Jews have been forced to \n     leave the country, and five Jews have been executed by \n     Iranian authorities over the past five years, without \n     receiving a trial;\n       Whereas Iran hanged two people convicted of spying for \n     Israel and the U.S. in 1997, which implies impending danger \n     for these 13 prisoners;\n       Whereas espionage is punishable by death in Iran:\n       Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the arrest and detention of 13 Iranian Jews \n     accused of spying for the United States and Israel; and\n       (2) calls upon the Iranian authorities to release these \n     individuals immediately and without harm.\n       (3) calls upon the Iranian authorities to provide \n     internationally accepted legal protections to all its \n     citizens, regardless of their status or position.\n\n Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I rise to submit a \nresolution condemning the arrest and detention of 13 Iranian Jews \naccused of espionage.\n  In April of this year, 13 rabbis and religious leaders were arrested \nat their homes in the Iranian cities of Shiraz and Isfahan. According \nto the Israeli newspaper, Ha'aretz, the names of the detainees are \nDavid Tefilin, Doni Tefilin, Javid Beth Jacob, Farhad Seleh, Nasser \nLevi Haim, Asher Zadmehror, Navid Balazadeh, Nejat Beroukkhim, Aarash \nBeroukhim, Farzad Kashi, Faramaz Kashi, Shahrokh Pak Nahad, and Ramin \n(last name unknown). They have remained imprisoned since the time of \ntheir arrest, without charge, under accusation of spying for the United \nStates and Israel, although they have no apparent ties to any type of \nespionage. Both the United States and Israel have dismissed the charges \nas false, denying any connection to the detainees. In addition to the \nUnited States, Israel, and Germany have denounced these arrests and \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright as well as Joschka Fischer, the \nGerman Foreign Minister, have called for their release.\n  Iran's treatment of its Jewish residents in recent years has been \ndeplorable, forcing half of its Jews to flee the country. In the past \nfive years alone, five Jews have been executed by Iranian authorities, \nwithout the fundamental right of a trial. In 1997, Iran hanged two \npeople convicted of spying,\n\n[[Page S6879]]\n\nan event that emphasizes the extreme importance of timely action on the \nmatter of these 13 detainees. Espionage is punishable by death in Iran, \nso the lives of these 13 people need our support and protection. The \nIranian government's actions are deplorable and fly in the face of \njustice. This resolution condemns the arrests and calls upon Iran to \nrelease these 13 people immediately and without harm.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6879-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 117--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n UNITED STATES SHARE OF ANY RECONSTRUCTION MEASURES UNDERTAKEN IN THE \n     BALKANS REGION OF EUROPE ON ACCOUNT OF THE ARMED CONFLICT AND \n  ATROCITIES THAT HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA \n                          SINCE MARCH 24, 1999\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 117\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF SENATE ON UNITED STATES SHARE OF \n                   RECONSTRUCTION COSTS.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the United States share \n     of the total costs of reconstruction measures carried out in \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or contiguous countries, \n     on account of the armed conflict and atrocities that have \n     occurred in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia since March \n     24, 1999, should not exceed the United States percentage \n     share of the common-funded budgets of NATO.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this resolution:\n       (1) Common-funded budgets of NATO.--The term ``common-\n     funded budgets of NATO'' means--\n       (A) the Military Budget, the Security Investment Program, \n     and the Civil Budget of NATO; and\n       (B) any successor or additional account or program of NATO.\n       (2) Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.--The term ``Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia'' means the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and includes Kosovo.\n       (3) United states percentage share of the common-funded \n     budgets of nato.--The term ``United States percentage share \n     of the common-funded budgets of NATO'' means the percentage \n     that the total of all United States payments during a fiscal \n     year to the common-funded budgets of NATO represent to the \n     total amounts payable by all NATO members to those budgets \n     during that fiscal year.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I submit the Kosovo Reconstruction \nFair Share Resolution of 1999.\n  This resolution's goal is to express the sense of the Senate that the \nUnited States should not end up paying more than its fair share of the \nKosovo reconstruction effort.\n  Specifically, the Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution states \nthat the United States' share of the costs of reconstructing Kosovo and \nthe surrounding region following the conflict in the Balkans should not \nexceed the United States' portion of NATO's three ``Common Funds \nBurdensharing'' budgets.\n  Our contributions to NATO come in two basic forms. The first and most \nsignificant portion by far comprises our direct deployment of troops \nand equipment. Over the years America has contributed the lion's share \nof the troops and equipment.\n  America's disproportionally heavy burden has continued into the late \n1990s as the War in Kosovo clearly demonstrated. The vast majority of \nthe fighting needed to wage the war in Kosovo was done in large part by \nAmerican air power. We should not have to also carry the burden in the \nKosovo reconstruction effort.\n  That's why the Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution states \nthat America's portion of the reconstruction costs should not exceed \nthe portion we contribute to NATO's three Common Fund Accounts, which \nis smaller than our contributions of troops and equipment.\n  Factors considered when determining each country's portion includes \nits respective Gross Domestic Product and other considerations. Over \nthe past three decades the U.S. portion has declined, as it should.\n  For the years 1996 through 1998, America's contribution to these \nthree NATO common funds averaged around 23 percent according to the \nCongressional Research Service. Accordingly, this resolution calls for \ncapping our portion of the reconstruction costs at the same level of 23 \npercent.\n  In light of the fact that we carried the vast majority of the burden \nin ending the fighting I think that this is still too much. Perhaps 10 \npercent is a fairer share. It is time for our European allies to do \ntheir fair share.\n  Following World War Two, a war that would not have been won without \nAmerica, the American people invested in the Marshall Plan. The \nMarshall Plan was vital in the effort to rebuild Europe from the ashes \nof WWII. Fifty years later we won the Cold War. Now, just yesterday, we \nput an end to the fighting in Kosovo. It is time for our NATO European \nallies to shoulder the financial burden to rebuild a region of their \nown continent that has been ravaged by war.\n  The Kosovo Reconstruction Fair Share Resolution indicates that \nAmerica will not pay more than our fair share. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport passage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6879-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6879-S6880]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                Y2K ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       EDWARDS AMENDMENT NO. 619\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS proposed an amendment to amendment No. 608 proposed by \nMr. McCain to the bill (S. 96) to regulate commerce between and among \nthe several States by providing for the orderly resolution of disputes \narising out of computer-based problems relating to processing data that \nincludes a 2-digit expression of the year's date; as follows:\n\n       Strike Section 12 and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 12.

Mr. President, on March 9th of this year, 105 \nstudents--out of 80,000 applicants nationwide--were selected to receive \nthe prestigious Horatio Alger Award, an honor bestowed each year on \nstudents and adults who excel despite significant adversity.\n  One of those recipients was Leslie Jones, a 16-year-old student from \nWhite Station High School in Memphis, Tennessee who, despite brain \nsurgery to remove a tumor and medical complications that damaged her \nvision and rendered her facial muscles incapable of managing even a \nsmile, will nevertheless graduate with her class this year--with \nhonors. Her high school was also recognized as a Horatio Alger School \nof Excellence.\n  Despite physical setbacks that kept her from attending classes, \nLeslie used a homebound teacher to keep up with her studies. When her \neyes crossed and refused to cooperate, she--as her teacher described \nit--``just covered one eye with her palm and continued on.'' When asked \nif the homework was too much, Leslie never once said yes, even when \nsome work had to be done over because faulty vision caused her to miss \nsome lines on the page.\n  In the essay which helped her win the competition over tens of \nthousands of others, Leslie wrote that despite the pity, the lack of \nunderstanding, and even the alienation of other people, she never once \nlost faith in her own ability to focus on her goals. ``In my heart,'' \nshe said, ``I know my dreams are greater than the forces of adversity \nand I trust that, by the way of hope and fortitude, I shall make these \ndreams a reality.''\n  And so she has. Yet, what is perhaps even more remarkable than the \ncourage and determination with which she pursued her dreams, is the \nhumility with which she has accepted her hard-earned reward.\n  When 1,900 students gathered to honor her achievement, she down\nplayed her accomplishment saying instead that everyone possesses the \nsame ability to rise above adversity. Rather than dwell on her medical \nproblems, she insists that they don't define who she is.\n  Emphasizing the power of positive thinking, the Italian author, Dr. \nPiero Ferrucci, once observed, ``How often--even before we begin--have \nwe declared a task `impossible'? How often have we construed a picture \nof ourselves as inadequate? A great deal depends upon the thought \npatterns we choose and on the persistence with which we affirm them.''\n  Mr. President, Leslie Jones stands as a testament to the truth of \nthose words just as surely as White Station High School proves that \npublic institutions committed to helping students achieve can be a \nmajor influence in helping them shape a positive future for themselves \nand others. Both the school, and especially the student, deserve our \nadmiration, our praise, and our thanks--all of which I enthusiastically \nextend on behalf of all the people of Tennessee and, indeed, all \nAmericans everywhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6881-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6881-S6882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO GOVERNOR JOHN McKEITHEN\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, last week Louisiana lost of one its \nmost prominent sons. An era passed into history with the death of \nformer Governor John McKeithen, who served his state with distinction \nas governor during the turbulent years of 1964 to 1972.\n\n[[Page S6882]]\n\n  When he died at the age of 81 in his hometown of Columbia, Louisiana, \non the banks of the Ouachita River, John McKeithen left a legacy of \naccomplishment as governor that will likely not be matched in our \nlifetime. As one political leader observed last week, with John \nMcKeithen's death ``we have witnessed the passing of a giant, both in \nphysical stature and in character.''\n  Indeed, McKeithen was not affectionately called ``Big John'' for \nnothing. Like most great leaders, he thought big and acted big.\n  Louisiana was blessed with John McKeithen's strong, determined \nleadership at a time when a lesser man, with lesser convictions, might \nhave exploited racial tensions for political gain.\n  In fact, throughout the South, McKeithen had plenty of mentors had he \nwanted to follow such a course. But Governor McKeithen was decent \nenough, tolerant enough and principled enough to resist any urge for \nrace baiting. In his own, unique way, to borrow a phrase from Robert \nFrost, he took the road less traveled and that made all the difference.\n  John McKeithen's wise, moral leadership at a time of tremendous \nsocial and economic transformation in Louisiana stands as his greatest \naccomplishment in public life. Not only did he encourage the citizens \nof Louisiana to tolerate and observe the new civil rights laws passed \nby Congress in the mid-1960s, he worked proactively to bring black \ncitizens into the mainstream of Louisiana's political and economic \nlife.\n  Hundreds of African-Americans will never forget the courageous way \nthat National guardsmen under John McKeithen's command protected them \nfrom harm as they marched from Bogalusa to the State Capitol in the \nmid-1960s in support of civil rights. And generations of African-\nAmerican political leaders will always have John McKeithen to thank for \nthe way he helped open door of opportunity to them and their \npredecessors.\n  But racial harmony will not stand as Governor McKeithen's only \nlegacy. All of Louisiana has ``Big John'' to thank for the way our \nstate has become one of the world's top tourist destinations by virtue \nof the construction in the early 1970s of the Louisiana Superdome. To \nmany--those who did not dream as big as ``Big John''--the idea of \nbuilding the world's largest indoor arena seemed a folly, sure to fail. \nBut like a modern-day Noah building his ark, McKeithen endured the \ntaunts and jeers of his critics while he forged ahead--sure that his \nvision for the success of the Superdome was sound.\n  And today, more than a quarter century later, the citizens of \nLouisiana, particularly those in New Orleans, are only beginning to \nunderstand the enormous economic benefits that Louisiana had reaped by \nvirtue of the Superdome and the world-wide attention and notoriety it \nhas brought to New Orleans.\n  Even at that time, Louisiana's citizens recognized that there was \nsomething unique and very special about their governor. And so it was \nfor that reason that they amended the state's Constitution to allow him \nto become the first man in the state's history to serve two consecutive \nterms in the Governor's Mansion.\n  Senator Landrieu and I doubt that we will never see the likes of John \nMcKeithen again--a big man, with a big heart, who dreamed big dreams \nand left an enormous legacy in his wake. We know that all our \ncolleagues join us in expressing their deepest sympathy to his wife, \nMarjorie, his children and his grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6882-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ELLIOTT HAYNES\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nElliott Haynes, a great American and Vermonter, who passed away on May \n19, of this year. Elliott served his country and his community in so \nmany ways, and I feel blessed to have known him.\n  Elliot and I came from similar backgrounds: he lived in my home town \nof Shrewsbury, Vermont, where we both served on the volunteer fire \ndepartment; we received our BA's at Yale; and we both served our \ncountry in the Navy.\n  The list of contributions Elliott made to the International, \nNational, and local arenas is impressive not only for its length, but \nalso for its variety. This tribute can only touch on a few of them, but \nI hope the highlights will give the Senate an impression of how great a \nman we have lost. He began his career writing for the United Nations \nWorld Magazine. In 1954, Elliott co-founded the Business International \nCorporation in New York. Its purpose was to provide information and to \nhelp those who worked in the worldwide economic market. In addition to \nbeing the co-founder, he also served as the Director, Managing Editor, \nEditor-in-Chief, and as Chairman of the Board.\n  In 1959, Elliott joined a group of executives called the ``Alliance \nfor Progress,'' who advised then President-Elect Kennedy on US business \npolicy towards Latin America. He then served as the President of the \nCouncil for the International Progress of Management and as the \nChairman of the Board of the International Management Development \nInstitute, a non-profit organization devoted to managerial training in \nAfrica and Latin American.\n  Elliott was also the manager of numerous International business round \ntables held throughout the years. While all of these activities would \nbe enough work for two people, Elliott found time to create the US \nbranch of the AIESEC-US, an International organization which gave \nuniversity students the opportunity to train in businesses throughout \nthe world. Later on in his life, he served as their International \nChairman and was inducted into their Hall of Fame. Throughout all of \nthis, he served as an advisor and occasional lecturer for various \nbusiness schools, including Indiana University, Pace University, and \nHarvard Business School.\n  Elliott Haynes was also very active in the State of Vermont. He was a \nmember the Rutland Rotary, served on the Board of Directors of the \nVisiting Nurses Association and was Chair of the Board of the Vermont \nIndependence Fund, which provided seed money to organizations which \nhelped the elderly and disabled lead more active and independent lives.\n  And while Elliott's list of business accomplishments is phenomenal, \nit was his ability to turn a personal tragedy into an inspiration for \nothers that is his greatest legacy. In 1994 he was diagnosed with \nParkinson's Disease, and from that moment on, he devoted his life to \nimproving the lives of others with the disease. In 1997, Elliott \nfounded the Rutland Regional Parkinson's Support Group in 1997. He \nbrought the needs and concerns of those with Parkinson's Disease to the \nattention of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, which I chair. Elliott was essential in getting legislation \npassed which provides federal money for research into this crippling \ndisease. I am so proud to have worked with him on this landmark \nlegislation and I only wish he could have lived to see the fruits of \nhis labor.\n  Elliott Haynes was a wonderful and influential man who's life touched \nthousands of people in direct and indirect ways. He will be remembered \nas a man who gave wholly of himself and who was willing to go the extra \nmile for his friend and neighbor, regardless of whether it was a \nneighbor in Shrewsbury or a ``neighbor'' halfway around the world. \nElliott Haynes will be deeply missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6882-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6882-S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BOYCOTT THE ALTERNATIVE ICE CREAM PARTY\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to request a boycott by \nall Senators to the ``Alternative Ice Cream Party'' being sponsored by \nSenators from the Northeastern United States. The ``Party'' is designed \nto rally support for the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. The dairy \ncompact that was eliminated by the recently revised milk marketing \norders has cost consumers in the Northeast over $60 million and cost \nchild and nutrition programs an additional $9 million. If proposals to \nexpand dairy compacts to 27 states this year are adopted, it will force \n60% of the consumers in the nation to pay an additional $2 billion, \nthat's correct, $2 billion a year in higher milk prices. And while the \nNortheast's consumers are purchasing overpriced milk, Wisconsin is \nlosing dairy farmers by the day--over 7,000 in the past few years.\n  Mr. President, rather than ice cream, the Northeast Senators should \ngive away cow manure instead: At least\n\n[[Page S6883]]\n\nthen the freebies would have some relation to the legislation they are \npushing. There are many other areas of concern I have in regard to this \nissue, particularly why the hard-working cows in the Northeast are not \nseeing the money from the extra profits that the large processors are \nmaking. I am surprised that animal rights and labor activists have not \nraised issue with the long hours worked and extra milk that cows in the \nNortheast are forced to produce. I am doubly surprised that my good \nfriends from the Northeast can sit in Washington eating free ice cream \nwhile poor children in New England end up paying more for their school \nlunch milk because of the dairy compact.\n  If we as the United States can no longer expect to give a fair (milk) \nshake to dairy farmers and consumers across the country, then maybe it \nis time for the Northeast to secede from the Union.

Mr. President, as we enter the twilight of the \nTwentieth Century, we can look back at the immense multitude of \nachievements that led to the ascension of the United States of America \nas the preeminent nation in modern history. We owe this title as \nworld's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million \nmen and women who served in our armed services and who defended the \nprinciples and ideals of our nation.\n  Before we embark upon the Twenty-First Century, the American Legion \nwill celebrate its 80th anniversary serving our nation's veterans. \nSince the first gathering of American World War I Doughboys in Paris, \nFrance on March 15th, 1919, the American Legion has upheld the values \nof freedom, justice, respect and equality. The American Legion \neventually was chartered by Congress in 1919 as a patriotic, mutual-\nhelp, war-time veterans organization. A community-service organization \nwhich now numbers nearly 3 million members--men and women--in nearly \n15,000 American Legion Posts worldwide.\n  The American Legion's support for our nation's veterans has been \nexemplary over the last eighty years. Shortly after it's founding, the \nAmerican Legion successfully lobbied for the creation of a federal \nveterans bureau. With the American Legion's support, the agency \ndeveloped a veterans hospital system in the 1930s. In 1989, another \nAmerican Legion plan became reality: the elevation of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs as a cabinet-level agency. The American Legion also \nsuccessfully advocated for the compensatory rights of veterans, victims \nof atomic radiation, PTSD, Agent Orange, and Persian Gulf syndrome.\n  Over the past eighty years, the American Legion also has been active \nin promoting the values of patriotism and competition with our nation's \nyoung people. There are many sons and daughters participating in \nAmerican Legion sponsored programs such as American Legion Boys and \nGirls State, Boys and Girls Nation, the National High School Oratorical \nContest, and the Junior Shooting Sports and American Legion Baseball.\n  Throughout my service in Congress, I have long appreciated the \nleadership of the South Dakota American Legion for its input on a \nvariety of issues impacting veterans and their families in recent \nyears. The American Legion's insight and efforts have proven very \nvaluable to me and my staff, and I commend each and every one of them \nfor their leadership on issues of importance to all veterans of the \narmed forces.\n  Mr. President, as Americans, we should never forget the men and women \nwho served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. I close my \nremarks by offering my gratitude and support for all the achievements \nperformed by the American Legion. For eighty years now, the American \nLegion has been the standard bearer in the representation of our \nveterans. I want to extend my sincerest appreciation to the American \nLegion for its continued leadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6883-3", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6883]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELIZABETH BURKE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nElizabeth Burke, who has been chosen as a 1999 Community Health Leader \nby the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation for her efforts to combat \ndomestic violence. As one of 10 outstanding individuals selected each \nyear to receive this distinguished award for finding innovative ways to \nbring health care to communities whose needs have been ignored and \nunmet, Ms. Burke's work on behalf of domestic violence victims has \nbecome a national model.\n  A former victim of domestic violence, Elizabeth Burke was hired to \nstart up the Domestic Violence Medical Advocacy Project at Mercy \nHospital in Pittsburgh in 1994. The project is a joint effort between \nMercy Hospital and the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater \nPittsburgh, and since its start five years ago, the hospital has \nincreased the identification of domestic violence victims by more than \n500 percent. Women are offered counseling, education, shelter and \nemployment programs in the 24 hour, 40 bed facility. The Center screens \nall women who are admitted into the hospital, identifying domestic \nviolence victims at a point when they are most receptive to help.\n  Ms. Burke is responsible for training hundreds of physicians, nurses, \nsocial workers as well as others in prevention diagnosis, treatment and \nadvocacy for victims of domestic violence. Since coming to the project \nshe has successfully bridged the gap between the domestic violence and \nmedical fields to create a comprehensive response to victims of \ndomestic violence. From emergency room screenings to follow-up services \nto an extensive prevention network, she ensures that abused women get \nhelp before the violence destroys their lives.\n  Ms. Burke's efforts don't stop there. She also chairs the \nPennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence and makes \npresentations on domestic violence to a broad community. In addition, \nshe serves as adjunct faculty at the University of Pittsburgh, \nUniversity of Missouri and West Virginia University.\n  Mr. President, many victims of domestic violence have been touched by \nElizabeth Burke's compassionate spirit. I ask my colleagues to join \nwith me in commending Ms. Burke for her extraordinary contribution to \nthe Pittsburgh community and to all victims of domestic \nviolence.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6884-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S6884]]\n                             YOUTH VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our nation has been riveted by the \nviolence in Littleton, CO and Conyers, GA and our youth's easy access \nto guns. Communities have become increasingly concerned about their own \nschools and are more sensitized to the dangers of youth violence. Yet, \ndespite this scrutiny, firearms continue to claim the lives of our \nyoung people. Every day on the average, another 14 children in America \nare killed with guns because of the gaping loopholes in our Federal \nfirearms laws. We took steps to eliminate some of these loopholes \nduring Senate consideration of the juvenile justice bill. \nUnfortunately, the legislation passed by the Senate did not go far \nenough to reduce the easy availability of lethal weapons to persons who \nshould not have them.\n  Today, I saw an ABC News Wire report called ``Michigan sting \noperation shows felons can buy guns.'' According to this report, two \ninvestigators in Michigan, one posing as a felon and the other as his \nfriend, went to ten different firearms dealers to purchase guns. \nRemember, selling a gun to a felon is illegal but these investigators \nhad no problems with the gun dealers they approached. Out of the 10 \ndealers in this investigation, nine reportedly allowed, apparently, \nillegal purchases. In total, 37 guns were apparently purchased \nillegally during this selling spree. And still, the NRA wants Congress \nto expand the loopholes in our firearms laws, rather than taking modest \nsteps to close them.\n  Since the moment the Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill, NRA \nlobbyists in Washington have been working around the clock to lobby \nMembers of the House of Representatives. The NRA has named as its ``top \npriority, the defeat of any Lautenberg-style gun show amendment in the \nU.S. House.'' The Lautenberg amendment, adopted by the Senate, simply \nrequires dealers at gun shows to follow the same rules as other gun \ndealers, by using the existing Brady system for background checks. It \naccomplishes this goal without creating any new burdens for law-abiding \ncitizens and without any additional fees imposed on gun sellers or gun \nbuyers. But the NRA wants to create additional loopholes by creating a \nspecial category of gun show dealers, who would be exempt from even the \nmost minimum standards. They also want to weaken the bill by \nestablishing a 24-hour limit on the time that vendors have to complete \nbackground checks, rather than the current standard of 3 business days, \nthe time the FBI says is necessary. It will be a sad day if the NRA can \nsuccessfully lobby the House to eliminate these moderate proposals in \nthe Juvenile Justice bill.\n  I hope the House will amend its current bill to include language, \npassed by the Senate, to limit the importation of large capacity \nammunition devices, clips that domestic companies were prohibited from \nmanufacturing in 1994. Again, this is a moderate measure designed to \nkeep clips with rounds as high as 250 off our streets and out of the \nhands of young people.\n  As the House begins their consideration of the juvenile justice bill \nnext week, I hope it will strengthen, not weaken, the moderate gun \ncontrol measures that we passed in the Senate. For example, Congress \nshould take steps to prevent unintentional shootings, which occur as a \nresult of unsafe storage of guns. These daily tragedies, resulting from \nthe careless storage of guns, can easily be prevented by requiring the \nuse of locking devices for guns, which are inexpensive and easy to use. \nWe should also take steps to eliminate illegal gun trafficking and ban \nsemiautomatic assault weapons and handguns for persons under 21 years \nof age.\n  The legislation passed in the Senate was a step in the right \ndirection, but those moderate reforms are in jeopardy if Congress \nallows our legislative priorities to be dictated by the NRA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6884-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6884-S6885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OUTSTANDING STUDENT--COURTENAY BURT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \nachievements of an outstanding student from Kalispell, Montana. The \nMontana chapter of the American Association of University Women \nsponsors an annual essay contests for students in grades 11 and 12. The \ntopic of the essays was ``Women in Montana History.''\n  Courtenay Burt, an Eleventh Grader at Bigfork High School, had her \nessay chosen as the best of all submitted in Montana. She writes about \nher grandmother, a woman of integrity and wisdom who died when \nCourtenay was only eight months old. Her essay tells us the story of a \nwoman who grew up during the Great Depression, survived the often harsh \nclimate of Montana, raised a family, earned the respect of her \ncommunity, and maintained a healthy sense of humor throughout it all.\n  I ask that Courtenay Burt's essay ``Big Mama'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The essay follows:\n\n                              ``Old Mama''\n\n                          (By Courtenay Burt)\n\n       ``Dear Courtenay, I wish you could only know how much I had \n     looked forward to watching you grow up, but I guess that just \n     wasn't meant to be. Not to worry, though--we'll get better \n     acquainted later.'' My grandmother, who was affectionately \n     referred to as ``Old Mama,'' wrote those words in a shaky \n     hand just before she passed away in 1982. I was eight months \n     old, then, and so I have no memories of her; instead I've \n     borrowed the memories of those who knew and lover her, as I \n     wish I could have. Through reminiscing with those close to \n     her, I have discovered the courageous, colorful woman my \n     grandmother was and I have begun to paint a picture in my \n     mind.\n       ``Old Mama,'' was born Mary Katherine Emmert on February 7, \n     1918, in Kalispell, Montana. From an early age, it was \n     apparent she would make her own decisions, and her strong \n     will served her well. Using her active imagination, young \n     Mary reportedly kept her parents as a full gallop.\n       Mary's adolescent years might have been similar to any of \n     ours, but they were marked by the hardships of the Great \n     Depression, which began in 1929. ``Old Mama'' actually was \n     one of those children who walked three miles to school in a \n     blizzard. Like many, young Mary was eager to grow up. ``You \n     always look up to the next step and think how grown up you \n     would feel to be there, but when you get there, you don't \n     feel any different than you ever did. I have found this to be \n     the way with life,'' she stated in a paper for her English \n     class at Flathead County High School.\n       As a young woman, Mary lived the American Dream: She \n     married Tommy Riedel, a local boy, and they eventually had \n     two children. The couple worked side by side building a home \n     on family farmland south of Kalispell, and the years that \n     followed were typical for a young family of the '50's: Tommy \n     worked while Mary raised the children. There were \n     neighborhood events, outdoors activities, and there were \n     always the joys of the farm life. My mother recalls horseback \n     rides with Old Mama on those long-ago summer evenings, dusk \n     falling hazy and pink as they loped the long fields home.\n       Old Mama was a constant and steady support for her \n     children. At one time she drove all the way to Nebraska to \n     watch my mother compete in the National track finals. \n     ``During those teen years, it was her never-failing presence \n     more than her words that assured me of her love,'' my mother \n     once wrote.\n       After Tommy had a sudden heart attack in his mid-forties \n     and became disabled, Mary did not sit helplessly by. She \n     inventoried her skills and went to work in Kalispell, \n     becoming a legal secretary. She took great pride in her work. \n     Years later, when it was fashionable for women to have more \n     grandiose plans, my mother once made the mistake of remarking \n     that she intended to be more than ``just a secretary.'' Old \n     Mama gathered herself to full indignation and retorted that, \n     indeed, Christ had been ``just a carpenter.''\n       Eventually, hard work and commitment opened a door for Mary \n     Riedel. When the Justice of the Peace fell ill--for whom \n     she'd been ``just a secretary''--Mary was appointed to act in \n     his place. From all accounts, the job was perfect for her. \n     ``Old Mama,'' had an uncanny ability to discern people's \n     character and it served her well, as did her dry sense of \n     humor. On one occasion, Mary intercepted a note that a \n     previous offender had written to a friend who was due to \n     appear in her court.\n       ``Watch out for Mary Redneck,'' the note cautioned; it went \n     on to complain of a substantial fine and a stern lecture. As \n     Judge Mary read the note, all eyes were riveted on her. \n     Slowly, Mary began to smile. Then she was laughing-tear \n     streaming, gut-wrenching laughter. She returned the note to \n     offender with the notation: ``Sorry. This seems to have \n     gotten misdirected. Best wishes, Judge Mary Redneck.''\n       So often, in the shadow of life's triumphs come the cruel, \n     unexpected twists. My grandmother was diagnosed with terminal \n     cancer only a few years after being elected Justice of the \n     Peace. Determined to battle the disease, she struggled to \n     survive the ravages of chemotherapy. With all of her heart \n     she fought, until she could see that it was time to give in \n     with grace.\n       On the last evening, she gathered her family together. ``I \n     told God I wanted ten more years,'' she said, that wry smile \n     still working the corners of her mouth. ``But when you're \n     dealing with Him . . . you have to compromise a little.'' To \n     the end, Old Mama was indomitable.\n       On April 14, 1982, Mary Riedel was layed to rest. Although \n     she is not here in person, her\n\n[[Page S6885]]\n\n     spirit lives on in the hearts of those who loved her; her \n     strength, faith, and courage fire my imagination and warm my \n     heart. Mary Riedel was a woman to be admired and remembered, \n     and I am proud that she was my grandmother. She showed us how \n     to live . . . and when the time came, she showed us how to \n     die.\n\n\n                              works cited\n\n       Beers, Burton F., World History: Patterns of Civilization: \n     Prentice Hall; Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey; Needham, \n     Massachusetts; Updated Edition, 1993.\n       The Bible, New International Version as written by the \n     Apostles.\n       Burt, Justin, ``Mary Riedel: An Influencing Force in \n     Montana History,'' Women of Montana Essays 1991-1995; \n     American Association of University Women; Kalispell, Montana \n     1996.\n       Burt, Kathleen, ``Remembering Mary Redneck,'' an \n     unpublished paper.\n       Burt, Kathleen, A personal interview.\n       Riedel, Mary, ``Pat,'' an unpublished \n     autobiography.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6885-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6885-S6886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PLEASANT VIEW GARDENS\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Chairman, recently the Washington Post \ncontained an article recognizing an innovative and successful approach \nto public housing in Baltimore, MD. Pleasant View Gardens, a new \nhousing development, holds great promise as a new approach to public \nhousing in the Nation.\n  The birth of this new project began in 1994, when the City of \nBaltimore in cooperation with the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and the State of Maryland, made funds available for the \ndemolition of Lafayette Courts and began the process of replacing it \nwith the new Pleasant View Gardens. As the Washington Post reported, \nhigh rise buildings in the ``densest tract of poverty and crime in \n[Baltimore] city'' have been replaced by low-rise, low density public \nhousing where in the evenings you hear ``the murmur of children playing \non the jungle gym at sunset,. . .police officers [chat] with \nresidents..[and] the street corners [are] empty.'' Residents who once \nreferred to their housing as a ``cage,'' now allow their children to \nplay outside.\n  Pleasant View offers homeownership opportunities and affordable \nrental housing to its residents as well as a medical clinic, a \ngymnasium, a job training center, an auditorium and includes a 110-bed \nhousing complex for senior citizens. Pleasant View is part of a plan to \nreplace more than 11,000 high-rise units in Baltimore with \napproximately 6,700 low-rise units to be completed by 2002, with \nremaining residents to be relocated throughout the city. I believe that \nthe Pleasant View initiative offers a new path for public housing in \nthe future and demonstrates that working with the community, the \ngovernment can help to make an important difference. I ask that the \nfull text of this article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   [Washington Post, April 26, 1999.]\n\n   Pleasant View Lives Up to Name--New Public Housing Has Less Crime\n\n                            (By Raja Mishra)\n\n       BALTIMORE.--On a recent April evening in the Pleasant View \n     public housing development here, the ordinary was the \n     extraordinary.\n       The only sound was the murmur of children playing on a \n     jungle gym at sunset. Police officers chatted with residents \n     on the sidewalk. Street corners were empty. Just over three \n     years ago, Lafayette Towers stood on this spot five blocks \n     northeast of the Inner Harbor. The half-dozen 11-story high-\n     rise buildings were the densest tract of poverty and crime in \n     the city.\n       Public planners trace the lineage of Lafayette Towers--and \n     hundreds of high-rise buildings like them in other cities--to \n     modernist European architects and planners of the post-World \n     War II era. When the need for urban housing gave birth to \n     such places, the term ``projects'' was viewed with favor.\n       Plasant View residents who once lived in Lafayette Towers \n     had their own term for the buildings: cages. Life in the \n     project remains seared in their memories.\n       ``I had to lug groceries up to the 10th floor because the \n     elevator was always broke,'' said Dolores Martin, 68. ``But \n     you're afraid to go up the steps because you don't know who's \n     lurking there.''\n       Eva Riley, 32, spent the first 18 years of her life in \n     Lafayette Towers.\n       ``It gives you a feeling of despair,'' she recalled. \n     ``You're locked up in a cage with a fence around you and \n     everything stinks.''\n       In Pleasant View, the federal government's more recent \n     theories of public housing--which stress low-rise, lower \n     density public housing rather than concentrations of massive \n     high-rises--have been put to the test.\n       The physical layout of Pleasant View is the heart of the \n     new approach. Each family has space: large apartments, a yard \n     and a door of their own. There are no elevators or staircases \n     to navigate. Playgrounds and landscaping fill the space \n     between town houses. There is a new community center.\n       One year into the life of the new development, the results \n     present a striking contrast to life in the old high-rise \n     complex: Crime has plummeted. Drugs and homicide have all but \n     disappeared. Employment is up.\n       ``Folks are revitalized. The old is but, the new is in. And \n     the new is much better,'' said Twyla Owens, 41, who lived in \n     Lafayette Towers for six years and moved into Pleasant View \n     last year.\n       ``People who live here care about how it looks and keeping \n     it safe,'' said Thomas Dennis, 63, who heads a group of \n     volunteers that patrols Pleasant View. ``We all pull \n     together. There was nothing like that at Lafayette.''\n       ``Federal housing officials say they view Pleasant View as \n     their first large-scale success in rectifying a disastrous \n     decision half a century ago to build high-rise public \n     housing.\n       ``It's an acknowledgment that what existed before was not \n     the right answer,'' said Deborah Vincent, deputy assistant \n     secretary for public housing at the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development.\n       The about-face is a welcome change for longtime critics of \n     high-rise projects.\n       ``I don't hold any real animosity to the people who sat \n     down in the 1940s and planned Lafayette Towers,'' said \n     Baltimore City Housing commissioner Daniel P. Henson III. \n     ``But, boy, were they short-sighted.''\n       In retrospect, it seems as if the idea of the urban \n     apartment project was destined to lead to problems, several \n     housing experts said.\n       It concentrated the poorest of the poor in small spaces set \n     apart from the rest of the city. The idea is thought to have \n     originated with Le Corbusier, considered one of the giants of \n     20th century architecture.\n       Le Corbusier was grappling with the problem of crowding in \n     big cities in France as populations swelled at the beginning \n     of the century. Slums were rapidly expanding in urban areas. \n     Rather than move housing outward, Le Corbusier thought it \n     would be better to move it upward: high-rises. He conceived \n     of them as little towns unto themselves, with commerce, \n     recreation and limited self-government.\n       As hundreds of thousands of young Americans returned from \n     World War II, eager to find transitional housing for their \n     young families, and a mass migration began from the rural \n     South to the urban North, Le Corbusier's thinking influenced \n     a generation of U.S. policymakers.\n       In this country, cost became a central issue. The new \n     projects were designed to house as many people as possible \n     for as little money as possible.\n       ``Who wanted to put poor people in lavish housing? So they \n     used shoddy materials and were built poorly,'' said Marie \n     Howland, head of the Urban Studies and Planning Department at \n     the University of Maryland at College Park.\n       The tall high-rises soon because symbols of blight.\n       ``Then the sigma of public housing increased because \n     everyone could just point to the housing high-rises,'' said \n     Sandra Neuman, interim director of the Institute for Policy \n     Studies at Johns Hopkins University.\n       As the ex-servicemen departed for new suburban \n     developments, many of the projects took on the appearance of \n     segregated housing, particularly in cities south of the \n     Mason-Dixon line. Baltimore housing department officials \n     unearthed official city documents from the 1940s that refer \n     to the planned high-rises as ``Negro housing.''\n       The most public initial concession that high-rise public \n     housing had failed came on July 15, 1972, when the notorious \n     Pruitt-Igoe projects of St. Louis were demolished with \n     explosives.\n       High-rise projects have been crashing down across the \n     country with increasing frequency in recent years. They have \n     been replaced with low-rise, low-density public housing in 22 \n     cities, including Alexandria, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia \n     and Atlanta.\n       The $3 billion effort there aims to replace more than \n     11,000 high-rise units. HUD hopes to have all the \n     construction done by 2002. Most of the new units will be town \n     houses. There will be a few low-rise apartments and some \n     stand-alone homes as well. Those who do not get space in the \n     new units will be relocated in other, existing low-rise \n     apartments.\n       The facilities reflect other shifts in public housing \n     philosophy; social needs must also be addressed and a \n     positive environment must be created.\n       Twenty-seven of the 228 homes in Pleasant View are owned by \n     their occupants. The city is trying to coax some of the \n     renters, as well as others, to buy. The idea is to have a \n     mixed-income population with long-term responsibilities. All \n     residents are required to have a job or be enrolled in job \n     training.\n       ``Before, you had too many people with too many social \n     problems concentrated in one area. Here you have a mix of \n     incomes,'' said U-Md.'s Howland.\n       Pleasant View has a new medical clinic, a gymnasium, a 110-\n     bed housing complex for senior citizens, a job training \n     center and an auditorium, where President Clinton recently \n     delivered a speech on homelessness.\n       Pleasant View also has its own police force, a small cadre \n     of officers from the Baltimore City Housing Authority police \n     unit.\n\n[[Page S6886]]\n\n     From a small station in the community center, officers \n     monitor the community using cameras that are mounted \n     throughout the neighborhood.\n       In 1994, the last year Lafayette was fully operative, there \n     were 39 robberies. In Pleasant View, there have been three. \n     In 1994, there were 108 assaults; Pleasant View had seven. \n     Lafayette had nine rapes, Pleasant View none.\n       Four hundred of the 500 people who lived in Lafayette \n     Towers have returned to live in Pleasant View, among them Eva \n     Riley. After a childhood in the high rises, she left as soon \n     as she could afford subsidized housing in another part of the \n     city, vowing never to raise her children in a place like \n     Lafayette Towers.\n       But when she visited Pleasant View shortly after its \n     construction, she decided to return to her old neighborhood \n     with her children, Jerod, 13, and Lakeisha, 11.\n       ``It's much safer,'' she said. ``I don't mind my kids \n     playing outside in the evening.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6886-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VERMONT COUNCIL ON THE HUMANITIES\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize \nthe Vermont Council on the Humanities on the occasion of its 25th \nanniversary.\n  In 1965, Congress created the National Endowment for the Humanities \n(NEH) with the goal of promoting and supporting research, education, \nand public programs in the humanities. The mission of the NEH was to \nmake the worlds of history, language, literature and philosophy a part \nof the lives of more Americans. Over the past three decades, the NEH \nhas lived up to its founding mission and has made the humanities more \naccessible. As Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee, which has jurisdiction over the agency, I have been \nextraordinarily proud to support NEH during my years in Congress.\n  NEH brings the humanities to our lives in many unique and exciting \nways. NEH makes grants for preserving historic resources like books, \npresidential papers, and newspapers. It provides support for \ninterpretive exhibitions, television and radio programs. The agency \nfacilitates basic research and scholarship in the humanities. And NEH \nstrengthens teacher education in the humanities through its summer \ninstitutes and seminars. Yet, in my view, one of the most important \nways that NEH broadens our understanding of the humanities is through \nthe support it provides for state humanities councils. These state \nhumanities councils, at the grassroots level, encourage participation \nin locally initiated humanities projects. Every state has one, but few \nare as innovative, creative and self-sufficient as the Vermont Council \non the Humanities.\n  Early on, the Vermont Council on the Humanities determined that the \nfirst step in engaging Vermonters in the humanities was to ensure that \nall Vermonters were able to read. The Vermont Humanities Council met \nthis challenge head on and provided support for reading programs and \nbook discussions targeted at people of all levels of literacy--from the \nConnections programs which serve adult new readers to the scholar-led \ndiscussions held in public libraries. In 1996, the Council initiated \nthe Creating Communities of Readers program. Five Vermont communities \nreceived grants to help them achieve full literacy for their \ncommunities. This undertaking of ``creating a state in which every \nindividual reads, participates in public affairs and continues to learn \nthroughout life,'' involves an enormous commitment. Yet, undaunted by \nthe enormity of the challenge, the Vermont Humanities Council stepped \nto the plate and hit a home run.\n  Vermont has taken quite literally the mission of bringing the \nhumanities to everyone and, in doing so, the Vermont Council has \ndistinguished itself as a national leader in promoting reading as a \npath towards participation in the humanities. Recently, the Vermont \nCouncil received a national award of $250,000 from the NEH to implement \nhumanities based book discussions for adult new readers nationwide. \nThrough this national Connections program, 14,000 children's books will \nbecome part of the home libraries of adults who are learning to read.\n  There is much we can gain from studying the humanities. The small \namount of money that the federal government spends on NEH goes a long \nway toward building a national community. Coming together to learn from \nliterature, learn from our past, and learn from each other is, in my \nview, an extraordinarily valuable use of our public dollars.\n  Twenty-five years ago, the Vermont Humanities Council chose the road \nless traveled, and that has made all the difference in Vermont and in \nthe nation. The Council, with its focus on literacy, chose to \nexperiment by developing new and different ways of bringing the \nhumanities to all Vermonters. By choosing to move to the beat of its \nown drum, the Vermont Humanities Council has become a unique and \nindependent actor promoting the importance of literacy as a means of \npursuing the humanities.\n  In honor of this twenty-fifth anniversary, I offer my sincere \ncongratulations to the Vermont Council on the Humanities for a job well \ndone. I would also like to offer a special note of gratitude to Victor \nSwenson and the Council's extraordinary Board of Directors. Victor's \nleadership and the commitment of the Board has made our Council a \nshining example of excellence. Keep up the good work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6886-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6886-S6887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE VETERANS OF FOREIGN WARS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we enter the twilight of the \nTwentieth Century, we can look back at the immense multitude of \nachievements that led to the ascension of the United States of America \nas the preeminent nation in modern history. We owe this title as \nworld's greatest superpower in large part to the twenty-five million \nmen and women who served in our armed services and who defended the \nprinciples and ideals of our nation.\n  Before we embark upon the Twenty-First Century, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars (VFW) will celebrate an historic milestone. On September \n29, the VFW will celebrate the 100th anniversary of the organization's \nfounding. For over one hundred years, the VFW has supported our armed \nforces from the battlefields to the home front. From letter-writing \ncampaigns in WWI to ``welcome home'' rallies after the Persian Gulf War \nto care packages sent to Bosnia, the VFW continues to take pride in \nsupporting American troops overseas.\n  The VFW's support for our nation's armed forces has been exemplary \nover the last one hundred years, but it is the VFW's work with our \nnation's veterans that has been most impressive. The original intention \nof the VFW, in fact, was to ensure that the veterans of the Spanish-\nAmerican war would not be forgotten and that they received medical care \nand support in return for their service and sacrifice. The VFW's motto, \n``Honor The Dead By Honoring The Living'', resonates to this day and \nwill carry forth into the next century. Since organizing the first \nnational veterans service office in 1919, to today's nationwide network \nof service offices, the VFW provides the assistance veterans need in \norder to obtain much-deserved benefits.\n  To celebrate this prestigious occasion, a resolution, S. J. \nResolution 21, has been introduced in the United States Senate \ndesignating September 29, 1999 as ``Veterans of Foreign Wars of the \nUnited States Day'', and the President of the United States is \nauthorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon all \nGovernment agencies and the people of the United States to observe the \nday with appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities. I am a proud \ncosponsor of this resolution which honors the VFW's recognition of \nmilitary service and remembrance of the sacrifices made in our nation's \ndefense. I feel this resolution presents an opportunity to recognize, \nhonor, and pay tribute to the more than 2,000,000 veterans of the armed \nforces represented by the VFW, and to all the individuals who have \nserved in the armed forces\n  Throughout my service in Congress, I have long appreciated the \nleadership of both the South Dakota VFW and the Ladies Auxiliary for \ntheir input on a variety of issues impacting veterans and their \nfamilies in recent years. Their insight and efforts have proven very \nvaluable to me and my staff, and I commend each and every one of them \nfor their leadership on issues of importance to all veterans of the \narmed forces. I was honored to have the\n\n[[Page S6887]]\n\nVFW's strong support when I offered my amendment to increase veterans \nhealth care in this year's budget to $3 billion. Even though it wasn't \nthe full amount of my amendment, the final Budget Resolution contained \na $1.7 billion increase above what the Clinton Administration had \nrequested for veterans health care. This never would have been possible \nwithout the grassroots support of the VFW.\n  Mr. President, as Americans, we should never forget the men and women \nwho served our nation with such dedication and patriotism. I close my \nremarks by offering my gratitude and support for all the achievements \nperformed by the Veterans of Foreign Wars. For a century, this \norganization has been the standard bearer in the representation of our \nveterans, as well as their undying patronage to our armed forces and \nsupport for the maintenance of a strong national defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6887-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO ANTONIO J.

(Tony) Palumbo, a coal miner from Western Pennsylvania who humbly \nrepresents the generous spirit of community.\n  President and owner of the New Shawmut Mining company, Mr. Palumbo \nwas born in Pennsylvania on June 14, 1906 and actively serves as a \nTrustee for La Roche College, Duquesne University, Carlow College, \nGannon College, the Villa Nazareth School in Rome, Italy, and the Mayo \nClinic Foundation for Medical Education and Research. He has also \ndeveloped unique relationships with the Catholic Diocese of Erie, Elk \nCounty Christian High School, the Nicaraguan-American Nursing \nCollaboration, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Holy Family \nInstitute and the Boy Scouts of St. Marys, PA.\n  Throughout his years of involvement at these institutions, Mr. \nPalumbo has gained the admiration and respect of the many students that \nhe has come in contact with. His influence in their lives will be felt \nfor many years to come.\n  Mr. Palumbo was recently presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award \nby the National Society of Fund Raising Executives. His efforts have \nhelped build educational and health care facilities, endow research, \nprovide scholarships, deliver care to the poor and support community \ninitiatives. As varied as each of these causes are, they all reflect \nTony Palumbo's compassion for the needs of others and his commitment to \nusing his time and talents to enrich the lives of those around him.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join with me in commending Tony \nPalumbo for the leadership and compassion that he has portrayed, as \nwell as the platform that he has created for motivating the stewardship \nof others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6887-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6887-S6888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOREIGN SERVICE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on May 24, 1924, President Calvin \nCoolidge signed into law the Rogers Act, establishing a unified corps \nof career diplomats to represent the United States abroad. Based on the \nprinciples of professionalism, non-partisanship and merit-based \npromotion, thus was born the modern foreign service.\n  This year we join in commemorating the 75th anniversary of the \nforeign service. Over the years there have been many changes: it has \nbecome more diverse, more specialized, and has been called to deal with \nan ever-expanding list of issues. While this milestone is an occasion \nfor celebration and congratulations, there are some sobering reminders \nof the task that still awaits us. 1998 saw the worst attack on American \ndiplomats in history, with two tragic bombings that resulted in the \ndeaths of over 220 persons, twelve of them Americans. Here in \nWashington, we continue to contend with budget cuts that handicap the \nability of our foreign service officers to perform their duties safely \nand effectively.\n  On the occasion of this anniversary, Secretary Albright hosted a \ndinner at the State Department as a tribute to the efforts of the brave \nmen and women who have served over the past three-quarters of a \ncentury. In her speech, she challenged the unfortunate and inaccurate \nstereotypes of the foreign service and emphasized the urgency of \nproviding adequate resources to promote U.S. interests abroad. I \nstrongly agree with the thrust of her remarks, and I ask that the full \ntext of her statement be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n Remarks by Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, 75th Anniversary \n       Dinner of the United States Foreign Service, May 24, 1999\n\n       Secretary Albright: It is indeed a pleasure to be able to \n     first congratulate Nicholas (Bombay) for winning the essay \n     contest. It's never too early in life to learn the value of \n     strong diplomatic leadership, and although I didn't meet you \n     until tonight, I already like the sound of the name Bombay \n     preceded by the term ``Ambassador'' or ``Secretary of \n     State.'' (Laughter.)\n       Congratulations, once again.\n       Thank you, Cokie, and good evening to all of you. It's a \n     great pleasure to be able to spend the evening here with you, \n     and I must say that a special pleasure for me to have had \n     George Kennan on my right and Paul Sarbanes on my left--can't \n     ask for much more. It has been a great evening to be able to \n     exchange views.\n       Members of Congress and distinguished colleagues and \n     friends, and so many of you who have contributed to the rich \n     legacy of the modern US Foreign Service, as we mark our 75th \n     anniversary, I want to begin by thanking Under Secretary \n     Pickering for his remarks. There is really no better \n     advertisement for what can be achieved in the Foreign Service \n     than the career of Tom Pickering. From 1959 to 1999, as Cokie \n     explained, he has served everywhere and done everything; and \n     he's still doing it. Tom, the Foreign Service doesn't have a \n     Hall of Fame, but it should, and you and others here tonight \n     belong in it.\n       I also want to congratulate Ambassador Brandon Grove and \n     Dan Geisler and Louise Eaton and our Director General, Skip \n     Gnehm, our generous sponsors and everyone who helped to \n     organize this magnificent event. It was a big job and \n     everybody's done it terrifically well.\n       I especially endorse the conception of this anniversary as \n     a challenge to look forward. Your goal of outreach through \n     this essay contest and other initiatives is right on target, \n     for if we are to match or surpass the accomplishments of \n     the past 75 years, we must have the understanding and \n     support of the American people. This requires that we tell \n     the story of U.S. diplomacy clearly and well. It is to \n     that purpose that I will attempt a modest contribution in \n     my remarks here tonight.\n       Thank God I don't have to win any contests. [Laughter.]\n       I start with a simple request. Let us take the old, but \n     persistent, stereotype of the diplomat as dilettante and do \n     to it what one Presidential candidate wanted us to do to the \n     tax code: let us drive a stake through it, kill it, bury it \n     and make sure that it never rises again.\n       The job of the Foreign Service today is done with hands on \n     and sleeves rolled up. It is rarely glamorous, often \n     dangerous and always vital.\n       In my travels, I have seen our people at work not only in \n     conference rooms, but in visits to refugee camps, AIDS \n     clinics and mass grave sites. I have seen them share their \n     knowledge and enthusiasm for democracy with those striving to \n     build a better life in larger freedom.\n       I have seen them and their families give freely of their \n     energy and time to comfort the ill and aid the impoverished. \n     I have seen them provide incredible administrative support \n     despite antiquated equipment, crowded workspace and \n     impossible time constraints. And I've stood with head bowed \n     at memorial services for heroes struck down while \n     representing America or helping others to achieve peace. In \n     the past 35 years, the number of names listed on the AFSA \n     plaque has grown from 77 to 186. And the memory of those most \n     recently inscribed, as Tom Pickering's toast reflected, is \n     fresh and painful in our hearts.\n       So let us not be shy about proclaiming this truth. In a \n     turbulent and perilous world, the men and women of the \n     Foreign Service are on the front lines every day, on every \n     continent for us. Like the men and women of our armed \n     forces--no more, but no less--they deserve, for they have \n     earned, the gratitude and full backing of the American \n     people.\n       Now, having impaled that stereotype, let's proceed to the \n     second challenge. Let us make clear to our citizens the \n     connection between what we do and the quality of life they \n     enjoy; let us demonstrate that there's nothing foreign about \n     foreign policy any more.\n       Consult any poll, visit any community hall, listen to any \n     radio talk show; it's no secret what Americans care about, \n     fear and hope for the most. Certainly, foreign policy isn't \n     everything. We cannot tell any American that our diplomacy \n     will guarantee safe schools, clean up the Internet or pay for \n     long term health care.\n       But we can say to every American that foreign policy may \n     well help you to land a good job; protect your environment; \n     safeguard your neighborhood from drugs; shield your family \n     from a terrorist attack; and spare your children the \n     nightmare of nuclear, chemical or biological war.\n       Our Foreign Service, Foreign Service National and Civil \n     Service personnel contribute every day to America through the \n     dangers they help contain, the crimes they help prevent, the \n     deals they help close, the rights\n\n[[Page S6888]]\n\n     they help ensure and the travelers they just plain help. \n     Right, Cokie?\n       There is much more we could say and 100 different ways to \n     say it, but the bottom line is clear. The success or failure \n     of U.S. foreign policy will be a major factor in the lives of \n     all Americans. It will make the difference between a 21st \n     Century characterized by peace, rising prosperity and law, \n     and a more uncertain future in which our economy and security \n     are always at risk; our values always under attack; and our \n     peace of mind never assured.\n       To convince the public of this, we must erase another myth, \n     which is that technology and the end of the Cold War have \n     made diplomacy obsolete.\n       Some argue that Americans concluded after Vietnam that \n     there was nothing we could do in the world; after the Berlin \n     Wall fell, that there was nothing we could not do; and after \n     the Gulf War, that there was nothing left to do. Others \n     suggest that whatever we want to do, there is no need to be \n     diplomatic about it. Our military is the best, our economy \n     the biggest; so what's left to negotiate?\n       But as Walter Lippmann once wrote, ``Without diplomacy to \n     prepare the way, soften the impact, reduce the friction and \n     allay the tension, money and military power are double-edged \n     instruments. Used without diplomacy, they may, and usually \n     do, augment the difficulties they are employed to overcome. \n     Then more power and money are needed.'' So spake Walter \n     Lippmann.\n       The United States emerged from the Cold War with unequaled \n     might. On every continent, when problems arise, countries \n     turn to us. Few major international initiatives can succeed \n     without our support.\n       But with these truths comes a paradox: In this new global \n     era, there are few goals vital to America that we can achieve \n     through our actions alone. In most situations, for most \n     purposes, we need the cooperation of others; and diplomacy is \n     about understanding others and explaining ourselves. It is \n     about building and nourishing partnerships for common action \n     toward shared goals. It's about listening and persuading, \n     analyzing and moving in at the right time. And certainly, at \n     this time, there is no shortage of important diplomatic work \n     to be done.\n       As I speak, we are using diplomacy in support of force to \n     bring the confrontation in Kosovo to an end on NATO's terms. \n     We are launching a strategy for drawing the entire Balkans \n     region into the mainstream of a democratic Europe. We are \n     preparing for a new push on all tracks of the Middle East \n     peace process. We have a high-level team in Pyongyang to \n     explore options for enhancing stability on the Korean \n     Peninsula. And we're working hard to help democracy take a \n     firmer hold in capitals such as Jakarta and Lagos, Bogota \n     and Phnom Penh.\n       Around Africa, we are supporting African efforts to end \n     conflicts and promote new opportunities for growth. And \n     around the world, we are striving to prevent the spread of \n     advanced technologies, so that the new century does not end \n     up even bloodier than the old one.\n       Certainly, the diplomatic pace has quickened since 1924, \n     when the Rogers Act was signed, Calvin Coolidge was \n     President, the State Department's entire budget was $2 \n     million and the Secretary of State had a beard. (Laughter.)\n       In that time, the door of the Foreign Service has opened \n     further to minorities and women, although not far and fast \n     enough. America's overseas presence has grown several fold, \n     as has the demand for our consular services. Public diplomacy \n     has become an integral part of our work. And we've learned \n     that, merely to keep pace, we must constantly manage smarter, \n     recruit better, adjust quicker and look ahead further.\n       That is why we are modernizing our technology, training in \n     21st Century skills and implementing a historic restructure \n     of our foreign policy institutions. And it's why we know that \n     the Foreign Service of 75 years from now--or even ten years \n     from now--will look far different than the Foreign Service of \n     today.\n       What has not and will not change are the fundamentals: the \n     professionalism; the pride; the patriotism; the tradition of \n     excellence reflected here tonight by the wondrous George \n     Kennan and other giants of the Foreign Service. And what has \n     not changed, as well, is the need for resources.\n       The problem of finding adequate resources for American \n     foreign policy has been with us ever since the Continental \n     Congress sent Ben Franklin to Paris. But it has reached a new \n     stage.\n       Today, we allocate less than one-tenth of the portion of \n     our wealth that we did a generation ago to support democracy \n     and growth overseas. In this respect, we rank dead last among \n     industrialized nations.\n       For years, we have been cutting positions, shutting AID \n     missions and eliminating USIS posts. And now, under the year \n     2000 budget allocations that Congress is considering, we may \n     be asked to go beyond absorbing cuts to the guillotine.\n       We face overall reductions of 14 percent to 29 percent from \n     the President's foreign operations request and 20 percent for \n     State Department operations and programs. Yes, members of \n     Congress, this is a commercial. This will undermine our \n     efforts to protect our borders, help Americans overseas and \n     make urgently needed improvements in embassy security. And \n     it could translate into cuts of 50 percent or more in key \n     programs from fighting drugs to promoting democracy to \n     helping UNICEF.\n       Now, I'm not here to assign blame. We have gotten \n     bipartisan support from those in Congress--including those \n     with us tonight--who know the most about foreign policy. And \n     Congress did approve the President's request for supplemental \n     funds for Central America, Jordan and the Balkans.\n       But this is madness. America is the world's wealthiest and \n     most powerful country. Our economy is the envy of the globe. \n     We have important interests, face threats to them, and nearly \n     everywhere.\n       And I hope you agree. Military readiness is vital, but so \n     is diplomatic effectiveness. When negotiations break down, we \n     don't send our soldiers without weapons to fight. Why, then, \n     do we so often send our diplomats to negotiate without the \n     leverage that resources provide? The savings yielded by \n     successful diplomacy are incalculable. So are the costs of \n     failed diplomacy--not only in hard cash, but in human lives.\n       Tonight, I say to all our friends on Capitol Hill, act in \n     the spirit of Arthur Vandenberg and Everett Dirksen and Scoop \n     Jackson and Ed Muskie: help us to help America. Provide us \n     the funds we need to protect our people and to do our jobs. \n     Let America lead!\n       As we look around this room, we see depictions of liberty's \n     birth and America's transformation from wilderness to \n     greatness.\n       From the adjoining balcony, we can see the memorials to \n     Lincoln and Jefferson, the Washington Monument, the Roosevelt \n     Bridge, the white stone markets of Arlington and the silent, \n     etched, cloquent black wall of the Vietnam Wall.\n       It is said there is nothing that time does not conquer. But \n     the principles celebrated here have neither withered nor \n     worn. Through Depression and war, controversy and conflict, \n     they continue to unite and inspire us and to identify America \n     to the world.\n       From the Treaty of Paris to the round-the-clock \n     deliberations of our own era, the story of US diplomacy is \n     the story of a unique and free society emerging from \n     isolation to cross vast oceans and to assume its rightful \n     role on the world stage. It is the story of America first \n     learning, then accepting and then acting on its \n     responsibility.\n       Above all, it is the story of individuals, from Franklin \n     onwards, who answered the call of their country and who have \n     given their life and labor in service to its citizens.\n       As Secretary of State, the greatest privilege I have had \n     has been to work with you, the members of the Foreign Service \n     and others on America's team.\n       Together, tonight, let us vow to continue to do our jobs to \n     the absolute best of our abilities, and to tell our stories \n     in language and at a volume all can understand.\n       By so doing, we will keep faith with those who came before \n     us, and we will preserve the legacy of liberty that was our \n     most precious inheritance and must become our untarnished \n     bequest.\n       To the men and women of the Foreign Service who are here \n     this evening or at outposts around the world or enjoying \n     their retirement, I wish you a happy 75th anniversary; and I \n     pledge my best efforts for as long as I have breath, to see \n     that you get the support and respect you deserve.\n       Thank you and happy birthday.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \npay tribute to two distinguished Pennsylvanians, Leonard and Madlyn \nAbramson, upon the establishment of the Abramson Family Cancer Research \nInstitute at the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center. The $100 \nmillion commitment from The Abramson Family Foundation--the largest \nsingle contribution for cancer research to a National Cancer Institute-\ndesignated comprehensive cancer center--supports the unprecedented \nexpansion of cancer research, education and patient care at Penn's \nCancer Center.\n  The Abramson Family Foundation is a trust fund directed by Leonard \nand Madlyn Abramson. Mr. Abramson is the founder and former chairman \nand CEO of U.S. Healthcare, Inc. Best known for his accurate \npredictions in the changing world of health care over the past two \ndecades, Mr. Abramson believed in HMOs as the best health care \nalternative in the early 1970s. He went on to build one of the nation's \nlargest and most successful managed care organizations before selling \nit to Aetna in 1996. Madlyn Abramson is a trustee of the University of \nPennsylvania, as well as a member of the Health System's Board of \nTrustees and the Graduate School of Education's Board of Overseers.\n  The Abramsons have been supporters of cancer research, as well as \nnumerous other causes, for more than a decade. The family's long and \ngenerous history with the University of Pennsylvania Health System \nincludes gifts to endow two professorships and a multi-year grant \nthrough the former U.S.\n\n[[Page S6889]]\n\nHealthcare to the Cancer Center's Bone Marrow Transplant Program.\n  The Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute has created a \nrevolutionary framework for facilitating innovation in cancer research, \nenabling the Penn Cancer Center to bring together the best scientists, \nphysicians, and staff and to develop new approaches in an effort to \nmake current treatments for cancer obsolete. John H. Glick, M.D., the \nLeonard and Madlyn Abramson Professor of Clinical Oncology and Director \nof Penn's Cancer Center for more than a decade, serves as Director and \nPresident of the Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute.\n  The gift of The Abramson Family Foundation will significantly \nincrease our opportunities to break new ground in the war on cancer--\nespecially in the areas of cancer genetics and molecular diagnosis, \nfrom which future research and patient care advances will occur.\n  The Institute supports leading-edge cancer research through the \nrecruitment of outstanding scientists and physicians from around the \nworld and the design of innovative patient care paradigms. The Abramson \npledge propels the University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center--already \none of the nation's top cancer centers--to the next level of research \nand patient-focused care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6889-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NEW BUDGET MATH\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to recommend an article \nthat appeared this week on National Journal's website. It is ``More New \nBudget Math'' by Stan Collender and discusses in a very readable way \nwhy gross federal debt continues to rise even when the government is \nrunning a surplus. The concepts of deficit, surplus, debt, and trust \nfunds lie at the heart of many of our fiercest budget battles, and \neveryone has an opinion, or a one-liner, about all of them. But these \nconcepts are as technical and difficult to understand as they are \ncontroversial, and I always appreciate it when they are explained in a \nclear manner, as they are in this article.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the article ``More New Budget Math'' be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The article follows.\n\n         [From the National Journal's Cloakroom, June 8, 1999]\n\n                  Budget Battles--More New Budget Math\n\n                          (By Stan Collender)\n\n       This column pointed out a year ago (June 2, 1998) that, in \n     light of the surplus, the old mathematics of the federal \n     budget were no longer adequate to explain what was happening. \n     A variety of new calculations would have to become as \n     commonplace as the old measures to move the debate along. Now \n     we have yet another example.\n       One of the questions I get most these days is, how is it \n     possible for total federal debt to be increasing if there is \n     a surplus? That inevitably leads to someone insisting that \n     there really isn't a surplus at all, and that all the talk \n     about it coming from Washington is just an accounting trick \n     or an X-Files-style government conspiracy.\n       Here, however, is the new math to explain things:\n       A federal surplus or deficit is the amount of revenues the \n     government collects compared to the amount it spends during a \n     fiscal year. Whenever spending exceeds revenues the \n     government runs a deficit, and has to find a way to make up \n     the difference. It can sell assets (like gold from Fort Knox, \n     timber from national forests or an aircraft carrier) or \n     borrow from financial markets to raise the cash it needs to \n     cover a shortfall.\n       But the revenues vs. spending calculation is not as \n     straightforward as it seems. Because of rules enacted in 1990 \n     as part of the Budget Enforcement Act, the federal budget \n     does not show the actual amount of cash the government uses \n     to make loans (i.e., to students or to farmers). Instead, the \n     budget shows only the amount needed to cover the net costs to \n     the government of lending that money.\n       But because the government lends real money rather than \n     this calculation, its actual cash needs are greater than what \n     is in the budget. This is not an insignificant amount. OMB is \n     projecting that the fiscal 1999 net cash requirements for \n     all federal direct loans will be $25 billion, which must \n     be financed either by reducing the surplus or, when there \n     is a deficit, by additional federal borrowing. As a \n     result, the actual surplus is a bit lower, and the amount \n     available to reduce debt is lower than is immediately \n     apparent.\n       Then there are the loans made to the government. When ever \n     it borrows to finance a deficit, the government incurs debt. \n     Conversely, whenever it runs a surplus, debt is reduced. As \n     might be expected given the surpluses that are projected over \n     the next 10 years, this debt, formally known as ``debt held \n     by the public,'' was projected in January by the \n     Congressional Budget Office to fall from its current level of \n     about $3.6 trillion to $1.2 trillion by the end of fiscal \n     2009.\n       However, financing the deficit is not the only reason the \n     federal government borrows. Whenever any federal trust fund \n     takes in more than it spends in a particular year, that \n     surplus must be invested in federal government securities. In \n     effect, a trust fund's surplus is lent to the government, so \n     federal debt increases.\n       CBO's January forecast showed this separate category of \n     debt--``debt held by the government''--increasing from almost \n     $2.0 trillion in fiscal 1999 to $4.4 trillion by the end of \n     2009.\n       The combination of debt held by the public and debt held by \n     the government--``gross federal debt''--is increasing, \n     according to CBO, from $5.57 trillion in 1999 to $5.67 \n     trillion in 2000 and $5.84 trillion in 2005.\n       The bottom line, therefore, is that the measurement of what \n     the government borrows to finance its debt is projected to \n     decline because of the surplus. However, overall federal debt \n     will be increasing because of the growing surpluses in the \n     Social Security and other federal trust funds.\n       This shows that the situation is neither the budget \n     sophistry nor government conspiracy that some talk show hosts \n     and conservative columnists often make it out to be. It is \n     also hardly unique. Try to imagine the following situation:\n       Your personal budget is not just in balance, but you are \n     actually running a small surplus each month. Because of that, \n     you are also slowly paying down your credit cards.\n       The next month, you buy a bigger and more expensive home. \n     Because of lower interest rates and other financing options, \n     your monthly payments actually go down from their current \n     levels so your surplus goes up. As a result, you increase the \n     payments you make each month on your credit cards, so that \n     portion or your debt decreases faster.\n       However, the bigger and more expensive house you just \n     bought increases the overall amount you have borrowed by, \n     say, $200,000. Your budget is still in surplus, and some \n     of your debt is decreasing, but your overall debt is \n     actually growing substantially.\n       This is roughly the same situation now facing the federal \n     government, given the new budget math of the surplus.\n       One more thought: The debt ceiling was raised in the 1997 \n     budget deal to accommodate the deficits that had been \n     projected to require additional federal borrowing through \n     fiscal 2002. But if the limit had not been raised that high \n     in 1997, this new budget math could have meant that Congress \n     would be in the anomalous, ironic, and certainly frustrating \n     situation of having to pass an increase in the debt ceiling \n     at the same time the budget was in surplus. Try to imagine \n     explaining that to constituents.\n       Budget Battles Fiscal Y2K Countdown; As of today there are \n     54 days potential legislative days left before the start of \n     fiscal 2000. If Mondays and Fridays, when Congress does not \n     typically conduct legislative business are excluded, there \n     are only 33 legislative days left before the start of the \n     fiscal year.\n       The House and Senate have not yet passed even their own \n     versions of any of the regular fiscal 2000 appropriations \n     bills, much less sent legislation on to the president.\n       Question Of The Week; Last Week's Question. The statutory \n     deadline for reconciliation is established by Section 300 of \n     the Congressional Budget Act, which shows that Congress is \n     required to complete action by June 15 each year. This year's \n     congressional budget resolution conference report established \n     the deadline as July 16 for the House Ways and Means \n     Committee and July 23 for the Senate Finance Committee to \n     report their proposed changes to their respective houses. \n     But, as a concurrent resolution, the budget resolution did \n     not amend the Congressional Budget Act so the dates are not \n     statutory requirements.\n       Congratulations and an ``I Won A Budget Battle'' T-shirt to \n     Stephanie Giesecke, director for budget and appropriations of \n     the National Association of Independent Colleges and \n     Universities, who was selected at random from the many \n     correct answers.\n       This Week's Question.

(a) Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Congress recognizes and supports, as being fundamental \n     to the national defense, the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     test weapons and weapon systems thoroughly, and to train \n     members of the Armed Forces in the use of weapons and weapon \n     systems before the forces enter hostile military engagements.\n       (2) It is the policy of the United States that the Armed \n     Forces at all times exercise the utmost degree of caution in \n     the training with weapons and weapon systems in order to \n     avoid endangering civilian populations and the environment.\n       (3) In the adherence to these policies, it is essential to \n     the public safety that the Armed Forces not test weapons or \n     weapon systems, or engage in training exercises with live \n     ammunition, in close proximity to civilian populations unless \n     there is no reasonable alternative available.\n       (b) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) there should be a thorough investigation of the \n     circumstances that led to the accidental death of a civilian \n     employee of the Navy installation in Vieques, Puerto Rico, \n     and the wounding of four other civilians during a live-\n     ammunition weapons test at Vieques, including a reexamination \n     of the adequacy of the measures that are in place to protect \n     the civilian population during such training;\n       (2) the Secretary of Defense should not authorize the Navy \n     to resume live ammunition training on the Island of Vieques, \n     Puerto Rico, unless and until he has advised the \n     congressional defense committees of the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives that--\n       (A) there is not available an alternative training site \n     with no civilian population located in close proximity;\n       (B) the national security of the United States requires \n     that the training be carried out;\n       (C) measures to provide the utmost level of safety to the \n     civilian population are to be in place and maintained \n     throughout the training; and\n       (D) training with ammunition containing radioactive \n     materials that could cause environmental degradation should \n     not be authorized;\n       (3) in addition to advising committees of Congress of the \n     findings as described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of \n     Defense should advise the Governor of Puerto Rico of those \n     findings and, if the Secretary of Defense decides to resume \n     live-ammunition weapons training on the Island of Vieques, \n     consult with the Governor on a regular basis regarding the \n     measures being taken from time to time to protect civilians \n     from harm from the training.\n       Sec. 8153.

For purposes of \n     this subsection, an article or technology that is not \n     primarily used for missile development or nuclear weapons \n     programs.\n       (c) National Security Interests Waiver of Sanctions.--\n       (1) In general.--The restriction on assistance in section \n     102(b)(2)(B), (C), or (G) of the Arms Export Control Act \n     shall not apply if the President determines, and so certifies \n     to Congress, that the application of the restriction would \n     not be in the national security interests of the United \n     States.\n       (2) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (A) no waiver under paragraph (1) should be invoked for \n     section 102(b)(2)(B) or (C) of the Arms Export Control Act \n     with respect to any party that initiates or supports \n     activities that jeopardize peace and security in Jammu and \n     Kashmir;\n       (B) the broad application of export controls to nearly 300 \n     Indian and Pakistani entities is inconsistent with the \n     specific national security interests of the United States and \n     that this control list requires refinement; and\n       (C) export controls should be applied only to those Indian \n     and Pakistani entities that make direct and material \n     contributions to weapons of mass destruction and missile \n     programs and only to those items that can contribute such \n     programs.\n       (d) Reporting Requirement.--Not later than 60 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act, the President shall submit \n     a report to the appropriate congressional committees listing \n     those Indian and Pakistani entities whose activities \n     contribute directly and materially to missile programs or \n     weapons of mass destruction programs.\n       (e) Congressional Notification.--A license for the export \n     of a defense article, defense service, or technology is \n     subject to the same requirements as are applicable to the \n     export of items described in section 36(c) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2776(c)), including the transmittal of \n     information and the application of congressional review \n     procedures described in that section.\n       (f) Renewal of Suspension.--Upon the expiration of the \n     initial five-year period of suspension of the sanctions \n     contained in paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a), the \n     President may renew the suspension with respect to India, \n     Pakistan, or both for additional periods of five years each \n     if, not less than 30 days prior to each renewal of \n     suspension, the President certifies to the appropriate \n     congressional committees that it is in the national interest \n     of the United States to do so.\n       (g) Restriction.--The authority of subsection (a) may not \n     be used to provide assistance under chapter 4 of part II of \n     the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2346 et seq.; \n     relating to economic support fund assistance) except for--\n       (1) assistance that supports the activities of \n     nongovernmental organizations;\n       (2) assistance that supports democracy or the establishment \n     of democratic institutions; or\n       (3) humanitarian assistance.\n       (h) Statutory Construction.--Nothing in this Act prohibits \n     the imposition of sanctions by the President under any \n     provision of law specified in subsection (a) or (b) by reason \n     of any grounds for the imposition of sanctions under that \n     provision of law arising on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       Sec. 10002.

Mr. President, it is common for Members of the Senate to \nthank members of their staff, particularly after handling an important \npiece of legislation. I am sure our constituents realize much of what \nwe do is in reliance on very capable members of our staff. I have never \ntaken the opportunity to talk about a member of my staff before, but on \nthis occasion I wish to do so very briefly, because tomorrow a member \nof my staff is leaving to go on to another wonderful opportunity. I \nthink it is important to recognize her as someone who embodies really \nthe qualifications and the qualities of staff that all of us would like \nto have work with us and represent our constituents' interests.\n  Her name is Jeanine Esperne. She began working with me about a dozen \nyears ago when I was a Member of the House of Representatives and \nserved on the House Armed Services Committee. She became my chief \nlegislative assistant on defense matters. She came from the office of \nGeneral Abramson, who at the time was head of the Strategic Defense \nInitiative Organization at the Pentagon, with rich experience in \ndefense and national security matters.\n  She worked with me as staff person on my Defense Armed Services \nCommittee matters throughout my career in the House. Then, when I came \nto the Senate, she remained on my staff responsible for all foreign \npolicy and national security matters.\n  That was important, because I began serving immediately on the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence in an active capacity and had a \nsignificant need for someone of her qualifications and experience.\n  In addition to that, I chaired the Subcommittee on Technology, \nTerrorism, and Government Information of the Judiciary Committee, again \nrequiring someone with her expertise to assist me in those matters.\n  Throughout her tenure on my staff, she has worked with Arizona \ncompanies and interests that have important defense-related concerns \nand with other people around the country who share a strong desire that \nwe have a strong national defense, including contractors and other \nindividuals with a direct interest in the government process.\n  During this time, the feedback I received from both my own \nconstituents and others around the country was uniformly in praise of \nJeanine Esperne for her willingness to listen, her professionalism, the \nfact she used time very economically. She didn't waste time; she \nunderstood that time was important to everyone. She got her job done\n\n[[Page S6912]]\n\nvery quickly with a minimum of excess effort, almost always satisfying \nthe interests of the constituent or the person with whom we were trying \nto work.\n  It is with mixed emotions that today I pay tribute to Jeanine Esperne \non her next to last day on my staff as she moves on to another \nopportunity. I do so not only because she has worked for me in a way \nwhich exemplifies the way most Members would have their staffs work \nwith them, but I think it is important for our constituency to know \nthat we have very fine staff in the Congress, that our work could not \nbe done without that staff, and that when we take the opportunity to \npraise the staff, it is really to praise their exceptional abilities \nand the way in which they have served our constituents.\n  In the case of Jeanine Esperne, I certainly express all of those \nsentiments, wish her very well in her new endeavors, and certainly \nsuggest that occasionally those Members who are so busy doing jobs here \ntake the time more often to thank those staff who, after all, are \nresponsible for so much of our success.\n  Jeanine Esperne, good wishes and thank you for all of your services \non behalf of the U.S. Government, and on my behalf specifically.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6912-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the agreement signed yesterday between \nNATO and Yugoslavia is hopeful news as we move toward our goals of \nending the atrocities and genocide in Kosovo and bolstering stability \nin southeastern Europe. The vote by the UN Security Council today \nauthorizing an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo is yet \nanother hopeful sign.\n  This agreement is a victory for freedom. It is a defeat for dictators \naround the world. NATO's resolve to halt and redress Milosevic's crimes \nagainst humanity sends an important message to world leaders who engage \nin ethnic cleansing and other atrocities. NATO's victory over Yugoslav \naggression also sends a positive signal to the forces of democracy in \nthe region.\n  President Clinton deserves immense credit for his leadership \nthroughout this 11-week military operation. When so many said it was \nimpossible, he kept a 19-member NATO alliance intact. When so many said \nit would never work, he stuck to the air campaign that led that NATO \nalliance to victory.\n  The President never wavered in his commitment to the alliance's goals \nof ending the atrocities in Kosovo, forcing the withdrawal of Serb \nforces from the region, and ensuring the safe return of Kosovar \nrefugees to their homes. President Clinton's steadfast resolve, \ntogether with our NATO allies, forced President Milosevic to back down \nand accept NATO's conditions for a halt in the bombing campaign.\n  It would appear that some of those who were most critical of the \nPresident's Kosovo policies were more concerned with waging a political \nassault than in stopping the Serbs' military assault on Kosovo. But now \nthat the Serbs have conceded defeat, one can only hope that those who \nwere so harshly critical of the President might concede they were \nmistaken.\n  Our NATO allies also deserve great credit and much gratitude. They \nunderstood the long-term implications of failing to address the \nYugoslav threat to Kosovo and to regional stability. They met the \nchallenge head-on and showed that NATO remains the most formidable \nmilitary alliance in the world.\n  And the front-line states--Albania, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and \nRomania--were forced to experience firsthand the consequences of \nMilosevic's ethnic cleansing. They, and the Republic of Montenegro, \nshould be commended for accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees and \nenduring the instability caused by the actions of the Yugoslav \ngovernment.\n  Of course, those truly on the front lines were our U.S. military \nforces who contributed so skillfully to the success of the air \ncampaign. They deserve our full support and our thanks for carrying out \ntheir mission so bravely, and for achieving our military goals with \nvirtually no casualties.\n  It is now vitally important that the United States and our NATO \nallies remain vigilant to ensure that the Serbs live up to their \nagreement so that the Kosovars can return to their country and their \nhomes, and rebuild their lives. They have a right to live in peace \nwithout fear of further atrocities.\n  The agreement reached yesterday is cause for great hope that we can \nachieve those goals, and I want to again commend the President, our \ntroops, NATO, and those front line countries who gave so much for the \nsuccess and the victory that we celebrate today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I commend the democratic leader on behalf of \nthe entire country for the statement he has just made. Think for just a \nminute what has taken place: Thousands and thousands of individual \nsorties by 19 member nations. There are some, who were detractors, who \nreferred to this as Clinton and Gore's war. No, it was not Clinton and \nGore's war, but rather a war of those people of good will around the \nworld, and certainly in this country, who detest evil, repudiate ethnic \ncleansing, and, in short, believe that atrocities by bullies like \nSlobodan Milosevic should be no more.\n  So, I am confident and hopeful this will send a message to those \naround the world who feel they can maim and kill and displace those \npeople with whom they disagree for purposes only they understand--the \ncolor of their skin, their religion--a message that this will no longer \nhappen.\n  So I, too, applaud the Commander in Chief. I especially applaud \nSecretary of Defense William Cohen for his leadership and commend all \nthe American forces deployed in the Balkan region who have served and \nsucceeded in the highest traditions of our country, and, finally, I \nwish to thank the families of the brave service men and women who \nparticipated in Operation Allied Force, who have borne the burden of \nbeing separated from their families for these many weeks.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative assistant proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of a Kosovo-related resolution; \nthat the resolution and preamble be agreed to en bloc; and that the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to object at this time, not that I \nwill object to it in the end. The Senate will go on record on this \nmatter, but we just saw the language 15 minutes ago. I have already \ninitiated a process to have it reviewed by the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, \nthe chairman of the Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, and \nother interested Senators, to make sure they are comfortable with the \nlanguage, because it does go beyond just the resolution we see underway \nnow concerning Kosovo and the withdrawal of the Serbian troops and, \nhopefully, the return of the Kosovars. It also goes into some language \nwith regard to what should happen in Kosovo now and also language with \nregard to President Milosevic.\n  All I am saying is we want to review the language and make sure all \ninterested Senators are aware of it. We will be glad to work with \nSenator Reid, Senator Daschle, and others to have a statement by the \nSenate on this matter, as we usually do when there are events such as \nthis.\n  I do want to go ahead and say for the Record, as others have, that \nthe Senate is, I am sure, and I personally am very pleased an agreement \nappears to have been worked out and appears to be going forward.\n\n[[Page S6913]]\n\n  Earlier I was able to discuss this matter with the President. It does \nappear that the Serbian troops are beginning to be withdrawn and the \nbombing will be halted. This should lead to a process where the \nKosovars can return to their homeland. That is good news.\n  I think we all should express our appreciation for the leadership \nthat has occurred in this area, and also for the good and outstanding \nwork done by our troops. That is the thrust of what is in this \nresolution. So I think we all should acknowledge that. I think there is \na sigh of relief that it did not go on further, with great problems \nfacing U.S. men and women in uniform who had to go in as ground troops, \nor as the weather turned bad. We are all very pleased that this appears \nto be working out.\n  As the President said to me when we talked earlier today--and I do \nnot want to quote the President, because you do not do that, but the \nupshot of it was we still have a long way to go. And we do. But we all \ncan hope and pray for the best.\n  So while I will reserve the right to object at this point, we will \nwork with the leadership on both sides of the aisle and develop some \nlanguage on which the Senate can act.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand the objection of the majority \nleader. We wish we could have gotten the information in the form of \nthis resolution to him sooner. But the war just ended, and the United \nNations resolution just a matter of hours ago was passed.\n  We thought it was very appropriate prior to this weekend--we are \ngoing out of session now until Monday--that the President, the \nSecretary of Defense, and especially those military men and women who \nhave been away from home for weeks--the bombing has taken 11 weeks--\nthat we commend and applaud the work they have done.\n  The way to do that formally is through a resolution. As the leader \nhas said, he agrees generally with the thrust of what we are trying to \ndo. We will be happy to work with the Republican leadership to come up \nwith a resolution that makes sure the fighting men and women of this \ncountry are commended, that the Secretary of Defense is commended, the \nCommander in Chief, and that also we acknowledge we set out to make \nsure the Serb forces got out of Kosovo--they are on their way out--that \nthe ethnic Albanians are allowed to return--they are on their way \nback--and, of course, there be a peacekeeping force on the ground, \nwhich this body has already approved.\n  So with that, I will yield the floor, recognizing that this is a \ngreat day in the history of the United States, and it is a great day in \nthe history of the other 18 nations in that we have been able to force \nevil to come to an end. We have won the war. It is very important that \nwe now win the peace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. One final comment on that. The record will show the Senate \nis working on an appropriate resolution. We will have one, I am sure, \nearly next week.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Daschle-\nReid resolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the concurrent resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. --\n\n       Whereas United States and NATO Forces have achieved \n     remarkable success in forcing Yugoslavia to accept NATO's \n     conditions to halt the air campaign;\n       Whereas these historic accomplishments have been achieved \n     at an astoundingly small loss of life and number of \n     casualties among American and NATO forces;\n       Whereas to date two Americans have been killed in the line \n     of duty;\n       Whereas hundreds of thousands of Kosovar civilians have \n     been ethnically cleansed or killed by Serb security forces: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That:\n       (1) The Congress applauds and expresses the appreciation of \n     the Nation to:\n       (A) President Clinton, Commander in Chief of all American \n     Armed Forces, for his leadership during Operation Allied \n     Force.\n       (B) Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Armed Forces Chief \n     of Staff Hugh Shelton and Supreme Allied Commander--Europe \n     Wesley Clark, for their planning and implementation of \n     Operation Allied Force.\n       (C) All of the American forces deployed in the Balkan \n     region, who have served and succeeded in the highest \n     traditions of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (D) All of the forces from our NATO allies, who served with \n     distinction and success.\n       (E) The families of American service men and women \n     participating in Operation Allied Force, who have bravely \n     borne the burden of separation from their loved ones, and \n     staunchly supported them in this crisis.\n       (2) The Congress notes with deep sadness the loss of life \n     on all sides in Operation Allied Force.\n       (3) The Congress demands from Slobodan Milosevic:\n       (A) The withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo according \n     to relevant provisions of the Military Technical Agreement \n     between NATO and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B) An end to the hostilities in Kosovo on the part of Serb \n     forces.\n       (C) The unconditional return to their homes of all Kosovar \n     citizens displaced by Serb aggression.\n       (4) The Congress urges the KLA to observe the ceasefire and \n     demilitarize.\n       (5) The Congress urges all relevant authorities to \n     seriously examine the issue of possible war crimes by \n     Slobodan Milosevic and other Serb military leaders and \n     forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/10/senate-section/article/S6913-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  GUIDANCE FOR THE DESIGNATION OF EMERGENCIES AS A PART OF THE BUDGET \n                                PROCESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
