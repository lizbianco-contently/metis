Mr. President, and colleagues, this is going to be an \nimportant week in the debate about the future of the Medicare program. \nThe White House is coming forward with several useful Medicare \nproposals. Democrats and Republicans on both sides of the Hill are \nsimilarly focused.\n  This morning I have come to the floor to zero in on the issue of \nprescription drug coverage for older people under Medicare. I believe \nif the Senate builds on a bipartisan proposal already approved by a \nmajority of Senators, it will be possible to responsibly add \nprescription drug coverage to the Medicare program in this session of \nthe Congress.\n  A few weeks ago, 54 Members of this body voted for legislation \noffered by\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe and myself to finance prescription drug coverage \nfor seniors under Medicare with a tobacco tax. Senator Snowe and I have \nnow developed a specific proposal that calls for a 55-cent-a-pack \ntobacco tax that would be used to cover the prescription drug needs of \nolder people under Medicare. We think that is appropriate because, of \ncourse, the Medicare program spends upwards of $10 billion a year \nsimply paying for tobacco-related illnesses that older people have \nsuffered.\n  Under the Snowe-Wyden proposal, we would be able to raise $70 billion \nin order to cover prescription drug benefits for older people over the \nnext 10 years. That is hard dollars to cover this important benefit. It \nis not phantom funding. It is not sleight of hand. It is not a kind of \nwish-and-hope, pie-in-the-sky way to take care of this particular need \nfor older people. It is a concrete, tangible concept.\n  A majority of the Senate, Senators of both political parties, have \nvoted for it. I am very hopeful that it will be possible now for the \nSenate to build on this support, with bipartisan approval, to actually \nget the job done and support older people.\n  In the legislation that Senator Snowe and I have put together, we \nenvision this $70 billion being used to assist older people with the \ninsurance premiums that they now pay for Medicare supplemental \npolicies. As we know, many of our seniors have Medicare supplemental \npolicies. Many of our seniors participate in what is called Medicare \nChoice, a program that involves Medicare HMOs. It may well be that a \nnumber of seniors wish to purchase policies that cover only \nprescription drugs.\n  But what Senator Snowe and I have developed would be voluntary. No \nsenior would be required to do it. The Presiding Officer and I will \nrecall the catastrophic care fiasco of several years ago when older \npeople were concerned about being required to pay for something they \ndid not really need or did not particularly want.\n  That would not be the case under the legislation developed by Senator \nSnowe and I. It would be voluntary if an older person chose to \nparticipate in the program; and $70 billion in real funding would be \neligible to assist the older people who desire to have that coverage as \npart of their Medicare.\n  Senator Snowe and I believe the best way to deliver this coverage is \nto build on a model that Members of Congress know a fair amount about, \nand that is the Federal employee health plan.\n  Senator Snowe and I recognize that program covers different people \nthan we would be covering under Medicare, so our delivery system for \nthis particular benefit would be a kind of senior citizen's version of \nthe Federal employee health plan. We call it the SPICE Board. It stands \nfor Senior Prescription Insurance Coverage Equity. We consider it a \nkind of senior citizens' friendly version of the Federal employee \nhealth plan.\n  We have incorporated some of the very good ideas that have come from \nFamilies USA, the seniors' advocacy group, the National Council of \nSenior Citizens, and a variety of the senior citizens' organizations, \nto ensure that the SPICE Board that would deliver this system would \noffer choices and competition for older people but at the same time \nwould not allow cherry-picking; so that a plan could not take just \nhealthy people, it would make sure there were protections against \nadverse selection.\n\n  We bar the use of preexisting conditions. A lot of the problems we \nhave seen with insurance coverage in the past would not be allowed \nunder the SPICE Board because we have incorporated many of the good \nideas that have come from AARP and Families USA and the National \nCouncil of Senior Citizens so as to ensure that the SPICE Board would \noffer these benefits to older people in a senior-friendly way.\n  At the same time, it is important to note that this is a competitive \nmodel. This will help us to hold costs down because older people would \nhave the kind of bargaining power, through the SPICE Board, that an HMO \nhas today when it bargains for younger people getting prescription drug \ncoverage under the Federal employee health plan.\n  I think it is particularly sad to see older people, many of whom have \n16, 18, 20 prescriptions they are using in a year, paying well over \n$1,000 out of pocket for their medicine. It is particularly outrageous \nthat they end up paying a premium, since they don't have coverage, when \nthey walk into a pharmacy and pay out of pocket. They have to pay more \nbecause, in effect, they are subsidizing those who have bargaining \npower in the private sector who get their coverage through a managed \ncare plan.\n  We use an approach that uses markets, offers choice, avoids price \ncontrols, but makes sure that through the SPICE Board, older people \nwould have the kind of bargaining power and clout we see HMOs having in \nthe private sector.\n  I am very hopeful that this week, as the Congress moves to have a \nvigorous discussion about Medicare--the President's proposal is coming \ntomorrow; our colleagues on both sides of the Hill expressing great \ninterest in this issue--Members will reflect on the fact that a \nmajority of the Senate has already voted for the Snowe-Wyden proposal \nto finance this coverage with a tobacco tax. It is only fair, because \nof the costs Medicare incurs related to tobacco. We know now that a \nbipartisan group of Senators is willing to at least look at that \napproach to finance this coverage.\n  I am also very hopeful that our colleagues will steer clear of some \nof these price control ideas that would create more bureaucracy. \nIncidentally, most of these price controls just shift the cost onto the \nbacks of other consumers. I am very fearful that if we set up a price \ncontrol regime for older people under Medicare, a lot of low-income \nfolks, African Americans, Hispanics, and others would end up seeing the \ncosts shifted onto them because they wouldn't have any protection from \nthis price control regime.\n  In addition to the real intangible way that is going to be essential \nto finance this program, we ought to use a concept the Congress is \nfamiliar with for delivering the benefit. Under the Senior Prescription \nInsurance Coverage Equity Program, the SPICE Program, we would be able \nto do that. We would be able to deliver the benefit in a way that \nallows senior citizens to exercise clout in the marketplace and be in a \nposition to hold their costs down. There would be real consumer \nprotections because we have incorporated the good ideas from Families \nUSA and AARP and the National Council of Senior Citizens.\n  I am very hopeful as this debate goes forward this week, our \ncolleagues in the Senate will see there is a chance to avoid some of \nthe bickering and partisanship that has accompanied other issues, look \nto giving older people this important preventive benefit that is so \ncritical but financing it in a real way, not with phantom kind of \nmoney, and then delivering the benefit in a way that steers clear of \nprice controls but gives older citizens in our country the kind of \nbargaining power an HMO has so the older people can get reasonable \nprices for their coverage.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has a great interest in this issue. He \nand I have worked often on this matter. He can count on the fact that \nSenator Snowe and I will be visiting with him, as well as other \ncolleagues, because it is our intent to do everything possible to keep \nthe Senate, at least on the prescription drug issue, focused on the \nreal needs of older people and the opportunity to address this issue in \nthis session of Congress with real and hard financing and a delivery \nsystem that will work for the 21st century.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7682-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7682-S7683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GENERAL JAMES L. JONES, JR.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor and personal \nprivilege for me to pay tribute to two distinguished Americans. One of \nthem is General James L. Jones, Jr., the newly confirmed 32nd \nCommandant of the United States Marine Corps.\n  The general hails from Kansas City, Missouri. He spent his formative \nyears in France where he acquired his fluency in the French language.\n  He is a graduate of Georgetown University School of Foreign Service \nand I understand he still keeps up a Georgetown tradition by playing a \nlittle basketball now and then.\n  General Jones is a warrior--part of a family of distinguished \nmarines. His father commanded a Marine Corps Force\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\nreconnaissance company during the Second World War. His uncle, \nLieutenant General William Jones, commanded Marine Forces in the \nPacific and had a long and distinguished combat record.\n  On a personal note, General Jones and I served together in Vietnam \nduring the siege of Khe Sahn. The general was twice decorated for \nbravery, receiving the Silver Star Medal--our Nation's third highest \naward for valor--as well as the Bronze Star Medal with combat ``V.''\n  For me, the general is truly ``a brother of the bond''--a member of \nthe small ``band of brothers'' who have served their country with \ncourage and honor in the crucible of combat.\n  General Jones is a highly experienced infantry commander and staff \nofficer--during his long and distinguished career he has served as an \ninfantry battalion commander, Marine Expeditionary Unit commander and \nas the commanding general of the Second Marine Division at Camp \nLejeune, North Carolina.\n\n  He has led marines from the fire-swept rice paddies of Vietnam to the \nmountains of Northern Iraq and Turkey.\n  General Jones just recently completed an assignment as the Military \nAssistant to the Secretary of Defense, our former colleague Bill Cohen. \nIn this capacity, he accompanied the Secretary around the globe in \nsupport of the defense of our Nation's vital national interests.\n  Many may not know this, but General Jones is also a ``veteran'' of \nthe United States Senate. He served as the Marine Corps Liaison Officer \nto the Senate alongside another colleague--then Captain, United States \nNavy, John McCain.\n  Mr. President, I, again, welcome Lieutenant General Jones as the 32nd \nCommandant and as the newest member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He \nwill lead one of the finest military organizations on Earth, the United \nStates Marine Corps. He will be responsible for our Nation's premier \n``911'' force, charged with guiding and directing our Corps of Marines \ninto the new century and millennium.\n  I know I speak for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in \nwishing General Jones, his lovely wife Diane--as well as his family Jim \nJr., Kevin, Greg, and Jennifer--our very best wishes. On June 30, 1999, \nhe will take on the awesome responsibility of being the 32nd Commandant \nof the Marine Corps. Semper Fi and Godspeed, General Jones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7683-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7683-S7684]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GENERAL ERIC K. SHINSEKI\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished \nsoldier, General Eric K. Shinseki, whose inspiring personal journey is \na story that could happen only in America.\n  My good friend and distinguished colleague, the senior senator from \nHawaii, presented a moving tribute to General Shinseki when he formally \nintroduced his fellow Hawaiian to the Armed Services Committee on June \n8th. Senator Inouye reminded us that when the general was born on the \nisland of Kauai in the midst of the Second World War, his Japanese \nheritage made him, according to the regrettable laws that existed at \nthat time, an enemy alien. Due in large part to the heroism of noble \nHawaiians like our colleague, who fought so bravely and honorably and \nat such great personal sacrifice with the 442d Regimental Combat Team \nin Europe, Japanese-Americans no longer bear the indignity that the \ngovernment of their country visited upon them during that time of war. \nAs Senator Inouye reminded us, President Roosevelt declared that \nAmericanism is a matter of mind and heart and that it is not, and never \nhas been, a matter of racial color. The birthright that Senator \nInouye's blood purchased for these Americans enabled young Ric Shinseki \nto rise to the top of the military profession in this great country. \nAnd for that we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to our brave and \ndistinguished colleague.\n  General Shinseki began to show promise at a tender age. An \noutstanding student, he left the Territory of Hawaii for the first time \nand came east to become a high school exchange student in New Jersey.\n  Having broadened his horizons, he sought and secured an appointment \nto the United States Military Academy. While a cadet at West Point he \nheard a young president challenge the Nation to ``ask not what your \ncountry can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' He \nlistened in the Cadet Mess as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur \neloquently defined the words of the Academy motto, ``Duty, Honor, \nCountry.'' Cadet Shinseki has never stopped answering those ringing \ncalls to duty. He answers them still.\n  He graduated from the Military Academy in 1965 with a commission in \nthe field artillery. He soon found himself en route to Vietnam and a \ntour of duty with the 25th Infantry Division, the ``Tropic Lightning'' \nDivision. Onboard a ship crossing the Pacific a veteran non-\ncommissioned officer taught the young lieutenant his craft. For days \nand days the two men drilled on the techniques of calling for and \nobserving artillery fire. Second Lieutenant Shinseki never forgot the \nvalue of skilled and dedicated non-commissioned officers. He has been a \nsoldier's soldier ever since.\n  Combat wounds cut short his tenure in Vietnam. After a long \nconvalescence, he volunteered to return to the war, to answer the \nsummons of the trumpet once again. While commanding a cavalry troop \nwith the 5th Infantry Division, he received another wound, this one far \nmore serious. For a while, his life was in jeopardy. And even after the \nhealing had begun, there were serious questions about whether he could \ncontinue his career.\n  True to his nature, honoring his birthright and still answering the \ncall to duty, Ric Shinseki fought to stay in the Army. Fortunately for \nus, the Army saw more than a little potential in this twice-wounded \nwarrior, and granted his request to stay. They sent him to Duke \nUniversity to get a degree in English literature so that he could \nreturn to teach at his alma mater on the banks of the Hudson. There, as \na member of the West Point faculty, he could teach and mentor a new \ngeneration of officers, inspiring them with his stoic example of duty \nand sacrifice.\n  Since that time, General Shinseki has built two great legacies in the \nArmy. First, he is a leader and trainer of soldiers. He has been a \ncommander and operations officer in armored and mechanized formations \nfrom the 3rd of the 7th Cavalry in Europe, to my own beloved First \nTeam, the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, where he served \nas commanding general.\n  General Shinseki has also built a reputation as a brilliant staff \nofficer who has helped the army to shape its force and modernize its \ntraining during tours of duty in five different positions in the Office \nof the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. There he came to \nknow the army as an institution, to learn the folkways of the Pentagon, \nand to understand the byzantine nature of this great city.\n  In 1997 the President and the Senate recognized the enormous \npotential of this soldier by promoting him to a fourth star and \nappointing him Commanding General of United States Army, Europe. This \ncritical assignment was all the more important because General Shinseki \nwas also soon to become Commanding General of the Stabilization Force \n(SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There he undertook the difficult and \ndelicate mission of implementing the Dayton Peace Accords among the \nBosnians, Croats, and Serbs, a task whose complexity has been \nunderscored by our more recent trials in the Balkans.\n  Last year, General Shinseki returned home to become Vice Chief of \nStaff of the Army, to run the staff in the building he knows so well. \nHe has brought a mature, steady hand to his administration of the Army \nStaff.\n  A combat veteran, a soldier's soldier, an accomplished trainer, a \nconsummate staff officer, a respected commander, this son of Japanese \nimmigrants who was born an enemy alien has now risen to the pinnacle of \nthe American military profession. Wow, what a story. In a ceremony on \nJune 22, 1999 at Fort Myer, Virginia, General Eric K. Shinseki assumed \nduty as the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army.\n  He is a visionary leader and there is no one better qualified to lead \nthe United States Army into the next millennium. I salute his service, \nhis sacrifice, his devotion to duty. I applaud his perseverance, his \nintelligence, his humility. I feel honored that the members of the \nArmed Services Committee\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\nand I will have many opportunities to work with General Shinseki over \nthe next several years as we labor to guarantee the readiness of the \nArmed Forces and to maintain our covenant with the men and women of the \nUnited States Army, who guarantee our own freedoms and guard our \ninterests at home and abroad.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7684-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7684-S7685]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RURAL SATELLITE SERVICE\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, rural states are particularly affected by \nsatellite service. Telecommunications is changing the way things are \ndone, providing more and more of our services through satellites. Yet \nwe have difficulty with people who live in low-density areas, people \nwho live in the country, receiving their local satellite service.\n  This is a common problem in a low-density State such as Wyoming, \nwhere we have fewer people, where we have more rural areas. Many issues \nwe work on have a unique impact on people who live in rural areas. The \nreregulation of electricity, for example, has a different impact in \nWyoming than it does in Pennsylvania. That is true, also, with the \ndelivery of health care services.\n  It is important, when we deal with nationwide issues, that we also \ntake some time to give special attention to the differences that exist \namong consumers in the country. That is particularly true with TV. \nTechnology and satellite TV have allowed TV services to be delivered in \nplaces it could never be delivered before. However, there are many \nrural people who cannot receive over the air television signals. That \nis the case in Wyoming.\n  Technology and satellite TV are great because they often provide \npeople with more services. Indeed, it does. But it is difficult to \nprovide local TV, local news, and local emergency signals that are \ngiven by the local stations. When a satellite company cannot do that, \ncustomers get their NBC broadcast in Rawlins, WY, they receive it from \nChicago. That is a problem in terms of being able to have those local \nservices available to consumers.\n  It is important, No. 1, we maintain local broadcast markets. It is \nimportant, as well, that people who live in that vicinity have the \nopportunity to see local news, to hear about local activities, to \nparticipate locally. The problem is, how do you provide satellite \nservice and at the same time provide local news and local activities, \nas well?\n  This week, the Senate-House conference will be meeting regarding the \nSatellite Home Viewers Improvement Act. Hopefully, something will come \nout of that. This is legislation which will enable more customers to \nreceive broadcast network television. The question is, of course, who \ncan adequately receive local service from their own antenna and who can \nreceive these local broadcasts through a staellite provider.\n  I had meetings in Wyoming this week. We only have two areas in \nWyoming where the local TV has a designated area; the others do not. \nThere are 15 States that do not have local-to-local service at all. \nWhen people up for satellite TV and they want the national broadcast--\nwhich is done locally, if you can receive that from an antenna--viewers \nare blocked from receiving it on the satellite.\n  The difficulty is determining the strength of the signal that comes \nto that antenna. There is a great difference of view about that. \nFrankly, it is very uncertain who makes that determination.\n  The first issue is determining the strength of the signal. You have \nto find out if that signal is strong enough so you qualify to get it \nover your antenna, or have a technician show that it isn't.\n  That is the difference of view. There needs to be a third party who \nsays, whether you have adequate signal strength. Some viewers are \nbehind a mountain or in a valley and can't get it. That is part of the \nproblem.\n  Another problem is considering the local market. Over 25 percent of \nthe viewers in Wyoming receive their TV from satellites. This is the \nthird highest percentage, I believe, in the United States. That is not \na huge number of people, but it is a very high percentage of people.\n  Without satellite access of course, the customers have no TV at all. \nUnder the current situation, the TV they do get often comes from \ndistant network stations.\n  There are two problems. One is that there has been a moratorium so \nthese viewers could continue to get their services. That moratorium is \nscheduled to expire at the end of this month for folks in Grade A. In \nthe Grade B contour network service expires at the end of the year; and \nthere is nothing to be done in the interim. We need to deal with the \nimmediacy of the problem--hopefully give customers another moratorium \nto continue network service. Second, we need to decide how we can get \nlocal-to-local coverage, how we can get the local TV station carried in \na ``must carry'' proposition.\n  There are two difficulties. One, I am told--and I am not completely \npersuaded--that there is a lack of capacity on the satellites. In order \nto do that, additional satellites must be launched to carry all the \nlocal stations so people can get local broadcasts. Of course, that runs \ninto the third issue--money.\n  I know the folks in Kansas would be just as excited about having TV \ncoverage as the folks in Wyoming; and I am sure the Presiding Officer \nwould be instrumental in making this happen.\n  In summary, I think many individuals would like to use satellites for \ntheir TV viewing. People in the country also want to have their local \nstation available to them. They do not want to be blocked from \nreceiving NBC or CBS because they are within the area that their local \nstation carries, despite the fact they can't get it well on their own \nTV.\n  This is a problem that can have a happy resolution. Ideally, everyone \ncould receive TV and have a good picture. Ideally, everyone could view \ntheir local station. We will work toward this end. I hope the \nconference committee meeting now can help find a way to provide a \nremedy for the short term and then set up an efficient system as we \nlook to the future.\n  We have written a letter to the committee--I think there are 24 \nsignatures on this letter--urging they set up a commission to determine \nhow this might be done to resolve the question in the long term. I am \noptimistic that can be done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1999.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman,\n     The Honorable Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman,\n     The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Colleagues: We are writing today to request your \n     support for efforts to ensure local service for small \n     television markets during conference committee deliberation \n     of comprehensive satellite legislation.\n       While we support provisions in this legislation that will \n     allow the satellite retransmission of local television \n     signals back into local markets (``local into local''), we \n     are concerned that satellite providers are not expected to \n     provide local service to the 19 million U.S. households in \n     the smallest 150 rural and less populated markets. We believe \n     that all Americans should receive the benefits of \n     educational, informational and entertainment programming \n     resulting from the reception of local signals.\n       We are particularly concerned that at least 15 states, \n     including many of our own, do not have a single television \n     market which will receive local television retransmission. \n     Therefore, disagreements will continue over importation of \n     distant network signals, and worse, rural America will be \n     deprived of important communications access.\n\n[[Page S7685]]\n\n       While the legislation passed by the Senate requires the FCC \n     to report on methods of facilitating ``local into local'', we \n     believe there should be a more focused effort towards the \n     goal of implementing ``local into local'' as soon as \n     technically possible. To this end, we support the creation of \n     a Local Television Planning Group that would make \n     recommendations to Congress to ensure that all local \n     television signals are retransmitted by appropriate \n     technologies as soon as practicable. This Planning Group \n     should be convened under the auspices of the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), and \n     should include representative local broadcasters and \n     knowledgeable senior staff drawn from relevant federal \n     agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, the \n     Department of Justice, and agencies within the Department of \n     Agriculture that specialize in providing services to rural \n     America. We believe this is a workable approach that ensures \n     no portions of America are left out of the information age.\n       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to \n     working with you on this important issue for rural Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n         Max Baucus, Tom Daschle, Tim Johnson, Harry Reid, Larry \n           E.

Mr. President, as a member of the Energy Committee and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee where I am ranking member on the \nInternational Security, Proliferation and Federal Services \nSubcommittee, I have benefited from numerous briefings and extensive \nhearings on the issues raised in the House select committee's Report on \nU.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns With the \nPeople's Republic of China. Representative Cox and Representative Dicks \nand their colleagues on the House select committee have done the \ncountry a great national service in producing the report.\n  The bipartisan manner in which they conducted their analysis is an \nexample to us all of the importance of placing bipartisanship above \npolitical interests for the sake of national security.\n  I was dismayed, as other Members have been, by the extent of Chinese \nespionage efforts exposed in the committee's report. I wish we could \nsay that American efforts and commitment to countering Chinese \nespionage were as relentless and as persistent as their ongoing efforts \nto acquire information from us.\n  Importantly, the President and the entire administration have taken \nmajor steps to reform our security at the national nuclear weapons \nlaboratories and to improve our counterintelligence capability. Many of \nthese changes were ordered by the President in February 1998 well \nbefore the House Select Committee was formed.\n  Additional measures were taken during the committee's review as the \nextent of Chinese espionage became apparent.\n  Let me make two cautionary statements:\n  There is a great deal of discussion now in Washington as to whom to \nblame for the security lapses. There is the usual round of finger-\npointing and calls for this or that person to resign.\n  We should not spend all of our time searching for scapegoats. Only \nour adversaries take solace when we turn on ourselves and become \ndistracted by partisan squabbling. Let us instead focus our attention \non improving our security and rooting out those guilty of betraying \nAmerica.\n  Secondly, let us not sacrifice our efforts to build a constructive \nrelationship with the Chinese people because of our justifiable anger \nat their government's espionage.\n  Much of what has occurred is to our embarrassment for not being more \nvigilant.\n  We need to engage China. We have issues and problems that can only be \nresolved by cooperation. These include bread and butter issues such as \nreducing our trade deficit and improving market accessibility for \nAmerican goods. They include global issues such as global warming and \nthe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  The Select Committee's report indicates that, despite international \ncommitments to the contrary, China continues to proliferate weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  To convince China to cooperate with us in ending the threat of \nproliferation we will need to engage China.\n  Our foreign visitor's program at the national laboratories has \nprovided us with one opportunity to engage the Chinese on issues such \nas improving export controls. With enhanced restrictions, these \nprograms should continue. it is our openness to the best scientific \nminds which aids America in keeping its intellectual edge sharp on the \nfrontiers of science.\n  But engagement is not a one-way street.\n  China needs to demonstrate that it wants to and can engage the United \nStates in a constructive and cooperative manner.\n  China can choose to swamp us either with spies or with friends. The \nchoice is theirs.\n  There is a sense in the country from the revelations contained in the \nCox Committee report that the Chinese have ``poisoned the well'' of \nrelations between the United States and China. The report observes that \n``the PRC uses a variety of techniques, including espionage, controlled \ncommercial entities, and a network of individuals and organizations \nthat engage in a vast array of contacts with scientists, business \npeople, and academics.''\n  The report further charges that there are an increasing number of \nChinese ``front companies'' in the United States attempting to gain \naccess to our technology and national security secrets. China seems to \nbe almost unchecked in its efforts to gain information on the United \nStates.\n  This view has two detrimental effects. The first effect is on the \noverall perception of the benefits of relations with China.\n  On June 3, the President took the correct step of renewing normal \ntrade relations with China. But it was a step that China needs to \nmatch. With a growing trade imbalance of $57 billion in 1998 out of a \ntotal trade of $85.4 billion, China is our fourth largest trading \npartner. We are also the third largest foreign investor in China. \nDuring the Asian financial crisis, American trade with China played a \nsubstantial role in keeping the Chinese economy afloat as Chinese \nexports to the U.S. grew even as Chinese exports to other nations fell. \nThe lesson for China is that we are too important for them to ignore. \nThe lesson for us is that China has become too big for us to ignore.\n  A step in the right direction for both countries is to achieve an \nagreement on conditions for China's entry into the World Trade \nOrganization. Chinese participation in this international body would be \na major leap forward into integrating China in the world economy. \nConditions that permit more access for American goods and protection \nfor American investment in China would help accelerate the \nmodernization of the Chinese economy.\n  I think the battle within China over whether or not to participate in \nthe international economy has been won by the advocates of \nmodernization led by President Jiang Zemin and Premier\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nZhu Rongji. Granting NTR to China this year will set the stage for a \nconclusion to the long-running negotiations with China over WTO \naccession. I support renewal of NTR for China because it is an \nessential step towards redefining American-Chinese relations in terms \nof mutual benefit rather than in terms of winner and loser.\n  The second discouraging effect of the report is to taint Asian \nAmericans, especially Chinese Americans, with the stain of suspicion of \nespionage. This unfair, but very real, perception came through clearly \nduring a recent visit by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to Lawrence \nLivermore National Laboratory where one Asian American employee \ndeclared, ``we all feel like suspects of espionage.'' Mr. Hoyt Zia, \nchief counsel for export administration in the Commerce Department, \nwrote in the New York Times recently about the unfortunate and \nunwarranted charge that ``Asian-Americans continue to be accused of \nhaving dual loyalties to a degree far greater than any other immigrant \ngroup to this country.''\n  I commend his article, ``Well, Is He A Spy--Or Not?'', to my \ncolleagues and ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in its \nentirety in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. AKAKA. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Yes, it is true, according to our counter intelligence specialists, \nthat Chinese intelligence officers target Chinese Americans and that \nthey also rely on Chinese in the United States who are not American \ncitizens, but it has always been true that foreign intelligence \nservices seek out Americans with similar ethnic backgrounds when trying \nto establish spy networks. There are numerous examples of this. During \nthe cold war, East German operatives targeted German Americans. From an \noperational perspective, this only makes sense.\n  It is the job of all Americans to be vigilant, regardless of ethnic \nbackground. This is the lesson of the recent concern over national \nsecurity leaks. We should not overreact or allow ourselves to become \nsidetracked by unsupported charges that unfairly tarnish any individual \nor group absent solid evidence. As the recent report about national lab \nsecurity by a Presidential panel chaired by former Senator Warren \nRudman stated, ``enough is enough.'' We need now to sit down, review, \nimprove our security procedures and think seriously anew about our \npolicy towards China.\n  I urge my colleagues in joining me in examining next steps, not our \nlast steps, in an effort to implement security reforms at the national \nlaboratories and to encourage the development of a more effective \npolicy towards the People's Republic of China.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I, again, ask that we seriously look \ninto our relationship with China.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 26, 1999]\n\n                       Well Is He a Spy--or Not?\n\n                             (By Hoyt Zia)\n\n       Washington, DC.--After serving almost five years in the \n     Clinton Administration, I've learned a number of things about \n     Washington--and one of them is how innuendo can ruin a \n     reputation in no time.\n       In my job as chief counsel for export administration in the \n     Commerce Department, I work daily with classified information \n     in order to help regulate technology exports to China and \n     other countries that can be used for military purposes.\n       As such, I am well familiar with the risks to national \n     security that could result from the improper disclosure of \n     classified information, as well as the highly politicized \n     nature of technology transfers to China. From this vantage \n     point, I find myself greatly troubled by the atmosphere \n     surrounding the espionage allegations leveled against Wen Ho \n     Lee, a nuclear weapons scientist at Los Alamos National \n     Laboratory in New Mexico. I'm afraid this tension is only \n     going to get worse with the release yesterday of the report \n     from the Congressional investigation led by Representative \n     Christopher Cox.\n       The case against Mr. Lee goes something like this: In 1996, \n     intelligence officials obtains a Chinese document from 1988 \n     containing classified information about an advanced American \n     nuclear warhead. Since Mr. Lee traveled to China for \n     scientific conferences in 1986 and 1988, and in 1982 had \n     called a Chinese-American scientist at another national lab \n     who was suspected of espionage, he was added to the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation's list of Chinese spies.\n       After a three-year investigation by the F.B.I. yielded \n     insufficient evidence to support a charge of espionage, Mr. \n     Lee was fired from his job in March for unspecified breaches \n     of security and identified as an espionage suspect. While \n     recent Congressional investigations into the matter, \n     including the one led by Representative Cox, have \n     concluded that Chinese spying at the labs is pervasive and \n     ongoing, there is no other evidence that Mr. Lee passed \n     classified information to the Chinese, intentionally or \n     otherwise. Nonetheless, many in the media and in the \n     Government have pronounced Mr. Lee guilty of passing \n     nuclear weapons secrets to the Chinese.\n       Let me make clear that I do not defend Mr. Lee's alleged \n     misconduct or contend that he has not done anything wrong. \n     While the F.B.I. has yet to uncover any evidence to support \n     charging him with espionage, he appears to have committed \n     gross violations of the rules for handling classified \n     material. The details of the security violations for which he \n     was fired were never specified, but subsequently it was found \n     that he had transferred highly classified nuclear weapons \n     programs from a protected classified computer system to his \n     unprotected desktop computer. If Mr. Lee indeed mishandled \n     classified information, then he deserves to be punished for \n     those violations, the same as anyone else.\n       Nevertheless, such violations do not on their face make him \n     a spy. A charge of espionage requires the specific intent to \n     steal the secrets of one in order to turn them over to \n     another. Mishandling classified information has nothing to do \n     with giving secrets away, but simply failing to safeguard \n     them properly.\n       It has been reported that many of Mr. Lee's colleagues at \n     the national laboratories have also been lax about observing \n     these rules. Even John Deutch, the former head of the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, was reportedly investigated after being \n     accused of mishandling classified information, including \n     allegedly having 31 secret C.I.A. files on his unsecure home \n     computer. And it is well known that the major national \n     weapons labs long resisted F.B.I. and Congressional pressure \n     to tighten their security policies.\n       While Mr. Lee should not be excused because ``everybody \n     does it,'' neither should he be singled out if he has acted \n     no differently from many of his colleagues of all \n     ethnicities.\n       Although the problem of lax security has been around for \n     two decades and largely unnoticed, the controversy \n     surrounding Mr. Lee will not let up. Attorney General Janet \n     Reno has been vilified for the Justice Department's decision \n     not to order wiretaps on Mr. Lee. Under normal circumstances \n     would this even have been considered given the inadequate \n     evidence? And there has even been talk of banning those \n     scientists with ``dual loyalties'' from our scientific \n     laboratories.\n       Why this single-minded pursuit of Mr. Lee? There is an \n     obvious difference between him and others in his position: He \n     is of Chinese ancestry. For reasons that I cannot fathom, and \n     notwithstanding numerous cases of exemplary service to this \n     country, Asian-Americans continue to be accused of having \n     dual loyalties to a degree far greater than any other \n     immigrant group in this country.\n       I know--I, too, have been accused of having dual loyalties \n     because, though an American, I happen to be of Chinese \n     ancestry. During the Congressional investigations into \n     improper campaign fund-raising, I, like many other Asian-\n     Americans, was interviewed by Federal and Congressional \n     investigators as well as by self-appointed ``watchdog'' \n     groups with their own political agendas.\n       Though I was not involved in fund-raising and had no \n     personal ties to the Chinese Government, I was named as a \n     possible link to China by far-right publications like The \n     American Spectator. The sole evidence was my Chinese \n     ancestry. No official evidence was ever given to support \n     those offensive falsehoods, but the damage to one's \n     reputation from accusations of disloyalty are irreparable.\n       The link to possible controversy was enough to cause \n     Administration officials to withdraw my appointment to a \n     higher position in the Department of the Navy where, as a \n     former Marine officer, I hoped I could serve. I will forever \n     have to explain to prospective employers why my loyalty as an \n     American was called into question.\n       It is no secret that the Chinese, like the Israelis, \n     Russians, French, Germans and every other industrialized \n     country, are spying on us every day. Perhaps it is also a \n     fact of life that politicians conjure up fears against \n     minority groups to achieve their objectives.\n       But in the United States, there is something called due \n     process. If the Government has evidence that Wen Ho Lee \n     committed espionage, it should charge him and let the \n     accusations be aired in a courtroom. If it doesn't, then it \n     should put the matter to rest rather than allow innuendo and \n     rumor not only to smear Mr. Lee but to call into question the \n     loyalty of every Asian-American.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I return to the floor today to urge my \ncolleagues to allow an open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. For \nsome time now we have been asking for this debate. Actually, we have \nbeen asking for about 2 weeks. Yet we still have not reached an \nacceptable agreement.\n  I return to the floor today to continue my discussion of a critically \nimportant provision in the Patients' Bill of Rights. This provision \nensures appropriate coverage for emergency services according to the \nprudent layperson standard. Unfortunately, the alternative standard \nthat my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are offering falls \nshort of the true prudent layperson standard. It is unfortunate that we \nare locked into a divisive debate, since I believe we could reach \nagreement on this provision.\n  We have already passed the prudent layperson standard for Medicare \nand Medicaid beneficiaries--a very important point. It is already in \nthe law. Now we need to complete the task and offer the same protection \nfor hard-working Americans with private insurance.\n  The bipartisan bill I cosponsored and the Democratic Bill of Rights \ncontain the real prudent layperson standard for emergency services. \nWhat is the problem with the version of the prudent layperson standard \nproposed by those on the other side of the aisle? There are two \nweaknesses in their version.\n  First, it provides an inadequate scope of coverage for emergency \nservices. The prudent layperson standard in their bill only applies to \n48 million people. Both the bipartisan bill and the Democratic bill \napply this support and protection to all 180 million Americans with \nprivate health insurance.\n  I heard arguments from the other side of the aisle that the Federal \nGovernment shouldn't get involved in private health insurance. The \nproblem with that argument is simply this: We already are involved. \nThankfully, we have made the decision that even if there is no other \nguarantee in our health care system, we will have guaranteed access to \nemergency services.\n  Health care that millions of Americans receive during emergencies is \na safety net on which our system relies. Federal legislation already \nmandates this safety net. The prudent layperson standard in our bill--\nwhich, I might add, has bipartisan support--parallels the Federal \nmandate for emergency care.\n  If we fail to extend the prudent layperson coverage to all privately \ninsured individuals, then we are choosing to continue an unfunded \nmandate.\n  The other major weakness in the prudent layperson provisions in the \nRepublican bill is the lack of provisions for post-stabilization \nservices. Mr. President I want to point out what the debate about post-\nstabilization services is all about. It simply boils down to two \nquestions:\n  (1) Is post-stabilization care going to be coordinated with the \npatient's health plan, or is it going to be uncoordinated and \ninefficient?\n  (2) Are decisions about post-stabilization care going to be made in a \ntimely fashion, or are we going to allow delays in the decision-making \nprocess that compromise patient care and lead to overcrowding in our \nnation's emergency rooms?\n  When I have heard arguments about the post-stabilization services, I \nhave heard opponents of these provisions characterize post-\nstabilization care as ``optional.''\n  Mr. President, we need to understand that no matter what Congress \ndecides to do, post-stabilization care will be delivered in our \nnation's emergency rooms. The care delivered after stabilization is not \noptional. The choice Congress has is to decide whether the care will be \ncoordinated or uncoordinated.\n  Kaiser-Permanente is a strong supporter of the post-stabilization \nprovisions in our bill for a simple reason: They realize that \ncoordinating care after a patient is stabilized not only leads to \nbetter patient care, it saves money.\n  Mr. President, I have a letter of support from Kaiser-Permanente \nwhich outlines their reasons for supporting our version of the prudent \nlayperson standard. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Kaiser Permanente,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1999.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus, since 1996, Kaiser Permanente has \n     supported the passage of federal legislation embracing the \n     Prudent Lay Person concept, which requires insurance coverage \n     of emergency services provided to people who reasonably \n     expect they have a life or limb threatening emergency. In \n     connection with this, we support a requirement that the \n     emergency physician or provider communicate with the health \n     plan at the point where the patient becomes stabilized. This \n     will allow for coordination of post-stabilization care for \n     the patient, including further tests and necessary follow-up \n     care. These concepts are contained in several bills currently \n     pending before Congress. I should note, however, that our \n     favoring of this language should not imply endorsement in its \n     entirety of any specific bill that deals with other issues.\n       As a result of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 with its \n     ensuing regulations applicable to Medicare + Choice and \n     Medicaid enrollees and the Executive Order applying the \n     President's Advisory Commission's Bill of Rights to all \n     federal employees, approximately 30 million Americans are now \n     the beneficiaries of a financial incentive to emergency \n     departments to communicate with the patient's health plan \n     after the patient is stabilized. This helps to ensure that \n     the patient's care is appropriate, coordinated and \n     continuous. It is important that emergency departments have \n     the same incentive to coordinate post-stabilization and \n     follow up care for patients who are not federal employees or \n     beneficiaries of Medicare or Medicaid. We have heard of \n     minimal problems implementing this standard in those health \n     plans participating in FEHBP and Medicare + Choice programs. \n     Since a federal standard is in place and working, it is good \n     policy to extend that standard to the general population.\n       For the past ten years, we have implemented on a voluntary \n     basis a program that embraces these concepts of honoring \n     payments for the care our members receive in non-\n     participating hospital emergency departments up to the point \n     of stabilization. Our Emergency Prospective Review Program \n     has encouraged the treating physicians in such settings to \n     contact our physicians at the earliest opportunity to discuss \n     the need for further care. This has allowed us to make \n     available elements of the patient's medical record pertinent \n     to the problem at hand and to coordinate on-going care as \n     well as the transfer of the patient back to his/her own \n     medical team at one of our facilities. We have found this \n     program to be considerate of the patients' needs, emphasizing \n     both the urgency of treatment for the immediate problem as \n     well as the continuity of high quality care.\n       This has been a cost-effective practice, affording the \n     patient the highest quality of care in the most appropriate \n     setting. By assuring immediate response to telephone \n     inquiries from non-participating emergency facilities, we \n     have been able to provide substantial assistance to the \n     emergency doctor who otherwise is practicing in an isolated \n     environment without access to the patient's medical record. \n     Our own emergency physicians on the telephone have offered \n     peer consultations provisionally approved coverage for \n     urgently needed tests and treatment, arranged for the \n     coordination of follow up care, and implemented critical care \n     transport of patients back to our own facilities. Of over two \n     thousand patients transported in this fashion, one third have \n     been discharged to their homes. Without this coordination of \n     care, these patients would have been hospitalized at needless \n     expense.\n       In summary, this program has served the needs of our \n     patients, the treating emergency physicians, and our own \n     medical care teams, while providing substantial savings in \n     both clinical expense and in administrative hassle over \n     retrospective approval of payment for services provisionally \n     approved through the telephone call. We are strongly in favor \n     of the post-stabilization coordination provision as an \n     essential element of the emergency access provision of the \n     Patients Bill of Rights.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Donald W. Parsons,\n\n                                     Associate Executive Director,\n                                        Health Policy Development.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I need to point out that this letter \ndoesn't endorse all of the provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nHowever, it strongly supports the post-stabilization provisions in our \nbill. I'll read a small portion of the letter:\n\n       In summary, this program has served the needs of our \n     patients, the treating emergency physicians, and our own \n     medical care teams, while providing substantial savings in \n     both clinical expense and in administrative hassle over \n     retrospective approval of payment for services provisionally \n     approved through the telephone call. We are strongly in favor \n     of the post-stabilization coordination provision as an \n     essential element of the\n\n[[Page S7688]]\n\n     emergency access provision of the Patients Bill of Rights.\n\n  Mr. President, I don't know how you can say it any more clearly than \nthat. Our version of the prudent layperson standard for emergency \nservices is the right one for several reasons:\n  (1) It's patient-centered; (2) It's comprehensive; (3) It promotes \ncoordination of care with the patient's health plan; (4) It decreases \novercrowding in our nation's emergency rooms by requiring timely \ndecisions; (5) And last but not least, it saves money.\n  Frankly Mr. President, I am puzzled by the fact that my Republican \ncolleagues oppose this language. I can't understand why they oppose \nextending protection for emergency services to all Americans with \nhealth insurance. Shouldn't we do the right thing, and approve the real \nprudent layperson standard?\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to allow us to have an open debate on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. We need to have this debate. Americans \nwant protections in their health plans. Americans want a system that \nbalances the needs for access, quality, and cost-control for their \nhealth care.\n  I am confident that we will have this debate. The last thing any of \nus want to do is put up barriers for patients who need medical care \nduring an emergency.\n  Mr. President, this legislation removes barriers and allows patients \nto get the care they need, providers to deliver care in a timely \nfashion, and health plans the opportunity to coordinate care \nefficiently. I am confident that when we have this debate, we will be \nable to come together and pass the real prudent layperson standard for \nemergency services.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hutchison).

Madam President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nDevils Lake in North Dakota. Most people don't know about Devils Lake. \nIt is one of only two lakes at the bottom of a closed basin in the \nentire country. One is the Great Salt Lake, the other is Devils Lake. \nDevils Lake has a basin about the size of the State of Massachusetts \ntucked inside the borders of North Dakota.\n  To set the stage, North Dakota is ten times the size of \nMassachusetts. Devils Lake has been subject to chronic emergency \nflooding now for many years. That flooding in Devils Lake over recent \nyears has caused absolute chaos for the folks who live in that region \nof northeastern North Dakota.\n  This is a lake that has risen about 25 feet in 7 years. In the past \n60 years, it has risen nearly 50 feet. If you were a family living in \nMinnewaukan, ND, it wasn't too long ago that you lived 7 miles away \nfrom a lake. But recently I was standing in Minnewaukan, and the lake \nis right up to the back yards of that community. In 7 short years, \npeople who lived 7 miles away from the lake now find the lake flooding \ntheir property.\n  The cost of this flooding, in human terms, is massive. The lake \ncontinues to rise in a manner that is uncontrolled, and the question \nfor the Corps of Engineers and the Federal Government is: What do we do \nto respond to the threatening rise of the lake that has occurred in \nrecent years and threatens a fairly large city in North Dakota? It \nthreatens to cut off one region of our state from emergency services \nand the normal commerce of daily life. It inundates roads, railways and \nutilities.\n  In response, over $300 million has been spent in that region raising \nroads and relocating people and building dikes--doing all the things \nnecessary to combat the flooding. This is a different kind of flood, \nunlike a river flood, where we see a picture on television of a swollen \nriver moving very rapidly and causing chaos with houses floating down \nthe river. The lake flooding here has come, and it has stayed, slowly \ndestroying homes and businesses. It is causing major problems.\n  One of the plans with respect to this Devils Lake flooding has been \nto build an outlet. We are building dikes to protect cities and protect \nroads. We are raising roads, using roads as dikes. We are doing all of \nthese things over recent years.\n  One of the pending proposals is to build an outlet to take a small \namount of pressure off the lake. The challenge is that there is no \nproblem-free place to put the water. You could put some of it in the \nSheyenne River, which goes down to the Red River and up into Canada. An \noutlet to the Sheyenne River can provide relief but must be well-\nmanaged to avoid causing problems for others. We don't want to solve a \nproblem by creating a problem for others. The question of building an \noutlet has been a very difficult and sensitive one.\n  By the same token, most everyone believes it is an emergency and we \nmust use a comprehensive strategy to try to take some pressure off this \nlake, including upland storage in the upper part of the basin and \nbuilding an outlet to take some pressure off the lake. However, all of \nthe plans and work to build an outlet have been for naught at this \npoint, because the Corps of Engineers is at odds with itself on the \nquestion of whether an outlet should be built.\n  I came to the Senate floor to put in the Record two things. One is a \n``Draft Summary Document for the Report to Congress on the Emergency \nOutlet from Devils Lake, North Dakota, to the Sheyenne River, North \nDakota.'' This was prepared by the St. Paul District Office of the Army \nCorps of Engineers. I requested this be made available to me by the \nDepartment of the Army's Corps of Engineers Division Office in \nVicksburg, MS.\n  Incidentally, Vicksburg, MS, has jurisdiction over North Dakota. Now, \nLord only knows how that can happen. Tell me how it makes sense for a \ngeneral sitting down in Vicksburg, MS, to tell us about lake flooding \nin North Dakota. But that is the way it is and the way the Corps is \norganized.\n  The St. Paul district, which has spent a great deal of time on this \nissue, prepared this document. I want to read just a bit from the \ndocument. The St. Paul district says pointedly that we face emergency \nconditions. This is the Corps of Engineers, St. Paul office:\n\n       Clearly we face emergency situations and we need to \n     proceed.\n\n  The St. Paul division further says:\n\n       Further study and analysis are not reasonable responses to \n     what is truly an emergency situation. What is required is a \n     proactive, multifaceted emergency flood damage reduction plan \n     to protect not only Devils Lake but the region. The lake is \n     within a single Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) event of \n     overtopping the levees protecting the City of Devils Lake, \n     and for the first time in recorded history, the lake is \n     within single PMF event of spilling into the Sheyenne River . \n     . . . Any project that would prevent the natural overflow \n     would be justified by economics and from a human health and \n     safety perspective.\n\n  Accordingly, the St. Paul District recommends immediate action \nleading to the construction of an emergency outlet.\n  The Mississippi division, which has charge of the St. Paul division, \nis 1,500 miles away. The general at the Mississippi division and his \nstaff have come up with a completely different perspective. They are \nfarther away, spend far less time on this issue, and know much less \nabout the issue. The Mississippi commander wrote a letter to the North \nDakota congressional delegation questioning the summary recommendations \nof the St. Paul office, which has done all of the work on this issue \nand whose experts judged there to be an emergency--one that justifies \nan outlet.\n  The Vicksburg office in Mississippi says that is not the case at all. \nThey say they don't need an outlet. They say, first of all, they are \nnot certain there is an emergency at all. They say an outlet is not \nnecessary or appropriate. ``Of the outlet plans reviewed, none of the \noutlet plans show benefits exceeding costs.''\n  Incidentally, this computation by the Division ``experts'' wouldn't \nmeet third grade math standards. They arbitrarily establish costs and \nbenefits, but then leave out some of the real and major benefits. These \nbenefits include, for example, not having to increase roads in order to \nkeep roads open in this basin. Tens and tens and tens of millions of \ndollars are required to do that. But maybe if you have an outlet you \ndon't have to do that.\n  The Corps of Engineers Division Office says: That is not the problem \nor the complication because we have\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n``principles and guidelines'' to use for the computations. So we leave \nout large categories of costs avoided. Then they say the cost-benefit \ncalculation does not work. The Mississippi division agrees with St. \nPaul that dikes should be built but only supports building an outlet \nsubject to a favorable analysis.\n  In fact, the division doesn't believe that on outlet is appropriate.\n  The St. Paul Corps of Engineers said: Yes to an outlet. They are the \nones who know this region. They study it, and are in charge of it. \nVicksburg, 1,500 miles away, says no.\n  When the Corps decided to move its office to Vicksburg, MS, I had a \nfit. I should have tried to put a wrench in the crankcase then, and I \ndid not do everything I should have done--I admit. It didn't make any \nsense at all to decide that the Corps of Engineers' headquarters for a \nregion similar to that ought to be in Mississippi, 1,500 miles away.\n  Here is the evidence. The evidence is that you have the Corps arguing \nwith the Corps. The St. Paul office, which knows the subject best, \nsays: Here is what ought to be done. It is an emergency. We support an \noutlet for the following reasons. Here is what we ought to do. The \nfolks in Mississippi say: Gee. We don't believe that at all.\n  The only reason I am putting two documents in the Record today by \nconsent--I would like to include in the Record the summary document \nprepared by the St. Paul office of the Corps of Engineers and the \nletter sent to the congressional delegation by General Anderson, who \nruns the Vicksburg office of the Corps of Engineers--is that they \ndirectly contradict each other. Again, it is the same agency.\n  Let me use a couple of charts because I think it is useful to see.\n  This is the level of Devils Lake. You can see what is happening with \nthis lake. This shows 1445.5 feet. It is actually now again up to 1447. \nSo this chart is actually out of date in just a month or two. That \nchart shows what is happening to this lake.\n  Actually, the most appropriate chart to show for Devils Lake is a \nchart that I want to put up. This chart is actually a picture taken of \na woman in 1993. If you look carefully, you can see she is standing at \nthe bottom of the telephone pole in the Devils Lake area.\n  I want to show you where the lake is right now. It is not here. This \nis also out of date. This is 1445.5. The lake is now 1447 feet. It is \nabove this chart. Here is where this woman would be in the lake at the \nmoment with the lake somewhere around 25 or 30 feet above her head. \nThis picture was taken in 1993.\n  That will describe to you what has happened here.\n  I mentioned to you that people who used to live 7 miles away from the \nlake 7 years ago now have a lake behind their homes threatening their \nhouses. This doesn't happen anywhere else in the country. It happens in \nthe Great Salt Lake and in Devils Lake. They are the only two closed \nbasins in America in which you have this kind of flooding. The Great \nSalt Lake threatened a flood in a very dramatic way and receded. But \nDevils Lake continues to increase.\n  I want to show you what is happening. Every single year the Corps of \nEngineers says: Well, we were at 1437 feet, then the height of that \nlake. There is less than a 3-percent chance that it will increase. It \nincreased up to 1443. Then they said there was a less than a 1-percent \nchance it would increase once more. Again, it increased up to 1444.7. \nThey said that there was less than a 1-percent chance again, and it may \nwell increase to 1447.5 by the middle part of this summer.\n  Every single year we are in a wet cycle, and this basin continues to \nflood and cause chaos for the people of that region.\n  Here is the cost. Here is what is happening to us and what happens \nwith respect to this flooding.\n  At some point, this flows naturally across the divide out of the \nbasin with the worst possible quality of water, with dissolved solids \nthat create a terrible quality of water that everyone is afraid of. And \nit flows naturally across the divide at 1460, down into the Sheyenne \nRiver, up the Red River into Canada, causing very significant problem \nfor major population centers.\n  That is why all of us have to be concerned about this.\n  Here is what the damages are when you have that kind of flooding. \nAgain, it is not river flooding where a gushing river grabs a house and \nthrows it downstream and you have dramatic pictures. It is a lake that \ngobbles up a region, people, property, and hope inch by inch.\n  What is happening is the cumulative damages, as this lake goes up, \nare massive--about $300 million to date, and the prospect is much more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the document \nthat I asked the Vicksburg office to provide me which reflects the \nrecommendations by the Corps of Engineers at the St. Paul office, and \nalso the document that is offered by the general who is in charge of \nthe Vicksburg office.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Draft Summary Document for the Report to Congress on the Emergency \n           Outlet from Devils Lake, ND to the Sheyenne River,\n\n    (Prepared by the St. Paul District Office of the Army Corps of \n                               Engineers)\n\n                            Summary Document\n\n\n                           executive summary\n\n       Conditions in the Devils Lake basin have changed \n     dramatically. The continued rise of Devils Lake has \n     exacerbated the flooding concern around the lake. The higher \n     lake level has created a situation where a single \n     catastrophic event would overtop the levees protecting the \n     City of Devils Lake and overflow to the Sheyenne River. This \n     has serious international, regional, and environmental \n     implications. The strategies employed to date cannot be \n     expected to provide a timely solution. Further study and \n     analysis are not reasonable responses to what is truly an \n     emergency situation. What is required is a proactive, \n     multifaceted emergency flood damage reduction plan to protect \n     not only Devils Lake but the region.\n     Current lake level situation\n       Devils Lake is now at the highest level (elevation 1445.5) \n     in recorded times. Although the lake is a terminal lake, it \n     has naturally spilled to the Sheyenne River several times in \n     geologic history. The last spill was likely 800 to 1200 years \n     ago. The 1999 forecast is for the lake to rise another 2 feet \n     to elevation 1447.5 by August. The 1999 inflow is forecast to \n     be the second largest on record even though the basin had a \n     reasonably mild winter and near normal preciptation this \n     spring. The lake level is extremely sensitive to small \n     climatic shifts, which might be the case given the persistent \n     wet cycle over the last 7 years. The continuing lake rise is \n     necessitating additional emergency flood control measures to \n     protect urban areas and transportation routes.\n     Curent efforts\n       Solving the rising lake problem is not easy, and the \n     pursuit of a single solution offers little hope. Currently, \n     three separate flood damage reduction activities are being \n     pursued--upper basin management, infrastructure protection, \n     and a managed outlet. Numerous entities are pursuing water \n     management measures to reduce runoff and store water in the \n     upper basin. Infrastructure protection is being implemented \n     by local counties and cities, the Federal Highway \n     Administration, the North Dakota Department of \n     Transportation, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n     (FEMA), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Corps of \n     Engineers, and private citizens. To date, infrastructure \n     protection--raising roads and levees and evacuating \n     structures--has been provided in incremental steps that \n     usually just stay ahead of the steadily rising lake, although \n     in some cases the lake has risen faster than the level of \n     protection.\n       This year, the Corps of Engineers is completing the final \n     authorized raise of the levees protecting the City of Devils \n     Lake to elevation 1450 with top of levee at 1457. FEMA issued \n     a ``Continuous Lake Flooding Waiver'' in 1996, 1997, and \n     1998, which changed their policies to allow for buyouts of \n     properties expected to be affected by the forecasted lake \n     rise. A waiver for 1999 is being sought. Highways 19, 20, \n     57, and 281 have been or are being raised by the North \n     Dakota Department of Transportation. Emergency actions are \n     being pursued for other communities by the State, \n     counties, and Corps of Engineers. Agencies have worked \n     with the Spirit Lake Tribe to try to protect \n     infrastructure on tribal properties and keep \n     transportation routes to and from the Spirit Lake \n     Reservation open.\n       In response to the Energy and Water Development \n     Appropriations Acts of 1998/99, the Corps of Engineers is \n     also investigating the possibility of developing an emergency \n     outlet from Devils Lake to the Sheyenne River. That \n     authorization is contingent upon there being an emergency \n     declaration and that the project is technically sound, \n     economically justified, environmentally acceptable, and in \n     compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). \n     There also need to be assurances that the discharges from the \n     outlet will not violate the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty with \n     Canada. A report to Congress is required on the findings of \n     the outlet investigations, which is the purpose of this \n     document.\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\n     Preliminary report to Congress findings\n       The concept of an outlet from Devils Lake has been the \n     subject of several studies. To meet water quality standards \n     in the Sheyenne River and Red River of the North, the only \n     viable plan appeared to be an outlet from the fresher, west \n     end of this saline lake. However, the effectiveness of even a \n     west end outlet is limited because the salinity constrains \n     the rate of releases in order to meet the downstream water \n     quality standards.\n       A plan developed by the Corps of Engineers in December 1998 \n     indicated that, to be effective in lowering or controlling \n     the rising lake levels while meeting downstream water quality \n     standards, the outlet would have to remove fresh water from \n     the basin before it mixed with Devils Lake water. Studies \n     since December have concentrated on freshwater alternatives \n     that would allow a higher discharge that stays within the \n     water quality and channel capacity constraints on the \n     Sheyenne and Red Rivers.\n       The constantly changing lake level, flood protection \n     measures, and other circumstances combined with current Corps \n     policies and principles and guidelines have made it \n     challenging and virtually impossible for the hydrologic, \n     economic, and water quality modeling and analysis to keep \n     ahead of events. Consequently, an economically justified \n     solution concentrating on the damages prevented within the \n     basin has been elusive.\n       Findings from these recent studies indicate that an \n     economically feasible solution cannot be developed using the \n     current economic and hydrologic models. Benefit-cost ratios \n     vary from 0.12 to 0.72 depending on what assumptions for a \n     without-project condition are used. Also, a outlet of 300 \n     cubic feet per second (cfs) has limited effectiveness in \n     terms of reducing peak lake levels, although the maximum \n     drawdown in the lake could be as much as 8 feet. These \n     results, however, do not take into account downstream \n     benefits from an outlet's reduction in the probability, \n     severity, and duration of natural spills to the Sheyenne \n     River.\n       Of the five separate criteria set forth by Congress for \n     outlet authorization, all but two could be met, assuming \n     satisfactory consultation with the State Department and \n     satisfactory completion of the NEPA process. The current \n     analysis shows that economic feasibility is lacking, and due \n     to the extremely controversial nature of the emergency outlet \n     and many outspoken opponents, a consensus on environmental \n     acceptability would be extremely difficult to achieve.\n     Reframed problem\n       With the release of the April 1999 forecast by the National \n     Weather Service (NWS), the flooding problem has changed from \n     protecting the properties around the lake to also protecting \n     the region from a natural overflow from Devils Lake to the \n     Sheyenne River. The lake is within a single Probable Maximum \n     Flood (PMF) event of overtopping the levees protecting the \n     City of Devils Lake and, for the first time in recorded \n     history, the lake is within a single PMF event of spilling to \n     the Sheyenne River.\n       A natural overflow to the Sheyenne River could cause \n     catastrophic flooding and water quality effects for residents \n     along the Sheyenne and Red Rivers. Ecosystem impacts of a \n     prolonged spill would be devastating. Computer simultations \n     show that an overflow could exceed the Sheyenne River's \n     channel capacity by a factor of more than two and the river's \n     sulfate standard by a factor of more than seven. In addition, \n     should the water flow out naturally, erosion would cut into \n     the divide and increase the discharge and downstream effects \n     even further.\n       Although, the downstream damages have not been quantified, \n     it is expected that any project that would prevent the \n     natural overflow would be justified by economics and from a \n     human health and safety perspective. The problem now becomes \n     one of dealing with the emergency in time to allow for final \n     design and implementation of a plan before it is too late. To \n     determine the urgency of taking action, the Corps of \n     Engineers analyzed when action would be needed to prevent a \n     natural overflow to the Sheyenne River assuming a \n     continuation of the average net inflow to the lake over the \n     last 7 years and assuming a 2-year construction period. Using \n     this approach, construction should have begun at lake \n     elevation 1441.8 to prevent a PMF from overflowing naturally \n     and at 1451.3 to prevent a natural spill from a Standard \n     Project Flood (SPF). To prevent overtopping of the City of \n     Devils Lake levee system by an SPF, construction would need \n     to begin at lake elevation 1448.0, 0.5 foot above the 1999 \n     forecast lake level. This incidates that plans and \n     specifications for both an outlet and a 3-foot raise of the \n     city's levee should begin immediately to allow for a \n     construction start early in 2000.\n       To demonstrate how quickly the situation is deteriorating, \n     in February 1999, the Corps of Engineers was working on a \n     plan to divert water from Devils Lake to the Stump Lakes. \n     This plan made sense on the basis of the NWS's initial \n     forecast of a 1446.0 peak lake level. Using the Stump Lakes' \n     storage could limit Devils Lake's near-term rise and buy time \n     to deal with the emergency outlet situation. However, at the \n     NWS's 9 April 1999 revised forecast for a peak lake level of \n     1447.5, Devils Lake will begin a natural spill to the \n     Stump Lakes, and if Devils Lake continues to rise next \n     year, implementation of this plan may not be a prudent or \n     practical option. Having possibly missed the window of \n     opportunity for a diversion to Stump Lake emphasizes how \n     important it is not to miss the window of opportunity for \n     an emergency outlet that might prevent the lake from \n     overtopping the city's levee or spilling uncontrolled to \n     the Sheyenne River.\n     Report to Congress\n       This summary report to Congress has been prepared to \n     present the most recent findings regarding the emergency \n     outlet to the Sheyenne River and to discuss the changing \n     conditions at Devils Lake that warrant a new fast-track \n     approach. Hope, incremental solutions, and constrained \n     measures are no longer an acceptable course of action. The \n     report proposes a solution and a timetable capable of dealing \n     with this evolving emergency situation; details are being \n     worked out. The plan would involve six actions:\n       Building a west-end outlet with a discharge rate between \n     500 and 600 cfs to help prevent lake rises; however, this \n     outlet would not be capable of keeping up with inflow from an \n     extreme event.\n       Raising the height of the City of Devils Lake levee.\n       Developing a contingency plan for an emergency spillway \n     consisting of a controlled and armored outlet from the east \n     end of Devils Lake into the Sheyenne River to prevent a \n     natural overflow from eroding and causing a catastrophic \n     spill.\n       Revising Public Law 84-99 Flood and Coastal Stream \n     Emergency Act policies to better deal with the flooding \n     problems on the Spirit Lake Reservation.\n       Continuing emergency actions at Churchs Ferry, Minnewaukan, \n     and other communities within the Devils Lake basin on an as-\n     needed basis.\n       Mitigating downstream flooding caused by operation of the \n     outlet.\n       By implementing the above actions, the risk of the \n     catastrophic damages to the Devils Lake region as well as the \n     risk of significant damages along the Sheyenne and Red Rivers \n     would be substantially reduced. If no action is taken, the \n     decision to accept the consequences is implicit. Further \n     study and analysis is not considered an appropriate response \n     to this emergency situation.\n     Where do we go from here\n       The resources of local interests are exhausted from 7 \n     straight years of devastating floods in the Devils Lake \n     basin. The local interests are tired of worrying about the \n     rising lake, the loss of property, the evacuation of their \n     neighbors, and the uncertainty of getting a solution through \n     normal channels. They are proactively pushing for an answer, \n     and they recently passed a resolution supporting local \n     construction of an east-end spillway.\n       The North Dakota Congressional Delegation and the Governor \n     consider Devils Lake to be one of the most important issues \n     in the State and are working hard to try to solve the Devils \n     Lake problem. The Corps of Engineers role has been to build \n     levees, to protect urban areas, and to study the problem and \n     a possible outlet. But the focus has been on solving the \n     internal flood problem to the Devils Lake basin. Now, with a \n     natural spill to the Sheyenne River being a statistical \n     reality, the focus must change to do what is necessary to \n     protect the region from a disaster by treating the situation \n     as a real emergency.\n       We first need to use latitude that the Corps of Engineers \n     already has to develop plans and specifications for an \n     outlet, a levee raise, a contingency plan for an emergency \n     spillway, and protection measures for each community around \n     the lake. Second, we need to use the Corps of Engineers \n     emergency authorities under Public Law 84-99 to start \n     construction of the levee raise and community protection \n     measures as well as the west end emergency outlet using the \n     shortest possible implementation methods. We also need to \n     consult with the Council on Environmental Quality regarding \n     concurrent compliance with NEPA. In addition, coordination \n     between the State Department and the International Joint \n     Commission regarding compliance with the Boundary Waters \n     Treaty of 1909 should begin immediately.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of the Army, Mississippi Valley Division, \n           Corps of Engineers,\n                                     Vicksburg, Ms, June 17, 1999.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: This is in response to your letter \n     dated June 10, 1999, concerning an outlet for Devils Lake. I \n     have sent this same response to Senator Conrad, \n     Representative Pomeroy, and Governor Schafer. The Corps \n     recognizes that emergency conditions exist within the Devils \n     Lake area. We will continue to respond, to the limit of our \n     authority, to minimize damages within the basin. While I \n     understand your concern and frustration in finding a timely \n     remedy for this rising lake, I have not reached a conclusion \n     that an outlet is a necessary or appropriate solution to the \n     recent rise of water in Devils Lake.\n       Our analyses and my recommendations will be contained in an \n     Interim Report to Congress that will be completed by St. Paul \n     District and submitted in mid-July for Headquarters, U.S. \n     Army Corps of Engineers and the Assistant Secretary of the \n     Army for Civil Works' review and approval. For your \n     convenience, I have enclosed a copy of my recommendations. I \n     have recommended that we complete the Final Report to \n     Congress, which will include analyses of several \n     alternatives, including outlet plans. One of those\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n     plans will have an objective of holding the lake at elevation \n     1454. The Final Report to Congress will contain a fully \n     coordinated Environmental Impact Statement. It will also \n     address the other criteria of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Acts of 1998 and 1999.\n       The recently completed Technical Report is the product of a \n     joint Division and District team that looked into the timing \n     and consequences of an uncontrolled overflow from Devils \n     Lake into the Sheyenne River. Due to time constraints, \n     that report relied heavily on the data and analyses \n     contained in the Limits Study completed by St. Paul \n     District in 1998. The Technical Report did not analyze the \n     benefits of lowering the lake. There would be minor \n     benefits from the re-emergence of some of the abandoned \n     secondary roads, but since they were not considered in the \n     Limits Study, these benefits were not included. Some \n     benefits would also result from return of submerged \n     agricultural lands to productivity. However, in accordance \n     with the Limits Study, we assumed that these benefits \n     would be negated by the salinity of the saturating water, \n     which would preclude an early return to productivity. If \n     all the cropland and fallow acreage between elevations \n     1440 and 1447 were returned to productivity, the average \n     annual benefits would be about $1 million.\n       As to the hydrologic modeling, it is important to note that \n     the inflows were assumed to equal those experienced during \n     the recent wet period from 1993 through 1998. Thus, a high \n     inflow rate to the lake has been assumed in the Technical \n     Report analysis. Even so, this results in the lake taking \n     longer to rise to higher levels than previously estimated \n     because the recent hydrologic modeling results utilized in \n     the Technical Report are based on a more accurate estimate of \n     future evaporation as the lake rises and its surface area \n     becomes much greater.\n       The analytical tools used in the Devils Lake study are \n     designed specifically for the unique system at Devils Lake. \n     This, unlike a riverine system, has no outlet and the lake \n     levels are not independent of each other from one year to the \n     next. For example, the model used to estimate the probability \n     of future lake levels, given the current level of the lake, \n     is uniquely suited for a closed basin such as Devils Lake. It \n     has limitations in that following the snow melt and spring \n     runoff each year, the probability of future lake levels must \n     be recomputed. This is required because it is not possible to \n     accurately forecast snow pack and spring runoff for the next \n     year, which will produce next year's lake level.\n       I appreciate your continued interest in this effort and \n     look forward to working together to solve this most \n     unfortunate problem.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Phillip R. Anderson,\n\n                                         Major General, U.S. Army,\n                                                Division Engineer.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n                            recommendations\n\n       1. Establish six (6) feet of freeboard as design standard \n     for advance measures on Devils Lake.\n       2. Immediately proceed with necessary reports to include \n     NEPA compliance and PCA Amendment to raise Devils Lake Levee \n     to TOL 1460.\n       3. Following completion of necessary reports and PCA, raise \n     Devils Lake levee to TOL 1460.\n       4. Complete Interim Report to Congress within 30 days for \n     submittal to HQUSACE and ASA(CW). Interim Report will target \n     holding lake level at elevation 1454 or lower.\n       5. Complete Final Report to Congress with analyses of \n     several alternatives, including outlet plans. One of those \n     plans will have as an objective holding the lake to elevation \n     1454. The Final Report to Congress will include a fully \n     coordinated Environmental Impact Statement. The Report to \n     Congress will also address the other criteria of the Energy \n     and Water Development Appropriations Acts, 1998 and 1999. \n     Subject to analyses favorable to an outlet, plan completion \n     of the Report to Congress to allow initiation of P if the \n     lake approaches elevation 1452 (about 2005) and construction \n     if the lake approaches elevation 1453 (about 2006).\n       6. Continue to define trigger points for other actions \n     around the lake. Provide incremental protection for Churchs \n     Ferry, Minnewaukan, Spirit Lake Nation, and other communities \n     in accordance with PL 84-99 and in coordination with local, \n     State and other Federal interests.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Madam President, if the Senator from Mississippi is \nprepared to speak on something, I would be happy to defer. I want to \nspeak for 5 minutes on something that is going to happen, perhaps, in a \nday or so. I have spoken about this a great deal. That is the question \nof interest rates and the Federal Reserve Board that will be meeting \nthis week.\n  We are told that the Federal Reserve Board will almost certainly \nincrease interest rates later this week. I thought it would be \ninteresting to include in a discussion on the floor an analysis of what \nhas happened to the rate of inflation in this country.\n  Interest rates are still at a rather high rate after adjusting for \ninflation. The economic rent for money is still very high given the \nhistoric American standards. The inflation rate--especially the core \ninflation rate--has dropped very dramatically in recent years. \nIncidentally, despite all the predictions by all of the best economists \nat the Fed and elsewhere, they used to say if you penetrate through 6 \npercent unemployment you clearly have massive inflation problems. You \njust can't have low unemployment and low inflation.\n  The economy, of course, confounded all of them. I think part of the \nreason was the models are all wrong. The models reflect traditional \neconomic theory, and that doesn't account for the global economy in \nwhich producers produce anywhere they want in the world at lower costs \nand, therefore, put downward pressure on wages in the industrialized \ncountries. But despite that, even if the models are wrong, what has \nhappened is that as unemployment has reduced in this country and come \ndown rather dramatically over the years, so too has inflation.\n  Looking at the rates of inflation, the Consumer Price Index, going \nback to 1990, we were at 6 percent, then down to just over 3 percent, \nunder 3 percent, and down under 2 percent. The fact is inflation is \nwell under control. The downward pressures that the global economy has \nput on wages in this country, I think, will continue to keep the rate \nof inflation well under control.\n  The Federal Reserve Board has a different set of circumstances it \nwill evaluate. The Federal Reserve Board is an interesting board. It \nwas created in the nineteen-teens. President Wilson and those involved \npromised the country: We are not and will not ever create a strong \ncentral bank. We just won't do that.\n  For many years, of course, the Fed has had a central banking function \nthat has been enormously strong, and largely unaccountable. Some people \nthink that is a virtue to be unaccountable to anything or anyone else \nin the country so it can run monetary policy as it sees fit, unlike \nothers who are involved in the executive and legislative branch running \nfiscal policy.\n  The Federal Reserve Board is made up of a Board of Governors. We have \none seat vacant. We have one seat that is being vacated. It is also \njoined in the Open Market Committee by a rotating group of members of \nthe presidents of the regional Federal Reserve banks. The presidents of \nthe Federal Reserve banks are hired and retained by their boards of \ndirectors who are their bankers in their regions. Despite the fact they \nare not confirmed by anyone and are accountable only to the bankers and \nboards of directors in their region, they come to town on a rotating \nbasis with the Board of Governors' to vote on interest rate policy.\n  The Fed will probably, the day after tomorrow, decide it should \nincrease short-term interest rates again. I don't agree with that. I \nthink it is a terrible decision to make. I don't think any evidence \nthat justifies a hike in rates. Some of my colleagues come to the floor \nand say: What are you talking about? Mr. Greenspan ought to be credited \nfor the great economy.\n  In my opinion, this nation's economic performance--if you review the \nrecord--is in spite of the estimates by Mr. Greenspan and the Federal \nReserve Board. They insisted we could not\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\npierce 6-percent unemployment without having a rekindling of inflation. \nThey were wrong. The unemployment rate has remained below 6-percent for \nnearly five years with low inflation.\n  Now the Fed will say it has finally seen a demon in a closet \nsomewhere called inflation that they can use to justify increasing \ninterest rates. I think they are wrong. The American people, and \nespecially producers, are already paying a higher economic rent for \nmoney than is currently warranted, given the core rate of inflation.\n  Organizations such as the National Association of Manufacturers \nbelieve it is not appropriate to have the Federal Reserve Board once \nagain increase interest rates. The National Association of \nManufacturers sent a fax sheet last Friday to 535 Members of the House \nand the Senate detailing why they think interest rates are already high \nenough and that an increase in the rates is not justified in light of \nan already slowing economy.\n  I happen to agree with that; I know others do not. I also happen to \nthink the Federal Reserve Board and these Members ought to have some \nbasic accountability. We ought to at least give them credit if you \nthink they have done a wonderful job. Here are their names, addresses, \npedigrees, and grey suits. Here are their salaries.\n  If you think, however, they are pursuing an unreasonably high \ninterest rate policy, given the rate of inflation, here is who they \nare. Here is how much money they make. Here is who the regional Fed \nbank board of directors have appointed to be in charge of public \npolicy. They come on a rotating basis, galloping into Washington, DC, \nshutting their large oak doors and make a decision on behalf of \nAmerica. They will decide they think interest rates aren't high enough.\n\n  They have decided for a long while that too many people were working \nin this country--a decision I did not quite understand. They serve \ntheir own constituents; their constituents are their member banks. \nPerhaps some day we can have a debate about monetary policy in this \nSenate. A century ago it used to be debated in barber shops and bars.\n  Not too long ago, I studied money and banking in graduate school. \nLyndon Johnson was President and William McChesney Martin was head of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. He was going to increase interest rates by \none-quarter of 1 percent. Lyndon Johnson sent for him to come down to \nthe ranch in the Perdinales in Texas for a barbecue. He put his arms \naround him and almost squeezed barbecue juice over that fellow--all \nover one-quarter of 1 percent.\n  Now it is not a big deal. The Fed shuts their door and everybody \nsays: Hosanna--whatever the Fed thinks is what the economic doctrine \nought to be.\n  Not with me. I think there is no justification with respect to the \nrate of inflation for the Fed to put this additional charge on American \nproducers or the American people. When the Fed meets this week behind \nclosed doors--and this is who they are, where they live, how much money \nthey make--give them credit or blame them, depending on your economic \ndoctrine.\n  My policy is interest rates are higher than is justified, or higher \nthan justified at this point, given the rate of inflation in this \ncountry. The economic rent now charged for money exceeds the economic \nrent by historical standards over a long period of time. For the Fed to \nshut its doors and decide the economic rent ought to be higher, in my \njudgment, is fundamentally wrong.\n  That is probably a minority view these days, given the reverence for \nFed policy, but it is at least therapeutic for me to say it on a \nMonday, preceding the Fed's meeting. If they increase interest rates at \ntheir meeting this week, I will come back with more to say. I hope \nperhaps they will surprise me and others and decide there is no data to \njustify an increase in interest rates given the rate of inflation in \nour economy today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, we have had a health care debate for the \nlast couple of weeks. The problem is that we are on appropriations \nbills. We are trying to pass a bill that will help stabilize the \ncondition of farms and ranches all over America.\n  However, our colleagues on the Democrat side of the aisle have seemed \ndetermined to talk about health care. I will talk about health care \ntoday.\n  I begin by saying, first of all, this is not the beginning of the \nhealth care debate. Here are some bills we have debated on health care \nsince President Clinton has been in office. This is the Clinton health \ncare bill. We were told in 1993 there was a crisis in America and we \nneeded to deal with it. The way to deal with it was setting up health \ncare collectives where every American would be forced to buy their \nhealth care from one in their geographic region that would be set up \nwith a local collective leader, appointed by the Government. Then all \nthe doctors would work for this health care collective and the \nGovernment from Washington would issue mandates.\n  Then people such as myself said that this is a terrible loss of \nfreedom. When you adopt the Clinton health care bill that I have on the \ndesk, when my mama is sick, she will end up talking to a bureaucrat \ninstead of a doctor. We were told by Senator Kennedy and by President \nClinton we have to give up this freedom because we have 30 million \nAmerican families who have no health insurance.\n  So in 1993, we were told if we would pass these bills and let \nGovernment run the health care system, if we would force every American \ninto a health care collective where Government could run it efficiently \nand where Government could guarantee our health care, that we would \nlose some freedom, but we would deal with the problem of lack of \ncoverage. We were told that the problem in 1993 was access.\n  We had a big debate. At one point 82 percent of the American people \nthought these health care collectives were a great idea. Finally, a few \nMembers of Congress stood up and said, ``Over my cold, dead political \nbody.'' It was like somebody had taken a pin and stuck it in a big, fat \ninflated balloon. It just went whoosh, and suddenly everybody decided \nthis was not a debate about health care; this was a debate about \nfreedom.\n  The reason I go back to this history is two things. First of all, \nplease remember when we are debating the so-called Health Care Bill of \nRights, it has the same authors who wrote the Clinton health care bill \nsetting up health care collectives. They have not changed their minds \nabout what kind of American health care they want. They really believe \nthe Government knows best. They really believe if the Government ran \nthe health care system that everybody could have access and everything \nwould be better because the Government, through these health care \ncollectives, could make decisions for us and we are basically ignorant \npeople and we do not know how to make decisions for ourselves. This was \nand is still their goal.\n  We defeated the Clinton health care bill because the American people \ndecided it may have been Senator Kennedy's goal, it may have been Bill \nClinton's goal, but it was not their goal. In fact, I would have to say \nthat during the months I debated this bill by talking about cost and \nabout efficiency, it was similar to throwing rocks at a tank. But \nsuddenly when the issue changed to freedom and the right to chose, we \nblew the tank up.\n  The same people who several years ago said give up your freedom \nbecause the problem is access changed their minds once we defeated \nthem. Now they have a new health care bill they call the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. Oh, it does have something I guess you could call rights. \nLet me explain the basic problem and then I want to explain what they \ncall rights and then I want to explain what I call rights and what I \nthink Main Street America would call rights.\n  Here is the problem in a nutshell. First of all, having spent 2 years \ntrying to sell us on the idea we should give up our freedom to get \naccess, they now say: Access is not a problem. Forget the 30 million \npeople who do not have health insurance. In fact, Senator Kennedy's \nbill would take health insurance away from another 1.4 million \nAmericans by driving up costs. These are estimates by the Congressional \nBudget Office. For the people who did not lose\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\ntheir health insurance, they would pay $57.2 billion more in costs. And \nby losing their health insurance--by the way, that would mean next \nyear, if we pass the Kennedy health care bill this year, there would be \n150,220 fewer breast examinations given to people who might have breast \ncancer; it would mean there would be 42,194 fewer mammograms; it would \nmean there would be 107,628 fewer Pap tests; it means there would be \n18,458 fewer screenings for prostate cancer.\n  When I am saying Senator Kennedy's bill, by the CBO estimates, would \ntake insurance away from 1.4 million people, and for the people who got \nto keep their insurance because they had enough income, it would cost \nthem $57.2 million, don't think I am just talking about money. Don't \nthink I am just talking about a piece of paper that says ``Insurance \nPolicy.'' I am talking about breast examinations, mammograms, Pap \ntests, and prostate screenings. I am talking about lives. I am talking \nabout families. I am talking about your mama. I am talking about people \nyou care about. This is a big issue. It is an important issue.\n  What is the problem that Senator Kennedy wants, or tells us he wants, \nto deal with this year. The problem several years ago was too much \nfreedom, and we had to get people in these health care collectives \nwhere Government could provide health care. Now the problem is the \nprivate HMOs, after which these Government collectives were modeled, \nare not giving people enough choices. The same things the Kennedy bill \ndenied when it was the Clinton health care bill, such as the right to \nsue the Government when it was providing health care, now, all of a \nsudden, Senator Kennedy wants to give you the right to sue your doctor. \nSo under the Kennedy plan, if your baby is sick and running a 104 \nfever, you may not be able to get a doctor, but you can sue. For most \npeople, that is not what they want. But it is interesting that Senator \nKennedy, who denied you the right to sue when he was going to let \nGovernment run the health care system, now is willing to attack the \nprivate sector and to expand lawsuits.\n  What does he claim he wants to deal with? What he claims he wants to \ndeal with is the following problem. People join HMOs to try to hold \ndown medical costs. You have two people who are working, they have \nthree children, they are trying to make ends meet in their family, they \nare sitting down the first day of the month at the kitchen table \nwriting those checks, trying to figure out how they are going to pay \nthe bills. So they join an HMO because it is cheaper. The one thing \nthey are very much unhappy about is that the HMO too often gets in \nbetween them and their doctor.\n  Let me just do a little analogy, if I may. It is similar to going \ninto the examination room with your doctor--even with your doctor you \nfeel a little bit uncomfortable taking off your clothes; everybody has \nhad that experience. But with an HMO it is almost like the HMO \ngatekeeper is in the examination room with you. What you really want is \nto get him out of the room and leave you just with your doctor. What \nyou want is what we show here--if you will just forget the symbols for \na minute and just look at this stethoscope--what you want is you at one \nend of the stethoscope and your doctor's ears at the other end and you \nwant to get any HMO gatekeeper out of the examining room.\n  Senator Kennedy looks at this problem and here is his solution. His \nsolution to the problem is: OK, you are unhappy because you are in the \nexamining room and you have this gatekeeper in there with you and your \ndoctor. Here is how he solves the problem: He solves the problem by \nsaying, OK, you have your doctor in there, you have your HMO in there, \nand then what he calls your rights--his Patients' Bill of Rights--your \nright is not to get the gatekeeper from the HMO out of the examining \nroom. That is not your right. Your right is to have a Government \nbureaucrat join the HMO gatekeeper and your doctor in the examining \nroom with you, and then to have a lawyer join the Government bureaucrat \nwho joins the HMO gatekeeper in getting between you and your doctor.\n  So Senator Kennedy's solution to your problem is he puts two more \npeople in the examining room with you. What kind of freedom does he \ngive you? It is an interesting concept of freedom. I do not want to \nsound too partisan, but it sure defines the difference between the two \nparties. Freedom to Senator Kennedy is having a Government bureaucrat \nwho is there who might take your side. Freedom to Senator Kennedy is \nfreedom to hire a lawyer and sue somebody.\n  That is not the freedom most Americans are talking about when they \ntalk about freedom. Freedom is the right to choose. Freedom is the \nright to fire your HMO. Freedom is the right to make your own \ndecisions. That is what freedom is about. This so-called Kennedy \nPatients' Bill of Rights may be about rights, but it is not about \nfreedom.\n  The Republican alternative, which we would like to debate and hope to \nadopt--in fact, to facilitate the debate, our leader has suggested over \nand over the most eminently reasonable proposal I can imagine. The \neminently reasonable proposal is, let the Democrats write the best bill \nthey can write, where they pick exactly the bureaucrat they want who \nwill be there with the gatekeeper in the examining room with you, and \nthen set up the system where you can hire the best lawyer you want to \nbe there, all of them listening to your heartbeat with your doctor--the \nbureaucrat ready to regulate and the lawyer ready to sue. Let them \nwrite the best program they can write, and let us write our best \nprogram, and then let's put them before the Senate and let Members \nchoose.\n  Our Democrat colleagues do not want to do that because they know what \nwill happen. They know that ours will be chosen. Now we have spent \nweeks and weeks fooling around with this thing.\n  To get to the point I want to make, because I know our leader is \ncoming over in a minute to start the debate, the Democrat bill is not \nwhat people want. This is not freedom. What people want is the right to \nfire their doctor, if they want to fire their doctor, to fire their \nHMO, if they want to fire their HMO, and choose for themselves. On a \ndark night when their baby has a 104-degree fever, they do not want to \nbe given the freedom to call a lawyer, they want to be given the \nfreedom to call a doctor. What good does calling a lawyer do after the \nfact? They want the ability to call a doctor to get the best medical \ncare they can for their child.\n  Our bill goes back to this chart. That is, there are two people in \nthe examining room, and you choose to put both of them there under our \nbill. No. 1, you choose to put yourself there; and, No. 2, you choose \nthe doctor who is in the examining room with you.\n  How does it work? Under our bill, we give people freedom. We give \npeople the right to choose. One of the choices--and I can go through \nmany provisions of our bill. I am just going through one today, and it \nhas to do with medical savings accounts.\n  When we first started debating medical savings accounts, a lot of our \nDemocrat colleagues were for them, but now that they understand them, \nthey hate them, and they hate them because they empower people. They \nempower mothers and they empower fathers to make decisions rather than \ngovernments or HMO's.\n  This is how it works. You have a choice, and one of the choices you \ncan exercise is to set up a medical savings account. You would buy an \ninsurance policy, and you would choose that insurance policy from the \ncompany you want to provide the services. It would guarantee your \nmedical expenses beyond, say, $3,000 of expenditures, so that if \nsomebody gets really sick, you have an insurance policy. But then you \nand your employee would together over time put $3,000 into a medical \nsavings account, and that money would belong to you.\n  Each year, if you had medical expenses, you could spend it out of the \nmedical savings account, where you choose how to spend it on health \ncare and who provides the service, and if at the end of the year you \nhave not spent the money, it belongs to you. So you have an incentive \nto be cost conscious and efficient and to have a stake in your health \ncare system. But also, you have the right to choose.\n  Here is how Senator Kennedy's plan works. Under his plan--and let me \ntake the Washington phone book because it is on top--under his plan, \nyou have total freedom to look under ``lawyer'' and hire any lawyer you \nwant to sue,\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\nbut you do not have the total freedom to look under ``physician'' and \nhire any physician.\n\n  Under Senator Kennedy's plan, assume, to make a long story short, it \nis 2 o'clock in the morning. My youngest son Jeff, let's say he is 3 \nyears old--actually he is 22 now, but he was 3--and let's say he has a \n103-degree fever. I am never spooked fever until when I see it in my \nown children. When my children are sick, like any father, I begin to \nget nervous.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's plan, I get out the telephone book and I look \nunder ``physician.'' I am not interested in a lawyer. A lawyer cannot \ndo me any good. If I do not get help quickly, I may want to look up and \ncall a preacher. I figure he might do me good, but a lawyer is not \ngoing to do me any good.\n  Under Senator Kennedy's plan, I get out the phone book and look up \n``physician'' and ``services.'' Under his plan, I have to call people \nup and say: I know it is 2 o'clock in the morning, but I am in such and \nsuch HMO. Are you a member of my network? Do you participate in the \nprogram I participate in? They may or they may not. Most of them do \nnot. In fact, if one goes down the list and picks the biggest network \navailable in Washington, DC, only a very small fraction of the doctors \nlisted in the phone book are members of that network.\n  How does our plan work? My wife and I have put money into our medical \nsavings account. We can have it in one of three forms. We can do it \nwith a checking account. This is an actual medical savings account \nprogram by Golden Rule Insurance. They give you a checking account, out \nof which you pay medical bills.\n  This card is through Mellon Bank, and this is a medical savings \naccount. It is a MasterCard.\n  This is through Visa, and it is a medical savings account from \nAmerican Health Value.\n  It is 2 o'clock in the morning, and I have a sick child. Under our \nplan, I call up and I have to ask only one question: Do you take a \ncheck? Do you take MasterCard? Do you take Visa? If he does, that \ndoctor is my doctor.\n  I picked a page of the phone book and had my trusty aides call. This \nis on page 1017 of the DC phone book. On page 1017 of the DC phone \nbook, there is not one doctor on that page who will not take a check. \nThere is not one doctor on that page who will not take a MasterCard. \nThere is not one doctor on that page who will not take Visa. In other \nwords, under the Republican plan, if your baby is sick, you can go to \nany doctor. If your baby is sick, you choose.\n  What is freedom? Freedom in health care is not the ability to have a \nGovernment bureaucrat second-guess the HMO which is second-guessing \nyour doctor. That is not what freedom is about. Freedom is not being \nable to have a lawyer who can sue the HMO which is second-guessing the \ndoctor and sue your doctor. That is not what freedom is about.\n  Freedom is about the ability to fire your HMO. Freedom is about the \nability to choose. Why don't we have a situation where we make \neverybody go to one kind of grocery store and we have the Government \nregulate it? We can set up the ability to sue them. We do not do that \nbecause, basically, it does not work. That is how we run Government, \nand that is why it works so poorly.\n  If a grocery store does not sell what I like, I do not go there. If \npeople do not clean my shirts or if the gas I put in the car makes it \nrun poorly, I go to another station and buy another kind of \ngasoline. All through my life I exercise my freedom to choose. What the \nRepublican plan brings to health care is the freedom to choose.\n\n  We have gone so far down this road, where we are making American \nhealth care look like this, that even our hometown doctors are talking \nabout joining labor unions because they want somebody to help them \nnegotiate with the bureaucrat, they want somebody to help them \nnegotiate with the HMO, and they want some ability to protect \nthemselves from lawsuits.\n  Is that what we want in American health care? I don't think so. I \nthink we want freedom. We want people to have the right to choose. What \nour bill does is do that. It gives you an opportunity to hire anybody \nyou want to hire, to pick up any phone book in any city--I have here a \nphone book from Atlanta, GA. Again, you open up the part of the phone \nbook that has to do with the listing of physicians, and any time you \npick up the phone, when you have a medical savings account, you can \nsay: Do you take a check? Do you take MasterCard? Do you take Visa? If \nthey do, you are in.\n  Under our bill, you do not find yourself without health care because \nyou are a member of some medical group in Washington but you happen to \nbe in Atlanta when you get sick. Under our plan, the basic currency we \nuse, which is U.S. currency, is taken everywhere.\n  So that is the choice I think people want. This Democrat bill is not \nfreedom. It almost abuses the English language to call this a Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  What kind of right do you have in health care when you are guaranteed \nthe right to pick your own lawyer? The right you want in health care is \nthe right to pick your own doctor. The right you want in health care is \nthe right to pick your hospital. The right to choose in health care is \nthe right to say: I don't like how I am being treated. I don't like the \nkind of service being provided. I think your cost is too high, I think \nyour quality is too low, and I am going to leave.\n  Those are not freedoms guaranteed in Senator Kennedy's Patients' Bill \nof Rights. His freedoms are: Look, if you are not happy with the \nquality of service, then you wait right here--it may take several hours \nor you may have to come back on Tuesday at 4 o'clock--but we will have \na person from Health and Human Services, and they will listen to you \nand they will talk to you. If you are not happy, you can meet with \nthem. You will have to sign some forms. They will want to look at your \nmedical records; they will go through them.\n  It may take weeks and weeks and months and months and years and \nyears, but under Senator Kennedy's bill you will have these bureaucrats \nwho will be protecting you. That is freedom to Senator Kennedy.\n  Then if that fails, Senator Kennedy said: Well, another freedom you \nhave, you have the freedom to sue.\n  So let's say you have this terrible health care problem, and you or \nsomeone you love may be on the verge of death. What Senator Kennedy's \nfreedom is that first of all, you can talk to this bureaucrat. You may \nhave to come back next Wednesday. You may have to wait in line. You \nwill have to fill out a lot of forms, but he will be there for you at \nsome point. But if that doesn't work, then you can hire a lawyer, and \nyou can sue. You may die, your loved one may die, but you will have a \nbureaucrat who will have been there. Maybe they did not make it in \ntime--they meant to be there--but they were there for you. And then you \ncan sue somebody if all that happens. That is what their ``freedom'' is \nabout.\n  Our freedom is the right to choose, not a lawyer, but a doctor. If \nyour baby is sick, you have the right to choose the doctor. You can \npick up the phone, pick up any Yellow Pages across America, look up in \nthe Yellow Pages under ``physician,'' and then you can pick whoever you \nwant. Under our bill, you can call them up and say: Do you take a \ncheck? Do you take MasterCard? Do you take Visa?\n\n  If you are covered under our plan, you have the right to choose a \nprogram that will let you choose a doctor. So if you think your HMO is \ndoing a good job, you can stay in your HMO. But if you do not think \nthey are doing a good job, you do not have to wait in line to talk to a \nbureaucrat, you do not have to hire a lawyer, you just simply say to \nthem: You are not doing a good job, and you're fired.\n  If you like Senator Kennedy's freedom, you want his bill. If you like \nour freedom, then you want our bill.\n  What is real freedom? It is the right to choose.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience.\n  I see the leader is here on the floor. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Senator from Texas respond to a couple questions?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Sure I would.\n  Mr. LOTT. This is the Kennedy-care stethoscope you have there \ndemonstrated on that board?\n\n[[Page S7695]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. If I may, what I first have here is the Kennedy bill that \nwe call the Clinton health care bill which, as our leader will \nremember, we debated on the floor for 2 years. This bill was their bill \nwhere, if we would just force every American to go into a health care \npurchasing collective and let Government make the decision for them, \nthey were going to guarantee that everybody would have coverage. This \nis what they wanted 3 years ago. We defeated that because we did not \nwant our mama talking to some bureaucrat when she got sick.\n  What they want to do is set up a system where if you have a patient \nwho wants to be in the room with their doctor, they find themselves in \na room with their doctor and a gatekeeper. Senator Kennedy would help \nthem by putting a bureaucrat and lawyer in the examining room with \nthem.\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me ask you the critical question. For the average \nperson out there--senior citizen who is worried about their health \ncare--they are in an HMO or managed care organization and they have a \nproblem and they want that problem dealt with, this very graphically \nshows what the problem is with the bill. It winds up that a bureaucrat \nis involved and a lawyer is involved.\n  What I want to know is, the alternative bill that has been developed \nby you and Senator Nickles and Senator Collins and Senator Santorum, \nDr. Frist, and others, does it provide a way for that patient's problem \nto be dealt with? Is it a timely issue? Is it dealt with in a way where \nlawyers are not necessary?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me give you a concrete example. Under the Kennedy \nbill, if you are not happy with the kind of health care you are \ngetting, you can meet with a Government bureaucrat. You may have come \nback----\n  Mr. LOTT. I know that makes everybody feel good.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You might have to wait in line and fill out a lot of \nforms, but they will be there, potentially, to help you. Then if that \ndoes not happen, you can hire a lawyer, you can choose any lawyer you \nwant, and then you can sue.\n  Under our bill, what we do is we get rid of this. Under our bill, we \ngive you this. What we let you do, if you are not happy with your HMO, \ninstead of fooling around with a bureaucrat and lawyer, you just simply \nsay to your HMO: You're fired. You set up a medical savings account, \nwhere for care beyond $3,000 a year you have an insurance policy; and \nthen you and your employer put money in, up to $3,000 a year, out of \nwhich you pay medical expenses, through a check. These are various \nmedical savings accounts that are now available through MasterCard and \nVisa.\n  So what it enables you to do is, if, at the end of the year, you did \nnot spend the $3,000, it belongs to you, and you spend it on other \nthings.\n  Mr. LOTT. You give the patient that choice. They can choose to go \nwith an MSA account. They can choose the doctor they want.\n  But again, I want to ask the question, what if that person decides to \nstay in their managed care organization and a problem develops? Under \nyour bill, there is a review process--an internal and external \nprocess--that has a specified period of time in which action has to \noccur; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is exactly right. We have a time-sensitive system for \ndecisionmaking. But beyond that, we give the people, if they are not \nhappy with their HMO, the ability to go somewhere else.\n  As you know, Mr. Leader, nothing makes somebody providing a service \ndo a better job than to know that you can say to them, if they are not \ndoing the job: You're fired.\n  Mr. LOTT. All right, sir. I just wanted to emphasize those points. \nYou always do an excellent job with your cards and even your unusual \nstethoscope.\n  Let me talk about the issue of where we are. First of all, I think it \nis very important that we in the Senate act to do the people's \nbusiness. This time of year, every summer, the Senate is very much \ninvolved in passing the annual appropriations bills--the bills that do \nkeep the Government going, bills that have many programs that the \nadministration has asked for and, quite frankly, many programs that the \nAmerican people rely on.\n  We are going to have four votes this afternoon, trying to bring up \nfour different appropriations bills to try to get the people's business \ndone: the agriculture appropriations bill, the transportation \nappropriations bill. So many of us in this country depend on an \nimproved transportation infrastructure. I know that is true in my State \nand a lot of other States. We have dangerous bridges, narrow, two-lane, \nhilly roads. We have interstate systems that are in disrepair. We have \nmass transportation systems that need additional systems. All of that \nis in the transportation appropriations bill, which we hope to have \nconsidered in short order by the Senate.\n  We have the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. This is a \nbill that has to do with everything from fisheries in this country to \nforeign policy to law enforcement. Certainly, we need to get that bill \nup. We need to have all three of those bills done before this week is \nout.\n  Another one is the foreign operations appropriations bill, a bill \nthat has been masterfully put together by the members of the \nappropriations subcommittee in a bipartisan way, under the leadership \nof Senator McConnell of Kentucky, a bill that probably could go through \nhere on a voice vote. Yet it appears that these appropriations bills \nare going to be delayed or obstructed.\n  The one that is presently pending before the Senate, and has been \nhere now for this being the third week, is the agriculture \nappropriations bill, a bill that is so important to our farmers in \nAmerica and important to our consumers and to our children and to the \npoor people in this country. This bill does provide the farm programs, \nbut it also has programs such as food stamps and school lunches and the \nWomen, Infants, and Children Program. It is the one that determines \nwhether or not in many instances the American people get access to the \nfarm products from our farmers, who are the geniuses of the world in \nterms of production and what they have done in our lifetime to provide \nquality high protein food. They have done a magnificent job.\n  Right now, they have fallen on somewhat hard times. For the second \nyear in a row now we will see a significant downturn in farm production \nin terms of money that comes to the farmers. This is being brought \nabout by depressed prices, by the fact that we have not been opening up \nnew markets, the fact that we have let countries block our farm \nproducts from China to Japan as well as Europe and get away with it. In \nthe case of Europe, they are systematically ignoring WTO decisions with \nregard to bananas. Now we have the impending problem with beef.\n  So at a time when our markets are not being expanded and opened up, \nat a time when prices are depressed, farmers are looking for any sign \nof hope and encouragement. And yet here we are, for the third week, \ntangled up with an unrelated issue to agriculture.\n  This is not a small bill. This is $60.7 billion for agriculture in \nAmerica. There is a strong feeling that there is probably going to be a \nneed for additional disaster assistance. I saw where some States right \nnow are looking at another serious drought. You add that on top of \ndepressed prices, declining markets instead of growing markets, and now \na drought on top of that, you have the prescription for a disaster.\n  So we may have to come back and take a look at that later on this \nyear. But farmers need some encouragement right now. They need to know \nwhat they can depend on.\n  The schools need to know what they are going to be able to count on \nin the next school year that begins in August, by the way, not at the \nbeginning of the next fiscal year. They need to know what they are \ngoing to be able to count on.\n  So we have had this delay because an agreement can't be reached as to \nhow to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights. Frankly, for 8 months I \nhave been trying to find a way to do just that. I have offered repeated \nsuggestions--the fairest one of all probably just to have a jump ball \nand say, OK, we will begin here and at a date certain, after a \nreasonable period of time, we will be through with it. But we tried all \nkinds of variations.\n  I read into the Record last week the complete unanimous consent \nagreement I had suggested on Thursday that would have allowed us to \nbring it up, would have had a reasonable time for\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\nconsideration, 2 hours on first-degree amendments, 2 hours on second-\ndegree amendments. I don't know how I could be any fairer. That, too, \nwas rejected.\n  So I have tried repeatedly to make this happen. Add to that that this \nis a charade. This is a farce. This is not for real. So not only are \nthe farmers being taken advantage of, they are being played with. They \nare being laughed at. Every Senator knows, men and women, Republican, \nDemocrat, regardless of region, no amendment that is added from the \nPatients' Bill of Rights to the agriculture appropriations bill will \never see the light of day. It will be sheared like wool from a sheep \nbefore it gets to the conference just the other side of the Rotunda. It \nwill not happen--not the Feinstein amendment, not some other amendment, \nnot the Kennedy alternative. It will not be a part of the agriculture \nappropriations bill and shouldn't be. It is still legislating on an \nappropriations bill. It is an unrelated, nongermane amendment that is \nbeing insisted on by, I think, really a few on the Democratic side of \nthe aisle.\n  So this is a farce, ladies and gentlemen. We should no longer allow \nthe people's business to be shunted aside and delayed and obstructed \nand held up by this kind of activity. We should treat it for what it \nis. It is a charade. It is a farce. But it is not a happy one. It is a \nsad one.\n  I encourage my colleagues today on both sides of the aisle, don't be \na part of this. We should summarily dismiss as frivolous these \namendments that are being added or offered to be added to this \nagriculture appropriations bill. Maybe they are substantive. Maybe some \nof them have merit. But to offer them here, who are we kidding? Nobody, \nnobody in this room. I think most Americans know this is not a serious \neffort.\n  Can we work out a way, an agreement to bring this up for a reasonable \nperiod of time and still get our work done in terms of the \nappropriations bills and other legislation that is pending, some of it \nin conference, some of it waiting to come before the Senate? The \nbankruptcy reform package is waiting for action. The flag burning \nconstitutional amendment has been passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. Yet we are over here tangled up in a procedural \nactivity.\n  I think we should not be a part of that. I am going to insist that we \ndismiss it and that we move on and get our work done. I really hope and \nreach out to the leadership on the other side of the aisle and say: \nLet's see if we can't find a way to deal with this at another time in a \nway that is fair to all sides. Let's go on and pass these \nappropriations bills. Several of them that I have not even mentioned \nhere today we could probably move through very quickly, in a limited \nperiod of time, with limited amendments, because there are just not \ngoing to be a lot of amendments offered, and do some of the other \nbusiness, including the nominations that we all know should be at least \ngiven an opportunity to be considered.\n\n  I just wanted to lay that marker down and get that word firmly \nplanted in our lexicon. This procedure is a farce. It will not happen.\n  And by the way, just to make sure I was on totally safe ground, it \nalways behooves one to check with the appropriations chairman to make \nsure he agrees. He agrees. He obviously is offended and upset that his \nbills out of the Appropriations Committee are being delayed, and he \nagrees we should not have these legislative matters, these extraneous \nmatters being used to delay very important appropriations bills so that \nwe can get our work done.\n  By the way, the President is out there saying: Let's work together. \nGreat, let's do. I am ready for deeds, not words. I want us to have \nMedicare reform, but the commission, the bipartisan commission's work \nwas basically rejected. The President didn't allow one of his nominees \nof the commission to vote for it. Yet we had Democrats and Republicans \nwho were for it. The Finance Committee, I believe, is willing to move \nforward in a constructive way. If he wants to work on some of these \nissues, we would certainly be glad to find the time to do it.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Feinstein amendment is the pending \nbusiness.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1103 To Amendment No. 737\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk to the pending Feinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1103 to amendment No. 737.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will read the \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with so that I may explain briefly what is \nin this amendment, and if the Senator from Wisconsin wishes, he can \ncontinue the objection. I will clarify it for those who are curious \nabout exactly what that amendment is.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I just offered the Kennedy health care \nbill, the identical text of amendment No. 703, which was offered by \nSenator Dorgan to the agriculture appropriations bill. I hope that our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will let this go forward so \nthat we can take appropriate action.\n  I wanted to explain that. If the Senator insists, the reading can \ncontinue.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the majority leader. I have no objection at \nthis point.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, again, I did offer the Kennedy health care \nbill to the agriculture appropriations bill. My thinking is that rather \nthan doing this piecemeal, let's go ahead and deal with the overall \nDemocrat bill dealing with the Patients' Bill of Rights. In order to \nmake sure it is properly considered, I will advocate cloture and I \nwill, in fact, vote for cloture. I think that way we can deal with this \nissue straight up, not playing around with it.\n  I emphasize again that this is a farce. I am treating it accordingly. \nWhen both sides really want to get serious about sitting down and \nworking out a way to consider this bill separately as a legislative \nvehicle, I will be glad to do that. But it should not continue to \ntangle up the appropriations bills. I believe Senator Daschle and I \nreally want to get some work done this week for the benefit of the \ncountry. I am convinced that he has that intent. By taking this action, \nI think we can still pass some appropriations bills this week and clear \nour calendar of a lot of nominations.\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the Kennedy \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of \nrule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the pending amendment No. 1103 to the Agriculture \nAppropriations bill:\n         Senators Trent Lott, Thad Cochran, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, Susan M. Collins, Craig Thomas, Michael D. \n           Crapo, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Bob Bennett, Larry Craig, \n           Connie Mack, Chuck Grassley, Christopher H. Bond, \n           Richard Shelby, Tim Hutchinson, Ted Stevens, and \n           Michael B. Enzi.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I know this is an important issue to the \nminority leader. He will be here shortly. If he wishes, I would be \nwilling to go ahead and have this cloture vote occur as the last vote \nin the voting sequence that we have stacked this afternoon at 5:30, \nnotwithstanding rule XXII. I am not asking for that right now, but I \nmake that offer to our colleagues. We can vote on that cloture motion \nthis afternoon if they wish, or we can do it tomorrow. But at some \npoint, it will ripen, and we will then have a chance to vote on \ncloture. I suggest that we actually vote on it.\n  At this time, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have just arrived from Illinois, and I \nhave come at the right moment because we are considering something \ncalled cloture in the Senate. The reason you file a motion for \ncloture--as Senator Byrd knows because he knows the Senate rules better \nthan anyone, and probably wrote most of them--is to bring to an end to \ndebate and to force the Senate to go forward on a vote.\n  The Republican strategy, as enunciated by Senators Lott and Nickles, \nis to bring an end to this debate. Which debate would they like to see \nend? The debate about reforming health insurance in America. They do \nnot want us to move forward with amendments pending by Senators \nFeinstein of California, Kennedy of Massachusetts, and others, which \naddress the issue of health insurance reform. They do not want to face \nvotes on these amendments. They do not want us to bring the Democratic \nPatients' Bill of Rights to the floor and ask Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to vote their conscience, up or down, yes or no, on how we \ncan change health insurance in America.\n  For several days last week, the argument was made that ``we don't \nhave time to debate health insurance reform.'' But as one day flowed \ninto a second day, and now into another week, we are spending a lot of \ntime on the issue without voting on it. We are spending time finding \nways to avoid voting on health insurance reform--a Democratic Patients' \nBill of Rights.\n  Now my Republican colleagues have their own version of the bill and, \nof course, they are very proud of their version, as we are of ours. We \nhave suggested: Bring your bill to the floor and bring your amendments \nto the floor. We will bring ours, and then we will assume the role of \nSenators. We will debate and we will vote. Ultimately, we hope to put \ntogether a good bill. But whatever the outcome, we will then go home \nand explain to the people we represent why we voted one way or another. \nThis is not a radical strategy or policy.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield for a question in a moment, if the Senator \nwill allow me to complete my thought.\n  What we are suggesting here is reminiscent of what most people expect \nto occur on the floor of the Senate--that Senators of differing \nviewpoints come forward and present their points of view and vote on \nthem. We have gone on day after weary day with the Republican \nleadership trying to find ways to stop us from debating and stop us \nfrom voting.\n  Over this weekend, I made a tour of my State of Illinois, which is a \nbig State. I ran into some people who told me an interesting story \nabout their experience with health care. One group was in a machine \nshed on a farm near Farmington, IL. About 30 farmers gathered. I asked \nthem about the farm crisis and I asked them about health insurance. \nThey were equally animated on both subjects, concerned about their loss \nof income and also concerned about the jeopardy they and their families \nface because of health insurance.\n  Last weekend, I was in Peoria and I met with Henry Rahn. He raises \nsoybeans and corn. If you go to most Illinois farms, you will find that \nis the case. He was quoted a price of $17,000 a year for health \ninsurance for himself and his wife. What really wrangled Mr. Rahn was \nthat in spite of his paying top dollar, the insurance companies were \nalways trying to get out of paying for his health care needs. Recently \nhe suffered a heart attack, and his coverage was threatened when he \nwent to an emergency room because he had not called 24 hours in advance \nto notify the insurance company.\n  Another farmer, Bob Zinser--he is a farmer in Peoria and is also a \nchiropractor--told me in no uncertain terms that the HMO and PPO plans \nwere total garbage. Mr. Zinser says, ``It seems like insurance \ncompanies have infinite wisdom on what's right and what's wrong.''\n  These farmers I met were angry about how they were treated by \ninsurance companies. They wanted action.\n  Under the GOP version--the Republican version--of managed care \nreform, these farmers I have just spoken about are not protected. They \nhave written a bill which literally leaves behind 115 million Americans \nand provides no insurance reform. They do some things for small groups. \nBut unlike the Democratic bill, which covers the vast majority of \npeople with health insurance, the Republican bill leaves many behind, \nincluding the farmers and other self-employed people I just mentioned.\n  When I described this to the farmers at the gathering, they couldn't \nbelieve it: You are talking about health insurance reform on the floor \nof the Senate, and yet it won't help us and our families? I said: The \nRepublican version of the bill will not; the Democratic version will.\n  Last night I flew to the Chicago area and went to Highland Park and \nmet with a cardiologist. His story was chilling. Let me tell you \nexactly what he told me last night.\n  He said a patient came to his office--a woman--on Thursday \ncomplaining of chest pains. He didn't think she was in an emergency \nsituation but he wanted her to go to the hospital the next day--the \nnext morning--for a catheterization, a very common diagnostic procedure \nused in cardiology, to determine just what her heart problem might be.\n\n  So they called her insurance company, and the insurance company said: \nNo, we will not let her have a catheterization on Friday, because that \nhospital that you want to send her to is not covered by her health \ninsurance. So the doctor said: What would you have her do? They said: \nLet us make an appointment for her. We will call on Saturday to see \nwhat we can find.\n  She passed away on Sunday. A decision about a hospital ended up \njeopardizing this woman's health and her life.\n  This doctor said to me: What am I supposed to tell her family?\n  Think of how vulnerable each and every one of us is, going into a \ndoctor's office hoping to get the very, very best diagnosis or \ntreatment but always wondering if we will be second guessed by some \nbureaucrat at an insurance company. That is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  I understand the frustration of the Republican leadership. Those of \nus on the Democratic side for 2 weeks now have been pressing to bring \nthis issue to the floor. We have said we will take the outcome of the \nvote, whatever it might be, but let us have this debate. America is \nlooking for us to initiate that debate. But, sadly, there are those on \nthe Republican side who do not want to face these votes. They don't \nwant to have to vote yes or no. They don't want to have to decide \nbetween the insurance companies' agenda and the agenda of families \nacross the Nation.\n  That is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in the Senate, \nbecause the men and women I spoke to in that machine shed at the farm \nin Farmington, IL, and the doctor I spoke with in Highland Park \nunderstand full well\n\n[[Page S7698]]\n\nthat this is an issue that can't be delayed.\n  There are certainly important bills for us to consider. We have a \nmyriad of important appropriations bills to consider. I hope we can \ncome to them soon. But we have taken the position on the Democratic \nside that we are only prepared to move to the appropriations bills once \nwe have an agreement from the Republican side that we will debate \nhealth insurance reform, we will debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. \nUnfortunately, as of this moment we do not have that agreement.\n  There is also a question of accountability. I think this is a bottom \nline thought: The doctor who told me the story about the woman he \nwanted to refer for a heart catheterization but was told she couldn't \ngo to the hospital that he wanted and the insurance company would come \nup with another one, I hope that doctor is never sued by anyone because \nof that decision. But those things do happen to doctors and hospitals. \nDespite the fact that the insurance company made the decision--the \ninsurance company took her out of that doctor's care and said she had \nto go to another hospital--under current law in the United States of \nAmerica, that health insurance company is protected from liability in \ncourt except for the cost of the procedure. If there is suffering, if \nthere is pain, if there is loss of income, or if there is death, the \ninsurance company, having made the decision which it did, will not be \nheld liable.\n  You say, well, certainly there must be other companies in America \nwhich enjoy this kind of special privilege. And the answer is no--not \nany; none. No other company in America enjoys this protection from \nliability or enjoys this exemption from accountability like health care \ninsurance companies.\n  Some on the Republican side have argued, oh, you Democrats just want \nto bring the health insurance companies in court to make lawyers \nwealthy. Of course, lawyers would be involved. It would be naive to say \nthey wouldn't be involved. But the bottom line is, if you do not \nbelieve that your corporate decision--your insurance company decision--\nis something you can be held accountable for, how careful will you be? \nYou will make a decision based on the bottom line profit: What is good \nfor my company? How much money will be there at the end of the year? If \nyou make the wrong decision in the interest of the patient, will you be \nheld accountable? Not under the law as written today.\n  The Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights says no; health insurance \ncompanies, as every other company in America, will be held accountable \nfor their conduct. Currently only foreign diplomats and health \ninsurance companies cannot be brought into court in America. We think \nthat should change. When it changes, we think health insurance \ncompanies, as in the example I used of the cardiologist, will think \ntwice: Well, Doctor, perhaps you send that letter for a catheterization \nat the nearest hospital on Friday morning. No. We will not play with \nthe insurance policy. We will work it out later. Let's take care of her \nhealth condition.\n  But they didn't. They decided, let's stick to the letter of the \ninsurance policy.\n  How frustrating it is for doctors who face this. The doctors I talk \nto feel helpless.\n  You read in the paper last week that the American Medical Association \nis talking about forming a union--the ``International Brotherhood of \nPhysicians'' or something. What would bring what is typically viewed as \na conservative political group such as the AMA to a moment in time \nwhere they have decided they have had enough, that they have no voice \nwhen it comes to medical decisions, and they have to come together and \nbargain collectively with insurance companies?\n  I will tell you what has brought them to this point--the example that \nI used, and some others, where they realize that they have been \noverruled time and time again. They are frustrated. They are angry. \nThat is why they have decided to start exploring the possibility of \nforming a union.\n  The message is here, America. This is an issue which cannot wait. \nWhen the Republican leadership comes to the floor and accuses us of \nstalling tactics, we are not trying to stall this process; we on the \nDemocratic side are trying to accelerate this process.\n  Let's bring this bill to the floor. This is our last week before the \nFourth of July recess. Let's dedicate this week to the Patients' Bill \nof Rights. Let's make sure that when we go home on Independence Day and \nwalk down the parade route, the people we are looking at, who are \nwaving sometimes at us, realize we have done our best, we have done our \nbest to address an issue that is critical to every American.\n  The Rand study said that 115 million Americans have had a bad \nexperience with a health insurance company or know someone in their \nfamily, or close friend, who has. The cases I have cited to you are not \nisolated examples. The letters stack up in our office from people all \nacross my State of Illinois and all across this Nation. I have been \nspeaking on the floor the last couple of weeks on this issue, and I \nhave started receiving these letters. I have asked people to send \nletters to me in my office and to tell me about their experience with \nhealth insurance.\n  Every single letter tells the same story--letters where women who \nhave chosen an OB/GYN as their primary care physician, a person they \nare confident of, a person they want to work with, have been overruled \nby insurance companies that said: We have a new doctor for you; \nsituations where people, as I described earlier, will go into an \nemergency room only to learn that they are denied coverage because they \npicked the wrong hospital or they didn't call in advance for an \nemergency room.\n  Can you imagine, racing to the hospital with a son who has just \nfallen out of a tree in the backyard, trying to remember the number of \nthe insurance company? Is that the last thing on your mind? It \ncertainly would be on mine. I can remember taking my son to an \nemergency room when he decided to catch a baseball with his teeth \ninstead of the glove. Those things happen. And you race off to the \nemergency room. You don't want to fumble in the glove compartment to \nfind the insurance policy. You are worried about that little boy whom \nyou love like everything in this world, and you want to get him to a \ngood doctor as quickly as possible. You don't want to get tangled up in \nan insurance company bureaucracy.\n  Many times we find that the people, for example, who need specialists \nfor medical care learn that they are being overruled by insurance \ncompanies that say: No; even though a doctor told you you needed a \ncertain specialist, we don't approve of it.\n  One doctor who kept calling insurance companies and receiving \nfrustrating answers finally asked the clerk on the phone: Are you a \ndoctor? The voice at the insurance company said no.\n  He said: Are you a nurse? The voice said no.\n  He then asked: Do you have a college degree? No.\n  Do you have a high school diploma? Yes.\n  What qualifies you on the other end of this telephone to overrule me \nafter years of education and medical school? The clerk said: I've got \nthe rules in front of me. They are in writing. They are very clear, and \nwe disagree.\n  That is what it comes down to. That is how the decisions are made. \nThat is what this debate would be about. The debate will decide how \nmany Americans will be protected by quality health care, debate will \ndecide whether health insurance companies, as every other company in \nAmerica, can be held accountable in court if they make a decision which \ntakes away the life of a loved one, causes pain or loss of income--\ndecisions as to whether or not medical necessity will rule when doctors \nmake decisions, including the procedure you should have, what emergency \nroom you can use, things that most Americans think are just common \nsense. That is what this debate would be about.\n  At 5 o'clock, we will start a series of four cloture votes. It is an \neffort by the Republican majority to stop this side of the aisle from \noffering this debate on the floor of the Senate. They are trying to \nstop this side from amending any bill so we can bring up these issues. \nThey do not want to talk about these issues. They do not want to face \nthese votes. If they can prevail--and on this side of the aisle hope \nthey will not--if they can come up with the requisite votes, they can \nshut down the debate\n\n[[Page S7699]]\n\nand move on to some other issues. If the Republicans are successful in \nstopping this debate on health insurance reform, they will, as will \nSenators on this side of the aisle, one day soon have to go home. When \nthey go home, they are going to face families such as those I faced \nover the weekend, living and dying with this problem every day and \nevery week.\n  They will have to answer possibly the hardest question posed to any \nSenator: Why didn't you do something? What stopped you, Senator? Don't \nyou understand? Don't you care about people like us?\n  That is what it is all about. I say to my friends on the Republican \nside of the aisle, please join in this debate. Don't be afraid of these \nvotes. Try to look for some opportunities where, frankly, Republicans \nmight find a Democratic amendment they like. I will look for Republican \namendments I might like. Let's try to put something together. Let's put \npolitics aside. Let's realize the families across America are not just \nDemocratic families; they are Republican families, Independent \nfamilies, and families who couldn't give a hoot about politics. But \nthey are hopeful that this system of government and the men and women \nserving in this Senate care about them, care enough to bring this \ndebate forward.\n  At 5 o'clock I will vote against the motion for cloture, to keep on \nthe floor this debate on health insurance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I support the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Let me thank my friend from Illinois, who is one of the newer Members \nof this body. He has had much experience in the other body. He comes to \nthis body with a tremendously versatile mind. He can speak almost at \nthe drop of a hat. He is very conversant on every subject. He fights \ntoday for a cause which is important. I congratulate him. He has been \nspeaking on the floor for several days on this subject. He speaks with \ngreat eloquence. I congratulate him and look forward to hearing him on \nother occasions. I hope in this situation he and we will be successful \nat some point.\n  I support the Patients' Bill of Rights. This is important legislation \nthat, if enacted, will provide important protections to the many \nmillions of Americans who receive their health care from managed care \ncompanies. It is therefore critically important that the Senate conduct \na full debate on this issue. I am saddened that supporters of this \nlegislation have been put in the position of offering this measure to \nan appropriations bill, thereby temporarily stalling progress on \nfunding programs that are a priority for yet other Americans.\n  While I consider a vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights imperative in \nthis Congress, I am also very concerned that putting important issues \nat loggerheads with one another may ultimately interfere with the \nsmooth operation of the government. We should all strive to avoid a \nrepeat of the train wreck that resulted in last year's Omnibus \nConsolidated Appropriations bill. Putting the Senate in the position of \nhaving to choose between competing critical needs is a dangerous game \nthat we should not play. It is bad public policy. There is still enough \nroom on the calendar for both a thorough debate on the Patients' Bill \nof Rights and for timely progress on the important work of passing the \nFiscal Year 2000 appropriations bills. I urge the leadership to move \nforward in a fair manner--to allow this bill to be fully considered and \ndebated, and to let amendments to the Patients' Bill of Rights be \ncalled up and debated and voted on--voted up or down or amended again.\n  Action on the Patients' Bill of Rights has been delayed for too long. \nAs the Congress stalls, problems with managed care companies increase. \nAccording to a Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University survey, the \nnumber of people reporting having problems with their health plan, or \nwho know someone who has had a problem with their health plan, rose \nfrom 96 million in 1996 to 115 million in 1998. With 85 percent of all \ninsured employees in managed care plans, this issue is too far-reaching \nto be delayed.\n  While managed care has been successful in stemming health care \ninflation in recent years, it has too often compromised patients' \nhealth care needs. Unfortunately and tragically, some health insurers \nhave put saving money ahead of patients' well-being. Instead of patient \ncare, we are getting ``investor care,'' with health plans keeping a \nconstant eye on shareholder profits. Our Patients' Bill of Rights would \nprovide important and necessary protections for families to ensure they \nget the care they need.\n  Too often, managed care plans erect barriers that interfere with \npatients getting the medical services they need when confronted with an \nemergency. Under this measure, patients do not have to fear that their \nemergency room care will not be covered if they have reason to believe \nthey need emergency care. They will not have to call for permission \nfirst and waste precious time hoping for clearance. Someone who \nexperiences chest pain and believes he or she is having a heart attack \nshould not have to check to see whether the health plan will cover the \nemergency room care. The ``prudent layperson'' standard gives patients \nthe ability to seek emergency room care with the assurance that it will \nbe covered.\n  Comprehensive managed care reform legislation should also provide \nwomen in managed care plans important protections. Oftentimes, women \nuse their ob/gyn as their primary care provider. Having managed care \nplans recognize this fact will eliminate time-consuming and costly \nadministrative barriers women face in getting the care they need. A \nwoman and her doctor should be able to make the decision, for example, \nas to how long she needs to stay in the hospital after a mastectomy, \nnot some health plan bureaucrat.\n  In recent years, health plan coverage of patients' participation in \nclinical trials has declined. This is a troubling trend. Under S. 6, of \nwhich I am a cosponsor, health plans would be required to cover the \nroutine costs associated with a patient's participation in certain \nclinical trials. This is an important provision because in some cases \nclinical trials may be the only option for patients who have not \nresponded to conventional treatments.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights also has special protections for \nchildren's access to care. The bill provides guaranteed access to \npediatric specialists. When a child has a chronic condition our bill \nallows standing referrals to pediatric specialists which eliminates the \nextra step of seeking the consent of the primary care provider. Under \nour bill, if a pediatric specialist is not included in the health \nplan's network, your child would have the right to see a specialist \noutside the network without having to pay more.\n  Patients undergoing treatment need to know that, if their doctor is \ndropped by the health plan or if their employer changes their health \nplan, they can still see their doctor. S. 6 offers continuity of \ncoverage by requiring a 90-day transition period during which treatment \nis continued. For example, a terminally ill patient should not have to \ngo through the disruption of changing doctors as that patient faces \ndeath.\n  I have long been concerned about West Virginians' access to health \ncare and, over the years, I have been successful in bringing facilities \nand technologies to the State to expand my constituents' access to \nquality care. Marshall University's Rural Health Center; the VA \nhospitals and clinics; and Mountaineer Doctor Television (MDTV), West \nVirginia's Statewide telemedicine program, are projects that have \nbroadened West Virginians' ability to receive quality care in West \nVirginia. As managed care continues to grow in the State, it is \nimportant that common-sense protections are in place so that patients \ncan get the care they need.\n  The Republicans have introduced their own managed care reform \nlegislation in response to the Democrat's Patients' Bill of Rights. \nBut, the Republican plan would leave over 100 million Americans without \nprotection. By applying reforms only to self-funded employer plans, the \nRepublican bill leaves those most in need of protection--people who buy \ntheir insurance without the assistance of their employer and those who \nwork for small businesses--out in the cold.\n  Scope of coverage is not the only weakness of the Republican plan. \nEven the protections provided to a limited number of Americans under \ntheir plan\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\ndo not go far enough. While differences exist in the shape and scope of \nthe reform proposals, one thing is clear. There is a crying need in the \nlives of real Americans for action to address these health care \nproblems. We need a thorough debate, an open debate about this issue, a \ndebate which is not constrained by limits on amendments or by a desire \nto hold such a critical matter hostage to partisan politics, and we \nneed it now. We also need to move forward on appropriations bills which \nfund important programs all across the spectrum of American life. I can \nonly hope that reason will prevail in this body, and that we will allow \nall of these important matters to proceed in a timely and sincere \nmanner as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, this weekend I traveled across my home \nState discussing the issues that are before us today, and also had the \nopportunity to travel into Canada to talk about agriculture, to try to \nsolve some of the problems that face agricultural producers today.\n  What is happening here is a matter of fact. The hostages are those \nfolks who depend on food stamps, those folks who depend on the WIC \nProgram--young women with children and infants who depend on those \nnutritional programs.\n  What is happening is we are trying to do the business of the Nation, \nand that is funding the programs that Americans want. Yes, agriculture \nis in tough straits. We have seen in this past year commodity prices \ndip way below the prices they were during the Great Depression. Yet we \nexpect our agriculture producers to produce. We expect our grocery \nstores to stay full. We expect to buy those foods in any amount, \nprepared in any way; to be handy--and they are. This Nation is truly a \nblessed nation in that we have producers like that.\n  While I realize the debate on health care is very important, let's \nnot lose sight of the Nation's business. Let's not take our eye off the \nball. The Nation's business, first and foremost, is to pass the \nappropriations bills to fund those Departments and those programs that \ndepend on those bills, and then debate health care or Medicare reform. \nNobody on either side of the aisle underestimates the importance of \nthat debate. But the business of the Government is to finance and \nprovide funds for programs so this Nation can operate. That is what is \nbeing held hostage.\n  Madam President, 23 percent of the gross national product depends on \nagriculture. No other part of the American economy contributes so much \nto our gross national product. Yet here we stand, talking about an \namendment to an agriculture bill that is strong enough to be debated as \na stand-alone piece of legislation.\n  I talk to my farmers in Montana. They want the agriculture \nappropriations bill passed. In this bill there is research money. In \nthis bill there is money needed to open up export markets, to let \nagriculture producers take advantage of added value to their own \nproducts. It allows them to find niche markets. It allows them to live.\n  The health care bill has nothing to do with agriculture--nothing. You \ncannot claim germaneness. You cannot claim anything. I think the health \ncare issue deserves a stand-alone debate, but it should not block the \nfinancing of Government programs. That is too important. The lives of \ntoo many producers are on the line, as are their farms and their \nranches.\n  We hear complaints all the time about legislation on appropriations \nbills. In the majority of these cases, the amendments at least have \nsome relationship or some germaneness to the issue at hand. But what \nsignificant relationship does a Patients' Bill of Rights have to \nagricultural production? We should pass the appropriations bills, get \nthem into conference, send them down to the President, and let him sign \nthem. There is ample time left to debate health care in the United \nStates.\n\n  My farmers and ranchers are a little bit baffled. They do not have a \nclue as to what is really happening. I say that somewhat in jest \nbecause the majority of them do know what is happening. They are being \nheld hostage. How do I explain to them that the money allocated to \nprograms important to them is being held up entirely for a debate on an \nissue which should be a stand-alone issue?\n  Let's pass these appropriations bills. Let's get them out of the way. \nLet's assure the American people we can do the Nation's business. Let's \nassure the American farm and ranch people their programs will be passed \nand financed. Let's tell those who depend on food stamps their money is \ngoing to be there. Let's tell the elderly people who depend on Meals on \nWheels it is going to be there. Let's tell the young mothers with \ninfants and children who depend on nutritional programs the money will \nbe there.\n  There is no sickness in the world worse than starvation. Do you want \nto drive health care costs higher? Then disregard the nutritional \nprograms found in this agricultural appropriations bill. Whom are we \nhurting? Those who can afford it least. Let's get back on track. My \nfarmers and ranchers are tired of waiting and so are the folks who \ndepend on these programs.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order of \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I want to spend a few moments talking about aspects \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights, which is an amendment to the \nagricultural appropriations bill before us this afternoon. We are faced \nwith a very clear choice: Are we going to finally debate and consider \nin some detail a Patients' Bill of Rights which will give every \nAmerican a clear opportunity to have the kind of quality health care we \nall support and we all want them to have, or will we continue to be \nshut out, will we continue to avoid confronting a critical issue which, \nto the people of Rhode Island, is probably one of the most critical \nissues they face.\n  If one goes to the people in my State and talks to them about their \nconcerns, particularly since there has been an economic revival, a \nprimary concern for them is whether they will have adequate health care \nfor their families and themselves, particularly for their children, \nwhen they need it.\n  One of the aspects of the Democratic bill, which I think is very \nsalutary and commendable, is with regard to accountability. It provides \nnot only for internal and external review, but also for patient \nadvocacy and patient protection.\n  There are three procedural points that should be included in any \nPatients' Bill of Rights. First, there has to be clear liability \ndirected against a health plan if they make mistakes in the care of \ntheir patients.\n  One of the great ironies of our system is that physicians can be sued \nfor their malpractice, yet insurance companies are invulnerable to such \nsuits. To put it in balance, since so many health care decisions are \nnow being made not by physicians but by review specialists, \naccountants, and analysts, the insurance company itself should also be \nliable for its decisions.\n  We also have internal and external appeals processes so there is no \nrush to the courthouse, but an individual can get relief quickly and \nefficiently for a health plan decision. When people are dealing with \ntheir health insurer, all they want is the best care for themselves and \ntheir families. They want their medical problems to be resolved, they \nwant access to the specialists they need, and they want the plan to \nrespond to their needs. In fact, they simply want what they paid for.\n  There is another aspect to consider--that is to help consumers \nnegotiate through the intricate maze of health insurance rules and \nregulations and to give them the leverage that will level the playing \nfield between health care consumers and the bureaucrats who run health \ncare plans.\n  Toward that end, Senator Wyden, Senator Wellstone, and I have \nintroduced a separate legislation which\n\n[[Page S7701]]\n\nwould provide for a health care consumer assistance, or ombudsman \nprogram, in every State. It would establish a mechanism whereby States \nwould be able to provide information and counseling services to assist \nhealth care consumers.\n  This provision has been incorporated in the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand it is a necessary provision because people are not getting the \ninformation they need to make the health care system work effectively \nfor them. For instance, studies show that the existing appeals process, \nboth internal and external, are being underutilized. In fact, there is \na very deep suspicion, not only in my mind but the minds of many, that \nhealth plans make it almost impossible to get adequate review.\n  They put up procedural hurdles. They have set up a series of barriers \nthat leave the average consumer without any redress and, as a result, \nthey become frustrated and give up.\n  Another suspicion which undermines the faith in the managed care \nindustry is that this frustration is a deliberate, calculated attempt \nby companies to reduce their costs. They are hoping that the consumer, \nrather than pressing for their rights, will just go away, will give up, \nand will accept whatever the health plan offers.\n\n  I believe we can improve this system dramatically if we have consumer \nassistance centers in place throughout the United States. These systems \nwill help consumers understand their rights, and will also help to \nunderstand in some cases where they do not have a legitimate grievance. \nOne of the virtues of this approach is it will give a consumer of \nhealth care an objective place to get an answer. Today some people call \nthe insurance company, where they get different answers and they may \nget suggestions of what the contract does and does not cover.\n  Unfortunately, it seems that they get everything except straight \nanswers. As a result, they do not have confidence in the health care \nsystem. Consumer assistance, or ombudsman centers that are administered \nby States can restore a measure of confidence in the system.\n  Interestingly, this Senate is already familiar with the concept of a \nhealth care ombudsman, and at the time, it was supported virtually \nunanimously. On the Armed Services Committee, we have been studying the \nissues of managed care in the military, the TriCare system. Many of the \ncomplaints with the TriCare system are the same types complaints we \nhear about managed care in general: Quality is not good, we can't get \ncare, we can't get answers.\n  As a result, we responded in the defense authorization bill this \nyear. One of the things we did was create within the TriCare system an \nombudsman program, an advocacy program, so when military men and women \nhave questions about their families' health, they do not have to get \nthe runaround from the local insurance company; they can go to the \nombudsman who can give them help, support, and assistance to get their \nclaim resolved or, in some cases, to explain that the insurance company \nis well within its rights to make the decision they made.\n  I find it interesting and ironic that an ombudsman provision could \nsweep through the defense authorization bill and be endorsed as \nsomething not only noncontroversial but terribly helpful. Yet, as we \nconsider managed care reform, we are struggling with this issue, among \nmany others.\n\n  My view is simple: If it makes sense for our military personnel--and \nwe are all committed to giving them the best health care--we should \nhave the same type of sensitivity for the broader population of our \ncountry. That is why the Reed-Wyden-Wellstone bill, which is part of \nthe Democratic managed care initiative, is an integral part and one \nthat should be considered, debated, and, I hope, adopted when we get--\nwe hope--to the debate and the votes on managed care.\n  Our consumer assistance, or ombudsman, program would perform several \nfunctions.\n  First, let me point out that our proposal would establish a \ncompetitive grant program for States. It would give them the \nflexibility to set up a program according to their best sense of how to \nbe of assistance and also that it be cost effective. They would, \nhowever, be required to meet certain general guidelines.\n  One of the functions of the ombudsman, would be to inform people \nabout health care plan options that would be available. There are lots \nof examples where consumers do not find out about their health care \ncoverage until they have a health care crisis.\n  I was reading the case of a mother who had a daughter who required \neye therapy. The daughter was suffering from autism. One of the \ncomplications of that disease is eye problems which requires detailed \nexercises for the eyes. If that is not done, the child rapidly loses \nthe ability to see, the ability to function appropriately.\n  She went to her health plan and said: I was told to ask you to give \nmy daughter a referral to an eye specialist for therapy. They said: No; \nyou can't do that, because it is not covered under your contract. She \nwent back and read the contract--all the fine print, all the pages and \npages and pages--and discovered, much to her disappointment, much to \nher chagrin, that indeed this was an excluded service.\n  The point is, if there is a place that parents or anyone can go to \nbeforehand and say: I have a daughter who has a condition, and there \nare complications with her sight, and other things; what advice do you \nhave for me about plans? what are the best plans? what knowledge do you \nhave about the plans that are available to me? that would be an immense \nhelp to the families of America.\n  The other thing that would be created is a 1-800 telephone hotline to \nrespond to consumer questions. Again, why don't we have this? Why don't \nwe have a place where a consumer can say: I have just talked to my \nhealth care plan; they told me I can't do this?\n  Why can't we have at least a hotline? In effect, we have lots of \nlittle fragmented hotlines. Every one of our offices is a 1-800 hotline \nfor people who are frustrated with their health care. We do it in an ad \nhoc way. We try to help our constituents. But, frankly, we could do it \nbetter and more consistently through an ombudsman program.\n  Also, what we want to do is help people who think they have been \nimproperly denied care. We want to help them, and not in an adversarial \nway, but to provide technical advice. It could be helping them write a \nletter to the insurance company to make an appeal, or explaining their \nappeal rights to them.\n  As I said before, many people simply do not understand their appeal \nrights. It could be that insurance companies do not want them to \nunderstand their appeal rights, that they would like them to walk away \nfrustrated, but it not costing the insurance companies any extra money. \nSo for all these reasons, I think an ombudsman program is an absolutely \ncritical part of any managed care reform.\n  One other reason why an ombudsman program is important is that it \ncould be a way to reduce the potential for litigation. This could be a \nway to solve problems before they get to the point that the only \nalternative a consumer thinks he or she has is to get a lawyer. This \ncould be a way to make the system work better without running the \nrisk--and I know this risk is conjured up by the insurance companies \nevery day--of litigation run amok across the United States. So for many \nreasons, I believe an ombudsman program makes so much sense.\n\n  This is not a theoretical response to hypothetical problems. Let me \noffer a couple of real cases which beg for the kind of consumer \nassistance we are suggesting in the Democratic alternative.\n  This is the story of Ms. Carolyn Boyer. Ms. Boyer is a 50-year-old \nwoman who has been battling breast cancer for about 6 years. Like so \nmany patients, she has had to wage a separate battle with her insurance \ncompany. Time and time again, her health plan has tormented her with \npayment followups and a host of bureaucratic hurdles that prevented her \nfrom getting timely payment for the services she needs.\n  This is one example. In the spring of 1996, Ms. Boyer received a bill \nfor a bone scan from Washington Sibley Memorial Hospital. She learned \nthat the total cost of the scan was $711.50 and that her portion of the \nbill, the copayment, was $142.30. She paid her portion of the bill. \nThirteen months later, Ms. Boyer received a balance due notice from \nSibley Hospital for $569.20, the amount the hospital had indicated was\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\ncovered by the insurer a year earlier. Then she got a bill from Sibley \na few days later for the entire $711.\n  This was now a battle about who was at fault. Of course, the hospital \nsaid it was the insurance company; the insurance company said it was \nthe hospital. Nevertheless, Ms. Boyer struggled through this situation. \nShe had already paid her portion, and now she was going to have to pay \nmore than the original cost if she responded to the last bill.\n  Now, 3 years later, after much travail, the insurer has paid their \nfull original amount. In fact, they gave Ms. Boyer a refund for the \n$142.30 she had paid.\n  This is a daily occurrence. For every one of our constituents, if you \nask them, either it has happened to them or it has happened to someone \nclose to them. One of the interesting things about this is, I suspect \nstrongly that the reason Ms. Boyer was successful in her battle with \nthe insurance company was that at the time of her diagnosis she was a \nlobbyist for the Health Insurance Association of America. She knew a \nlittle bit about the way HMOs and insurance companies work. Before \nthat, she was a lawyer for the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Ask yourself, what about the truck driver who is confronted with this \ndilemma? Ask yourself, what about the single mother with children? When \nthey are confronted with this dilemma, where do they go? What kind of \nlegal expertise can they call upon? The answer is, very little or none \nat all. As a result, they often do not get the care they need, or they \npay what they should not pay, or they end up paying all they have, and \nmany of them find themselves almost in bankruptcy, if not worse.\n  The protections that are built in the Democratic Patients' Bill of \nRights will help these people. They will give them access to people who \nknow how to deal with the insurance companies--not unfairly, but \nobjectively.\n  Let me give you another example of how these ombudsman programs have \nbeen helpful.\n  The Rafferty family in Sacramento, CA, were able to get their problem \nresolved after they appealed to the California Health Rights Hotline. \nThe metropolitian Sacramento area has its own hotline to address \nproblems and questions with managed care plans.\n  In September 1998, Lynmarie Rafferty gave birth, by cesarean section, \nto premature twins, Paige and Hannah. Each only weighed 2 and a half \npounds. The girls were admitted to the hospital's neonatal intensive \ncare unit in a very medically fragile condition. The Raffertys had \nchosen the hospital in part because of its intensive care facilities \nand its location close to their home.\n  Two weeks later, the Raffertys received a call from their health \nplan's medical director. He informed them that Hannah and Paige were \ngoing to be transferred to another hospital that day--not in a few \ndays, but that same day. He told the Raffertys that if the newborns \nwere not transferred on that day, the plan would not pay their hospital \nbill. The family was devastated. They had two premature babies in \nfragile medical condition suddenly being ordered out of the hospital. \nAnd if they didn't leave, then the thousands and thousands of dollars \nin bills that the Raffertys thought were being paid by the insurance \ncompany would suddenly be their bills.\n\n  They also had another young child at home, and the proximity of the \nnew hospital was much further away than the hospital where the twins \nwere currently hospitalized.\n  Well, the Raffertys went to the plan, told them of their concerns, \nbut to no avail. They went to the physician. Finally, they called the \nCalifornia health rights hotline. The hotline reviewed their plan's \ncontract and informed the Raffertys of their rights. Then the Raffertys \nsaid to their health insurance plan: We are not going to give consent \nto moving our daughters.\n  The plan still fought them and said: These babies have to leave. \nFortunately, with the help of the hotline, the Raffertys were able to \ndraft an appeal letter outlining the reasons why transferring the \nnewborns would violate their rights. Finally, the health plan backed \ndown and accepted the responsibility for the care of the children, \nwhich at that point was over $80,000.\n  Now, can you imagine where a struggling young family, with a child at \nhome and two newborns, were going to get $80,000, if the insurance \ncompany had prevailed, if there was no hotline, if there were no \nadvocates?\n  I believe very strongly that this kind of patient protection should \nbe an integral part of the legislation we consider for managed care \nreform. The Democratic alternative provides those types of protections. \nIt provides for internal reviews and external reviews that are \nobjective, not a situation where the insurance company has picked the \nindividuals who reviewing their own decisions, but truly objective. It \nalso applies the principle that if the insurance company has caused \ngrievous harm, they, just like the doctor, should be liable before a \ncourt of law.\n  It also goes a step further and says: Let's see if we can prevent \nthese troubles before they start. Let's create consumer assistance \ncenters. Let's create an ombudsman who can work with individuals and \ntry to resolve their claims long before they reach the stage where it \nis a matter of life or death or a matter of financial ruin.\n  I believe our greatest responsibility today is to move on to this \ndebate in a meaningful way, to talk about the issues of health care, to \ndebate them because there are points of difference that are principled \nand we should vigorously discuss and debate them. But we have to get \ninto that debate. The health of America depends upon it.\n  I will mention one other area which I am particularly concerned \nabout. I have spent some time talking about the issue of the appeals \nprocess, the procedural protections that we have to build in to any \npatient protection legislation that moves forward.\n  There is one other area of concern, among many, but one that \nparticularly concerns me. That is that we have to have legislation that \nis particularly sensitive to the needs of children. The Rafferty \nexample is a good one: Two premature babies who basically are being \nthreatened with eviction from the hospital. We need to be dealing with \nthe issue of children's health care in the managed care system.\n  We have to recognize, and too often we don't, that there is a \ndifference between adults and kids. Kids are different. They are \nparticularly different when it comes to health care.\n  Let me suggest some important differences which argue for special \ntreatment for children within managed care reform legislation. Once \nagain, I believe the Democratic alternative incorporates these special \ntreatments.\n  First, children are developing. This is not an issue that is \nconfronted in the context of adults who are ill. So developmental \nissues immediately and automatically create differences in the \nway children must be dealt with. Between birth and young adulthood, \nchildren change and grow. They develop intellectually. They develop \nphysically.\n\n  These developmental issues are seldom part of the equation when it \ncomes to making decisions about managed care because their models deal \nwith adults. Their models deal with very specific adult diseases and \nadult outcomes.\n  For one reason, they can measure them much better. Many times \nfamilies are faced with extreme difficulties in getting care from their \nHMO because the rules that are set for adults don't work for kids. \nTake, for example, the rule which is common in managed care, that you \ncan only have two sets of crutches in the course of your contract, or \nyear or two. That is fine if you are a fully grown person, if you are \nan adult. But if you are a developing child, you are going to need \ndifferent types of crutches, because you are going to get bigger, we \nhope. The same thing is true with wheelchairs. Children with spina \nbifida have changes in their bodies and changing needs, much more so \nthan adults. These rules, arbitrary as they may be for adults, are \ncompletely inappropriate for children because of this developmental \nissue. We have to recognize that.\n  The other thing we have to recognize is, symptoms in children which \nmight be dismissed in adults as minor could be the precursors to \nsignificant problems down the road that won't develop and be truly \nobvious for years ahead. That is another reason why children have to \nhave access to pediatric specialists, not general practitioners, who \nare used to seeing adults. And if you\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nhave some sniffles, you don't feel right, take two aspirins and get \nsome rest, that could mean something much more significant and much \nmore serious in a developing child.\n  There is another issue, too, with respect to children that makes them \nquite different from the grownup population. They are dependent. One of \nthe major measures of health care outcomes in the United States is \nindependent functioning. Can the person function independently? Can \nthey get up and move about? When you are talking about children, they \nare, by definition, dependent--dependent on adults; in many cases, they \nare dependent upon adults to explain their medical problems. It takes \ntheir parents or the care givers to explain to the physician what is \nwrong in many cases. That is a difference that seldom is appreciated in \nmanaged care plans because they don't have the kind of pediatric \nspecialists or pediatric primary care providers that are so necessary.\n  The patterns of injury are different between adults and children. The \ngood news is, the children are generally very healthy. But the bad news \nis, when a child has a serious disease, it is usually a combination of \nmany different conditions, unlike serious adult diseases which are \ntypically a single disease. Again, these complicated, interrelated \nconditions that threaten development argue for access to pediatric \nspecialists early in the process. That doesn't happen. It doesn't \nhappen enough in managed care plans.\n  The answer is not because managed care executives don't like kids; \nmanaged care executives have some sort of animus towards children. It \nhappens because of dollars and cents. If you have a very small pool of \nsick children, why are you going to go out and make arrangements to \nhave pediatric specialists in your care network? That is a lot of \noverhead for just a couple of kids.\n  We have a market failure. We have a situation in which the market \ndictates to these companies to do something which in the aggregate \nharms greatly the health of the American child. That is why we have to \nact.\n  Again, this is all part of the Democratic alternative. This is part \nof what we have to do. In addition, I would add that we need to develop \nquality measures that actually track children's health, in addition to \nadult health. We have to go beyond some of the simple things, such as \nimmunization rates. We need to get into more complicated measures and \nmake parents aware of these statistics so they make informed choices \nabout their health plans. Another thing health plans need to begin \ndoing more is looking at children in the context of some of exposures \nthat are unhealthy, but are not directly, traditionally medical; \nenvironmental exposures like lead poisoning; community exposures like \nviolence, and the stress and strain of living in difficult \ncircumstances. Our HMOs have to also begin to think about how, then, \nthey can do what we all thought they were going to do originally--\nemphasize preventive care, particularly with kids, coordinate not just \nwith their own physicians and medical providers in their networks, but \nwith the schools and community-based care centers, all of the \ninstitutions that must be allied together to help the children of \nAmerica.\n\n  Once again, the legislation that we have introduced--the Democratic \nPatients' Bill of Rights--does this. I can't think of two more \ncompelling reasons to move to this legislation in a meaningful way than \nthe opportunity to give every family a true voice in their health care \nthrough the procedural reforms that we have introduced and to give \nevery child in this country the opportunity to get the best health care \nthey can possibly get. I think we owe it to the people who sent us \nhere. I hope we can find a way to move beyond this deadlock and move to \nvigorous debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. If we do that, then we \nwill be serving very well the interests of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a week ago efforts were made by \nMembers on this side of the aisle to try to encourage our Republican \nleadership to schedule what is known as the Patients' Bill of Rights \nlegislation, which Senator Daschle has introduced and many of us have \ncosponsored. The underlying point of the Patients' Bill of Rights is \nvery basic and simple: to make sure that medical decisions are going to \nbe made by the trained medical professionals and the patients, and not \nby accountants or insurance companies. That is basically the concept \nbehind that legislation.\n  We have tried over the past week to have that legislation before the \nSenate. There are differences with the membership here on various \nprovisions. During March of this year, we had an opportunity in our \nHealth and Education Committee to have a discussion and debate on some \nof these matters, and the committee itself reported out legislation. At \nthat time, we had more than 20 different amendments dealing with a \nrange of different issues. Those were handled in a relatively \nreasonable period of time. People were familiar with the subject \nmatter, as I think they are here in this body. We had that legislation \nreported out more than three months ago. I think many of us expected \nthat, given the statements that were made by the majority leader in \nJanuary of this year on several different occasions, the Patients' Bill \nof Rights would be brought up before the Senate by now for an \nopportunity to debate and discuss it.\n  We have not had that opportunity to do so. We had hoped that was \ngoing to be the case last week when we discussed it, and we hoped, at \nleast if we were unable at that time to have this measure actually laid \ndown before the Senate on Tuesday or Wednesday, that the Republican \nleadership would indicate that we would have the chance to bring it up \nand debate it now.\n  It seemed that we might have the chance to bring it up today, with \nthe opportunity to offer amendments, and conclude the legislation by \nthe end of the week, prior to the Fourth of July recess. In the \nmeantime, it seemed that the Democratic leader had given strong \nassurances that he would do everything he possibly could in urging the \nMembers on this side to work in every possible way to expedite the \nconsideration of various appropriations bills. I think he spoke for all \nthe Members--I am sure he did--on this side on this issue. There are \nsome particular items and some of those measures that should be brought \nto the Senate for resolution. I thought that when he had indicated he \nthought it was reasonable that we could conclude a number of the \nappropriations bills and conclude this legislation, that was a very \nreasonable suggestion to the leadership.\n  Now, Mr. President, as those who follow this issue know, this is not \nthe first time the Senate has been effectively closed down--closed \ndown--closed down over their refusal to consider this legislation. That \nis effectively what is happening here. We will have some procedural \nkinds of votes, but the American people ought to understand what is \nreally happening here--that these procedural votes that we are going to \nhave later this afternoon really have nothing to do with the underlying \nlegislation; that is, the four different appropriations bills. It is \nbasically an attempt by the leadership to prohibit the debate and \ndiscussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The American people are \nbeginning to understand that more clearly.\n  I found when I was back in Massachusetts over this past weekend, \ntalking with various groups, more people are focused on this, more \npeople are paying attention, more people are aware of what is being \nattempted by the Republican majority--that is, denying us the \nopportunity for even a reasonable debate and discussion on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights--than most other issues.\n\n  I have taken the time of the Senate before--and I won't take it again \nthis afternoon--to review where we were a little over a year ago. Over \na year ago, we were in the exact same position. We were denied the \nopportunity to bring this measure up for consideration of the Senate. \nThe Republican leadership at that time said that the Democrats were not \ngoing to dictate what the agenda will be.\n  The only problem with that is that it isn't the Democrats who are \nattempting to dictate the agenda. It's the American people. It's every \nhealth care organization that has taken a position in favor of the \nproposal introduced by Senator Daschle and against the one introduced \nby Senator Frist and the Republican leadership. Virtually all\n\n[[Page S7704]]\n\nleading patient and medical groups have supported the Democratic \nproposal, Senator Daschle's proposal. We could understand why, if we \nhad an opportunity to actually debate these issues.\n  These groups do not care whether Democrats or Republicans are on a \npiece of legislation; they just want a strong bill. And virtually every \nsingle leading medical group in our country supports ours. None support \ntheirs.\n  You would think that at some time in this body, on a matter that \naffects all of the families of this country, we would have an \nopportunity to have some decisionmaking and be ready to call the roll. \nOf course, if the ramifications weren't so serious, many of us would \nhave been amused by the statements that were made last week by the \nassistant majority leader when he said: We are not going to let the \nMembers on our side vote because their votes might be misconstrued for \npolitical purposes. That would be laughable if it did not relate to an \nissue as important as the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  Imagine a political leader saying they are refusing to permit Members \nto vote because their votes may be interpreted in ways which might be \nmisconstrued. I think most of us feel that we can stand on our own two \nfeet in facing various votes. I always appreciate their leadership in \ntrying to protect our various interests. But we are not talking about \nsome narrow special interests, we are talking about the people's \ninterests.\n  As I have mentioned before, this matter is important because it is a \nchildren's issue. Virtually every major children's health group in our \ncountry--all those that advocate for children's health--has supported \nand recognized the importance of our legislation in protecting the \ninterests of children.\n  They haven't gotten a single organization that is committed to the \nadvancement of the interests of children on their side. We have all of \nthem. We have all of them because of some very important reasons. One \nof the most obvious ones is that we insist that a child who has some \nspecial need is not only going to have a pediatrician--but is also \ngoing to have a specialist trained in the area of the particular need \nof that child. If the child has cancer, the child should be treated by \na pediatric oncologist. A doctor that specializes in children and also \nchildren's cancer.\n  When our colleagues on the other side say: We don't understand why \nthe Democrats are talking about specialists because we guarantee \nspecialists; they say, ``We guarantee that a sick child will see a \npediatrician.'' But that is not the issue. The question is will a child \nwith a specific need for specialty care have access to a pediatric \nspecialist, meaning a pediatric cardiologist, or a pediatric surgeon, \nor a pediatric oncologist. Under the Republican bill, the answer is no. \nUnder our bill, the answer is yes.\n  This is a children's bill. The children's groups have spoken \npassionately, actively, and enthusiastically in support of our program.\n  This is a women's issue. The women in this country--the groups that \nhave specialized in women's health generally, and particularly those \nthat have been most concerned about issues, for example, of breast \ncancer--know the importance of having access to OB/GYN professionals, \nand to be able to designate that OB/GYN as the primary care doctor for \nwomen. We have had voluminous testimony about the importance of that.\n  It makes sense. Women also understand, particularly those who may be \nafflicted by the devastation of breast cancer, the importance of \nclinical trials. When they are talking with their doctor, and the \ndoctor says: Well, we know that there is a clinical trial out there \nthat can make a difference in terms of your survival. We know when that \npatient then asks to be enlisted in that clinical trial--and the doctor \nsays I can't because your HMO won't permit me to do it, the HMO has \noverridden my judgment on that--that denying access to it is not in the \nhealth interest of that woman. It is not in the health interest of her \nfamily, and it puts her at greater risk.\n  These are not tales. We had the testimony. We have given the examples \nof what is happening out there. This isn't a diminishing threat. To the \ncontrary, the system is becoming more of a threat to women. Women \nunderstand that. This is an enormously important issue with regard to \nwomen. That is why virtually all of the major women's groups and \norganizations support our legislation.\n  This legislation is also enormously important to those who have some \nphysical or mental disability. We don't necessarily like to use the \nword ``disability'' because it implies that people may not be able--and \nwe know that those who do have some challenge are able, and in many \ninstances gifted and talented in many different ways. But they often \nneed specialized attention, treatment, and medicine. Prescription drug \nformularies can deny access to critically important medications. Yet we \nfind that, while you can always go off the particular HMO's formulary, \nyou may have to pay exorbitant prices for the treatment.\n\n  I listened to the handful of those who spoke on the other side in the \nperiod last week who said: Oh, they can always go off the formulary. Of \ncourse they can--and pay an additional arm and a leg. I think most \nfamilies in this country understand what the problem is in terms of \nprescription drugs. They sign up for health insurance--and the HMO \ntakes their premium--and when the time comes for them to get the kind \nof treatment that they need, the HMO denies it.\n  We understand how important that is. We want to be able to debate \nthese measures, and these matters.\n  We had an excellent amendment by the Senator from California talking \nabout ``medical necessity.'' Let us use the best definition in terms of \n``medical necessity.'' Let's include in the various HMO plans what is \ngoing to be necessary in terms of treatment and what is going to \nrepresent the best in terms of medical practice. That seems to make \nsense. That is not a guarantee today.\n  I read in the Record last week about some of the various HMOs and \ntheir definitions of what was going to be included and what was going \nto be excluded. Listen to what is in the Republican bill, as offered in \nan amendment by the majority leader last week. On page 27, it says only \nthat HMOs have to provide a description of the definition of ``medical \nnecessity'' used in making coverage determinations by each plan--each \nplan.\n  Do we understand that? It isn't what is the best in terms of health \ncare. It is whatever each plan decides. So any of the HMOs can \neffectively develop whatever they want to use as a definition for \n``medical necessity.'' Your doctor might say to you: This is what the \nbest medicine is to save your life, or your child's life, or your \nwife's life, or your husband's life. And the medical plan will say: No \nway, Joe Smith. You signed our contract. You signed that contract. And \nin that contract, we say that treatment is not medically necessary. \nMake no mistake, the Republican bill says ``a description of the \ndefinition of medical necessity'' will be a determination by your plan. \nThat is the HMO.\n  Come on. Don't we think this body should be able to make a decision \nas to whether you want the Republican plan, which on page 27, line 20, \nprovides patients with ``a description of the definition of medical \nnecessity used in making coverage determinations by each plan,'' or, on \nthe other hand, you want medical decisions to be dictated by the best \nmedical practice in the United States of America?\n  That is what is in the Feinstein amendment.\n  Why shouldn't we be able to have 1 hour of debate on that, and have a \nrollcall in here and make a decision? Where are the Republican \nprinciples? Why is it that they are denying the American people the \nchance to hold their elected Representatives accountable?\n  That is what they are doing. We can't hold them accountable because \nthe other side won't permit us to get a vote on that particular issue. \nThat is what is going on here. We should have the chance. We will have \nthe chance to go through that legislation.\n  Remember all of last week they were talking about a description of \n``medical necessity''--the definition of medical necessity used to make \ncoverage determinations is decided by each such plan under the \nRepublican leadership's bill.\n  That ought to chill every Member of the opposite side--to think that \nis the\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\nposition that they are stuck with. That is in their Republican bill.\n  What we are trying to do with the amendment of the Senator from \nCalifornia is to change that to make sure that decisions of medical \nnecessity will be based on the best that we have in terms of treatment, \nand in terms of the opinions of trained individuals and research.\n  Let's let the American people understand who is on our side on this \nparticular issue, and who is on the side of the insurance companies. \nThe HMOs are fundamentally the ones that refuse to use the best medical \nscience in terms of their definitions.\n  This is just one example. It is a very powerful one, but I believe \nthat if we had been able to get on this legislation last week when the \nFeinstein amendment was actually brought up, we would have been on the \nappropriations bill this week. We might have concluded several of those \nvarious appropriations bills. Instead the whole of last week has passed \nwithout any progress, and we are starting over again evidently in \nanticipation of this week's activity.\n  Now, apparently, we are going to take a good part of this week just \nto deny the Senate the opportunity of making a judgment on whether \nmedical decisions should be made by doctors and patients, or by HMO \naccountants. They won't permit a number of amendments. They won't even \npermit Members a chance to debate and conclude this in five days. We \ntook 7 to 9 days on the Y2K legislation to try and deal with some \nanticipated problem regarding the computer industry, but we won't be \nable to take the few days necessary to protect the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our effort with these cloture votes was to \nfind a way to move the people's business forward. We had four cloture \nvotes on four appropriations bills: one on the agriculture \nappropriations bill and three on motions to proceed to other bills--\nCommerce-Justice-State transportation, and foreign operations \nappropriations.\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n  Obviously, these bills are ready to go. We should make every effort \nto consider those and/or other bills. I understand the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill is ready and perhaps Treasury-Postal \nService. The Appropriations Committee is doing its work, and its work \nis stacking up now on our calendar.\n  The business before us is exactly how to proceed with the cloture \nmotion filed on the Kennedy bill, which was offered as a second-degree \namendment to the Feinstein amendment. I had suggested we would be \nwilling to do it in the stacked sequence today, but I did not ask \nconsent for that. We need to find some way to move forward on that \ncloture vote.\n  Rather than waiting until Wednesday, I want us to find a way to have \nthat vote so we can move on to what is to be the outcome of that and \nwhatever follows next.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7707-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I do not believe I am able to do that, although I do not \nknow of any reason that would be used.\n  But I think at this point I would not be inclined to waive a point of \norder.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, until we have been able to clarify that, \nI will have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me explain briefly our situation.\n  Early this year, the majority leader stated we would take up the \nPatients' Bill of Rights in June. We applauded that commitment. That is \nreally what this fight is all about--maintaining the commitment that \nwas made earlier.\n  Democrats have been saying we will do everything humanly possible to \nensure that the Senate engages in a full, meaningful debate on the \ncentral issues of managed care reform:\n  Whether doctors or HMO bureaucrats determine what tests or treatments \nare medically necessary;\n  Whether you or your child can see a qualified specialist;\n  Whether patients have access to a timely, independent, external \nreview to appeal HMO decisions to deny care;\n  Whether HMOs should be held accountable for medical decisions to deny \nor delay care that injure or even kill patients;\n  Whether an HMO bureaucrat, or your doctor, decides what prescription \ndrugs you need;\n  Whether you or your family member can participate in a clinical trial \nfor a potentially life-saving new treatment;\n  Whether all privately insured Americans deserve protection.\n  The list goes on and on. Those are some of the issues, some of the \nquestions.\n  We have tried to reach an agreement with the majority to call up the \nbill separately. All we have asked is that we be guaranteed votes on \nthose central issues. So far, the majority has refused.\n  What we have done in the last few days is what we vowed we would have \nto do: We are offering our proposal as amendments on the floor, as is \nour right under the Senate rules.\n  In my view, it is also our obligation to bring to the floor of the \nSenate the issues that matter most to the American people.\n  While some have suggested there isn't time for this debate, others \nhave stated quite clearly their real reason for refusing: They do not \nwant to vote on these issues.\n  Why don't they want to cast these votes? Because they are, frankly, \non the wrong side of the issues. They do not want to have to defend \ntheir position.\n  They said they want to get beyond the Feinstein amendment. They can. \nAll they have to do is vote on it. The majority wants to accuse us of \nholding up the Senate, but nothing is stopping any member of the \nmajority from moving to table the Feinstein amendment. They can do that \ntonight. We could have our vote and move on to another amendment. That \nis all that is required: Table the Feinstein amendment if you do not \nlike it.\n  But the majority appears not to want to table the amendment. They \nappear to be afraid to have that vote, afraid to let doctors make \nmedical decisions, afraid to admit they are blocking that patient \nprotection. I have never seen anything like the bob-and-weave tactics \nthat have been employed to date to avoid this vote.\n  So what are they afraid of? What is wrong with doctors making medical \ndecisions? I believe this is gamesmanship at its worst.\n  Last week we heard several Republican Senators talk about how good \ntheir Patients' Bill of Rights is. Then they voted to strip it from the \nfloor.\n  Now they are offering the Democratic bill--which they tabled just \nlast week so they could avoid an up-or-down vote on the Feinstein \namendment--so they can avoid a vote on whether or not to let doctors \nand other health care professionals determine what is medically \nnecessary.\n  Every day the majority makes these decisions, every day they avoid \nthese tough votes, someone's child, someone's parent, someone's spouse \nis being denied medical care prescribed by a doctor because an \ninsurance company accountant is saying it isn't really necessary or \nthat it costs too much.\n  Let me make one thing very clear. This dispute isn't about the \nSenate's time. In the time the majority has spent avoiding a single \nvote on medical necessity, we could have considered the entire \nPatients' Bill of Rights amendments. They have turned down every offer \nwe have made to address this issue in an efficient manner. This dispute \nisn't about time, it is about actual votes on actual rights. We insist \non having them--both the votes and the rights. Apparently our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle want neither.\n  Up-or-down votes--isn't that what the Senate is here to do, to vote \non the issues that matter the most? If and when the majority is willing \nto vote on these issues, the Senate can move on. But it is our belief \nthat the Senate should not move on until it has dealt properly with one \nof the most important issues facing virtually every American--their \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Corporation for National Service \nrecently announced the first winners of the National Service-Learning \nLeader Schools program, a Presidential initiative to recognize \noutstanding schools for their achievements in the field of service-\nlearning.\n  Learn and Serve America, one of the three national service programs \nof the Corporation for National Service, is sponsoring the Leader \nSchools initiative. In this, its pilot year, the program is honoring 70 \nhigh schools in 41 states and the District of Columbia for thoughtfully \nand effectively integrating community service into the lives of \nstudents. The goals of the program are to promote civic responsibility, \nimprove school and student performance, and strengthen local \ncommunities.\n  Four schools from Massachusetts--Drury High School in North Adams, \nHudson High School, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Sharon High School \nhave been leaders in our state on service-learning, and were honored by \nthis designation. I commend them for the important work that they have \naccomplished in making community service an integral part of school \nlife. These schools are impressive models for Massachusetts and for the \nnation.\n  The Leader Schools program is not simply an awards program. The \nschools being honored today are also making a two year commitment to \nhelp other schools include service-learning in their curriculum.\n  In May 1996, President Clinton announced his intention to identify \nand honor the schools that have done the best job of encouraging, \norganizing, and leading the service-learning movement. He said, ``We \nshould make service to the community a part of every high school in \nAmerica and a part of the life of every dedicated citizen in the United \nStates.\n  Many of us have seen local service-learning programs in action and \nthe inspiring way that students of all ages respond and work together \nto improve their communities.\n  The Corporation for National Service also administers AmeriCorps, the \ndomestic Peace Corps that is engaging over 40,000 Americans in \nintensive, service activities. In addition, it administers the National \nSenior Service Corps, which is involving nearly half a million \nAmericans age fifty-five and older to share their time and talents to \nhelp solve local problems. These three outstanding programs are all \nachieving great success under the strong leadership of our former \ncolleague in the Senate, Harris Wofford, who is the chief executive \nofficer of the Corporation.\n  I also commend Carol Kinsley, a member of the Corporation's Board of \nDirectors, for her strong commitment and leadership in the field of \nservice-learning. The dedication of citizens like Carol are \ncontributing immensely to the success of our national service programs.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of Leader Schools be printed in \nthe Record.\n  These seventy schools were honored in a ceremony held at the Kennedy \nCenter last week. These schools are leaders in education reform, and I \ncommend them for all they are doing so well for our country and its \nfuture.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n             1999 National Service-Learning Leader Schools\n\n       Charles Henderson High School, Troy, AL; Mesa High School, \n     Mesa, AZ; Saguaro High School, Scottsdale, AZ; Community \n     ACTION Academy at Balboa High School, San Francisco, CA; Los \n     Molinos High School, Los Molinos, CA; Pioneer High School, \n     San Jose, CA; Eagle Rock School and Professional Development \n     Center, Estes Park, CO; Grand Junction High School, Grand \n     Junction, CO.\n       Waterford High School, Waterford, CT; Bell Multicultural \n     High School, Washington, DC; PEAK (Program for Educational \n     Alternatives in Kent County), Dover, DE; Mainland High \n     School, Daytona Beach, FL; Rutherford High School, Panama, \n     FL; South Lake High School, Groveland, FL; Carver High \n     School, Columbus, GA; Konawaena High School, Kealakekua, HI; \n     Olomana School, Kailua, HI.\n       Marion High School, Marion, IA; Shelley High School, \n     Shelley, ID; Harry D.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the ``Colorado \n     Wilderness Act of 1999''; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1020\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 829, the ``Colorado Wilderness Act of 1999'', \n     proposes to designate another approximately one million four \n     hundred thousand acres of land in Colorado as wilderness \n     prior to the revision of many of Colorado's forest plans, \n     thereby usurping the United States Forest Service's land \n     management review process and ignoring the original \n     wilderness recommendations made to the United States Congress \n     by the United States Bureau of Land Management (``BLM'') that \n     totaled four hundred thirty-one thousand acres; and\n       Whereas, H.R. 829 was drafted without input from either the \n     general public or local elected officials and does away with \n     local control over land management; and\n       Whereas, Federal lands in Colorado have been exhaustively \n     studied for their wilderness suitability under the \n     ``Wilderness Act'' of 1964, the Department of Agriculture's \n     second roadless area review and evaluation (RARE II), the \n     wilderness evaluation by the BLM, the ``Colorado Wilderness \n     Act of 1980'', and the ``Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993''; \n     and\n       Whereas, Many acres of federal lands slated for wilderness \n     designation do not qualify as pristine as required by the \n     ``Wilderness Act'' of 1964; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress considered the option \n     of wilderness designation of federal lands in Colorado and \n     designated several areas under the ``Wilderness Act'' of 1964 \n     and approved two statewide wilderness bills. One of those \n     statewide wilderness bills was enacted in 1980 and classified \n     one million four hundred thousand acres as wilderness. The \n     other was enacted in 1993 and provided wilderness protection \n     for six hundred eleven thousand seven hundred acres, bringing \n     the total wilderness acreage in Colorado to three million \n     three hundred thousand to date; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress declared that lands \n     once studied and found to be unsuitable for wilderness \n     designation should be returned to multiple-use management; \n     and\n       Whereas, H.R. 829 creates a federal reserved water right \n     for each wilderness area, an approach specifically rejected \n     in the 1980 and 1993 wilderness bills; and\n       Whereas, The designation of downstream wilderness areas may \n     result in the application of the federal ``Clean Water Act of \n     1977'' requirements in a manner that interferes with existing \n     and future beneficial water uses in Colorado; and\n       Whereas, The overall effect of the designation of \n     downstream wilderness areas will be to destroy Colorado's \n     ability to develop and use water allocated to the citizens of \n     this state and under interstate compacts, thereby forfeiting \n     Colorado's water to downstream states; and\n       Whereas, Many of our rural economies are dependent on a \n     combination of multiple uses of our public lands, such as \n     timber production, oil, gas, and mineral development, and \n     motorized and mechanized recreation, all of which are \n     prohibited by a wilderness designation and also severely \n     inhibits the ability to conduct grazing activities on public \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, Wilderness designations limit the land management \n     options available to public land managers to protect forest \n     health and dependent watersheds; and\n       Whereas, Additional wilderness designation puts increased \n     pressure on the new designated lands as well as lands \n     currently open to multiple-use activities and limits access \n     to only the most physically capable individuals; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein;\n       That the members of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     oppose H.R. 829, the ``Colorado Wilderness Act of 1999''. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the United States \n     Secretary of the Interior, the Director of the United States \n     Bureau of Land Management, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and to each member of Colorado's delegation \n     in the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-218. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to hardrock mining \n     activities; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1023\n\n       Whereas, The mining industry is vital to the economy of \n     Colorado, with direct and indirect contributions to the \n     state's economy that exceed $7.7 billion annually; and\n       Whereas, Hardrock miners are the highest paid industrial \n     workers in Colorado, earning average annual wages of \n     approximately $60,000; and\n       Whereas, The producers of gold, silver, lead, zinc, \n     molybdenum, gypsum, and other minerals located under the \n     general mining laws provide a source of high paying jobs in \n     rural areas of Colorado whose economies are highly dependent \n     upon resource extraction; and\n       Whereas, Lower mineral commodity prices and other economic \n     factors continue to challenge this industry making it \n     important that state and local governments fashion regulatory \n     programs that are cost effective and yet sufficient to \n     regulate the environmental impacts of hardrock mining \n     activities on public and private lands; and\n       Whereas, The ``Federal Land Policy and Management Act of \n     1976'' requires that mineral activities on federal lands \n     protect the environment and prohibits any mining activity \n     that would result in unnecessary and undue degradation of \n     these areas; and\n       Whereas, The Bureau of Land Management within the United \n     States Department of the Interior implements the mandate of \n     federal law through regulations codified at 43 C.F.R. subpart \n     3809, and these laws and regulations are among the many laws \n     that require mineral producers to protect air, water, \n     cultural, historic, fish, wildlife, and other resources; and\n       Whereas, The division of minerals and geology in the \n     Colorado department of natural resources, through a \n     cooperative agreement with the Bureau of Land Management, is \n     the lead agency responsible for regulating mining activity on \n     both public and private lands; and\n       Whereas, Colorado effectively regulates mining operations \n     pursuant to the ``Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Act'', part \n     1 of article 32 of title 34, Colorado Revised Statutes, that \n     sets forth very comprehensive permitting, bonding, \n     environmental management, monitoring, and reclamation \n     requirements for hardrock mining activities on both public \n     and private lands; and\n       Whereas, The Colorado General Assembly strengthened this \n     law in 1993 requiring that mining operators using certain \n     toxic chemicals in mineral extraction meet more stringent \n     standards before receiving authorization to mine; and\n       Whereas, The United States Department of the Interior, \n     through the Bureau of Land Management, has announced its \n     intention to propose revisions to 43 C.F.R. subpart 3809, \n     that would preempt, conflict with, and duplicate the very \n     effective state program now in place, and replace it with a \n     plenary federal program that may well lessen the \n     environmental protections available under state law; and\n       Whereas, In 1998, the United States Congress enacted \n     legislation directing the National Academy of Sciences to \n     perform a study of the adequacy of state and federal laws \n     governing hardrock mining on public lands and submit its \n     findings and recommendations before the Department of the \n     Interior's Bureau of Land Management may finalize changes to \n     regulations under 43 C.F.R. subpart 3809; and\n       Whereas, Notwithstanding the express mandate of Congress, \n     the Bureau of Land Management proposed revisions to the \n     regulations promulgated under 43 C.F.R. subpart 3809, in \n     February, 1999, before the National Academy of Sciences has \n     concluded, much less submitted, its study and \n     recommendations, and the Bureau of Land Management has failed \n     to consider the National Academy of Sciences' findings or \n     process in fashioning the various regulatory revisions \n     currently awaiting public comment; and\n       Whereas, Any changes to the regulations promulgated under \n     43 C.F.R. subpart 3809 must be based upon sound science and \n     compelling policy reasons, and must take into account the \n     findings and recommendations of the National Academy of \n     Sciences' study before the Bureau of Land Management submits \n     its proposal for public comment, yet the comment period on \n     the proposed rules is set to expire on May 10, 1999, before \n     the National Academy of Sciences completes its study of \n     existing laws; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       1. That the General Assembly calls upon the United States \n     Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land Management \n     to withdraw the current proposal to amend the federal \n     regulations, 43 C.F.R. subpart 3809 and published at 64 F.R. \n     6422 on February 9, 1999, governing hardrock mining activity.\n       2. That the General Assembly calls upon the Bureau of Land \n     Management to await completion of the study currently \n     underway by the National Academy of Sciences of the adequacy \n     of hardrock mining regulations, which must be completed prior \n     to July 31, 1999, and that the Bureau of Land Management \n     refrain from publishing any further\n\n[[Page S7713]]\n\n     changes to the existing rules before it has fully considered \n     the results of the study.\n       3. That the General Assembly calls upon the Bureau of Land \n     Management, if it decides that further revisions to 43 C.F.R. \n     subpart 3809 are necessary, to fully explain in the preamble \n     to the new regulations how it fashioned its proposals in \n     response to the anticipated findings and conclusions of the \n     National Academy of Sciences' study and give the public at \n     least 90 days to comment on the proposed changes.\n       4. That the General Assembly opposes changes to 43 C.F.R. \n     subpart 3809 that would preempt the existing Colorado \n     regulatory program or that would duplicate permitting and \n     other requirements.\n       5. That the General Assembly calls upon the United States \n     Department of the Interior to consider that the mining \n     industry is one of the most heavily regulated industries in \n     the United States and that unreasonable delays in obtaining \n     permits are a significant disincentive to the location of new \n     mines or expansion of existing mines in the United States.\n       6. That the General Assembly opposes the concept developed \n     as a result of 43 C.F.R. subpart 3809 of using the ``Most \n     Appropriate Technology and Practices'' which allows the \n     Bureau of Land Management to dictate what type of equipment \n     and technologies are employed by mining operators. Using the \n     ``Most Appropriate Technology and Practices'' would replace \n     the existing regulatory scheme that requires mining operators \n     meet performance standards, but allows the individual \n     operators to decide how the individual operator will meet \n     environmental standards.\n       7. That the General Assembly specifically calls upon the \n     Bureau of Land Management to consider the economic impact on \n     mining and the communities dependent upon mining in Colorado \n     and other states.\n       8. That the Bureau of Land Management specifically consider \n     the conclusions in the Fraser Report that found that Colorado \n     and many other states were ranked low in investment \n     attractiveness due, in part to the burden that government \n     regulation imposes on the industry. Colorado received a score \n     of only 24 out of a possible 100 in the Fraser Report.\n       9. That the General Assembly further calls upon the \n     Congress of the United States to impose a moratorium on any \n     appropriations for the continuation or completion of the \n     current rulemaking until the Department of the Interior \n     withdraws the current rulemaking and agrees to fully consider \n     the findings and recommendations of the National Academy of \n     Sciences' study. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the \n     President of the United States, the Vice-president of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of the Interior, the Director of the Bureau of Land \n     Management, and each member of the Colorado Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-219. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the Environmental \n     Protection Agency's over-filing against regulated entities in \n     Colorado where Colorado has already taken enforcement action; \n     to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1037\n\n       Whereas, Protection of public health and the environment \n     are among the highest priorities of government that requires \n     a united and uniform effort at all levels of government; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress has enacted \n     environmental laws to ensure the protection of the nation's \n     environment and consequently the health of the citizens of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, These federal environmental laws often provide for \n     the primacy of their administration and enforcement to be \n     delegated to the individual states; and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) is responsible for the administration and enforcement \n     of these federal environmental laws; and\n       Whereas, States that have been delegated primacy have \n     demonstrated to the EPA that they have adopted laws, \n     regulations, and policies at least as stringent as federal \n     laws, regulations, and policies; and\n       Whereas, The individual states are best able to administer \n     and enforce these environmental laws for the benefit of all \n     of their citizens and the citizens of the United States in \n     general; and\n       Whereas, the EPA and the states have bilaterally developed \n     policy agreements over the past twenty-five years that \n     reflect the roles of the states and the EPA, recognizing that \n     the primary responsibility for enforcement action resides \n     with the individual states, with EPA taking enforcement \n     action principally where an individual state requests \n     assistance or is unwilling or unable to take timely and \n     appropriate enforcement action; and\n       Whereas, Inconsistent with these policy agreements, the EPA \n     has levied fines and penalties against regulated entities in \n     cases where the state previously took appropriate action \n     consistent with the agreements to bring such entities into \n     compliance; and\n       Whereas, Colorado statutes give authority to the \n     appropriate state agencies for the administration and \n     enforcement of state and federal environmental laws; and\n       Whereas, The EPA continues to enforce federal environmental \n     laws despite Colorado's primacy and has acted in areas of \n     violations where the state has already acted; and\n       Whereas, The EPA has been unwilling to recognize the \n     importance of Colorado's ability to develop methods for the \n     state to meet the standards established by the EPA and \n     federal environmental laws while recognizing state and local \n     concerns and circumstances unique to Colorado; and\n       Whereas, A cooperative effort between the state and the EPA \n     is essential to ensure such consistency while making certain \n     to consider state and local concerns; and\n       Whereas, The EPA has been hesitant to recognize that \n     economic incentives and rewarding compliance are acceptable \n     alternatives to acting only after violations have occurred; \n     and\n       Whereas, The EPA's current enforcement practices and \n     policies result in detailed oversight and over-filing of \n     state actions causing the weakening of Colorado's ability to \n     take effective compliance actions and resolve environmental \n     issues; and\n       Whereas, The current EPA enforcement policy and actions \n     have had and continue to have an adverse impact on working \n     relationships between the EPA and Colorado and many other \n     western states; and\n       Whereas, The Western Governors' Association has adopted \n     ``Principles for Environmental Protection in the West'' which \n     encourages collaboration and not polarization between the EPA \n     and the states, and further encourages the replacement of the \n     command and control structure of the EPA with economic \n     incentives encouraging results and environmental decisions \n     that weigh costs against benefits in taking actions; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That we ask Congress to require the EPA to recognize \n     that the State of Colorado has the requisite authority, \n     expertise, experience, and resources to administer delegated \n     federal environmental programs by:\n       (a) Affording Colorado flexibility and deference in the \n     administration and enforcement of delegated federal \n     environmental programs;\n       (b) Refraining from over-filing against recognized \n     violators where Colorado has negotiated a compliance action \n     in accordance with its approved EPA management systems, so \n     long as that compliance action achieves compliance with \n     applicable requirements; and\n       (c) Allowing Colorado the ability to develop plans for \n     achieving national environmental standards established by the \n     EPA that are tailored to meet local conditions and \n     priorities.\n       (2) That we ask Congress to require the EPA to enter into \n     memoranda of understanding with the individual states that \n     outline performance and set joint goals and measures to \n     ensure compliance with federal environmental laws while \n     recognizing that states that have achieved primacy in \n     environmental programs have the right to direct compliance \n     actions.\n       (3) That we ask Congress to require the EPA to develop \n     policies and practices that recognize that:\n       (a) Successful environmental policy and implementation are \n     best accomplished through balanced, open, inclusive \n     approaches where the public and private stakeholders work \n     together to formulate locally-based solutions to \n     environmental issues;\n       (b) Threats of enforcement action to force compliance with \n     specific technology or processes may not result in \n     environmental protection but, instead, reward delay and \n     litigation, cripple incentives for technological innovation, \n     increase animosity between government, industry, and the \n     public, and increase the cost of environmental protection; \n     and\n       (c) Effective management of environmental compliance is \n     dependent upon the EPA shifting its focus from threats of \n     enforcement action to one of compliance and the use of all \n     available technologies, tools, and actions of the individual \n     states. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, each member of Colorado's Congressional \n     Delegation, the Director of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency, the Director of the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assistance, and the \n     Regional Administrator of EPA Region VIII.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-220. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the labeling of \n     agricultural products; to the Committee on Agriculture, \n     Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1043\n\n       Whereas, It is essential that consumers have access to \n     accurate facts to make informed choices about the food they \n     purchase; and\n       Whereas, Current federal legislation requires country-of-\n     origin labeling on frozen produce, but not on meat, poultry, \n     or fresh produce, which creates a confusing double standard \n     for consumers; and\n       Whereas, The current United States Department of \n     Agriculture policy of placing a grading label on imported \n     meats misleads consumers who believe the label means that the \n     product was produced in the United States; and\n\n[[Page S7714]]\n\n       Whereas, Many of the trading partners for the United States \n     require country-of-origin labels on food products produced in \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that 95% of the 625 million pounds \n     of meat imported into the United States annually is imported \n     for the purpose of additional processing and is therefore \n     exempt from import labeling provisions of the federal ``Pure \n     Food and Drug Act''; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That the General Assembly requests that the United \n     States Congress pass legislation requiring labels that \n     disclose the country of origin on meats, poultry, and fresh \n     produce; and\n       (2) That the General Assembly requests that the United \n     States Congress pass legislation prohibiting meat and cattle \n     raised or produced outside of the United States and destined \n     for immediate slaughter from carrying the United States \n     Department of Agriculture quality grade label; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the Senate \n     and the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the United \n     States Congress, each member of the Congressional delegation \n     from Colorado, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Agriculture, and the Federal Trade Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-221. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the ``Regional Haze \n     Rule''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1047\n\n       Whereas, The federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \n     has promulgated the ``Regional Haze Rule'' which has general \n     national applicability as well as containing alternative \n     provisions that Colorado and other western states may utilize \n     to deal with regional haze problems; and\n       Whereas, The Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission, \n     comprised of the states of Colorado, Arizona, California, New \n     Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming and the Acoma, \n     Hopi, Hualapai, and Navaho tribe, as well as federal \n     agencies, industry, and environmental groups, spent over 9 \n     million dollars and 3 years of detailed study and analysis to \n     directly address regional haze problems and issued their \n     findings in the 1996 report entitled, ``Recommendations for \n     Improving Western Vistas''; and\n       Whereas, The federal ``Regional Haze Rule'' ignores the \n     primary recommendations of the Grand Canyon Visibility \n     Transport Commission to seek to improve haze by regulating \n     all sources of haze, including visibility impairing emissions \n     arising from federal lands; and\n       Whereas, The Grand Canyon Visibility Transport Commission \n     found that unless emissions from all sources of haze are \n     reduced, a recognizable improvement in visibility cannot be \n     achieved; and\n       Whereas, Colorado is a receptor of haze attributable to \n     upwind sources such as emissions from fires on federal lands, \n     the Republic of Mexico, and sources located in other states; \n     and\n       Whereas, Colorado has participated since 1996 with other \n     western states in the Western Regional Air Partnership \n     (WRAP), formed as the successor body to implement the Grand \n     Canyon Visibility Transport Commission's comprehensive \n     regional approach to control all sources of regional haze; \n     and\n       Whereas, As the alternative regional provisions mandated in \n     the ``Regional Haze Rule'' prevent Colorado from receiving \n     credit in its state implementation plan (SIP) for controlling \n     sources of haze other than stationary sources which the Grand \n     Canyon Visibility Transport Commission report found are not a \n     primary cause of western haze; and\n       Whereas, Prior to the promulgation of the ``Regional Haze \n     Rule'', in violation of procedural fair play, the EPA made \n     major substantive changes to the draft rule without making \n     those changes available for public comment; and\n       Whereas, The United States Congress, in the 1998-99 EPA \n     appropriations measure, specifically recommended to the EPA \n     that the entire ``Regional Haze Rule'' be redrafted and made \n     available for full public participation and comment on the \n     substantive draft changes; and\n       Whereas, Amendments by other agencies and by other persons \n     identified as representing ``western state interests'' to the \n     draft rule were offered by the EPA without the opportunity \n     for the general public to comment and without allowing for \n     states that participated in the WRAP to receive credit in \n     their SIPs for regulating sources of haze other than \n     stationary sources; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado, the Senate \n     concurring herein:\n       (1) That the United States Congress is urged to subject the \n     ``Regional Haze Rule'' to congressional rule review, to \n     reject the rule, and return it to the EPA for proper \n     participation by all interested parties prior to promulgation \n     in accordance with the requirements of the federal \n     ``Administrative Procedures Act.''\n       (2) That the member of the General Assembly respectfully \n     request the Governor of Colorado to withdraw from \n     participation in the WRAP until such time as the ``Regional \n     Haze Rule'' is revised to allow for effective participation \n     of the state of Colorado in control of all sources of haze on \n     an equal basis; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     Governor of the State of Colorado, the President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, each \n     member of Colorado's Congressional Delegation, the Director \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Director of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency's Office of Enforcement and \n     Compliance Assistance, and the Regional Administrator of EPA \n     Region VIII.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-222. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution 99-1051\n\n       Whereas, the ``Endangered Species Act of 1973'' (ESA) needs \n     to be amended to encourage proactive species conservation \n     efforts at the state level rather than reactive, burdensome, \n     and costly efforts at the federal level; and\n       Whereas, Merely listing a species as threatened or \n     endangered does little to conserve the species; and\n       Whereas, Many state programs such as Colorado's nongame \n     program have been very successful in conserving species such \n     as the boreal toad without a federal listing; and\n       Whereas, The ESA should provide incentives for states to \n     adopt proactive approaches to avoid the listing of species \n     under the ESA rather than penalizing such efforts; and\n       Whereas, The ESA should be amended to provide that a \n     federal listing is not required where a state has already \n     adopted a program to protect the species unless it is \n     absolutely necessary to avoid nationwide extinction; and\n       Whereas, If a state has an effective program to protect a \n     listed species in place, that program should be recognized as \n     a reasonable and prudent alternative under the ESA, thereby \n     providing a cost-effective means for species recovery, \n     maintaining state jurisdiction over land and water resources, \n     and allowing economic development to move forward; and\n       Whereas, States should not be penalized for efforts to \n     enhance or establish populations of species by federal pre-\n     emption once the species is listed, rather, such populations \n     should qualify as experimental under the ESA, thereby \n     maintaining control and regulation of the species by the \n     state; and\n       Whereas, The ESA should not be applied retroactively, and \n     projects in existence prior to the passage of the ESA that \n     may come up for a federal permit or license renewal but do \n     not involve an expansion of the project or an increase in the \n     environmental impact of the project should not be subject to \n     consultation under Section 7 of the ESA; and\n       Whereas, Federal implementation of the ESA to protect \n     aquatic species must consider state water rights, and any \n     recovery program should be structured to avoid or minimize \n     intrusion into state authority over water allocation and \n     administration; and\n       Whereas, The administration's ``No Surprises'' policy \n     should be adopted as an amendment to the ESA so that permit \n     holders and landowners have some assurance that once ESA \n     requirements have been met, no further mitigation efforts \n     will be required; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the Sixty-\n     second General Assembly of the State of Colorado (The Senate \n     concurring herein), That we, the members of the Sixty-second \n     General Assembly, urge Congress to adopt these amendments to \n     the federal ``Endangered Species Act of 1973''; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of Colorado's Congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-223. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Nevada relative to air tours over the Grand \n     Canyon; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 21\n\n       Whereas, Tourism is the mainstay of the Nevada economy; and\n       Whereas, The air tour industry is an exciting and strong \n     attraction for visitors to Southern Nevada; and Air tours \n     over the Grand Canyon have been a tourism tradition for more \n     than 70 years and this industry has maintained a strong \n     safety record; and\n       Whereas, Approximately 800,000 visitors from around the \n     world enjoyed air tours of the Grand Canyon in 1996 and \n     500,000 of those visitors originated their flights in \n     Southern Nevada; and\n       Whereas, Air tours are the only way that persons who have \n     certain physical disabilities can experience the grandeur of \n     the Grand Canyon; and\n       Whereas, In 1996, a study conducted by the University of \n     Nevada, Las Vegas, estimated that air tourism to the Grand \n     Canyon using Southern Nevada air tour operators contributed \n     more than $374.8 million to the Southern Nevada economy; and\n       Whereas, The study concluded that the Las Vegas Convention \n     and Visitors Authority generates air tour industry \n     expenditures of $49.8 million each year; and\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n       Whereas, The study determined that more than 142,000 \n     foreign visitors, which constitutes 32.4 percent of all \n     foreign visitors, and more than 9,000 visitors from the \n     United States, which constitutes 23.7 percent of all visitors \n     from within the United States, would forego visits to \n     Southern Nevada if the Grand Canyon air tours were \n     unavailable; and\n       Whereas, Recent economic downturns in Asia have adversely \n     impacted tourism in Southern Nevada; and\n       Whereas, The air tour industry provides visual access to \n     back country of the Grand Canyon including many of its most \n     spectacular sights, and without air tours, only a small \n     minority of visitors who have the time and physical ability \n     to hike in the canyon would be afforded the opportunity to \n     appreciate these magnificent sights; and\n       Whereas, Air tours do not cause a permanent negative impact \n     on the fragile environment of the Grand Canyon as do some \n     other activities; and\n       Whereas, In 1988, Special Federal Aviation Regulation 50-2 \n     was enacted establishing routes, altitudes and reporting \n     requirements and as a result of this legislation, noise \n     complaints have been dramatically reduced and there has been \n     a substantial restoration of natural quiet to the Grand \n     Canyon; and\n       Whereas, Since the enactment of the requirements of this \n     regulation, 92 percent of visitors to the park have reported \n     that they were not adversely affected by aircraft sounds, and \n     visitors to the back country have reported seeing or hearing \n     only one or two aircraft a day; and\n       Whereas, The United States Forest Service concluded in 1992 \n     that there were ``few adverse impacts to wilderness users'' \n     from aircraft tours and that the flights did not impair the \n     overall enjoyment of the wilderness or reduce the likelihood \n     of repeat visits; and\n       Whereas, A hearing held on September 2, 1998, by the House \n     National Parks and Public Lands Subcommittee disclosed that \n     the National Park Service noise analysis failed to undergo \n     scientific modeling or peer review; and\n       Whereas, The National Park Service disclosed on February 2, \n     1999, its intention to redefine the threshold for substantial \n     restoration of natural quiet in the air tour air space of \n     Grand Canyon National Park at a noticeability level of 8 \n     decibels below natural ambient air sound; and\n       Whereas, Air tour operators and acoustical experts conclude \n     that this higher threshold proposed by the National Park \n     Service would virtually shut down air tours in the east end \n     air space of the Grand Canyon National Park; and\n       Whereas, The Federal Aviation Administration now proposes \n     to conduct an environmental assessment of air routes from Las \n     Vegas to the Grand Canyon based solely on sound that could \n     lead to further restriction or capping of flights; and\n       Whereas, The Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Nevada \n     Commission on Tourism, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors \n     Authority and McCarran International Airport repeatedly have \n     supported maintaining a viable Southern Nevada air tour \n     industry and continued air access to and from Las Vegas; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the State of Nevada \n     (jointly), That the Nevada Legislature expresses its concern \n     regarding any proposal to redefine the space in which \n     aircraft may be flown over the Grand Canyon and urges the \n     Congress of the United States to effect an outcome for the \n     Southern Nevada air tour industry that will protect, support \n     and sustain the viability of this significant contributor to \n     the tourism economy of the State of Nevada and the enjoyment \n     of visitors and sightseers; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate prepare and \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Vice President of \n     the United States as presiding officer of the Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, each member of the \n     Nevada Congressional Delegation, the Grand Canyon Air Tour \n     Council and the United States Air Tour Association; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That this resolution becomes effective upon \n     passage and approval.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-224.

A \n     permanent underground repository is needed to provide safe \n     and secure long-term disposal of this spent fuel and waste; \n     and\n       Whereas, The deadline for acceptance of spent fuel and \n     waste by the Department of Energy was one year ago. H.R. 45 \n     would accelerate acceptance of spent fuel and waste by the \n     Department of Energy by authorizing an interim storage \n     facility at Yucca Mountain; and\n       Whereas, Michigan residents deserve protection of the \n     $323.8 million investment they have made toward the \n     construction of a permanent site. They have every right to \n     demand that the federal government honor its commitment to \n     the nation in a timely and cost-effective manner. There can \n     be no further delay in carrying out the provisions of the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. Michigan residents are \n     entitled to the safety and economic benefit to be gained by \n     permanent disposal; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-225.

The men and women who fought and who died during \n     the century's darkest hours to secure the freedoms we enjoy \n     today command our lasting gratitude. Their supreme sacrifies \n     continue to touch every American. The World War II Memorial \n     is a small but important step in repaying the immeasurable \n     debt we owe these individuals. Many of these men and women \n     have continued serving their country in community service \n     organizations, such as the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the \n     American Legion. This legislation set in motion a long \n     process of securing support, establishing a site and design, \n     and working with the American Battle Monuments Commission and \n     the National Park Service to bring this project to \n     completion; and\n       Whereas, in an effort to expedite the establishment of this \n     memorial and to ensure adequate funding for its repair and \n     maintenance in perpetuity, Congress has before it H.R. 1247, \n     the World War II Memorial Completion Act. This bill addresses \n     a variety of issues, especially refining powers and purposes \n     of the fund created to handle the collection and disbursement \n     of money, including the authority to borrow, as well as the \n     protection of intellectual property and licensing rights \n     related to the memorial; and\n       Whereas, The World War II Memorial, which is to be located \n     in the National Mall in Washington, is an important \n     expression of the nation's debt to a remarkable generation. \n     The World War II Memorial Completion Act will play a vital \n     role in ensuring the success of this venture to perpetuate \n     for future generations the memory of valor and sacrifices \n     that must never be forgotten, now, therefore, be it;\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to enact the World War II Memorial Completion Act. We \n     urge all parties involved to work cooperatively toward the \n     completion of this important piece of our country's history; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-226. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the ``World \n     War II Memorial Completion Act''; to the Committee on \n     Veteran's Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 101\n\n       Whereas, Public Law 103-32, signed in 1993, authorized the \n     establishment of a memorial to the valor of World War II \n     veterans. The men and women who fought and who died during \n     the century's darkest hours to secure the freedoms we enjoy \n     today command our lasting gratitude.

A bill to provide incentives for collaborative forest \nrestoration projects on National Forest System and other public lands \nin New Mexico, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n                    COMMUNITY FOREST RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President I rise today to introduce the Community \nForest Restoration Act of 1999. This legislation provides incentives \nfor collaborative forest restoration projects on National Forest System \nand other public lands in New Mexico.\n  The densely stocked stands of small diameter trees in New Mexico \npresent an increasing danger of catastrophic wildfire that endangers \npeoples' lives and livelihoods. These conditions dramatically reduce \nplant and animal biological diversity, decrease watershed productivity, \nand provide fewer benefits to people. Healthy, productive watersheds \nminimize the threat of catastrophic wildfire, provide diverse wildlife \nhabitat, and produce a variety of timber and non-timber products \nincluding better quality water and increased water flows.\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\n  My goal is to promote healthy watersheds and reduce the threat of \ncatastrophic wildfire, insect infestation, and disease in the forests \nin New Mexico. To do this we must restore and maintain the forest \necosystem by reducing the unnaturally high number of small diameter \ntrees on Federal, State, and tribal forest lands, and improve the \nutilization of small diameter material.\n  This legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to create a \nprogram that provides forest restoration demonstration project grants \nto community organizations. The intent of the program is to encourage \ninnovation and collaboration on forest restoration projects among \nstakeholders at the local level, and provide for multi-party assessment \nof those projects.\n  Forest restoration activities that empower local organizations to \nimplement activities which value local and traditional knowledge can \nhelp build ownership and civic pride, and can lead to healthy, diverse, \nproductive forest ecosystems. This approach will encourage the \ndevelopment of industries which are based on the creation and \nmaintenance of healthy forest ecosystems. This bill will encourage \nsustainable community development through collaborative partnerships \nthat improve communication and joint problem solving. The objective of \nthese partnerships is to restore the forests of New Mexico by reducing \nthe density of stands that contain an unnaturally high number of small \ndiameter trees and improving the use of those trees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the text of the bill \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord. as follows:\n\n                                S. 1288\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Forest Restoration \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) forest lands in New Mexico that are densely stocked \n     with small diameter, even-aged trees can erupt in \n     catastrophic wildfire that can endanger human lives and \n     livelihoods;\n       (2) forest lands that are densely stocked with small \n     diameter trees can reduce biodiversity and provide fewer \n     benefits to human communities, wildlife, and watersheds;\n       (3) healthy and productive watersheds minimize the threat \n     of catastrophic wildfire, provide abundant and diverse \n     wildlife habitat, and produce a variety of timber and non-\n     timber products including better quality water and increased \n     water flows;\n       (4) restoration efforts are more successful when there is \n     involvement from neighboring communities and better \n     stewardship will evolve from more diverse involvement; and\n       (5) designing demonstration restoration projects through a \n     collaborative approach may--\n       (A) lead to the development of cost effective restoration \n     activities;\n       (B) empower diverse organizations to implement activities \n     which value local and traditional knowledge;\n       (C) build ownership and civic pride; and\n       (D) ensure healthy, diverse, and productive forests and \n     watersheds.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote healthy watersheds and reduce the threat of \n     catastrophic wildfire, insect infestation, and disease in the \n     forests in New Mexico;\n       (2) to improve the functioning of forest ecosystems and \n     enhance plant and wildlife biodiversity by reducing the \n     unnaturally high number and density of small diameter trees \n     on Federal, State, and tribal forest lands;\n       (3) to improve communication and joint problem solving \n     among individuals and groups who are interested in restoring \n     the diversity and productivity of forested watersheds in New \n     Mexico;\n       (4) to promote the use of small diameter trees; and\n       (5) to encourage sustainable community and sustainable \n     forests through collaborative partnerships, whose objectives \n     are forest restoration.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Agriculture acting through the Chief of the Forest Service; \n     and\n       (2) the term ``stakeholder'' includes: tribal governments, \n     educational institutions, landowners, and other interested \n     public and private entities.\n\n     SEC. 5.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat the capital gain treatment under section 631(b) of such Code shall \napply to outright sales of timber held for more than 1 year; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 timber tax simplification act of 1999\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will simplify and update a provision of the Tax Code that affects \nthe sale of timber. It is both a simplification measure and a fairness \nmeasure. We call it the Timber Tax Simplification Act of 1999.\n  Under the current law, landowners who are occasional sellers of \ntimber are often classified by the Internal Revenue Service as \n``dealers.'' As a result, the small landowner is forced to choose, \nbecause of the Tax Code, a method of selling timber that they\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\nmay not prefer. Fundamentally, there are two methods of selling timber. \nThe first method is known as ``lump sum'' sales, and it is the most \npopular, but it is subject to a higher tax rate. The second method, \npay-as-cut sales, allows for lower capital gains treatment but results \nin the landowner having to accept unnecessary risks throughout the \ntimber selling process.\n  Why, one might ask, do these conflicting incentives exist for our \nNation's timber growers? Earlier in the century, outright, or ``lump \nsum,'' sales on a cash advance basis were associated with a ``cut-and-\nrun'' mentality that did not promote good forest management. ``Pay-as-\ncut'' sales, in which a timber owner is only paid for timber as it is \nactually harvested and taken to the mill, were associated with \n``enlightened'' resource management. Consequently, Congress, in 1943, \nin an effort to provide an incentive for this preferred method, passed \nlegislation that allowed capital gains treatment under section 631(b) \nof the IRS Code for ``pay-as-cut'' plan sales, leaving the ``lump sum'' \nsales to pay a much higher rate of tax. It is said that President \nRoosevelt was not in favor of the bill and almost vetoed it. \nUltimately, however, he signed it into law.\n  Today, however, section 631(b), along with many other provisions of \nthe IRS Code, is completely outdated. Forest management practices are \nmuch different from what they were in 1943, and ``lump sum'' sales are \nno longer associated with poor forest management. Indeed, there is very \nlittle poor forest management today. People recognize the value of \ntimberland, and timber is almost never cut without being properly \nreplanted. While there are occasional special situations when other \nmethods may be more appropriate, most timber owners prefer the ``lump \nsum'' method, over the ``pay-as-cut'' method.\n  The reasons are simple. When a timber sale is entered into, the title \nto the timber is transferred on the closing of the sale. Once a \ncontract is assigned, the buyer, who is often a corporation, a sawmill, \nor a corporate timber company, assumes the risk of any physical loss to \nthe timber due to fire, insects, disease, or storms. Furthermore, the \nprice to be paid for the timber is determined and received by the \nlandowner at the time of the sale.\n  In addition, such a ``lump sum'' sale best protects the rights of the \nlandowner, by preventing delays not only in the actual cutting and \nharvesting of the timber, but in the receiving of payments.\n  Unfortunately, in order for timber owners to qualify for the \nfavorable capital gains treatment, they are virtually forced to market \ntheir timber on a ``pay-as-cut'' basis under section 631(b), which \nrequires landowners to sell their timber with a ``retained economic \ninterest.'' This means that the landowner, not the buyer, must bear the \nrisk of any physical loss during the time period contracted with the \nbuyer to harvest the timber. Furthermore, the buyer pays for only the \ntimber that is actually harvested. As a result, this type of sale can \nbe subject to fraud and abuse by the timber buyer.\n  Since the buyer pays only for the timber that is removed and scaled, \nthere is an incentive to waste poor quality timber--by breaking the \ntree during the logging process--underscale the timber, or remove the \ntimber without scaling.\n  Many different valuation methods can be utilized by sophisticated \nbuyers against a landowner; the landowner may not fully realize how the \ntimber is being priced, and even then he is paid only when the timber \nis delivered to the mill at a certain complicated rate.\n  But because 631(b) provides for the favorable tax treatment, many \nlandowners are forced into exposing themselves to unnecessary risk of \nloss and complications by having to market their timber in this manner \ninstead of the more preferred ``lump-sum'' method.\n  Like many of the provisions in the Tax Code, section 631(b) is \noutdated and prevents good forestry management. Timber farmers, that \nhave usually spent decades producing their crop, should be able to \nreceive equal tax treatment regardless of the method used for marketing \ntheir timber.\n  The IRS has no business--and, in effect, it does--stepping in and \ndictating the kind of sales contract a landowner must choose.\n  The legislation I have introduced will provide greater consistency by \nremoving the exclusive ``retained economic interest'' requirement in \nthe Internal Revenue Code section 631(b). This change has been \nsupported or suggested by a number of groups for tax simplification \npurposes, including positive comments from Internal Revenue Service \nofficials who have indicated they see no reason for this present law.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has studied this legislation to \nconsider what impact it might have on the Treasury and found that it \nwould have no real cost--only a ``negligible impact'' according to \ntheir analysis.\n  Reform of 631(b) is important to our Nation's nonindustrial, private \nlandowners because it will improve the economic viability of their \nforestry investments and protect the taxpayer from unnecessary exposure \nto risk of loss. This in turn will benefit the entire forest products \nindustry, the U.S. economy, and especially the small landowners.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Paul Coverdell, of \nGeorgia, who is a cosponsor of this legislation, in this effort to \nsimplify the Tax Code and to promote good forestry management.\n  There is simply no longer any need for this bizarre, complex tax \nregulation that is driving individual landowners to make choices they \nwould not otherwise make. Choices that cost them money and \nunnecessarily shift risk in a way that ought to be decided among the \nparties--the buyer and the seller--and not the Internal Revenue \nService.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Daschle, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1290. A bill to amend title 36 of the United States Code to \nestablish the American Indian Education Foundation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                  American Indian Education Foundation\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nestablish an American Indian Education Foundation. I am joined by \nSenators Domenici, Dorgan, Conrad, Bingaman, Johnson, Daschle and Akaka \nas sponsors of this measure, because we believe that this foundation \nwill help American Indian and Alaska native students immeasurably in \nthe years to come.\n  The foundation will be a charitable, non-profit corporation that \nwould be authorized to: (1) encourage, accept, and administer private \ngifts in support of the bureau of Indian Affairs' (BIA) Office of \nIndian Education; (2) conduct activities that will further educational \nopportunities of American Indians and Alaskan natives attending BIA \nschools; and (3) assist Federal, State, tribal, and individual entities \nthat will further the educational opportunities of American Indians and \nAlaskan natives attending BIA schools.\n  Similar foundations, such as the National Park Foundation and the \nNational Fish and Wildlife Foundation have been extremely successful \nover the past several years. This foundation is modeled after those \nfoundations.\n  Indian children are the most important resource in native America. \nAnd while the bureau's elementary and secondary education facilities \nand curricula have improved over the past few years, there is still \nmuch that can be done to make the learning environment a better place \nfor Indian students.\n  We want to motivate tribal students to look forward to school every \nday. We want them to be eager about learning. But realizing these \nobjectives is difficult when students are forced to learn in \ndilapidated buildings with outdated books and broken-down or no \ncomputer equipment. The foundation will be a start in helping to \naddress these problems.\n  There are many Americans who have asked how they can contribute to \nthe education of Indian students, but currently, there is no formal \nmechanism that would enable private resources to be dedicated to the \nsupport of the bureau schools. The foundation would serve as a means \nfor channeling private resources to provide that much-needed support.\n  Considerable thought has gone into the composition of the foundation. \nThe board will consist of eleven directors\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\nwho must be knowledgeable and experienced in American Indian education. \nThe Secretary of the Interior and the Assistant Secretary of Indian \nAffairs will both serve as ex officio non-voting members.\n  The foundation would be based in the District of Columbia and will \nmeet at least once annually. The foundation will submit an annual \nreport of its proceedings and activities to the Congress.\n  Mr. President, we feel that the foundation will provide greatly-\nneeded opportunities to American Indian and Alaskan native students, \nand would urge our colleagues to support this measure.\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nInouye in sponsoring this legislation to establish the American Indian \nEducation Foundation.\n  Similar foundations exist for national parks and national fish and \nwildlife purposes. Many Americans leave assets to benefit American \nIndians, but there is currently no national foundation to encourage \nthis type of giving for the benefit of Indian children in BIA schools.\n  The American Indian Education Foundation would primarily benefit \nelementary and secondary American Indian students with books, \ncomputers, school supplies, cultural preservation programs, literacy \nprograms, and many other worthwhile activities.\n  There is already a pool of about $400,000 held by the Office of \nIndian Education in the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). These personal \nassets have been donated over the years for Indian students, but there \nis no legal mechanism to transfer these funds to BIA schools. This \nlegislation would allow the BIA to direct these funds to BIA schools to \nmeet immediate education needs of today's Indian students.\n  I am proud to encourage this kind of targeted giving, and I am \noptimistic about its potential. America is a generous nation. As more \nAmericans become aware of the spectrum of needs at BIA schools on \nIndian reservations, I predict a huge success for this important \nfoundation.\n  I commend the Administration for developing this legislation, and I \nthank my friend Senator Inouye for taking the initiative to move it \nforward in the Senate.\n  I urge my colleagues to encourage private gifts to national Indian \neducation purposes by supporting this proposed foundation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN:\n  S. 1293. A bill to establish a Congressional Recognition for \nExcellence in Arts Education Board; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n\n     congressional recognition for excellence in arts education act\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nCongressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts Education Act. The act \nestablishes awards for schools that include the arts in their regular \ncurriculum.\n  When Congress passed the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, we \nfound ``that the arts are forms of understanding and ways of knowing \nthat are fundamentally important to education.'' Since then, many \nprofessional studies have been published about the relationship of arts \neducation to brain development, student achievement, career potential \nand other life quality issues.\n  The 1997 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) Arts \nReport Card was the first ever assessment of the effects of specific \narts instruction and the level of fine arts skills in American \nstudents. The assessment found that music and visual arts were more \nlikely to be taught than theater or dance, but the percentages of \nstudents actually in classes and their achievement varied widely. The \nreport card showed that instruction improved competency and literacy; \nand without it, very few students were able to create or perform at an \nadvanced or adequate level. This report card makes clear that attaining \nknowledge and skill in the arts is no different from becoming \nproficient in any school subject. While a few students are gifted, most \nhave to be taught in order to discover and use our abilities. And \ngifted students also need training and learning opportunities.\n  The evidence of the positive effects of arts education on overall \nscholastic achievement is an incentive for students, parents and \nschools to support serious sequential course work. In 1997, The College \nBoard reported that high school students with four or more years of \narts instruction scored over 100 points higher on the Scholastic \nAptitude Test than students with no arts instruction. And according to \nthe medical publication, Neurological Research, a California study \ndetermined that young children with six months of keyboard instruction \nperformed 34% higher on tests measuring temporal-spatial ability than \nother children.\n  Arts activity has been shown to lower the likelihood of delinquent \nbehavior. In 1996, the Department of Justice and the National Endowment \nfor the Arts began a project called YouthARTS, which developed model \nafter-school arts programs for teenagers. The evaluation of programs in \nFulton County, Georgia; Portland, Oregon; and San Antonio, Texas found \nthat YouthARTS participants significantly decreased their delinquent \nbehavior, increased their communication skills, and improved their \nability to complete tasks. The National Dropout Prevention Center \nreported that school arts classes and activities encourage attendance \nand achievement of at-risk high school students.\n  Programs teaching arts in schools differ widely from state to state, \nand from district to district within a state. The effectiveness of the \nprograms also varies. The Arts Education Partnership is a private, \nnonprofit coalition of education, arts, business, philanthropic, and \ngovernment organizations that demonstrates and promotes the essential \nrole of arts education in enabling all students to succeed in school, \nlife, and work. It was formed in 1995 through a cooperative agreement \nbetween the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States \nEducation Department, the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, and \nthe Council of Chief State School Officers.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year, the Arts Education Partnership, \nwith the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, released a \nreport titled, Gaining the Arts Advantage: Lessons From School \nDistricts that Value Arts Education. It is a national study of arts \neducation in schools. Thirteen ``critical success factors'' of \ndistrict-wide arts education programs were identified. The introduction \nto the report summarizes the findings this way, ``the presence and \nquality of arts education in public schools today require an \nexceptional degree of involvement by influential segments of \nthe community which value the arts in the total affairs of the school \ndistrict: in governance, funding, and program delivery.''\n\n  The report profiles 91 American school districts with successful arts \ncurriculum programs. I was very pleased to find the Hattiesburg and \nStarkville, Mississippi school districts featured in the report.\n  Outside funding and the success of classes in music, drama, dance and \nvisual arts has turned the arts into a priority in the Hattiesburg \nPublic School District budget. Hattiesburg superintendent Dr. Gordon \nWalker views arts as a school responsibility to ensure that, ``all \nstudents' lives are enriched and enhanced through academic achievement \nin the arts.''\n  Starkville's K-12 arts programs include: theater, visual arts, music \nlabs, television and graphic arts. Other features in their arts \neducation plan are a design program that brings university architecture \nstudents to an elementary school and an after school program funded by \na U.S. Department of Education grant. Joyce Polk, Starkville School \nDistrict arts coordinator explained that a comprehensive arts \neducation, ``. . . improves academic achievement and results in the \ndevelopment of well-rounded students who are able to leave rural \nMississippi and compete in prestigious college and university \nenvironments.'' She also attributes arts opportunities in the schools \nwith a higher quality of life for all community members, an \nunderstanding between diverse ethnic and cultural groups, a common bond \namong students, and long term healthy lifestyles. I am proud of these \nschool districts and the example they set for other American school \ndistricts.\n  An example of innovative efforts to support excellence and commitment \nin arts instruction is the Mississippi Arts Commission's Whole Schools \nInstitute,\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nwhich began this year. The institute at Millsaps College in Jackson, \nMississippi, is a week of professional development in teaching, \nplanning and implementing new curriculum. School teams of over 150 \nsuperintendents, principals, teachers, community and business leaders \nhad one-on-one training with nationally renowned arts educators, child \nand brain development researchers and arts professionals.\n  By recognizing the importance of arts instruction, I hope that we \nmake arts classes in schools as common as English or math. My bill \nestablishes the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in Arts \nEducation (CREATE) Awards and a board to direct the activities needed \nto promote it, to encourage arts curriculum, and to determine eligible \nschools.\n  Mr. President, vision and excellence can't be mandated, but through \nlegislation, such as the Congressional Recognition for Excellence in \nArts Education Act, we can reward it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1293\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, \n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Congressional Recognition \n     for Excellence in Arts Education Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Arts literacy is a fundamental purpose of schooling for \n     all students.\n       (2) Arts education stimulates, develops, and refines many \n     cognitive and creative skills, critical thinking and \n     nimbleness in judgment, creativity and imagination, \n     cooperative decisionmaking, leadership, high-level literacy \n     and communication, and the capacity for problem-posing and \n     problem-solving.\n       (3) Arts education contributes significantly to the \n     creation of flexible, adaptable, and knowledgeable workers \n     who will be needed in the 21st century economy.\n       (4) Arts education improves teaching and learning.\n       (5) Where parents and families, artists, arts \n     organizations, businesses, local civic and cultural leaders, \n     and institutions are actively engaged in instructional \n     programs, arts education is more successful.\n       (6) Effective teachers of the arts should be encouraged to \n     continue to learn and grow in mastery of their art form as \n     well as in their teaching competence.\n       (7) The 1999 study, entitled ``Gaining the Arts Advantage: \n     Lessons from School Districts that Value Arts Education'', \n     found that the literacy, education, programs, learning and \n     growth described in paragraphs (1) through (6) contribute to \n     successful districtwide arts education.\n       (8) Despite all of the literacy, education, programs, \n     learning and growth findings described in paragraphs (1) \n     through (6), the 1997 National Assessment of Educational \n     Progress reported that students lack sufficient opportunity \n     for participatory learning in the arts.\n       (9) The Arts Education Partnership, a coalition of national \n     and State education, arts, business, and civic groups has \n     demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing the purposes \n     described in section 5(a) and the capacity and credibility to \n     administer arts education programs of national significance.\n\n     SEC. 3.

For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired on \n     original issue at the issue price or by purchase of \n     outstanding obligations at the marketplace.\n       (2) Special rule.--The purposes for which obligations of \n     the United States may be issued under the Second Liberty Bond \n     Act are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of \n     special obligations exclusively to the fund.

A bill to designate portions of the lower Delaware River and \nassociated tributaries as a component of the National Wild and Scenic \nRivers System; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n               lower delaware wild and scenic rivers act\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation to designate the Lower Delaware River as a National Wild \nand Scenic River. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Torricelli and \nSantorum in sponsoring this legislation.\n  Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, designation as a Wild and \nScenic River is reserved for free flowing rivers with at least one \n``outstandingly remarkable'' resource value such as exceptional \nscenery, recreational opportunities, fisheries and wildlife, historic \nsite, or cultural resources. Mr. President, the Lower Delaware River \nhas several ``outstandingly remarkable'' resources of national \nsignificance and will make a fine addition to the National Wild and \nScenic River System.\n  Henry Hudson called the Delaware River ``one of the best, finest, and \npleasantest rivers of the world.'' The river begins in the Catskill \nMountains and flows south some 300 miles through forested mountains, \nfarmlands, historic towns, suburban and urban communities, industrial \ncomplexes and extensive wetlands as it nears the Atlantic Ocean. \nAlthough it is one of the largest rivers in the densely populated \nNortheast, the river retains much of its natural beauty. Woodlands \nstill cover many of the river's islands, the coast's steeply sloping \nhills and cliffs, and much of its floodplain along both sides of the \nriver. Threatened and endangered species, such as bald eagles and \nperegrine falcons, are found in forests within the river's watershed \nand rare fish species like striped bass, shortnose sturgeon and \nAtlantic sturgeon are found in its waters.\n  The Lower Delaware is the natural boundary between New Jersey and \nPennsylvania and this magnificent part of the river flows through \nrolling hills, broad valleys, and cliffs carved and shaped by the \nriver's floods. On these cliffs are a startling variety of plant life. \nCactus are found on the cliff shelves on the south-facing New Jersey \nside of the river, while shelves on the north-facing Pennsylvania side \nsupport arctic-alpine plants. The Nature Conservancy has identified \nover forty ``critical habitats'' along the river corridor.\n  The Lower Delaware is also rich in cultural history. The river \ncorridor contains 29 national historic districts and eight national \nhistoric landmarks. On Christmas Day in 1776, George Washington crossed \nthe Lower Delaware with his rag-tag Continental Army at present-day \nWashington Crossing State Park, New Jersey, on his way to a victory \nover the British and their Hessian mercenaries near Trenton, New \nJersey. Villages founded at 18th and 19th century crossroads are \nlocated on both sides of the Lower Delaware. Historic canals such as \nthe Delaware and Raritan Canal and the Delaware Canal still parallel \nportions of the river, and their surviving towpaths provide hiking and \nbicycling opportunities.\n  The Delaware Valley hosts a population of more than 5 million people \nand the river is within close proximity to major population centers. \nThis proximity provides recreational opportunities for thousands of \nindividuals who use the Lower Delaware for canoeing, kayaking, tubing, \nbirdwatching and fishing.\n  In 1978, both the Upper Delaware and the Middle Delaware River \nportions were designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers. Upon the \ndesignation of the Lower Delaware, the entire length of the Delaware \nRiver from Trenton north, with the exception of a few short sections, \nwould have national designation as a Wild and Scenic River, while the \nportion of the river from Trenton south is already included in the \nNational Estuary Program. Designation of the Lower Delaware would make \nthe Delaware River the only river system in the eastern United States \nto have this distinctive status.\n  Lastly, Mr. President, I just wanted to note that designation of a \nriver as Wild and Scenic does not mean that private lands will suddenly \nbe open to public access. Nor does it mean that existing uses of \nprivate property will be restricted. Designated rivers do receive \npermanent protection from federally licensed or assisted dams and other \nwater resource projects that would have direct and adverse effects on \nthe river's free-flowing condition or ``outstandingly remarkable'' \nresources. A major factor in determining suitability for designation as \na Wild and Scenic River is whether or not there is strong support for \ndesignation among the localities that border the river. In fact, the \nDepartment of the Interior will support designation of a river as Wild \nand Scenic only if the localities that adjoin the eligible river pass \nresolutions in support of designation of\n\n[[Page S7724]]\n\ntheir individual segments as Wild and Scenic.\n  Although designation has received overwhelming support from the great \nmajority of the localities along the river, a handful of localities in \nPennsylvania and New Jersey did not pass the necessary resolutions \nsupporting the designation of their river segments as Wild and Scenic. \nTherefore, although the river segments adjoining these townships are \neligible for designation in the future, the legislation that I propose \nwould not designate these river segments as Wild and Scenic River \nsegments under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.\n  Organizations that support designation of this part of the Lower \nDelaware River as Wild and Scenic include: The Heritage Conservancy, \nAmerican Rivers, the Delaware River Greenway Partnership, Central Bucks \nChamber of Commerce, Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, Tinicum \nConservancy, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural \nResources, Delaware River Mill Society and the Delaware and Raritan \nCanal Commission. Many individuals have worked hard to ensure that \ndesignation of this portion of the river becomes a reality including \nWilliam Sharp of the National Park Service, the members of the Lower \nDelaware River Wild and Scenic Management Committee and the Lower \nDelaware Advisory Committee including New Jersey residents Richard \nAlbert, Jim Amon, Maya Vanrossum, Thomas Dallessio, Linda Mead, \nChristian R. Nielson, Tisha Petrushka, Joseph M. Pylka, Chris Robert, \nWilliam Rockafellow, Jean Shaddow, Robert Stokes, Caroline Armstrong, \nRon Tindall, Celeste Tracy, Pamela Vinicombe, Lori Hixon, Kenneth G. \nZinis, Dan Longhi, Patricia McIlvaine, and John Brunner.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to \nrecognize the recreational, scenic and cultural resources of national \nsignificance that the Lower Delaware River has to offer both to the \ncitizens of New Jersey and the nation.\n  I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The bill follows:\n\n                                S. 1296\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower Delaware Wild and \n     Scenic Rivers Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) Public Law 102-460 directed the Secretary of the \n     Interior, in cooperation and consultation with appropriate \n     Federal, State, regional, and local agencies, to conduct a \n     study of the eligibility and suitability of the lower \n     Delaware River for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers \n     System;\n       (2) during the study, the Lower Delaware Wild and Scenic \n     River Study Task Force and the National Park Service prepared \n     a river management plan for the study area entitled ``Lower \n     Delaware River Management Plan'' and dated August 1997, which \n     establishes goals and actions that will ensure long-term \n     protection of the river's outstanding values and compatible \n     management of land and water resources associated with the \n     river; and\n       (3) after completion of the study, 24 municipalities along \n     segments of the Delaware River eligible for designation \n     passed resolutions supporting the Lower Delaware River \n     Management Plan, agreeing to take action to implement the \n     goals of the plan, and endorsing designation of the river.\n\n     SEC. 3. DESIGNATION.\n\n       Section 3(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1274(a)) is amended--\n       (1) by designating the first undesignated paragraph \n     following paragraph

If the plan or issuer, or if \n     the primary care provider in consultation with the medical \n     director of the plan or issuer and the specialist (if any), \n     determines that such a standing referral is appropriate, the \n     plan or issuer shall make such a referral to such a \n     specialist.\n       (B) Terms of referral.--The provisions of subparagraphs (C) \n     through (E) of paragraph (1) apply with respect to referrals \n     under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph in the same manner \n     as they apply to referrals under paragraph (1)(A).\n\n     SEC. __105.

terminated because of a change in the terms of provider \n     participation in a group health plan, and an individual who \n     is a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee in the plan or \n     coverage is undergoing a course of treatment from the \n     provider at the time of such termination, the plan or issuer \n     shall--\n       (A) notify the individual on a timely basis of such \n

period under this subsection with respect to \n     provider's treatment of the pregnancy shall extend through \n     the provision of post-partum care directly related to the \n     delivery.\n       (4) Terminal illness.--If--\n       (A) a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee was determined \n     to be terminally ill (as determined under section \n     1861(dd)(3)(A) of the Social Security

plan or issuer after the date of the \n     termination of the contract with the health insurance issuer) \n     and not to impose cost-sharing with respect to the individual \n     in an amount that

SMITH\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues a significant achievement in the field of environmental \nscience.\n  Lockheed Martin Corporation annually recognizes 50 of its 170,000 \nemployees with NOVA awards for technical excellence. Mr. Robert W. \nSmith of Lockheed Martin Idaho Technologies Company, the operating \ncontractor of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental \nLaboratory, INEEL, was cited for his valuable work in utilizing \nmicrobial communities in the subsurface to contribute to the \nremediation of contaminants resulting from nuclear energy and weapons \nresearch.\n  Mr. Smith heads teams comprised of scientists from the Pacific \nNorthwest National Laboratory, Princeton University, and Portland State \nUniversity. They represent the best in field scale research of \nbiogeochemistry processes. The natural processes that Mr. Smith and his \nteams uncover will be incorporated into future efforts to clean up the \nlegacy of waste from the nuclear energy complex and contamination \nproblems on other agency lands. Mr. Smith expects that instead of \nmassive engineering solutions to remove the waste, natural processes \nthat cause less environmental disturbance will be more commonly \nutilized.\n  I congratulate Mr. Smith on receiving this award. The achievement \nalso recognizes that his success could not have been made without the \ndedication of his team members. There are an array of environmental \nstewardship and natural resource problems ranging from mining \nreclamation to global climate impacts that could be solved through \ncollaborative research.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the City \nof Tecumseh, Michigan, as it celebrates its 175th birthday.\n  Located in Lenawee County, Tecumseh was one of the first three \nsettlements established in 1824 in what was then the Michigan \nTerritory. The settlement's founders, Musgrove Evans, Joseph Brown and \nAustin Wing, chose its location because of its fertile soil, good \nsupply of timber and its proximity to the Raisin River. They named \ntheir new home after the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh, who is said to have \nheld war councils on the site.\n  A growing agricultural community, Tecumseh's first rail line was \nbuilt in 1838, and train service continued until the late 1970s. \nTecumseh was not only a stop on the actual railroad, but was also a \nstop on the Underground Railroad. Many people in Tecumseh displayed \ntheir strong anti-slavery sentiment, and their Quaker beliefs, by \nproviding shelter to slaves escaping from the South.\n  Through the years, the landscape around Tecumseh has changed, as have \nthe ways in which its people make their living. While it was primarily \na small agricultural town, today the economy of Tecumseh mostly \nrevolves around industry. In fact, its largest employer, Tecumseh \nProducts, was founded in 1934 and grew to become a Fortune 500 company.\n  Mr. President, Tecumseh is notable for its significance in Michigan's \nhistory, but its most dependable asset over the last 175 years has been \nits people. It is fitting that we recognize Tecumseh's residents as \nthey celebrate the past while looking to build an even better future. I \nknow my colleagues will join me in offering the people of Tecumseh \ncongratulations and best wishes on this important occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7752-4", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7752-S7753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO AURELIE V. BURNHAM\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncongratulate Aurelie V. Burnham on her 91st birthday.\n  Aurelie was born on July 5, 1908 in East Weare, New Hampshire to Fred \nand May Bellefeuille. Aurelie's mother, May, died in 1915 leaving \nAurelie to care for her older brother, four younger brothers and her \nfather Fred. In 1920, the Bellefeuille farm burned down, thus forcing \nFred to move his family to the mill town of Manchester, New Hampshire. \nFred later remarried a widow with four daughters and one son; together, \nthey had a son--bringing the total number of children in the \nBellefeuille family to eleven.\n  At the age of sixteen, Aurelie began working at the Amoskeag Mills. \nOn December 9, 1938, she married Arthur H. Burnham. Arthur, a native of \nPeterborough, New Hampshire lived in the Nashua-Hudson area. After \ntheir marriage, they resided in Manchester where they raised their \nthree children: Dorothy, Joanne and Arthur, Jr. Dorothy, a senior \ncaseworker in my Manchester office, has been a valued member of my \nstaff for the past fifteen years. Joanne is employed with the Internal \nRevenue Service and Arthur, Jr. is a computer programmer for the \nAssociates National Bank in Dallas, Texas. Aurelie and Arthur have six \ngrandchildren. Mr. Burnham passed away in September 1979.\n  Aurelie is known for her kindness and caring. She was a stay-at-home \nmother who was always there for her children and their friends. Aurlie \nhas been a volunteer on several federal campaigns. Though her physical \nhealth is not what she would prefer, she is still an avid reader, \ncrossword puzzle expert, and manages to go shopping at\n\n[[Page S7753]]\n\nthe malls whenever possible. During the summer months, she enjoys a \ntrip to the seacoast where she says she can breathe in the ocean air \nand feel more comfortable.\n  Once again, I would like to congratulate Aurelie on reaching her 91st \nbirthday. It is an honor to represent her in the United States \nSenate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7753-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A TRIBUTE TO THE LATE JUDGE PHILIP E. LAGANA\n\n Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJudge Philip E. Lagana, a retired Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nState of New York who recently passed away. Judge Lagana leaves behind \na legacy of fairness and compassion as a Justice. He was not afraid to \nmake difficult decisions, explore new concepts, or develop new \ntheories, and he serves as an example to all in terms of not only how \nto be an exemplary justice but also how to be an exemplary human being.\n  Judge Lagana was born in Brooklyn, New York, and spent his lifetime \nserving his community. He attended Georgetown University, and then \nBrooklyn Law School, after which he began a private practice in the \nfield of criminal law. Soon after, he began a long and distinguished \ncareer of public service, beginning in the Kings County District \nAttorney's Office, where he was appointed an Assistant District \nAttorney. He was rapidly promoted to the position of Deputy Chief of \nthe Supreme Court Trial Assistants, where he set up a Bureau of Major \nOffenses. Upon completion of this task, Judge Lagana was appointed \nChief of this bureau. In 1974, then-mayor Abe Beame made Judge Lagana \nthe President of the New York City Tax Commission. In 1975, he was \nelected to the Supreme Court of the State of New York. His election \nserved as recognition by the public of his many years of public \nservice.\n  As a Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Judge \nLagana acted with firmness, fairness, and compassion. His actions found \nsupport from the appellate bench which reviewed them, from the lawyers \nwho argued before him, from his fellow justices, and from the public. \nHe was reelected for an additional 14-year term.\n  In 1992, Judge Lagana retired from the bench, leaving behind a proud \nlegacy as a distinguished public servant, and taking with him many \naccolades and honors, among them from the Catholic Lawyers Guild, the \nColumbian Lawyers Association, the Kings County Criminal Bar \nAssociation, the Brooklyn Bar Association, the New York State Real \nEstate Board, the United Jewish Appeal, Marlboro Memorial Post No. \n1437, the American Legion and its Women's Club, and the 46 A.D. \nDemocratic Club.\n  Judge Lagana will be remembered as a dedicated public servant and as \na decent person who had a loving commitment and dedication to his \nfamily, country, and society. Judge Lagana will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7753-2", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7753-S7754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE SOCIAL SECURITY LOCKBOX\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today is a great day for American \ntaxpayers and especially for senior citizens. I come to the floor to \nwelcome the President's endorsement of the lockbox plan to protect the \nSocial Security surplus. I am gratified to hear that he now agrees with \nour congressional effort to protect every dollar of the current Social \nSecurity surplus for future obligations that the Social Security trust \nfund has to America's retirees.\n  I believe the President's statement today can lead to a bipartisan \nagreement to protect Social Security. It is a fact that the President's \nstatement today reverses his earlier policy to use $158 billion out of \nthe Social Security trust fund surpluses over the next 5 years to \nfinance increased spending. So this is welcome news. It is good news. \nIt provides us with the basis for an agreement and the achievement of a \npublic good--to help American citizens, particularly older Americans, \nin their concerns about their retirement.\n  When the President first submitted his budget proposal that included \nspending, instead of saving, a portion of the Social Security surplus, \ncongressional Republicans, in the House and in the Senate, began \nworking to ensure that every dollar--not just some of the money but \nevery dollar--of the forthcoming Social Security surplus was reserved \nfor one thing--for Social Security.\n  In March, Senator Domenici and I introduced S. 502, the Protect \nSocial Security Benefits Act, which would have instituted a point of \norder preventing Congress from spending any Social Security dollars for \nnon-Social Security purposes.\n  In April, under the strong direction of Senator Domenici, the Senate \npassed a budget resolution that did not spend any of the Social \nSecurity surpluses for the next decade, and included in the resolution \nwas language endorsing the idea of locking away the Social Security \nsurpluses. This language passed with the unanimous approval of the \nSenate.\n  Also in April, Senators Abraham and Domenici and I introduced the \nSocial Security lockbox amendment which would have added executive \nresponsibilities to the congressional requirement to protect Social \nSecurity surpluses. That executive responsibility would have demanded \nthat the President submit budgets that did not invade the Social \nSecurity surplus as a means of covering deficits in the rest of \nGovernment. The Senate has voted on the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft plan \nthree times, and the measure has yet to win a single Democratic vote.\n  On May 26, the House overwhelmingly passed H.R. 1259. That was \nCongressman Herger's measure to protect the surpluses of Social \nSecurity. It did so in a bipartisan vote in the House, a vote of 416 to \n12. On June 10, the Democrats in the Senate blocked the Herger measure \nas well, just as they had blocked the measures which had been proposed \nin this body. But the House, in a bipartisan way, voted 416 to 12.\n  These repeated votes on a Social Security lockbox demonstrate \ncongressional Republicans' dedication to protecting every dollar of the \nprojected Social Security surpluses and using them to shore up the \nSocial Security system. It is essential to protect Social Security so \nwe can ensure the long-term viability of America's most vital social \nprogram. We must restore the public's confidence that money paid into \nSocial Security will be paid out only for Social Security benefits. The \nlockbox would accomplish this important goal.\n  Over the next 5 years, Social Security taxes will bring in an \nestimated $776 billion in surpluses. Those who say they want to protect \nSocial Security should join us in our efforts to create this lockbox so \nthat every dime, every cent, of this money for Social Security, paid in \nfor Social Security, will be reserved for Social Security's future \nbeneficiaries. The lockbox is the way to make this happen.\n\n  The Congress is and has been moving to create a Social Security \nlockbox for this entire year. The President's staff said yesterday that \nthe President will unveil his own Social Security lockbox proposal. If \nthe President does, indeed, have a plan he wishes to offer, I urge him \nto bring it to Congress immediately so we can examine it and perhaps \neven vote on it before the Independence Day district work period for \nthe Congress. If he does not have his own plan, I urge the President to \nsupport the existing congressional lockbox proposals, one of which has \nalready passed the House with substantial momentum; 416 to 12 is not a \nvote to be disregarded. In spite of that, it has been disregarded by \nthose on the other side of the aisle in the Senate.\n  In addition, I ask that the President reach out to his Democratic \ncolleagues, now that he has joined the idea of building a lockbox, and \na strong one, to protect Social Security and urge the Democrat Members \nof the Senate to support efforts to protect Social Security. This is \nthe best way to ensure Social Security's financial integrity for this \nand future generations.\n  Again, I say that the American people are the winners when the \nPresident of the United States announces that he will support the \nefforts in Congress to protect all of the Social Security surplus, \nbasically changing his position from spending $158 billion over the \nnext 5 years to saying that he wants to stop the raid and no longer \ncover shortfalls in Federal spending programs by using Social Security \nsurpluses.\n  The President's Rose Garden announcement is welcome news. It is a \nrosy scenario, if it can be carried out.\n\n[[Page S7754]]\n\n I urge President Clinton to join us in demonstrating his commitment to \nSocial Security protection by backing the congressional Social Security \nlockbox, which we have been working so carefully to bring into place, \nas a means of protecting Social Security taxes that people across \nAmerica work day after day after day to pay. They should be entitled to \nlook forward to the day when those taxes will come back to them in \nterms of Social Security retirement benefits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/06/28/senate-section/article/S7754-1", "month": "06", "year": "1999", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7754]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ORDER FOR STAR PRINT--S. 606\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.
