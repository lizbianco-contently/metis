Mr. President, those who have followed the proceedings of \nthe Senate over the last 2 weeks understand we have been debating \nchanges in the Tax Code. The two changes we have focused on are changes \nin the estate tax and changes in what is known as the marriage penalty. \nThese are two very interesting proposals that have been before the \nSenate but they really tell the story about the priorities of the \nSenate when it comes to dealing with the economy and helping families \nacross America.\n  The estate tax, which we have considered and passed in a version last \nweek to ultimately repeal it, is a tax which affects a very small \npercentage of Americans. In fact, fewer than 2 percent of American \nfamilies will pay the estate tax. Those who end up paying it are the \nwealthiest people in America.\n  It is curious to me that when we established our list of priorities \nin this Congress as to tax relief, the first people in line were the \nwealthiest people in America. That is not to say we should not consider \ntax relief that involves them, but I think everyone understands that \naverage families, smaller businesses, and family farms have priorities, \ntoo, when it comes to tax relief.\n  Take a look at what the Republican proposals under the estate tax, as \nwell as the so-called marriage penalty tax, would do in terms of the \npeople in America and their income groups.\n  For the 20 percent of American families lowest in income, the \nRepublican proposals, two of them--the estate tax as well as the \nmarriage penalty--result in tax breaks of $24 a year. Then, as you \nstart moving up in income, you see that not until you get up to the \nlevel of the next 15 percent here, of the top wage earners in America, \ndo you find people even seeing a tax break of about $900 a year--about \n$75 or $80 a month.\n  Now look at what happens when you go to the top 1 percent of wage \nearners in America, the wealthiest people in America: $23,000 in tax \nbreaks coming from this Republican-led Senate under these two bills, \nestate tax reform and marriage penalty.\n  So if you happen to be in a working family, down here, you are not \ngoing to notice what has been going on in the Senate because, frankly, \nthe tax relief they are sending your way hardly pays for a magazine. \nBut look what happens at the highest income levels: $24 for the lowest \nwage earners, the people struggling to survive in America; $23,000 for \nthe wealthiest people in this country. Time and time and time again, \nthe Republican leadership, given a chance to deal with tax equity in \nAmerica, decides the best thing that can be done is to give to the \nwealthiest Americans more tax breaks.\n  This tells the story as well. I will not go through it in all detail, \nbut the top 1 percent of wage earners in this country, people making \nover $300,000 a year--those folks are going to see a tax break of \n$23,000; 43 percent of all the tax relief coming in these two \nRepublican bills goes to people making over $300,000 a year.\n  There are people who will say perhaps they need it. I am not one of \nthem. Frankly, I can tell you who needs it, as far as I am concerned. A \nworking family trying to figure out how they are going to pay for their \nkid's college education expenses, those are the folks who need a tax \nbreak. When we put on the floor a measure sponsored by my seatmate \nhere, Senator Charles Schumer of New York, to allow people to deduct \n$12,000 a year in college education expenses instead of giving tax \nbreaks to the wealthy, it was rejected by the Republican majority. A \n$12,000 deduction for college education expenses was rejected while we \ngive a $23,000-a-year tax break to the wealthiest among us.\n  Then Senator Dodd of Connecticut, who has been a leader in child \ncare, stood up and said we have a lot of people going to work in \nAmerica every day worried about the safety and quality of child care; \nlet's give them a tax break so they can pay for good, professional, \nsafe child care and have peace of mind while at work that their kids \nare in good hands. It was rejected by the Republican majority. The idea \nof helping working families take care of their kids was rejected.\n  Then Senator Kennedy and others offered a prescription drug benefit \nfor seniors and the disabled under Medicare, struggling to pay for \ntheir drug bills. We said we think that is a higher priority than a \n$23,000 tax break for the wealthiest people in America. The Republican \nmajority said no, it is not a higher priority; it is a much higher \npriority to keep in the front of the line at all times the wealthiest \npeople in America. That is what this debate is all about.\n  The question is, Whom do we stand for? Do we stand for working \nfamilies in this country or do we stand for the financially articulate \nwho, frankly, lord over this political process with their \nrepresentatives who come in expensive suits, well dressed, standing in \nthe corridors here saying we have to help the wealthy of America.\n\n  For good Heaven's sake, for the last 8 years this economy has been on \nsuch a roll, the wealthiest in America have done very, very well. I \ndon't begrudge them that. But when we talk about helping people in this \ncountry, why don't we remember the folks who get up and go to work \nevery single day, who worry about their kids' education expenses, who \nare concerned about day care where they can leave their kids safely, \nwho want to make certain their parents can afford the prescription \ndrugs they need to stay healthy?\n  That is not a priority among the Republican leadership here. They \ndon't want to talk about it. They want to go to their convention in \nPhiladelphia in 2 weeks and talk about how they have worked so hard for \ntax cuts and President Clinton and the Democrats have stopped them. \nDon't forget to ask them the question, Who are the winners under your \ntax cuts? The winners are those who turn out always to win when the \nRepublicans are in control. The wealthiest win again and again in \nAmerica.\n  I see Senator Harkin. Senator Harkin came in with his own proposal, \ntrying to help those concerned about tax equity. I am happy to yield to \nhim at this point.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend for his very eloquent \nand decisive statement. I think my friend has really put his finger on \nit.\n  I would add one other thing to what we attempted to do here with the \nfuture surpluses the Senator was mentioning, the various things we \nwanted to do to try to help average working people. I had offered an \namendment a couple of weeks ago to fully fund the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act so we could help the States help families \nwith children with disabilities to send them to school to get them the \nbest possible education. We were stymied by the Republicans. Most of \nthem voted against it.\n  Yet they find it within themselves to give, as the Senator pointed \nout, to the top 1 percent of this country 43 percent of the tax breaks. \nThe surplus we have coming in the next 10 years is being used up by \nthese tax breaks. I might ask the Senator if that is not so. It is my \ninformation, just this year, up until right now, this Senate, under \nRepublican leadership, has passed something over $1.3 trillion in tax \ncuts. Am I in the ballpark, I ask the Senator?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Iowa is correct. As these charts \nindicate, those tax breaks are going to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica. I think the Senator from Iowa, from my neighboring State, \nbelieves as I do: Hard-working people in this country are not looking \nfor a handout; they are looking for an opportunity. Give them a chance \nto pay for their kids' college education; give them a chance to pay for \nprescription drugs; give them a chance to pay for day care. And the \nRepublicans say consistently: That is not a priority. That is not \nimportant.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I see my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts. The \nother day, Senator Kennedy was pointing out that the Republicans have \npassed $1.3 trillion in tax cuts. Yet we have not purchased one book; \nwe have not reduced the size of one class, we have not hired one new \nteacher, modernized one school, brought one prescription drug for the \nelderly. Yet they spend $1.3 trillion of the surplus that is there \nbecause of hard-working Americans the Senator from Illinois is talking \nabout.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say in response to the Senator from Iowa, to \nthink we live in a nation where 30 percent of our population cannot \nread any higher than a fifth-grade level, this is a waste of resources \nin our country. We will\n\n[[Page S7085]]\n\nneed to be a productive society in the 21st century. The fact is that \nthis Republican-controlled Congress does not even view education as a \nhigh enough priority; they would rather put our time and our effort \ninto tax breaks for people who are doing very well under our economy.\n  I will be happy to yield again to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator knows that next week we \ncelebrate the 10th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nA recent court decision upheld the ADA, trying to get people with \ndisabilities the right to live independently in their own communities. \nThat is going to require us to make some changes in this country. It is \ngoing to require us to invest in making sure people with disabilities \nhave the kind of support they need so they can get education and jobs \nand independent living and transportation. If we do that, they are \ngoing to be wage earners and taxpayers and not living in institutions.\n  I say to the Senator from Illinois, as we celebrate the ADA next \nweek, we ought to think about that, where all the money is now going, \nbecause the Republicans are giving it all to the top 1 percent and \nthere will not be anything left to help make our country more fair and \njust, and to make sure we live up to our obligation to people with \ndisabilities so they are fully integrated into our society.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just before the Senator leaves that thought about the \nneed for support for special education, this is something the Senator \nfrom Iowa has been particularly interested in and in which he is \nstrongly supported by the Senator from Illinois and myself.\n  We have heard a lot of lectures out here about the importance of \nhelping local communities who have these extraordinary challenges of \nfamilies who have children with these special needs, and it places a \nvery special burden on local communities. I think the Senators from \nIowa and Illinois and others understand the importance of giving help \nand relief to these communities all across this country. We hear about \nthe need out there.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator shares my belief that after giving \n$1.3 trillion away, whether we should not have used some of those \nresources to try to help local communities and help families who have \nthese kinds of special needs for their children?\n  We are going to be hard pressed to find the resources to do that. \nPerhaps the Senator would also tell me why it is now that we have gone \nall of this last year, all of this year, and we still can't get a \nminimum wage up to look out for the interests of 13 million Americans \nwho are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, who take pride and \nhave a sense of dignity, that we can't have an opportunity to address \nit, when in the last 5 days we have given $1.3 trillion away to the \nwealthiest individuals.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, if you take a \nlook at this chart, this is what the Republicans want to do for those \nwho are working for the minimum wage, for less than $13,000 a year. \nThey want to give them a tax cut of $24. Two dollars a month is their \nresponse. We are trying to give them a dollar an hour increase under \nSenator Kennedy's leadership in the minimum wage. Yet those at the \nhighest level, those making over $300,000 a year, under the Republican \nproposal, will see a tax break of $23,000 a year. That is almost double \nwhat people making minimum wage are receiving in income. We are going \nto give that much in a tax break to those making over $300,000.\n  So instead of raising the minimum wage for the millions that the \nSenator refers to--and the 350,000 people who get up and go to work \nevery day in Illinois at minimum-wage jobs--we are, instead, giving a \ntax break to the wealthiest among us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator respond to another question?\n  Is it the Senator's position--and we have been joined by the Senators \nfrom California and New York--that there is a greater priority to \nprovide a prescription drug program for the 40 million Americans who \nneed prescription drugs than there is to grant the $1.3 trillion to the \nwealthiest individuals, that the Senator from Illinois shares the \nbelief that we ought to be addressing that particular issue prior to \nthe time that we give away all of these funds to some of the wealthiest \nindividuals?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree completely.\n  When Senator Feingold offered his amendment that said anyone with an \nestate over $100 million a year will have to pay estate taxes, it was \nrejected by the Republicans. To think people that wealthy should not \npay their taxes, while many seniors have to choose between filling \ntheir prescription drug prescriptions or filling their refrigerators \nwith food, I think tells the difference between the two parties when it \ncomes to helping America.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I do not know if the Senator has mentioned this, but it \nseems to me this Republican Congress wants to take care of the top 2 \npercent of income earners in this country; and as far as the other 98 \npercent, they don't seem to care.\n  Why do I say that? Because you have to look at the action. I ask the \nSenator to again hold up that chart. What is happening here? If you \nasked the average person in the higher income brackets, who is doing so \nwell in this particular time--thanks to the policies, I would say, of \nthe Clinton-Gore team, supported by those of us in Congress--they don't \nneed to get back $23,000 a year. They are doing extremely well.\n  Does my friend think it is time to take a little of this emotion--I \nwatched the debate when Senator Feingold offered his amendment to \nexempt estates of any taxes up to $100 million. I thought at least on \nthat point our friends on the other side could join hands with us. But \nno, the emotion on the other side of the aisle, defending the people, \nthe ``poor'' people who are worth more than $100 million, was so \npowerful that I only wished we could take a tenth of that emotion and \naddress it to the minimum wage and prescription drugs and good public \neducation.\n  I wonder if my friend noted the strong emotion and feeling on the \nother side of the aisle when it came to defending and protecting the \nwealthiest in this country, rather than the 98 percent of the people \nwho need it. Did he take note of that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from California, time and again, the \nRepublican Senators here have felt the ``pain'' of being wealthy in \nAmerica. They can feel the ``pain'' of those who make over $1 million \neach year, over $300,000. They don't seem to feel any pain or any sense \nof emotion when it comes to the working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7085-S7103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                             2001--Resumed\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3798\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the order of business? It is 9:45.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes evenly divided for \nexplanation on the Reed amendment No. 3798.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, Senator Reed and I have come to an \naccommodation, and we have a modification to his amendment.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and nays on the Reed \namendment be vitiated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3798, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send a modification to the Reed \namendment to the desk, and ask unanimous consent that it be immediately \nconsidered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for weatherization assistance grants, \n                            with an offset)\n\n       On page 182, beginning on line 9, strike ``$761,937,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``$138,000,000'' on line 17 and \n     insert ``$763,937,000, to remain available until expended, of \n     which $2,000,000 shall be derived by\n\n[[Page S7086]]\n\n     transfer from unobligated balances in the Biomass Energy \n     Development account and $2,000,000 shall be derived by \n     transfer of a proportionate amount from each other account \n     for which this Act makes funds available for travel, \n     supplies, and printing expenses: Provided, That $174,000,000 \n     shall be for use in energy conservation programs as defined \n     in section 3008(3) of Public Law 99-509 (15 U.S.C. 4507): \n     Provided further, That notwithstanding section 3003(d)(2) of \n     Public Law 99-509, such sums shall be allocated to the \n     eligible programs as follows: $140,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this modification does make an increase in \nthe appropriation to the amount in the House bill.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Mr. Reed toward a cause in which \nhe believes and in a way which is fiscally responsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his gracious \ncooperation. This would increase the money we are committing to the \nweatherization program so that we could, in fact, provide more \nassistance to low-income homes to weatherize their homes, both to \nprotect themselves in the cold of winter and the heat of summer. It \nwould also make, we hope, the Nation less dependent on foreign sources \nof energy. It is an excellent proposal and program.\n  I thank the Senator for his cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time and ask for a voice vote on the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3798, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3798), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 3910 and 3911, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two \namendments that were inadvertently omitted from the managers' package \nlast night be adopted at this time.\n  I send them to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Grassley, \n     for himself and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3910.\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3911.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendments be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments, en bloc, are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3910\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a land \n  exchange with Dubuque Barge & Fleeting Services, Inc., of Dubuque, \n                                 Iowa)\n\n       On page 163, after line 23, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1__.

Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3910 and 3911), en bloc, were agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3883\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nof debate on the Bryan amendment.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this amendment would reduce the amount of \nmoney in a program that loses the American taxpayers a great deal of \nmoney--some $2 billion over the period of 1992 to 1997--and transfers \n$15 million into a program to help prevent forest fires in those areas \nwhich interface with the urban base. So we have State and local \ngovernments and the Forest Service all needing more money for planting.\n  This is totally different from the amendment the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico offered which deals with reducing fuels that \ncause fires--a totally separate issue. This one is a winner for the \nAmerican taxpayer, and it is a winner for the other people who live in \nthose areas that can be affected by forest fires.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition \nto the Bryan amendment which proposes to cut funding for the Forest \nService's timber sale program. Unfortunately, this amendment continues \nto assault on the statutory principle of multiple use of public lands.\n  While I don't take issue with the Senator from Nevada on the question \nof increasing funds for fire preparedness under the U.S. Forest \nService, I must vehemently disagree with the proposal that the federal \ntimber program should be slashed by thirty million dollars. As we all \nknow, we are dealing with finite resources under the Interior \nappropriations bill, and I believe the managers of the bill have \nachieved a proper balance under these circumstances. In addition, I \nmust remind my colleagues that just last week we all voted to \ndramatically increase funds for hazardous fuels reduction with the \nadoption of the Domenici amendment.\n  Year after year, opponents of logging on public lands allege that the \nForest Service timber program is a subsidy for timber companies. The \nfact is, however, public timber is sold at competitive auctions at \nmarket prices. This is no subsidy for timber companies. Year after \nyear, opponents of logging on public lands also claim that the Forest \nService timber program is a money loser. Of course, their figures never \nseem to take into account the bureaucratic and statutory requirements \ncreated by a myriad of federal land regulations or recent accounting \nchanges that front-load certain expenses, making more sales appear \nbelow cost. Unlike many private lands, National Forest System lands are \nmanaged for multiple uses--recreation, wildlife habitat, and forest \nproducts. If anything, the fiscal arguments used by proponents of this \namendment only prove that, indeed, federal regulatory mandates are \nquite expensive.\n  Ironically, this amendment is actually counterproductive for the \nenvironment as well. We have well over sixty-five million acres of the \nNational Forest System at risk of catastrophic wildlife, disease, and \ninsect infestation. The high fuel loads created by a century of fire \nsuppression, and eight years of passive forest management have set up \nour national forests for catastrophic wildlifes that threaten homes, \nwildlife, and watersheds. Mechanical removal through timber sales can \nbe an efficient and economical tool to reduce these wildfire risks, and \nit should be available to the professional foresters of the Forest \nService.\n  Despite its strong backing from environmental groups, the Bryan \namendment will do nothing for global environmental stewardship as long \nas we, in the United States, continue to consume more wood products. \nDuring the assault on public lands industries under this \nadministration, the amount of timber sold from our federal forests has \ndropped by nearly eighty percent. Predictably, our lumber imports have \njumped by fifty percent over the same time. In other words, further \ncutting\n\n[[Page S7087]]\n\nour domestic federal timber program may be a feel-good move for some, \nbut it will merely serve to encourage the shift of U.S. timber \nconsumption to forests in foreign countries. Many of these source \ncountries do not have the rigorous environmental standards we have in \nthe U.S.--so we should ask ourselves whose environment we are really \nsaving with this amendment, and at what cost.\n  What is particularly troubling for me about this kind of attack on \nthe timber sale program is that Oregon has some of the best forests for \ntimber production in the world. Certainly, Oregon forests are able to \nregenerate this renewable resource in a much more environmentally sound \nway than some of the foreign forests on which we have come to depend \nfor our wood products needs. Yet in Oregon we have seen an even steeper \ndecline in federal timber harvests than the nation as a whole during \nthe Clinton-Gore years--more than ninety percent. Over a hundred mills \nhave closed in my state and thousands of family-wage jobs in rural \ncounties have been lost. Just last month, two more wood products \nfacilities closed--one in Dallas, Oregon and one in Wallowa, Oregon. \nThe Bryan amendment will just exacerbate the transfer of these jobs to \nforeign timber producers.\n  Mr. President, I'm not saying that there isn't a place for \nenvironment and recreational purposes on our federal lands--there \ncertainly is. However, I believe strongly that we must manage our \nfederal lands in a balanced way, so that we are good stewards of the \nland and meet some of our human needs for timber and recreation at the \nsame time. Unfortunately, the amendment before us is just another \nattempt to export jobs and timber harvests overseas at the expense of \nrural America. I urge my colleagues to reject the Bryan amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this is another attempt to do away with the \ntimber program and the salvage program, and all those associated with \nthem. If you want to do something about fires, or the safety of the \nforests, or the health of the forests, what you do is maintain a \nhealthy harvest situation. In other words, it just makes a lot of \nsense. It is the old idea of the Government having to own all the land. \nYou have to harvest those trees. To take the money away from it does \nnot get to the environmental objective that a lot of us want to get to.\n  I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Might I inquire, is there any more time remaining on my \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not. The question is on agreeing to \namendment No. 3883. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Coverdell) \nis absent due to illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes in \nthe next series be limited to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent that the Lieberman amendment be \npostponed and be put last on the list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3884\n\n  Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes equally divided on the \nNickles amendment numbered 3884.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment would basically say there \nwould be no new national monuments unless authorized by an act of \nCongress.\n  Under the Antiquities Act, this administration just this year \ndeclared 2 million acres to be national monuments.\n  I happen to be a fan of national monuments, but I think we should \nhave local input. We should have the Governors say whether or not they \nare for it. We should have local communities testify before Congress. \nWe should have some input. Right now, that is not happening.\n  Prior to the last election, the President stood at the Grand Canyon \nand declared 1.7 million acres in Utah a national monument. This year, \nhe declared 2 million acres. In contrast, that compares to 86,000 acres \nby Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush. President Johnson declared \n344,000. This President has already declared 2 million acres this year.\n  I think Congress should have some input. We should authorize it by an \nact of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Nickles amendment is a historic vote. \nSince 1906, virtually every President of the United States has used the \nAntiquities Act to protect valuable, irreplaceable national treasures, \nsuch as the Grand Tetons and Olympic National Park.\n  With this Nickles amendment, the party of Teddy Roosevelt officially \nabandons its commitment to his environmental legacy. Without as much of \na minute of hearings on this issue, the Nickles amendment strips the \nPresident of the authority he has had for generations to protect \nAmerica's natural and national treasures. The Grand Old Party works \novertime to protect the legacy of the wealthy from taxation but refuses \nto protect the legacies of meadows, rivers, mountains, and forests for \nour children.\n  Vote ``no'' on the Nickles amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask for a rollcall on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3884. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, an agreement has been reached on this \namendment, which requires a modification. I send the modification to \nthe Bingaman amendment to the desk and ask unanimous consent that it be \nso modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regrading the protection \n          of Indian program monies from judgment fund claims)\n\n       On page 163, after line 23, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) in 1990, pursuant to the Indian Self Determination and \n     Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA), 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq., a \n     class action lawsuit was filed by Indian tribal contractors \n     and tribal consortia against the United States, the Secretary \n     of the Interior and others seeking money damages, injunctive \n     relief, and declaratory relief for alleged violations of the \n     ISDEAA (Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Lujan, 112 F.3d 1455 (10th \n     Cir. 1997));\n       (2) the parties negotiated a partial settlement of the \n     claim totaling $76,200,000, plus applicable interest, which \n     was approved by the court on May 14, 1999;\n       (3) the partial settlement was paid by the United States in \n     September 1999, in the amount of $82,000,000;\n       (4) the Judgment Fund was established to pay for legal \n     judgments awarded to plaintiffs who have filed suit against \n     the United States;\n       (5) the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 requires that the \n     Judgment Fund be reimbursed by the responsible agency \n     following the payment of an award from the Fund;\n       (6) the shortfall in contract support payments found by the \n     Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Ramah resulted \n     primarily from the non-payment or underpayment of indirect \n     costs by agencies other than the Bureau of Indian Affairs and \n     the Indian Health Service;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) repayment of the judgment fund for the partial \n     settlement in Ramah from the accounts of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs and Indian Health Service would significantly reduce \n     funds appropriated to benefit Tribes and individual Native \n     Americans; and\n       (2) the Secretary of the Interior should work with the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget to secure \n     funding for repayment of the judgment in Ramah within the \n     budgets of the agencies that did not pay indirect costs to \n     plaintiffs during the period 1988 to 1993 or paid indirect \n     costs at less than rates provided under the Indian Self-\n     Determination Act during such period.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment is intended to express \nthe sense of the Senate that repayment of the judgment fund for the \npartial settlement in the Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Lujan case from \nIndian program funds within BIA and IHS would significantly reduce the \nfunds appropriated to benefit Tribes and individual Native Americans \nacross the country.\n  This unprecedented partial settlement was the result of a lawsuit \nfiled in 1990, pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act against the United States, the Secretary of Interior \nManuel Lujan, and others.\n  The Ramah Chapter of the Navajo Nation in northwest New Mexico \ninitiated the lawsuit to recover damages for the alleged non-payment or \nunderpayment of indirect costs, related to 638 contracts it entered \ninto with several federal agencies.\n  This suit became a class action suit and currently involves over 326 \nclass members made up of tribal contractors and tribal consortia from \nacross the country.\n  In 1997, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the tribes \ninvolved were underpaid and that several federal agencies were involved \nin the non-payment and underpayment of indirect costs.\n  Last year, the federal agencies and the plaintiffs negotiated a \npartial settlement totaling $76,200,000, plus applicable interest.\n  This partial settlement was paid by the United States in September \n1999.\n  Many people do not realize that Congress established a Judgment Fund \nto pay for legal judgments awarded to plaintiffs who sue the United \nStates. This enables plaintiffs to be paid the amount of their judgment \nwithout having to wait for Congress to appropriate funds for each case.\n  Years later, in 1978, Congress passed the Contract Disputes Act and \nrequired that the Judgment Fund be reimbursed by the responsible agency \nafter an award is paid from the judgment fund.\n  The problem we have today is the Department of Interior, namely the \nBureau of Indian Affairs, has been billed for the entire amount of the \npartial settlement in the Ramah case. With interest, this totals \napproximately $83 million.\n  Many tribes are concerned that if BIA has to pay back the judgment \nfund from available funds, Indian programs will be significantly \nimpacted. I share their concern.\n  I introduced this amendment to shed some light on this issue and to \nencourage the federal agencies to resolve this matter in a way that \ndoes not severely impact Indian programs.\n  It does not seem appropriate to me that Indian program funds--funds \nthat benefit tribes and individual Indians--should be used to pay for a \nlawsuit brought by tribes and tribal entities.\n  Because there were many agencies involved in the underpayment of the \ncontract support costs, I believe the Secretary of Interior should work \nwith the OMB to find the funding from within the budgets of all of the \nagencies involved.\n  Any other result would be unjust and unfair to Native Americans \nacross the country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this sense of the Senate and I \nthank Senator Campbell for his leadership in this area and his support \nof this amendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Bingaman \nand others in this Sense of the Senate Resolution related to a class \naction lawsuit that was filed some years ago by several Indian tribes \nagainst Secretary Babbitt for failure to fully pay for contract support \ncosts necessary for tribal contractors to carry out Federal programs \nand services under the Indian Self Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, as amended, 25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.\n  To fully understand this issue a little background is in order. I was \nthe proud sponsors of S. Res. 277, commemorating the 30th anniversary \nof President Nixon's ``Special Message to Congress on Indian Affairs'' \nin which he laid the foundation for modern Federal Indian policy--\nIndian Self Determination. Built on the twin pillars of political self \ndetermination and economic self sufficiency, this policy continues to \nbe a driving force in the economic progress some tribes are making.\n\n[[Page S7089]]\n\n  The 1975 ISDEA was enacted to further this policy by authorizing \nIndian tribes to contract for the performance of Federal programs and \nservices by ``stepping into the shoes'' of the United States.\n  Now, 25 years later, nearly one-half of the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Indian Health Service programs and services are subject to tribal \ncontracts and compacts.\n  To facilitate these contracts, the United States is obligated to \nprovide the administration costs--or ``contract support costs''--to \nthose tribes that carry out ISDEA contracts, just as it does to \nmilitary contractors, research universities and other entities.\n  The Ramah Navajo Chapter v. Babbitt case resulted in a judgment of \n$82 million against the U.S. to be paid from the Judgment Fund for \nfailure to pay these contract support costs. Under the law applicable \nto this case, the Treasury Department may seek to have the BIA \nreimburse the Judgment Fund for this amount. The funds for \nreimbursement would come from the BIA's operating budget, resulting in \nmanifest inequity for not only the plaintiff tribes but for all tribes \nwho depend on BIA funds for core programs such as law enforcement, \neducation, child care, and others.\n  This sense of the Senate amendment would not prevent the kind of \nreimbursement that the tribes and I fear, but expresses the consensus \nof the Senate that the agencies involved--the BIA and the IHS--should \ndeclare Indian program funds unavailable for purposes of reimbursement.\n  I remain hopeful that stronger language can be crafted to protect \nthese funds, and in the interim lend my support to this amendment. I \nwant to commend Senator Bingaman for his hard work in finding a \nsolution that does not run afoul of the budget rules and commit to \nworking with him and others as we proceed to conference in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is all time yielded back on the Bingaman \namendment, as modified?\n  Mr. GORTON. All time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment \nNo. 3887, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3887), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, regular order.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3886\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on the Bond second-degree \namendment No. 3886 to the Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLincoln, Kerrey of Nebraska, and Roberts be added as cosponsors to my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this bipartisan \namendment which prevents funds from being used for the application of \nunapproved pesticides in areas that may be used by children and directs \nthe Secretary of the Interior to work with EPA to ensure that pest \ncontrol methods do not lead to unacceptable exposure to children.\n  We updated the safety standards for pesticides, with specific safety \nfactors for children, in 1996.\n  This amendment allows EPA to do its job. The Boxer amendment seeks to \nregulate pest control products from the Senate floor, thereby ignoring \nthe scientific tests EPA requires for pesticide registrations.\n  I urge Members to support the Bond second-degree amendment and to let \nEPA do its job of regulating and ensuring safety for all of us, \nincluding our children.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Bond \nsecond-degree amendment to the amendment offered by my colleague from \nCalifornia.\n  I agree with the intentions of the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom California. All of us want to protect the health of our children. \nHowever, I do not believe her amendment does this. In fact, I believe \nit could actually harm the health of children.\n  In 1996, Congress approved, nearly unanimously, the Food Quality and \nProtection Act. The FQPA was intended to reform pesticide tolerance and \nreview processes dating from as far back as the 1950s. Quite simply, \nprior to the passage of the FQPA the standards being used to evaluate \npesticides and chemicals was not in step with today's science.\n  Under the FQPA we tightened the review standards. Their are specific \nguidelines for pesticide and tolerance review by EPA. And, EPA has \ntightened the requirements regarding the effects of the pesticides on \nchildren. If EPA believes a chemical or pesticide could be harmful to \nchildren, it can pull, or request that a product, be pulled from the \nmarket. In fact, this has happened in several instances.\n  EPA should and will pull a chemical when children's and the public's \nhealth are at risk. At the same time, I want my colleagues to \nunderstand that without these pesticides we may be submitting our \nchildren to health risks associated with roaches, brown recluse \nspiders, ticks, mosquitoes, and other pests.\n  By passing the Senator from California's amendment, we may actually \nbe tying the hands of our federal officials and keep them from \nprotecting children from these pests.\n  The Bond amendment recognizes that we already have a review and \napproval process in place. It says that if a chemical has not been \ndeemed safe to use around children it cannot be used by the federal \nagencies funded under this act. Congress has put a product review \nprocess in place. It should be followed. The Bond amendment stays the \ncourse and I urge my colleagues to support his amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the underlying amendment circumvents the \nscience-based process at EPA which includes explicit and stringent \nprotections for children.\n  Additionally, it places children at risk by prohibiting EPA-approved \nproducts that protect our children from diseases such as asthma, \nencephalitis, malaria, Lyme disease, brown recluse spiders, and others.\n  EPA does not support this amendment, and the amendment is based on \nthe shockingly false premise that EPA does not care enough about \nchildren to protect them as mandated by law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have no problem with the Bond-Lincoln \namendment, but it does nothing. All pesticides that are on the market \ntoday are approved by EPA. There are none that are not. This is a sham \namendment to kill my underlying amendment, which already passed this \nSenate 84-14 when I offered it on the Department of Defense \nAppropriations bill.\n  Simply put, what we are saying is, for preventive and routine \napplication of pesticides in national parks--where children play--don't \nuse the most toxic pesticides, those that are identified by the EPA as \nknown or probable carcinogens, acute nerve toxins or organophosphates, \ncarbamates or organochlorines. EPA has identified these pesticides as \nthose ``which appear to pose the greatest risk to public health.'' In a \nJune 13, 2000 letter, EPA states that it ``strongly supports the goal'' \nof my amendment.\n  EPA supports what we are trying to do because they have a mission, \nwhich is to protect kids. While it's true that the Food Quality \nProtection Act of 1996 required EPA to ensure that its standards \nprotect children, the fact is, EPA is not implementing this provision \nconsistent with congressional intent. EPA has only applied the ``safety \nfactor'' referred to by my colleague from Arkansas in nine--just nine--\nof the thousands of cases it has reviewed. EPA is currently being sued \nbecause it is not enforcing this important provision.\n  So what we are saying is, for the preventive and routine application, \ndo not use these highly toxic pesticides unless there is an emergency, \nbecause children are not adults--they are rapidly growing, they are \nrapidly changing and they are, as a result, uniquely vulnerable to \nthese toxins.\n  In its report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and Children, the \nNational\n\n[[Page S7090]]\n\nAcademy of Sciences tells us that children are uniquely vulnerable to \nthe exact toxins targeted by my amendment. The NAS also tells us that \ncurrent EPA standards ``could result in the permanent loss of brain \nfunction [in children] if it occurred during prenatal or early \nchildhood period of brain development.''\n  I am voting for the Bond amendment. And I am coming right back with \nmy first degree amendment to protect children from these dangerous \npesticides.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mrs. BOXER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3886 offered by the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, what is the question on which we are voting?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Bond \nsecond-degree amendment No. 3886 to the Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3912 to amendment No. 3885:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following: ``None of \n     the funds appropriated under this Act may be used for the \n     preventive application of a pesticide containing a known or \n     probable carcinogen, a category I or II acute nerve toxin or \n     a pesticide of the organophosphate, carbamate, or organ- \n     ochlorine class as identified by the Environmental Protection \n     Agency in National Parks in any area where children and \n     pregnant women may be present.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is an important amendment. What we \nare saying is, for routine pesticide spraying in our national parks \nwhere children play and pregnant women are present, that the Park \nService should use the least toxic pesticides. In other words, for \nroutine use, don't use pesticides that are known carcinogens, probable \ncarcinogens, or that are toxic to the nervous system. These pesticides \nare identified by EPA as ``those which pose the greatest risk to public \nhealth.''\n  I would like to place into the Record a June 30, 2000 letter from EPA \nto my colleague Senator Bond where EPA states that fact.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for forwarding follow up \n     questions to the June 13, 2000 nomination hearing of Mr. \n     James Aidala before the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works. Enclosed are the questions with the \n     Administration's responses. Should you require any additional \n     information, please contact me, or your staff may contact Ron \n     Bergman at 564-3653.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Diane E. Thompson,\n                                          Associate Administrator.\n       Enclosures.\n\n                              Enclosure 1\n\n       (1) Is it accurate that EPA supports enactment into law of \n     amendment #3308 as written?\n       As you are aware, EPA stated in a letter to Senator Boxer \n     dated June 13, 2000, that EPA supports the goal of the \n     amendment. As noted at the hearing, however, the amendment \n     has not been subject to a full review by the Administration, \n     nor has the Administration taken a position on the amendment.\n       (2) If EPA supports elimination of the products restricted \n     in amendment #3308, please outline and supply the scientific \n     studies and other scientific basis in detail which influenced \n     your judgement.\n       EPA supports the goal of limiting unnecessary exposure to \n     children of pesticides. EPA is ready to work with the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) and others to craft effective \n     methods of pest control that will minimize exposures to \n     children. In fact, there is already a foundation of success \n     to build on in this regard. In 1996, EPA and DoD entered into \n     a memorandum of understanding to form a partnership to \n     promote environmental stewardship by adopting integrated pest \n     management strategies. This effect has resulted in \n     significant reductions of pesticide use by DoD.\n       The categories of pesticides included in the amendment \n     correlate with Group 1 of EPA's schedule for tolerance \n     reassessment, consisting of pesticides which appear to pose \n     the greatest risk to public health. A copy of the Federal \n     Register Notice explaining the division of pesticides into \n     groups is enclosed. The Agency is giving priority to the \n     review of these pesticides through its tolerance reassessment \n     process and will take appropriate action upon completion of \n     the review. To date, the Agency has reviewed approximately \n     3,485 of the 9,721 existing tolerances. When the Agency \n     determines, after extensive scientific review, that the risks \n     posed by a pesticide do not meet the FQPA standards it will \n     move to eliminate the risk. For example, last August, the \n     Agency negotiated agreements with the manufacturers of methyl \n     parathion and azinphos methyl to either eliminate or reduce \n     application rates on foods to address such unacceptable \n     risks. Meanwhile, many of the pesticides included in the \n     amendment are still undergoing reassessment.\n       (3) If EPA opposes the amendment, supports changes to the \n     amendment, or has concerns with the amendment, why was that \n     not expressed in the letter?\n       As stated above, the June 13 letter reaffirms EPA's support \n     for the goal of the amendment. Beyond that, the \n     Administration has not taken a position on the amendment.\n       (4) If the letter is neither supportive or in opposition to \n     the amendment, what was the purpose of the letter?\n       Immediately after the June 13 confirmation hearing, EPA was \n     asked by Senator Boxer to provide its views in writing on the \n     amendment prior to the scheduled floor consideration of the \n     amendment. As Mr. Aidala testified, the amendment had not \n     received Administration review. Given the limited time \n     available, the Agency stated its support for the goal of \n     protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure and \n     to explain our current activities in that area. We also \n     expressed our willingness to work closely with the DoD on \n     this issue.\n       (5) Were you aware of this letter at the time of your \n     testimony and if so, why was it not referenced before the \n     Committee?\n       At the time of Mr. Aidala's testimony, EPA was not \n     preparing a letter, it was only upon the conclusion of the \n     hearing that a request was received from Senator Boxer for \n     such a letter. At the time of the hearing, Mr. Aidala was \n     only aware that Senator Boxer was considering introducing \n     such an amendment.\n       (6) If you were not, were you subsequently consulted?\n\n[[Page S7091]]\n\n       Mr. Aidala was subsequently informed that EPA's Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations received a \n     request from Senator Boxer to clarify EPA's views.\n       (7) If you were not consulted, why were you not consulted?\n       Not applicable.\n       (8) Please reconcile your testimony with the letter.\n       The letter and, to the best of our understanding, Mr. \n     Aidala's testimony state that EPA supports the goal of \n     protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure, and \n     that EPA supports the goal of the amendment. As noted at the \n     hearing, however, the amendment has not been subject to a \n     full review by the Administration.\n       (9) Does EPA already protect children on military bases \n     from harmful pesticides?\n       The protection of children is one of our highest \n     priorities. When we register, reregister, or reassess \n     tolerances for existing pesticides we try to ensure that our \n     actions are protective of all consumers, especially children. \n     FQPA requires special protections for infants and children \n     including: an explicit determination that tolerances are safe \n     for children; an additional safety factor, if necessary, to \n     account for uncertainty in data relative to children; and \n     consideration of children's special sensitivity and exposure \n     to pesticide chemicals.\n       (10) If not, why not?\n       Not applicable.\n       (11) If so, why is this legislation necessary?\n       EPA supports the goal of limiting unnecessary exposure to \n     children from pesticides and respects the authority of \n     Congress to impose restrictions beyond the current regulatory \n     program.\n       (12) List the products that would be impacted by this \n     amendment?\n       As stated earlier, the products correlate with those on \n     Group 1 of EPA's tolerance reassessment schedule. A copy of \n     that schedule of information is enclosed.\n       (13) Describe the nature of the products in a range from \n     threatening to benign that would be affected by this \n     amendment?\n       Pesticides which were included in Group 1 were those that \n     EPA identified as appearing to pose the greatest risk to \n     public health. The Agency did not distinguish among products \n     in this group in terms of their potential effects.\n       (14) Do any of these products have positive benefits to \n     children's health?\n       When used according to label directions many of these \n     products could be used for pest control, sterilization of \n     medical instruments, or other uses potentially beneficial to \n     children.\n       (15) If so, is there any risk to children if Congress \n     prevents the availability of these products?\n       EPA is not sufficiently aware of DoD's pest control needs \n     to make that determination. To make a proper assessment, the \n     Agency would need to know what products are used, and how \n     they are used so that alternatives could be considered. It \n     should be noted that through EPA's Pesticide Environmental \n     Stewardship Program, DoD has committed to moving toward \n     pesticide alternatives and less use of pesticides, or use of \n     less toxic pesticides. DoD has been recognized by EPA for \n     their tremendous progress in this area.\n       (16) What is the availability and cost of substitute \n     products?\n       Again, EPA would need to know more about the DoD's pest \n     control needs to make that determination.\n       (17) Are any of the products affected by this amendment \n     products that were NOT restricted in an equivalent way by the \n     chlorpyrifos agreement announced by EPA last week?\n       There would be many other products affected that were not \n     part of last week's agreement, although chlorpyrifos products \n     would be part of the list of affected pesticides.\n       (18) If so, which products/uses permitted under the \n     chlorpyrifos agreement would not be permitted under this \n     amendment?\n       This would require detailed knowledge of DoD pest control \n     needs, but might affect any of the pesticides under Group 1, \n     including chlorpyrifos.\n       (19) Did EPA consult with DoD prior to the 6/13/00 letter \n     to coordinate the Administration's view on the amendment?\n       EPA did not formally consult with DoD in preparing this \n     specific letter. The letter stated that EPA supports the goal \n     of protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure, \n     and that EPA supports the goal of the amendment. As noted \n     earlier, however, the amendment has not been subject to a \n     full review by the Administration.\n       (20) Is EPA, in general, supportive of Congress \n     substituting its own judgment in place of that of EPA's by \n     bypassing the existing regulatory system that relies on \n     science and is already in place?\n       EPA respects the role of Congress to enact laws and conduct \n     oversight on their implementation by the Administration. EPA \n     stands ready to work with Congress to ensure the necessary \n     pest control tools are available while minimizing unnecessary \n     risk.\n       (21) In general, is EPA supportive of broad new regulatory \n     requirements added as legislative provisions to \n     appropriations bills without the benefit of public hearings \n     and if so why was this amendment not opposed on that basis?\n       In general, the Administration opposes riders to \n     appropriations bills that weaken environmental protections. \n     As stated above, EPA supports the goal of limiting \n     unnecessary exposure of children to pesticides. This is \n     consistent with the emphasis of FQPA's mandate to protect \n     infants and children.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would also like to place into the Record a letter from \nEPA stating that the agency supports the goals of my amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2000.\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     express the views of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n     on your amendment to the appropriations bill for the \n     Department of Defense. This amendment would prohibit the \n     expenditure of funds for the preventative application of \n     certain categories of hazardous pesticides in areas owned or \n     managed by the Department of Defense, if the area may be used \n     by children. Examples of such areas include: parks, base \n     housing, recreation centers, and day care facilities.\n       The EPA strongly supports the goal of the proposed \n     amendment to prevent unnecessary exposure of children to \n     highly hazardous pesticides. We consider protection of \n     children from unnecessary exposure to pesticides to be one of \n     our highest priorities. Before EPA registers a new pesticide \n     for any use, we evaluate its potential human health effects, \n     including effects on children, using the best scientific data \n     available. We conduct an extensive scientific evaluation to \n     ensure that pesticides will not cause short-term effects, \n     such as skin and eye irritation, or more persistent effects, \n     such as birth defects, reproductive system disorders, and \n     cancer.\n       As you know, the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) \n     directs EPA to bring the same scientific scrutiny to the \n     review of all pesticides previously approved for food use so \n     that we can be sure that we are providing the full measure of \n     protection for children. Under the FQPA, the Agency has \n     identified the pesticides which appear to pose the greatest \n     risk to public health. These pesticides, which receive the \n     highest priority for reassessment, include the categories \n     identified in the Boxer-Reed amendment: organophosphate, \n     carbamate, and organochlorine pesticides, potential human \n     carcinogens, and neurotoxic compounds.\n       EPA stands ready to work with the Department of Defense and \n     other federal agencies to design safe, effective methods of \n     pest control that do not lead to unacceptable exposure of \n     children to these hazardous materials.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Michael McCabe,\n                                      Acting Deputy Administrator.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Contrary to statements you have heard today, EPA is not \nopposed to my amendment.\n  Now, the Senate is already on record as voting for this before by a \nvote of 84-14. I hope we will see that type of a vote today. I just \nhave to say this. There are scare tactics being used that say if there \nis an emergency, they could not use the highly toxic pesticides \ntargeted by my amendment. Untrue. We have drawn up this amendment in \nsuch a way that only applies to the routine, preventive use. So please \nsupport us.\n  The children in this country are counting on us to protect them. The \nNational Academy of Sciences has told us that children are vulnerable \nto the dangers posed by the pesticides targeted by my amendment. Most \nimportant, the NAS has told us that current EPA standards don't protect \nour children from those dangers. At a minimum, we should protect our \nchildren. Please vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stated before that this approach proceeds \non the outrageous assumption that the Clinton-Gore-Browner \nadministration in EPA is not doing its job of regulating pesticides. \nChildren would be placed at risk if we banned these pesticides. And \ncontrary to what was said in the DOD debate, EPA does not support the \nunderlying amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a June 30 letter from EPA, which states \nthey have not reviewed it, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              Environmental Protection Agency,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2000.\n     Hon. Robert Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for forwarding follow up \n     questions to the June 13, 2000 nomination hearing of Mr. \n     James Aidala before the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works. Enclosed are the questions with the \n     Administration's responses. Should you require any additional\n\n[[Page S7092]]\n\n     information, please contact me, or your staff may contact Ron \n     Bergman at 564-3653.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Diane E. Thompson,\n                                          Associate Administrator.\n       Enclosures.\n\n                              Enclosure 1\n\n       (1) Is it accurate that EPA supports enactment into law of \n     amendment #3308 as written?\n       As you are aware, EPA stated in a letter to Senator Boxer \n     dated June 13, 2000, that EPA supports the goal of the \n     amendment. As noted at the hearing, however, the amendment \n     has not been subject to a full review by the Administration, \n     nor has the Administration taken a position on the amendment.\n       (2) If EPA supports elimination of the products restricted \n     in amendment #3308, please outline and supply the scientific \n     studies and other scientific basis in detail which influenced \n     your judgment.\n       EPA supports the goal of limiting unnecessary exposure to \n     children of pesticides. EPA is ready to work with the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) and others to craft effective \n     methods of pest control that will minimize exposures to \n     children. In fact, there is already a foundation of success \n     to build on in this regard. In 1996, EPA and DoD entered into \n     a memorandum of understanding to form a partnership to \n     promote environmental stewardship by adopting integrated pest \n     management strategies. This effort has resulted in \n     significant reductions of pesticide use by DoD.\n       The categories of pesticides included in the amendment \n     correlate with Group 1 of EPA's schedule for tolerance \n     reassessment, consisting of pesticides which appear to pose \n     the greatest risk to public health. A copy of the Federal \n     Register Notice explaining the division of pesticides into \n     groups is enclosed. The Agency is giving priority to the \n     review of these pesticides through its tolerance reassessment \n     process and will take appropriate action upon completion of \n     the review. To date, the Agency has reviewed approximately \n     3,485 of the 9,721 existing tolerances. When the Agency \n     determines, after extensive scientific review, that the risks \n     posed by a pesticide do not meet the FQPA standards it will \n     move to eliminate the risk. For example, last August, the \n     Agency negotiated agreements with the manufacturers of methyl \n     parathion and azinphos methyl to either eliminate or reduce \n     application rates on foods to address such unacceptable \n     risks. Meanwhile, many of the pesticides included in the \n     amendment are still undergoing reassessment.\n       (3) If EPA opposes the amendment, supports changes to the \n     amendment, or has concerns with the amendment, why was that \n     no expressed in the letter?\n       As stated above, the June 13 letter reaffirms EPA's support \n     for the goal of the amendment. Beyond that, the \n     Administration has not taken a position on the amendment.\n       (4) If the letter is neither supportive or in opposition to \n     the amendment, what was the purpose of the letter?\n       Immediately after the June 13 confirmation hearing, EPA was \n     asked by Senator Boxer to provide its views in writing on the \n     amendment prior to the secluded floor consideration of the \n     amendment. As Mr. Aidala testified, the amendment had not \n     received Administration review. Given the limited time \n     available, the Agency stated its support for the goal of \n     protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure and \n     to explain our current activities in that area. We also \n     expressed our willingness to work closely with the DoD on \n     this issue\n       (5) Were you aware of this letter at the time of your \n     testimony and if so, why was it not referenced before the \n     Committee?\n       At the time of Mr. Aidala's testimony, EPA was not \n     preparing a letter, it was only upon the conclusion of the \n     hearing that a request was received from Senator Boxer for \n     such a letter. At the time of the hearing, Mr. Aidala was \n     only aware that Senator Boxer was considering introducing \n     such an amendment.\n       (6) If you were not, were you subsequently consulted?\n       Mr. Aidala was subsequently informed that EPA's Office of \n     Congressional and Intergovernmental Relations received a \n     request from Senator Boxer to clarify EPA's views\n       (7) If you were not consulted, why were you not consulted.\n       Not applicable.\n       (8) Please reconcile your testimony with the letter.\n       The letter and, to the best of our understanding, Mr. \n     Aidala's testimony state that EPA supports the goal of \n     protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure, and \n     that EPA supports the goal of the amendment. As noted at the \n     hearing, however, the amendment has not been subject to a \n     full review by the Administration.\n       (9) Does EPA already protect children on military bases \n     from harmful pesticides?\n       The protection of children is one of our highest \n     priorities. When we register, reregister, or reassess \n     tolerances for existing pesticides we try to ensure that our \n     actions are protective of all consumers, especially children. \n     FQPA requires special protections for infants and children \n     including: an explicit determination that tolerances are safe \n     for children; an additional safety factor, if necessary, to \n     account for uncertainty in data relative to children; and \n     consideration of children's special sensitivity and exposure \n     to pesticide chemicals.\n       (10) If not, why not?\n       Not applicable.\n       (11) If so, why is this legislation necessary?\n       EPA supports the goal of limiting unnecessary exposure to \n     children from pesticides and respects the authority of \n     Congress to impose restrictions beyond the current regulatory \n     program.\n       (12) List the products that would be impacted by this \n     amendment?\n       As stated earlier, the products correlate with those on \n     Group 1 of EPA's tolerance reassessment schedule. A copy of \n     that schedule of information is enclosed.\n       (13) Describe the nature of the products in a range from \n     threatening to benign that would be affected by this \n     amendment?\n       Pesticides which were included in Group 1 were those that \n     EPA identified as appearing to pose the greatest risk to \n     public health. The Agency did not distinguish among products \n     in this group in terms of their potential effects.\n       (14) do any of these products have positive benefits to \n     children's health?\n       When used according to label directions many of these \n     products could be used for pest control, sterilization of \n     medical instruments, or other uses potentially beneficial to \n     children.\n       (15) If so, is there any risk to children if Congress \n     prevents the availability of these products?\n       EPA is not sufficiently aware of DoD's pest control needs \n     to make that determination. To make a proper assessment, the \n     Agency would need to know what products are used, and how \n     they are used so that alternatives could be considered. It \n     should be noted that through EPA's Pesticide Environmental \n     Stewardship Program, DoD has committed to moving toward \n     pesticide alternatives and less use of pesticides, or use of \n     less toxic pesticides. DoD has been recognized by EPA for \n     their tremendous progress in this area.\n       (16) What is the availability and cost of substitute \n     products?\n       Again, EPA would need to know more about the DoD's pest \n     control needs to make that determination.\n       (17) Are any of the products affected by this amendment \n     products that were NOT restricted in an equivalent way by the \n     chlorpyrifos agreement announced by EPA last week?\n       There would be many other products affected that were not \n     part of last week's agreement, although chlorpyrifos products \n     would be part of the list of affected pesticides.\n       (18) If so, which products/uses permitted under the \n     chlorpyrifos agreement would not be permitted under this \n     amendment?\n       This would require detailed knowledge of DoD pest control \n     needs, but might affect any of the pesticides under Group 1, \n     including chlorpyrifos.\n       (19) Did EPA consult with DoD prior to the 6/13/00 letter \n     to coordinate the Administration's view on the amendment?\n       EPA did not formally consult with DoD in preparing this \n     specific letter. The letter stated that EPA supports the goal \n     of protecting children from unnecessary pesticide exposure, \n     and that EPA supports the goal of the amendment. As noted \n     earlier, however, the amendment has not been subject to a \n     full review by the Administration.\n       (20) Is EPA, in general, supportive of Congress \n     substituting its own judgement in place of that of EPA's by \n     bypassing the existing regulatory system that relies on \n     science and is already in place?\n       EPA respects the role of Congress to enact laws and conduct \n     oversight on their implementation by the Administration. EPA \n     stands ready to work with congress to ensure the necessary \n     pest control tools are available while minimizing unnecessary \n     risk.\n       (21) In general, is EPA supportive of broad new regulatory \n     requirements added as legislative provisions to \n     appropriations bills without the benefit of public hearings \n     and if so why was this amendment not opposed on that basis?\n       In general, the Administration opposes riders to \n     appropriations bills that weaken environmental protections. \n     As stated above, EPA supports the goal of limiting \n     unnecessary exposure of children to pesticides. This is \n     consistent with the emphasis of FQPA's mandate to protect \n     infants and children.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there are great efforts in the EPA to \nprotect children. They have special protections for infants and \nchildren. These products are important for sterilization of medical \ninstruments, pest control, and other uses that are potentially \nbeneficial to children.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I agree with the intentions of the \namendment by my distinguished friend and colleague from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. All of us should support Senator Bond.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on amendment No. 3912 to \namendment No. 3885. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll. The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

We urge Members to see the memorial and understand it. \nI think it will become a controversial subject in the near future.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3885, As Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the underlying \nBoxer amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 3885), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n\n                         city of craig, alaska\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the Interior appropriations bill in a short colloquy \nregarding a provision of interest to me. My amendment provides an \nappropriation to recompense an Alaskan community for its inability to \nreceive a municipal land entitlement under the Alaska Statehood Act and \nAlaska state laws.\n  The city of Craig is a small town located on the southern end of \nPrince of Wales Island in southeast Alaska. It is the only community in \nsoutheast Alaska which was unable to receive a municipal entitlement \nunder Alaska state law. This is a result of a 20-year process in the \n1960s and 1970s by which the U.S. Forest Service and State of Alaska \ncould not agree on the process for State selections under the Alaska \nStatehood Act at Craig.\n  In 1971, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. \nANCSA authorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to work with the State \n``for the purpose of effecting land consolidations or to facilitate the \nmanagement or development of the land. Exchanges shall be on the basis \nof equal value, and either party to the exchange may pay or accept cash \nin order to equalize the value of the properties exchanged.''\n  Despite this authority, the implementation of the act in southeast \nAlaska simply resulted in Alaska Native land selections completely \nsurrounding Craig. Under ANCSA, these selections are not taxable or \nsubject to condemnation unless the land is developed. As a result, \nCraig and its residents of about 2,500 people live on only 300 acres of \nprivately and municipally owned land. This is insufficient as a tax \nbase to support the community. My colleague and chairman of the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee introduced S. 1797 to solve this \nproblem. That bill which I cosponsored and which has passed the Senate \nunanimously would provide a land grant to Craig of approximately 4,300 \nacres.\n  However, I recently have been informed by the administration that it \nbelieves a direct monetary grant to Craig is a better way to resolve \nthis situation. The amendment which is to be added to the bill would \nprovide for this payment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I held a hearing on this issue and on S. 1797--\nthat bill will provide a grant of lands. While I would be happy to have \nthat bill passed into law, I plan to work to that end. However, to \nassure that Craig is not left with nothing, I would also support this \nsolution. It is my hope that one of these two approaches can be \naccomplished this year.\n  My committee's hearing provides a clear record that Craig is in a \nunique position being the fastest growing city in Alaska and the \nregional center for Prince of Wales Island. The city fathers are \nstruggling to keep up with the demands for services as people from all \nover the island move to Craig looking for work. The city submitted its \nfinancial records which showed its problems. Our committee responded \nwith S. 1797.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct that this amendment would provide \nfor such a payment. I am happy to accept this amendment from my \ncolleagues from Alaska.\n\n\n                       fish and wildlife service\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Appropriations Committee for presenting the Senate with \nan Interior appropriations bill which addresses so many of the Indian, \nnatural resource, and energy issues confronting America today. I also \nwant to reiterate my support for a program of great interest to me and \nmy colleagues from the Great Lakes states.\n  The Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act authorizes funding \nfor a grants program for the implementation of fish and wildlife \nrestoration projects recommended in the Great Lakes Fishery Resources \nRestoration Study. Enthusiasm for this program has been high and \nproposals for grants have exceeded available funds. Nevertheless, the \nAdministration has proposed discontinuation of these grants in its \nbudget request. I thank the chairman and ranking member for recognizing \nthe value of Great Lakes fish and wildlife restoration grants and \nmaintaining funding for these grants at this year's $398,000 level.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member if, should \nadditional funds become available, he would consider increasing the \ngrants funding for the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration \nProgram by an additional $500,000?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan and our colleagues from the Great Lakes states for \nhighlighting the importance of Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife \nRestoration grants to the chairman and myself. We are pleased to \nrecommend continuation of this program which is so vital to the fish \nand wildlife of the Great Lakes. I assure the Senator that the \nconferees will keep this program in mind, should additional funds \nbecome available for the appropriations in this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my friend from West Virginia.\n\n\n                       Funding for National Parks\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for the Department of Interior and Related \nAgencies, I wonder if the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nwould answer two questions regarding funding for the National Park \nService?\n  Mr. BYRD. I would be pleased to offer my views about this bill to my \nfriend from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am aware that the bill before us contains funding for \nOperations of the National Park System in the amount of $1,443,795,000, \nwhich is more than $80 million above the Fiscal Year 2000 level. I am \nalso aware that approximately $25.6 million has been provided for \nincreases in the base operating budgets of more than 80 parks and \nrelated sites, including increases of $325,000 for Isle Royale National \nPark and $850,000 for Keweenaw National Historic Park. I greatly \nappreciate that the chairman and ranking member have been able to \nprovide these amounts. I must say to my colleagues, though, that there \nis also a significant\n\n[[Page S7094]]\n\nneed for operating increases at other Michigan parks such as the North \nCountry National Scenic Trail and Sleeping Bear Dunes National \nLakeshore. I would like to ask the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia whether such additional needs, including those above the \nPresident's request, will be considered in conference, or, in the event \nadditional resources are not available, whether he would consider a \nreallocation of operational funds for Michigan parks?\n  Mr. BYRD. While the increases provided in the bill for base operating \nincreases are essentially spoken for, I will certainly be mindful of \nthe needs identified by the Senator should additional funding become \navailable in conference.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his answer, and \nif he will indulge me a few moments more, I would like to also inquire \nabout land acquisition funding for the National Park Service.\n  First let me say that, while the administration did not include the \nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in its Fiscal Year 2001 land \nacquisition request, I nevertheless appreciate your support, Senator \nByrd, in obtaining $1.1 million for acquisition of the LaPorte \nproperty. I would ask, however, if the Senator would be willing to \nconsider in conference a second request of $4 million for purchase of \nthe Barratt property at Sleeping Bear Dunes should additional funds \nbecome available as the appropriations process continues?\n  Mr. BYRD. Again, I thank the Senator for his question. As my friend \nfrom Michigan may know, the Interior subcommittee received over 2,000 \nMember requests for funding for particular projects, accounts or \nactivities. It is not an easy task, of course, to strike a satisfactory \nbalance between the thousands of requests on the one hand, and the \nsubcommittee's limited resources on the other. However, I am aware that \nthe Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore is of great importance to \nthe Senator from Michigan and the people he represents, and I was \ntherefore pleased to be able to secure funding for the LaPorte land \nacquisition. I can also assure my friend that I will carefully consider \nhis Barratt property request should additional resources become \navailable later in the year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. As always, I appreciate the courtesy of the distinguished \nSenator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                               cat island\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee may be aware, Cat Island is the last remaining private \nisland that lies outside the Gulf Islands National Seashore. Located so \nclose to the mainland, Cat Island has many natural and recreational \nresources that make it an attractive target for development.\n  For the past couple of years, the owners of this property have been \nextremely patient while working with the Mississippi delegation and the \nNational Park Service to ensure that their property is included in the \nGulf Islands National Seashore, while competing development offers have \nbeen on the table. H.R. 2541 has passed the House of Representatives, \nallowing the Park Service to acquire this tract. A companion bill, S. \n2638, is now pending here in the Senate, where I hope it will move \nforward expeditiously and be enacted this year.\n  Because this process has taken longer than expected, it is now \ncritical that funding for the first phase of this project be provided \nthis year through the Land and Water Conservation Fund should the \nenabling legislation be enacted. There is $2,000,000 in the House-\npassed Interior Appropriations bill which is a good start, but it \nprovides well below the amount needed for Phase I of this project. In \nfact, the first phase will require $10 million. Therefore, I request \nthe chairman's assistance in working with me to fund the first phrase \nof Cat Island, providing that additional funding be made available as \nthe Interior appropriations bill moves toward conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. The report accompanying this bill reflects the \nwillingness of the committee to consider funding for acquisition of Cat \nIsland, Mississippi, should the enabling legislation be enacted this \nyear. I understand the urgency of this project and the need to provide \nadequate funding this year. With this in mind, should additional \nallocations be made available for this bill as it moves through the \nprocess, I will work with the Senator to ensure that this worthy \nproject receives our full consideration.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I appreciate the Chairman's consideration of my request \nand his willingness to work with me both last year and this year to \nfurther this important project. I hope that the enabling legislation \nwill be completed by the time the Interior bill reaches conference and \nthat we can work together to make Cat Island a success this year.\n\n\n                       black liquor gasification\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \ngentlemen from Washington and West Virginia for their leadership in \nshepherding this bill through Committee and to the floor. I recognize \nthat the Committee was faced with requests that went far beyond the \nCommittee's budget, and I commend the leaders for successfully \nbalancing the myriad of requests with which they were presented.\n  I want to bring to my colleagues' attention one particular program \nthat I believe is worthy of additional funding in Conference. Would the \nSenator from West Virginia agree that encouraging the forest and paper \nproducts industry to achieve greater energy efficiency is a worthy \ngoal?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I would agree that is a worthy goal.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Since we agree with that goal, I am sure the Senator \nshares my support for a program within the Department of Energy that \nwill encourage the forest and paper products industry to utilize \nresources that are readily available on site to produce energy. By \nutilizing wood and bark residues and spent pulping liquor in a process \ncalled black liquor gasification, the industry could potentially \nimprove on site electricity generation by 300%-400% over existing \ncogeneration systems. Given these benefits, would the Senator agree \nthat increasing funding for the black liquor gasification program \nshould be pursued in Conference?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I share the Senator's support for the program and will \nsupport efforts to find additional funding for the program.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the gentleman.\n\n\n                     Indian Trust Services Programs\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, resolving Indian trust management issues \nshould be one of the foremost priorities of this Congress. Ever since \nthe passage of the Dawes Act in 1887, serious problems have plagued the \nFederal government's trust management efforts. Due to recent \ncongressional interest and support, the Department of the Interior has \nbeen able to make significant progress in reforming its trust \nmanagement systems. Working in collaboration, the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs and the Office of the Special Trustee are:\n  Instituting a national, state of the art, trust asset management \nsystem;\n  Implementing a revised Trust Management Improvement Project High \nLevel Implementation Plan; and\n  Instituting improvements in systems, operations, and policies that \nwill help ensure that the Federal government meets its fiduciary \nobligations to Indian Tribes and individual American Indians.\n  The subcommittee's efforts to provide full funding for the Trust \nManagement Improvement Project under the Office of the Special Trustee \nshould be applauded. However, I am very concerned that the Senate mark \ndoes not fully fund the Bureau of Indian Affair's trust services \nprograms. All of our efforts to reform trust management could become \nmeaningless if BIA can't sustain these reforms by providing the funding \nand staffing to properly manage the trust land that produces trust \nincome, to produce accurate and timely land title information, and \nprovide timely closing of long open estates.\n  I would like to work with the gentleman from Washington, Senator \nGorton, and other concerned members, as the budget process continues, \nto provide additional resources for BIA's trust programs if funds \nbecome available.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would be pleased to work with the \ngentleman on that endeavor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would like to thank the Chairman from Washington State \nfor his support. I look forward to working with him to secure the \nresources\n\n[[Page S7095]]\n\nnecessary to institutionalize and maintain trust management \nimprovements in the future.\n\n\n                          red mountain project\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to express my \nsupport for the acquisition of Red Mountain in my home state of \nColorado. This site should be preserved because of its mining history \nand natural beauty. I look forward to working with the chairman of the \nInterior Subcommittee to ensure its funding in the future.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I would like to engage the chairman briefly on an \nimportant Land and Water Conservation project in my state of Colorado \ncalled the Red Mountain project. Specifically, the first phase of the \nproject owned by Idarado Mining Co.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to oblige the Senator.\n  Mr. ALLARD. The Red Mountain project, located in the communities of \nSilverton and Ouray Colorado, is a top priority for the U.S. Forest \nService this year.\n  Red Mountain is a 10,500 acre site that is one of the most nationally \nrenowned scenic and historic resources in Southwestern Colorado. Before \nthe Silver Crash in 1893, Red Mountain was a vibrant mining town, home \nto thousands of miners and their families, living in four communities \nand working dozens of rich silver mines. Today, the remnants of this \ncommunity have been designated by Ouray and San Juan Counties as a \nhistorical landmark, and just named one of the National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation's 11 most endangered sites in America. In \naddition, Red Mountain contains extensive habitat for endangered \nspecies as well as other sensitive species. The area offers an \nabundance of recreation opportunities to one million visitors \nannually--from hiking, biking and four-wheel driving to cross country \nskiing and mountaineering.\n  As you may know, this year although the Forest Service recommended \n$10 million in its FY01 budget for a Colorado project called Silver \nMountain, we have received correspondence from the Forest Service \nindicating that this project is no longer viable. In addition, the U.S. \nForest Service has further indicated that the Red Mountain project is a \ntop priority for funding this year. Therefore, I urge you to consider \nallocating the $10 million from the Silver Mountain project to the Red \nMountain project as the Interior bill moved toward conference.\n  Mr. GORTON. Unfortunately, due to our subcommittee's allocation, \nthere was not enough room in the Senate mark to cover many good Land \nand Water Conservation Fund projects. As the bill moves forward, if \nthere is an opportunity to reconsider this project, I will make every \neffort to do so especially given the unusual circumstance surrounding \nthe FY01 US Forest Service budget request. With the budget flexibility \nprovided by the Forest Service in its recent correspondence, I feel \nconfident that this will help the Red Mountain project as the bill \nmoves forward.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I sincerely appreciate the Chairman's consideration of my \nrequest and understand the predicament he was in with respect to his \nallocation. Given the immediate needs of this project, I appreciate the \nChairman is willing to work with me to find ways to fund the first \nphase of the Red Mountain project this year.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will continue to work with you toward that end.\n\n\n                      lincoln presidential library\n\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto ask the Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee about \nthe Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library that is planned for \nconstruction in Springfield, Illinois.\n  Currently, the Nation is without an institution that honors the \nlegacy of one of our greatest Presidents, Abraham Lincoln. The Lincoln \nLibrary would serve as museum and interpretive center, allowing \nvisitors and scholars to learn about the events that shaped Lincoln's \nlife and the contributions that he made to the history of our country.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I join my colleague from Illinois in recognizing the need \nfor a Lincoln Library. Twelve Presidents, as well as Confederate leader \nJefferson Davis, currently have presidential libraries. Abraham \nLincoln, as the man who preserved the Union, truly deserves such an \ninstitution where people from around the world can learn about his \ngreat achievements.\n  This project enjoys tremendous support at the federal, state, and \nlocal levels. The entire Illinois Congressional Delegation, the \nIllinois General Assembly, and City of Springfield have all expressed \ntheir strong support for this library to be completed. The State of \nIllinois has contributed $50 million, and the City of Springfield $10 \nmillion, to begin construction on the interpretive center. In addition, \nthe Lincoln Library received $3 million from the FY 2000 Interior \nAppropriations Bill. While these federal funds are greatly appreciated, \nwe need a stronger federal commitment to make sure construction of the \nLibrary can get underway. I would like to ask the Senator from \nWashington if there is any possibility to receive increased funding \nfrom the FY 2001 Interior Appropriations Bill for this important \nendeavor.\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand the importance of the Abraham Lincoln \nPresidential Library to my colleagues from Illinois, their \nconstituents, and the nation. While the Lincoln Library is an important \nproject, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee has received many \nimportant requests, for Fiscal Year 2001, that have received \nprecedence, due to the fact that they have been authorized.\n  The Lincoln Library project is a worthy project, and if the project \nreceives authorization, the Committee will again review the project and \ngive it strong consideration.\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree with the Chairman of the Subcommittee.\n\n\n                         Section 326 of HR 4578\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the record the \nintent of language included in Section 326 of the Interior \nAppropriation fiscal year 2001 bill. I want to point out that \ninteragency coordination of Federal resources is desirable and \ncertainly something many of us have been supporting as a way to \neliminate wasteful bureaucratic redundancies. We don't want to spend \nmoney in Washington duplicating positions and processes. We want money \nin the field helping local communities. The language in Section 326 \nrefers to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, which is coordinated \nby an interagency committee that serves that purpose for communities \nseeking technical assistance and opportunities for Federal grants. I \nwould like to point out that this initiative has proven to work well \nfor the participating communities in my state and others.\n  It is my understanding that this language does not prohibit Federal \nagencies funded through this appropriation from working on or \ncoordinating with each other to support American Heritage Rivers \nprojects. Further, I understand that this language does prohibit the \nuse of resources derived from this bill for funding personnel, training \nor administration of the activities of the Council on Environmental \nQuality.\n  Mr. L. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. This language does not \nprohibit coordination by Federal agencies funded in the bill. It also \nis not intended to penalize or disadvantage communities that seek or \napply for grants from agencies funded on the bill. Section 326 is \nlimited to prohibiting funding transfers for the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality or the Executive Office of the President. Would \nthe Chairman and the Ranking Member agree with this interpretation?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n\n\n                    collaborative forest restoration\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nengage Senator Domenici, Senator Gorton, and Senator Byrd in a brief \ncolloquy at this time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to clarify that it is your intent that $5 \nmillion of the emergency funds available through amendment 3782 will be \nused to implement the Collaborative Forest Restoration Program in New \nMexico. This program will be authorized by a bill, S. 1288, that \nSenator Domenici and I introduced together. It already passed the \nSenate last November and will be considered by the full House Resources \nCommittee next week. This program creates a mechanism through which \npeople with varied interests will be able to work cooperatively with \nthe\n\n[[Page S7096]]\n\nForest Service to conduct forest restoration and value-added projects. \nImproving communication and joint problem solving among individuals and \ngroups who are interested in restoring the diversity and productivity \nof forested watersheds can assist us in our efforts to address the \nproblem posed by communities at risk from catastrophic wildfire.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is correct. However, I would note that the \nemergency needs for on-the-ground work on fuel reduction in New Mexico \nare very great. I understand that the agencies could use more than $50 \nmillion in emergency dollars for projects ready to go in New Mexico by \nthe end of the year. The Collaborative Forest Restoration Program will \nhelp promote additional projects for fuel reduction. Considering the \nterrible toll fires have taken in the state, I hope our federal land \nmanagement agencies will use as much as possible in this emergency \nfunding to decrease the risk in New Mexico urban-wildland interface \ncommunities.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is my understanding as well.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I agree with you that $5 million of the emergency \nfunds will be used to implement the Collaborative Forest Restoration \nProgram.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Thank you all for the clarification.\n\n\n                           saint croix island\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the year 2004 will mark the 400th \nanniversary of a small French settlement on Saint Croix Island, located \nin the Saint Croix River, which forms the boundary between the State of \nMaine and Canada. The 1604 settlement was the initial site of the first \npermanent settlement in the New World, predating the English settlement \nof 1607 at Jamestown, Virginia. Many view the expedition that settled \non the Island as the beginning of the Acadian culture in North America.\n  Mr. GORTON. I am aware of the historical significance of the 1604 \nsettlement of Saint Croix Island and would note that the Island is the \nonly international historic site in the National Park System.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank you for your invaluable support of \nefforts to commemorate the Saint Croix Island site. Last year's \nInterior Appropriations bill included my sense-of-the-Senate language \nthat the National Park Service should take what steps are necessary to \nensure that appropriate exhibits are completed by 2004. This year's \nAppropriations Committee mark includes $200,000 in the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service construction budget to assist with the Downeast \nHeritage Center. The Center, which we will make every effort to \ncomplete in time for the 2004 celebration, will allow state and federal \nagencies and other partners in the project to interpret the French \nsettlement efforts at Saint Croix Island and other historical, \nrecreational, and cultural aspects of Downeast Maine.\n  Mr. GORTON. I have been pleased to support your efforts to \ncommemorate the Saint Croix Island settlement, including your work on \nthe Downeast Heritage Center. I would note that the National Park \nService is scheduled to undertake major improvements to its site at Red \nBeach beginning in fiscal year 2002. I support this effort as well.\n  Ms. COLLINS. A major, international celebration is expected to \ncommemorate the Saint Croix Island settlement's 400th anniversary. \nPursuant to a memorandum of understanding signed by the U.S. Department \nof the Interior and the Canadian Department of the Environment, Parks \nCanada has worked diligently to prepare for the event. I am concerned \nthat we have not been as enterprising and now face the very real \npossibility of being less than fully prepared for the 2004 celebration. \nIndeed, the National Park Service has informed me that it requires \nplanning money in fiscal year 2001 in order to ensure that the Downeast \nHeritage Center will be completed in time. I have introduced \nauthorizing legislation, S. 2485, that would permit the National Park \nService to join with other public and private entities to construct the \nCenter. That bill has been reported out of the Senate Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources. I have every hope that the bill will \nbecome law this year. Mr. Chairman, as the FY 2001 Interior \nAppropriations bill goes to conference, I would ask that you do what \nyou can to add $340,000 to the National Park Service construction \nbudget so that it can assist this year in the planning of the Downeast \nHeritage Center with an eye to its completion by 2004.\n  Mr. GORTON. I want to thank the Senator from Maine for again bringing \nthis matter to my attention. I understand the importance of this matter \nto the State of Maine and to a much broader, international community. I \nalso understand the importance of providing funds soon enough to allow \ncompletion of the Downeast Heritage Center in time for the 2004 \ncommemoration. I will be pleased to do what I can to see that your \nrequest is considered fully in conference.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to thank my good friend again. I know he, in \nparticular, appreciates the value of preserving our nation's history \nand its cultural heritage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we have before the Senate the Fiscal Year \n2001 Appropriations Act for the Department of Interior and Related \nAgencies.\n  I want to express my support for the American Heritage Rivers \nInitiative. This bill contains a provision that prohibits funds in the \nAct from being given to or used to provide support for the Executive \nOffice of the President in coordinating the American Heritage Rivers. \nIt also prevents the Council on Environmental Quality from receiving \nfunds and support to coordinate and oversee the initiative.\n  The American Heritage Rivers Initiative, which redirects federal \nresources without new spending, has greatly improved the Detroit River, \na designated American Heritage River, through shoreline development and \nprotection of wetlands. In the ten months that the River Navigator for \nthe Greater Detroit American Heritage River has been in operation, over \n$1 million has been acquired for Detroit River projects. This program \nalso assists communities in the use of Federal resources to help \ncommunities revitalize parks--to help celebrate their history and their \nheritage.\n  This initiative needs our support and full participation and I \nstrongly oppose any language which would put this program in jeopardy.\n\n\n                      NATIONAL PARK SNOWMOBILE BAN\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to express my concern over this \negregious and unjustified action by the Department of the Interior that \nwill have severe negative economic consequences on citizens and \ncommunities in Idaho and many other states around the country. The \nDepartment has announced that it intends to ban recreational snowmobile \nuse in virtually every national park that now allows them, although \nsnowmobiles have been an established use in these parks for more than \nfour decades. This announcement was made by Interior Assistant \nSecretary Don Barry on April 27th in an orchestrated press conference \nthat amounted to a public lynching of the snowmobile community. This \nnew policy was made without consultation with Congress, the snowmobile \nmanufacturers, the nearly four million snowmobile users, or with the \nmany gateway communities to the national parks that are dependent on \nbusiness generated by snowmobile visitors. Although Assistant Secretary \nBarry claimed that this ban is necessary because of air pollution, \nnoise and wildlife disturbance caused by snowmobiles, the truth is that \nthere is simply no evidence that snowmobiles cause such harm. In fact, \nin a shocking admission before the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee Mr. Barry conceded that snowmobiles had never been \nfound in violation of any environmental standard in any national park. \nI understand Mr. Barry has since left the Department to be employed by \nthe Wilderness Society, an organization that has actively advocated the \nexclusion of snowmobiles from national parks.\n  The major snowmobile manufacturers have made great progress in \nproducing machines that are cleaner and quieter than ever before. The \nmanufacturers, the snowmobile users and the gateway communities are \nwilling to work with the Department of the Interior to develop \nreasonable plans and programs to achieve agreed to environmental goals. \nI believe this is the best course for the Department to follow.\n  I bow to no one in my love for our majestic national parks. I fully \nsupport reasonable and reasoned efforts to protect and preserve them. \nBut to ban\n\n[[Page S7097]]\n\nsnowmobiles completely in the national parks is totally unnecessary. It \nis an abuse of bureaucratic power, and it is the duty of Congress to \nuphold the law and prevent this from taking place.\n  I feel it is important for all to understand that snow machines do \nnot run roughshod over the national parks as has been stated on the \nfloor. Travelways are designated and adhered to. The issue of where \nsnowmachines travel is a matter of management by the park service, not \nof whether or not they should be in our national parks. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a letter from Dr. Lori Fussell that explains a number of \nmisconceptions on pollution from snowmobiles be printed in the Record \nto clarify several of these issues.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                       Environmental Engineering &\n\n\n                                                     Research,\n\n                                         Wilson, WY, June 5, 2000.\n     Hon. James V. Hansen,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n\nComments on Testimony Given at the May 25, 2000 Hearing Held By United \n  States House of Representatives Subcommittee on National Parks and \n        Public Lands, Regarding Snowmobile Use in National Parks\n\n       I am writing to you today because I have had the \n     opportunity to read through some of the testimony offered at \n     the May 25, 2000 hearing held by the U.S. House of \n     Representatives' Subcommittee on National Parks and Public \n     Lands regarding snowmobile use in National Parks. And, in my \n     expert opinion, some of the testimony regarding pollution \n     from snowmobiles was incorrect or misleading. I feel a need, \n     in the interest of good science, to providing information to \n     the Subcommittee to correct these errors.\n       Before I go into details, let me make several points about \n     the information contained in this letter. First, the intent \n     of this letter is simply to correct misinformation that was \n     presented to the Subcommittee. I am not being paid by any \n     organization to submit my opinion to you and I have no \n     personal interest in the outcome of the hearings. I am not a \n     snowmobiler and do not particularly care for snowmobiles as \n     they presently exist. In fact, I was the first person to \n     publish any scientific research on exposure to snowmobile \n     pollution and believe very strongly that actions must be \n     taken to significantly reduce snowmobile emissions in our \n     National Parks. Human exposure to snowmobile pollution in \n     Yellowstone National Park (YNP), in particular, is \n     unacceptable. However, I believe just as strongly that \n     decisions about emissions are reduced (visitor limits, \n     technological improvements, and/or banning snowmobiles) \n     should be based on accurate information.\n       Second, I do not any way want to imply that the testimony \n     given to the Subcommittee by any individual or organization \n     was intentionally incorrect or misleading. There is a lot of \n     information circulating about pollution from snowmobiles. It \n     is difficult to separate fact from fiction.\n       Third, I have established myself as an expert in the field \n     of snowmobile emissions. I have attached my Curriculum Vitae \n     to this letter as documentation of my credentials and will be \n     happy to provide further documentation of my experience in \n     this area. My comments will be limited to the information \n     presented regarding snowmobile pollution. I do not have the \n     expertise necessary to comment as an ``expert'' on any other \n     issue regarding snowmobile use in the National Parks.\n       Fourth, I do not have access to all of the testimony given \n     at the hearings. I only have copies of the statements \n     prepared by the following individuals: Michael Scott, Kevin \n     Collins, Sean Smith, Mark Simonich, Donald Barry, Kim Rapp, \n     Michael Forsman, Jerry Johnson, and Teri Manning. Therefore, \n     my comments are limited to the testimony offered by these \n     individuals. While I can not comment on any information \n     presented by any other individual at this time, I would be \n     happy to do so if this information were provided to me.\n       The rest of this letter will simply outline information \n     related to pollution from snowmobiles contained in the above \n     testimonies that I find requires clarification or correction. \n     In each case, I will list direct quotes from testimonies in \n     italics. I will then reference the specific testimony in \n     parenthesis at the end of the quote. My response and \n     explanation will follow.\n\n\n                              i. testimony\n\n       ``Carbon monoxide levels in the (Yellowstone) park \n     currently exceed National Ambient Air Quality Standards and \n     will continue to be exceeded unless snowmobiles are \n     removed.'' Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, \n     Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n       ``It is their position (the Wyoming Department of \n     Environmental Quality) that there have been no documented \n     violations of the Clean Air Act within Yellowstone National \n     Park.

(Testimony of Kim Raap, Manager, Wyoming \n     State Trails Association)\n       ``The DEIS issued by the Park Service confuses data \n     collected for personal exposure measurements (50 ppm) to the \n     ambient air quality standards. The Montana Ambient Air \n     Quality Standard (MAAQS) 1 hour-maximum CO standard is 23 ppm \n     as monitored according to the standard. Let me clearly state, \n     air quality standards, both federal and the more stringent \n     Montana standards, have not been exceeded in Yellowstone \n     National Park. The DEIS incorrectly states that this \n     happened. While air quality did reach 90% of the Montana \n     standard last winter, the standard was not exceeded.'' \n     (Testimony of Mark Simonich, Director, Montana Department of \n     Environmental Quality)\n     Response\n       The testimony given by the Greater Yellowstone Coalition \n     (GYC) clearly contradicts the testimony of the Wyoming State \n     Trails Association (WSTA) and the Montana Department of \n     Environmental Quality (MDEQ). Who is correct? WSTA and MDEQ \n     are correct. There is no data to support the claim that \n     ambient air in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) is violating \n     National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQA) for carbon \n     monoxide (CO).\n       So, if NAAQS have not been violated in YNP, what is the \n     problem with emissions from snowmobiles in YNP? The problem \n     is that research conducted by both the National Park Service \n     (NPS) and me have shown that YNP employees and snowmobilers \n     can be exposed to high levels of CO. And, since the presence \n     of CO indicates a probable presence of hydrocarbon emissions, \n     the potential exists for significant air toxic exposure as \n     well.\n\n     NOTE. A comprehensive study of employees and visitor exposure \n     to pollution from snowmobiles is due to be published by Dr. \n     Norm Kado of the University of California at Davis in the \n     upcoming months. The information contained in this report is \n     not currently available to the public.\n     Explanation\n       The NAAQS for CO is 35 parts per million (ppm) for a one-\n     hour sampling period and 9 ppm for an eight-hour sampling \n     period. (The state of Montana one-hour CO standard is 23 ppm, \n     stricter than the federal standard.) A violation of NAAQS is \n     recorded if the standard is exceeded more than once in a \n     year.\n       In order for data to be used to determine compliance with \n     NAAQS, it must be collected according to standardized \n     sampling methods outline in The Code of Federal Regulations, \n     Title 40, Parts 53 and 58. Sampling locations must meet \n     proper siting criteria in order to assure that the data is \n     representative of ambient air. The sampling criteria include \n     placing the sampling probe at a height of approximately ten \n     feet and at a distance of at least seven to thirty feet \n     from the edge of the nearest traffic lane. Additionally, \n     the probe must be at least 33 feet from the nearest \n     intersection.\n       There is currently a properly sited and maintained CO \n     monitor located at the West Entrance to Yellowstone National \n     park, operated by the Montana Department of Environmental \n     Quality (MDEQ). And, while relatively high CO measurements \n     have been recorded by the MDEQ, they have never exceeded the \n     national or Montana standards.\n       So, why do some organizations believe that NAAQS have been \n     exceeded in Yellowstone National Park? The MDEQ testimony \n     explains this. Many organizations continue to confuse data \n     taken to determine personal exposure to snowmobile pollution \n     with data taken to determine degradation of ambient air.\n       CO samples have been taken by the park service (on the \n     roadway) at the West entrance to Yellowstone National Park \n     (YNP) and on the road between West Yellowstone and Old \n     Faithful. I have personally taken CO samples on the roadway \n     at Flagg Ranch, the south entrance to YNP. CO concentrations \n     collected on these roadways have reached levels in excess of \n     35 ppm for a 1-hour time period. However, data collected on a \n     roadway should not and can not be interpreted as indicative \n     of overall ambient air quality. It is only indicative of \n     personal exposure. It can not be used to determine compliance \n     with NAAQS.\n\n\n                              2. testimony\n\n       ``The highest carbon monoxide levels in the nation were \n     recorded at Yellowstone's West Entrance during winters in the \n     1990s.'' (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, \n     Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n     Response\n       This statement is false.\n     Explanation\n       As mentioned in the explanation of Testimony #1, the MDEQ \n     operates properly sited and maintained CO monitoring station \n     at the West Entrance of YNP. And, no state or federal \n     standards for CO have ever been exceeded at this location. \n     The location is classified by the Environmental protection \n     agency (EPA) as ``in attainment''.\n       As of August 10, 1999 the Environmental Protection Agency \n     lists 20 areas in the United States as Nonattainment areas \n     for CO pollution (this information can be found in the EPA \n     Green Book at http://www.epa.gov/oar/oaqps/greenbk/\ncnsum.html). These areas of the United States clearly have a \n     larger CO problem than does the West Entrance of Yellowstone \n     National Park.\n       NOTE: Perhaps this testimony refers to exposure data taken \n     at the West Entrance of Yellowstone. If so, this testimony \n     would still be false. There are instances of CO exposures \n     nationwide that exceed the CO exposure concentrations \n     measured at West Yellowstone and Flagg Ranch. In his text, \n     Automobiles and Pollution (Published by the Society of \n     Automotive Engineers, 1995), Paul Degobert states that ``up \n     to 250 ppm of CO can be\n\n[[Page S7098]]\n\n     found inside passenger compartments'' of automobiles. Again, \n     I must stress that is not appropriate to compare NAAQS data \n     to exposure data.\n\n\n                              3. testimony\n\n       ``One snowmobile emits 225 times more carbon monoxide than \n     an automobile. One snowmobile emits 1000 times more \n     hydrocarbons than an automobile.'' (Testimony of Michael D. \n     Scott, Program Director, Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n     Response\n       This statement is false.\n     Explanation\n       In February of this year, the National Park Service Air \n     Resources Division (NPS ARD) issued a report titled, ``air \n     Quality Concerns Related to Snowmobile Usage in National \n     Parks.'' Of this report, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition \n     (GYC) writes:\n       ``The final report was checked and validated by scientists \n     involved in the original research. That review, combined with \n     the depth and breadth of the studies (they began in 1995 and \n     covered emissions, ambient levels of pollutants, deposition \n     of pollutants in the snowpack, human exposure and more) make \n     the report the most comprehensive and credible assessment of \n     Yellowstone's air pollution to date.'' (GYX website, 6/2/00, \n     http://hosts2.in-tch.com/www.greateryellowstone.org/\nwintcruse.html)\n       I agree with the GYC assessment of the February 2000 NPS \n     ARD report.\n       The NPS ARD report estimates that ``a snowmobile operating \n     for 4 hours, using a conventional 2-stroke engine, can emit \n     between 10 and 70 times more carbon monoxide and between 45 \n     and 250 times more hydrocarbons than an automobile driven 100 \n     miles.'' These NPS ARD estimates are significantly different \n     than the estimates in the above GYC testimony.\n\n\n                              4. testimony\n\n       ``These (two-stroke) engines create dangerous levels of \n     airborne toxins including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, \n     ozone, particulate matter, aldehydes, 1,3 butadiene, and \n     extremely persistent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons \n     (PAHs).'' (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, \n     Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n       ``Nitrogen Oxides (NOX) and hydrocarbon emissions from \n     snowmobile two-cycle engines are also a major concern due to \n     their contribution to ground level ozone.'' (Testimony of \n     Sean Smith, Public Lands Director, Bluewater Network)\n     Response\n       While most of the pollutants listed above are emitted from \n     two-stroke engines, oxides of nitrogen (NOX) and \n     ozone are not pollutants of concern with respect to \n     snowmobile emissions.\n     Explanation\n        Two-cycle engines (including those used by \n     snowmobiles) emit less NOX than four-stroke \n     engines (including those used by automobiles).\n       The February 2000 NPS ARD report estimates that only 2% of \n     the NOX pollution in YNP comes from snowmobile \n     engines (with the remainder of the NOX pollution \n     coming from automobiles, busses, snow coaches, and \n     recreational vehicles). Although the NPS ARD report does not \n     compare the NOX emissions from an automobile to \n     the NOX emissions from a snowmobile, it does \n     contain the data necessary to make this comparison. I did the \n     calculations (using the same methodology used in the NPS ARD \n     report to compare automobile and snowmobile CO and UHC \n     emissions) and came up with the following: one automobile \n     emits 1.5 to 6.8 times as much NOX as one \n     snowmobile.\n       Low NOX emissions from snowmobile engines are \n     confirmed by emission data taken at the South West Research \n     Institute (summarized in the NPS ARD report) and also by \n     snowpack chemistry analysis performed by George Ingersoll of \n     the United States Geological Survey. Ingersoll's paper \n     titled, ``Snowpack Chemistry as an Indicator of Pollutant \n     Emission Levels from Motorized Winter Vehicles in Yellowstone \n     National Park'' (published at the Western Snow Conference in \n     1997) concludes ``that regional activities--not local \n     snowmachine traffic--seem to be controlling nitrate \n     deposition.''\n        Ozone, as the Bluewater Network testimony \n     correctly states, is not emitted by snowmobiles. Ozone is \n     formed via a photochemical reaction between NOX \n     and volatile organic compounds (VOCs are a specific class of \n     unburned hydrocarbons). While snowmobiles do emit a \n     significant amount of VOCs, NOX emissions from \n     snowmobiles are minimal (as explained previously).\n       Even when NOX are present in significant amounts \n     in areas frequented by snowmobiles (from regional sources) \n     the cold temperatures in which snowmobiles operate are not \n     conducive to ozone formation. ``Strong sunlight and hot \n     weather cause ground-level ozone to form in harmful \n     concentrations in the air'' (from Ozone: Good Up High, Bad \n     Nearby, EPA/451K-97-002, October 1997). Snowmobiles operate \n     at temperatures near freezing and below.\n       For the reasons listed above, significant ozone formation \n     due to pollution from snowmobiles is not a potential problem.\n\n\n                              5. TESTIMONY\n\n       ``Recent tests conducted by the SouthWest Research \n     Institute confirm that the two stroke engines of snowmobiles \n     emit hundreds of times more pollution than a modern \n     automobile.'' (Testimony of Sean Smith, Public Lands \n     Director, Bluewater Network)\n     Response\n       This statement can not be substantiated. The Southwest \n     Research Institute (SwRI) has not published the statistic \n     cited.\n     Explanation\n       The SwRI reports cited above only contain data on \n     snowmobile engine emissions. They do not contain a comparison \n     of snowmobile and automobile emissions.\n       In order to make the comparison between snowmobiles and \n     automobiles, one must make a series of assumptions regarding \n     snowmobile and automobile usage. The results of the \n     comparison are highly dependent upon the assumptions made.\n       The best estimates available that compare snowmobile and \n     automobile emissions are contained in the February 2000 NPS \n     ARD report. The NPS ARD report bases its calculations on the \n     SwRI data. As I stated before, the report estimates ``a \n     snowmobile operating for 4 hours, using a conventional 2-\n     stroke engine, can emit between 10 and 70 times more carbon \n     monoxide and between 45 and 250 times more hydrocarbons than \n     an automobile driven 100 miles.'' Additionally, \n     NOX emissions from automobiles are 1.5 to 6.8 \n     times greater than NOx emissions form snowmobiles.\n\n\n                              6. TESTIMONY\n\n       ``Given current levels of snowmobile use in Yellowstone \n     National Park, this (discharge of 25-30% of the fuel mixture \n     from a snowmobile engine) translates into the equivalent of \n     five tanker truck loads of gasoline being dumped along park \n     roads each winter.'' (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program \n     Director, Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n       ``Snowmobile emissions are deposited directly onto the \n     snowpack of the parks. This snowpack pollution translates \n     directly into pollution of the parks' waters as the snow \n     melts. Snowmobiles each year emit the equivalent of five \n     tanker truck loads onto the snowpack of Yellowstone.'' \n     (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, Greater \n     Yellowstone Coalition)\n       About 5000 gallons of gasoline and 250 quarts of 2 cycle \n     oil was spilled by National Park Service snowmobiles alone.'' \n     (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, Greater \n     Yellowstone Coalition)\n     Response\n       It is ludicrous to compare potential water quality impacts \n     from snowmobile emissions to the catastrophic environmental \n     devastation associated with a tanker spill.\n     Explanation\n       The fate and transport of pollutants in the environment is \n     a very complex field of study. However, it does not take a \n     scientist to realize that if most of the unburned fuel and \n     oil from snowmobiles is emitted in gaseous form (as air \n     pollution), the total hydrocarbon pollution emitted by \n     snowmobiles in YNP will not be found in the snowpack.\n       Only a percentage of the total snowmobile hydrocarbon \n     pollution is deposited onto the snowpack. George Ingersoll \n     (``Effects of snowmobile Use on Snowpack Chemistry in \n     Yellowstone National Park'', United States Geological Survey, \n     1998, Water Resources Investigations Report 99-4148) has \n     measured elevated levels of hydrocarbon pollution in \n     snowpacks near snowmobile use. However, he reported that \n     these elevated hydrocarbon levels ``were lower, in general, \n     than concentrations at hundreds of locations nationwide \n     representing a full spectrum of watershed settings ranging \n     from subalpine to urban.''\n       In his 1998 investigation, Ingersoll also performed a \n     preliminary analysis of snowmelt runoff in YNP. He concluded \n     that ``snowmelt runoff chemistry from five of the snow-\n     sampling sites indicated that elevated emission levels in \n     snow along highway corridors (used by snowmobiles in YNP) are \n     generally dispersed into surrounding watersheds at \n     concentrations below levels likely to threaten human or \n     ecosystem health.'' He also concluded that ``localized, \n     episodic acidification of aquatic ecosystems in these high \n     snowmobile-traffic areas may be possible, but verification \n     will require more detailed chemical analyses of snowmelt \n     runoff.''\n       Bottom line, the data shows some percentage of snowmobile \n     hydrocarbon emissions (the unburned fuel and oil) ends up in \n     snowpack along roadways. And, some percentage of this \n     snowpack pollution will later be found in the snowmelt (most \n     volatile organic compounds will tend to volatilize into the \n     gaseous phase during the spring melt-off). To date, no data \n     has been collected that shows snowmelt pollution from \n     snowmobiles at concentrations likely to threaten human or \n     ecosystem health. Only a potential for localized, episodic \n     acidification has been reported in the scientific literature. \n     Clearly, this potential, localized, episodic acidification \n     does not pose the same environmental risk as that of a tanker \n     spill in Park waters.\n\n     NOTE: I am aware that a more detailed investigation of water \n     quality impacts from snowmobiles was undertaken over the \n     winter of 1999-2000 in YNP. The results of this study may \n     provide new information regarding water quality impacts from \n     snowmobiles. However, a report on this research has not yet \n     been published and I do not have access to the raw data.\n\n\n                              7. Testimony\n\n       ``The components of snowpack pollution from snowmobile \n     emissions can include toxic compounds such as MTBE (a fuel \n     additive), and polycyclic acromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such \n     as benzene, xylene, toluene, and formaldehyde.'' (Testimony \n     of Michael D. Scott, Program Director, Greater Yellowstone \n     Coalition)\n     Responses\n       This is a true statement, but it requires clarification for \n     proper perspective.\n\n[[Page S7099]]\n\n     Explanation\n       The components of snowpack pollution from snowmobile \n     emissions can include the toxic compounds listed above. \n     However, the mere presence of a pollutant does not indicate \n     environmental degradation. The pollutant must also be present \n     at concentrations that are high enough to be of concern (even \n     oxygen can be considered a toxic compound at high \n     concentrations . . . but it does no harm to us at lower \n     concentrations). As described in the explanation for \n     Testimony #6, George Ingersoll (``Effects of Snowmobile Use \n     on Snowpack Chemistry in Yellowstone National Park'', United \n     States Geological Survey, 1998, Water Resources \n     Investigations Report 99-4148) did find elevated levels of \n     hydrocarbon pollution in snowpacks near snowmobile use. \n     However, he reported that these elevated hydrocarbon levels \n     ``were lower, in general, than concentration at hundreds of \n     locations nationwide representing a full spectrum of \n     watershed settings ranging from subalpine to urban.'' And his \n     preliminary research found that ``snowmelt runoff chemistry \n     from five of the snow-sampling sites indicated that elevated \n     emission levels in snow along highway corridors (used by \n     snowmobiles in YNP) are generally dispersed into surrounding \n     watersheds at concentrations below levels likely to threaten \n     human or ecosystem health.'' So, despite the fact that these \n     compounds can appear in the snowpack, they have not yet been \n     found in high enough concentrations to cause concern.\n\n\n                              8. Testimony\n\n       ``Unburned fuel (emitted by snowmobiles) contains many \n     toxic compounds including benzene, toluene, xylene, and the \n     extremely persistent suspected human carginogen MTBE (methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether).'' (Testimony of Michael D. Scott, \n     Program Director, the Greater Yellowstone Coalition)\n       ``Contaminants released by two-stroke snowmobile engines \n     include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and methyl \n     tertiary butyl ether (MTBE).'' (Testimony of Kevin Collins, \n     Legislative Representative, National Parks and Conservation \n     Association)\n     Response\n       These are true statements, but they require clarification \n     for proper perspective.\n     Explanation\n       Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) is a fuel additive that \n     is required in many areas to increase the oxygen content in \n     fuels. This is done in an effort to reduce hydrocarbon and \n     carbon monoxide pollution from automobiles and other mobile \n     sources. MTBE is also added to fuels (in smaller \n     concentrations) by some refineries to boost octane rating. \n     MTBE can only be emitted by snowmobiles if the fuel they are \n     burning contains MTBE as a additive. Snowmobile engines to \n     not ``manufacture'' MTBE.\n       The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency issued a press \n     release on January 18, 2000 that states ``gasoline in \n     Minnesota does not contain MTBE as an additive''. Therefore \n     snowmobiles in Minnesota (the site of Voyageurs National \n     Park) do not emit MTBE as a pollutant.\n       None of the other states with significant National Park \n     snowmobile usage (Michigan-Pictured Rocks, Montana-\n     Yellowstone, and Wyoming-Grand Tetlon and Yellowstone) \n     require the use MTBE as an oxygenate in fuel. Fuels in these \n     states are oxygenated with ethanol, if oxygenated fuels are \n     being used to curb air pollution (as in West Yellowstone, \n     Montana). However, the states of Michigan, Wyoming, and \n     Montana do allow the use of MTBE as an octane booster. \n     Therefore, it is probable that some percentage of the fuel \n     sold in these states does contain MTBE.\n       A fact sheet on MTBE from the Michigan Department of \n     Environmental Quality (available at http://www/\ndeq.state.mi.us/std.mtbe.html) reports that a 1998 survey of \n     Michigan fuel revealed that five percent of the fuel sampled \n     in Michigan contained MTBE. I have not located any statistics \n     on the amount of MTBE added as an octane booster to Montana \n     and Wyoming.\n\n     NOTE: MTBE has been detected in the snowpack along snowmobile \n     traffic corridors in Yellowstone National Park (George \n     Ingersoll, 1998 study previously cited), indicating that some \n     of the fuel sold in Montana and Wyoming does, in fact, \n     contain MTBE concentrations found in the snowpack were not \n     high enough to cause concern.\n\n\n                              9. testimony\n\n       ``While we are fully supportive of the development of \n     cleaner and quieter (snowmobile) technology, to date, there \n     are no definitive, comprehensive studies which document the \n     degree to which four-stroke engines will mitigate the adverse \n     impact that snowmobiles have on our parks.'' (Testimony of \n     Donald J. Barry, Assistant Secretary, Fish Wildlife and \n     Parks, Department of the Interior.\n     Response\n       This is a true statement. However, in September of this \n     year I will be publishing information about snowmobile \n     emission and noise reductions that were attained with the use \n     of a four-stroke engine. The information is summarized below.\n     Explanation\n       As the organizer and co-founder of the Society of \n     Automotive Engineers Clean Snowmobile Challenge 2000 (a non-\n     partisan student design competition to improve snowmobile \n     emissions and noise) I offer the following results as a \n     glimpse at what is possible in a short amount of time, using \n     existing technology. In doing so, I do not attempt to define \n     what emissions or noise levels are appropriate in National \n     Parks. I am simply reporting what has been documented as an \n     easily implemented improvement over the status-quo.\n       The University at Buffalo, State University of New York, \n     won the SAE CSC2000 with a four-stroke snowmobile that was \n     designed and manufactured in less than 5 months by a team of \n     undergraduate engineering students. When compared to a \n     traditional two-stroke snowmobile, the four stoke entry \n     reduced hydrocarbon emissions by more than 99.5% (NOTE: We \n     could not detect the snowmobile's hydrocarbon emissions. The \n     99.5% reduction cited represents the limit of detectability \n     of the test method). Carbon monoxide emissions were reduced \n     by 46%. Fuel economy was increased to 27.6 miles per gallon \n     (a 226% improvement). The sound level (measured 50 feet from \n     the road at wide open throttle) measured just 66.8 dbA. This \n     sound level reduction corresponds to an 80-90% reduction in \n     the distance snowmobiles can currently be heard in National \n     Parks.\n       Detailed information on the SAE CSC2000 is currently \n     available on the competition website at: http://www.sae.org/\nstudents/snow.htm. The results will also be available in a \n     peer-reviewed paper I am writing, scheduled for publication \n     on September 11, 2000.\n       Thank you, Representative Hansen, for the time you have \n     taken to read this lengthy letter. I will be happy to answer \n     any questions you or other Subcommittee members might have \n     and provide further documentation of the facts contained in \n     this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lori M. Fussell.\n\n\n                     SNOWMOBILING IN NATIONAL PARKS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nthis important discussion concerning the National Park Service's recent \nproposal to substantially curb recreational snowmobile use within the \nnational park system.\n  I believe that virtually everyone can agree that snowmobile use in \nnational parks must be carefully managed in a manner which balances \nlegitimate recreational needs with a concern for public safety and \nenvironmental protection. Nobody argues that snowmobiles should be \nallowed in every area of every park and without regard for noise, speed \nor numbers. But at the same time, snowmobiling is a recreational option \nthat should not be totally banned or limited in an unreasonable manner.\n  I appreciate that the National Park Service has now ``clarified'' its \nearlier statements which created the impression that an across-the-\nboard ban on snowmobiles in all parts of all parks was about to be \nestablished. The Park Service tells us that rather than a ban, it wants \nto curtail snowmobile use on park lands.\n  I will follow this new approach carefully. Again, few South Dakotans \nhave objections to reasonable rules designed to protect the \nenvironment, protect wildlife habitat and address issues of noise, \nsafety and numbers. But regulations to properly address these matters \ndo not require a total ban or draconian limitations on snowmobile use. \nI will urge the National Park Service to listen to all segments of the \nAmerican public in a careful, thoughtful manner and seek to strike a \nsensible balance that will protect our natural heritage but also allow \nfor reasonable and well-managed winter recreation opportunities for all \nour citizens. It certainly would be better for the National Park \nService to administratively arrive at balanced final rules, than to \nnecessitate legislative action on the part of Congress. If legislation \nis ultimately required on this matter, I will work with both my House \nand Senate colleagues in a bipartisan manner to secure a balanced final \nresolution of this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Friday morning, July 12th, the House of \nRepresentatives passed the Valles Caldera Preservation Act by a vote of \n377-45, and it will soon be signed by the President.\n  Later this month, the Secretary of Agriculture will take possession \nof the Baca ranch. He will be charged with the task of managing the \nValles Caldera National Preserve for an interim period until the Trust \nis appointed.\n  In order for the Preserve to be opened to the public at the earliest \npossible time, the Secretary and the Trust will have to complete a \nsubstantial inventory, put together interim plans, and provide for the \nimmediate requirements of basic public safety and law enforcement.\n  The Department of Agriculture has provided us with a breakdown of \nproposed activities over the next year, and estimates that they will \nneed about\n\n[[Page S7100]]\n\n$990,000 to prepare the Preserve for an eager public, over half of \nwhich will go into planning and law enforcement activities.\n  Once the Trust takes over, hopefully in about 6 months, funds will \ntransfer to them, so that they can take over management \nresponsibilities for the Preserve.\n  The $990,000 will be taken out of the budget of the Department of the \nInterior Solicitor's office, the bureaucrat who recently issued an \nopinion to federalize several reclamation projects in New Mexico.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, each year I carefully review the annual \nInterior appropriations bill to analyze how the Federal Government is \nmeeting its fiscal obligations and priorities to protect our nation's \nresources and provide needed funding for Native American programs. I \ncommend the Interior subcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton, and the \nranking member, Senator Byrd, for their hard work in completing this \nyear's funding recommendations that will provide critical funding for \nNational Parks, energy programs, the Indian Health Service, and the \nother resource management responsibilities within the Department of \nInterior.\n  Unfortunately, the appropriations committee has also continued the \nirresponsible practice of loading up an important bill such as this one \nwith unrequested, low-priority earmarks and legislative riders. This \nInterior appropriations bill has once again become the target for \nmembers to tack on parochial spending for their own special interest \nprojects. In this bill, I found nearly $280 million for porkbarrel \nspending projects, a level that is unacceptably higher than previous \nyears.\n  This type of unnecessary and low-priority spending is particularly \negregious since each agency within the Department of Interior is \nstruggling to meet its statutory responsibilities to protect our \nnation's parks, wildlife refuges and trust obligations to Native \nAmericans. These agencies all report exceptionally large, multimillion \nbacklogs for maintenance and repairs. Yet, instead of directing funding \nto substantially eradicate these backlogs, the appropriations committee \ninstead chooses to divert federal spending toward locale-specific \nearmarks that either were not included in the budget request, increase \nfunding above the requested level for other specific projects, or fund \nunauthorized projects.\n  I recognize that various communities around the country look to the \nfederal government to help protect them against wildfire threats or set \naside funding to preserve open space to build parks for their children. \nMany of the projects in this bill will no doubt address some of these \nimportant needs and are deserving of federal investments. However, I \nfail to understand why it is necessary to load up this bill with \nerroneous earmarks that appear to pander more to special interests \nrather than address our highest resource management needs. I believe \nthat we should abide by our established budget procedures by allocating \nfederal assistance to those projects that undergo a normal, merit-based \nprioritization process that protects the interests of the American \ntaxpayer, and employs the most cost-effective approach.\n  While individually, the amounts earmarked for these projects may not \nseem substantial, collectively they add up to unmitigated pork. Where \ndoes some of this pork go?\n  An increase of $600,000 is included for the Alaska Sealife Center for \nan eider recovery research program, a center which already received \nsupplemental funding in the recently passed Military Construction \nconference agreement. Other locale-specific earmarks include $200,000 \nfor a direct pass-through grant to Long Live the Lings to coordinate \nthe various hatchery managers and governmental jurisdictions in \nWashington state; $500,000 to continue with the retrofit of the \nresearch vessel (the R/V) Sturgeon) for use by the Great Lakes Science \nCenter; $5,000,000 for maintenance and snow removal on the Beartooth \nHighway; and, an increase of $500,000 above the requested level for the \nSmithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) to begin construction of a \nbase facility at Hilo, Hawaii in conjunction with the SAO Submillimeter \nArray initiative.\n\n  These projects may be important to the local communities for which \nthey are targeted, but are they really the highest national priorities? \nAre these projects fundamental to carrying out the resource management \nfunctions of the Interior Department? Unfortunately, it matters little \nsince I, nor the majority of my colleagues, had any input about whether \nfunding these projects is the wisest and best use of Federal dollars.\n  We further abandon our budget principles by funding projects that \nhave not been authorized by Congress. For example, the proposed \nWheeling National Heritage Area in West Virginia has been the recipient \nof an annual earmark for the past several years, including a \nrecommendation for a $500,000 earmark in this bill. While this does not \nappear to be problematic, what is not well known is that this \nparticular heritage area has not yet been authorized by Congress. This \nflies directly in the face of the statement by the Interior \nappropriations committee which specifically pointed out that it would \nnot fund projects unless Congress authorized them. Again, this project \nitself is not necessarily objectionable to me and may have good reason \nto be funded. But what is appalling is that these funds are \nspecifically earmarked for a project not yet authorized, thereby \nclearly sidestepping a process that other heritage area projects are \nexpected to adhere to in order to receive federal assistance.\n  It is also alarming to find, buried in this bill, a specific earmark \nof two million dollars to the Sealaska Corporation to develop an \nethanol manufacturing facility in Alaska, the purpose of which is \nintended to support a declining timber industry in the Alaska region. \nTo further assist these impacted communities in Alaska, an additional \nfive million earmark is provided for a three year timber supply for the \nTongass National Forest, language added securing preferential treatment \nof Alaska's surplus red cedar for sales abroad, and hundreds of \nthousands more are directed to other forest management activities to \nbenefit the Alaskan region.\n  I admit that I am not an authority on the matters affecting local \ncommunities in Alaska. However, what I take particular exception to is \nthe fact that this earmark benefits the ethanol industry, a fiscal \nboondoggle industry that already reaps substantial benefits from \nexisting federal subsidies at the expense of taxpayers. It is a blatant \ninsult to taxpayers to ask them to supplement the ethanol industry even \nmore by spending two million to build one ethanol manufacturing \nfacility for a region that is receiving more than adequate fiscal \nattention.\n  With the many identified priorities stated by the subcommittee \nmembers, such as addressing wildfire emergencies and health care for \nNative Americans, little to no information is provided as to why \ncertain organizations are deserve of direct earmarks, such as $176,000 \nfor the Kawerak Reindeer Herders Association, and one million for the \nNational Conservation Training Center. With no information to explain \nthe national importance of these programs, I find it troubling that the \nsubcommittee tends to specifically favor certain organizations for \nfunding when these organizations should also be subjected to a \ncompetitive and merit-review process.\n  As I stated before, there is undoubtably considerable merit to some \nof the programs for which funding is earmarked in this bill. However, \nuntil Congress ends the typical arbitrary spending which violates the \nintegrity of the federal budget process, I have no choice but to \nhighlight the practice of adding and earmarking funds for programs and \nactivities that appear to serve narrowly tailored interests at the \nexpense of the national interest.\n  Even in this time of an unprecedented budget surplus, we have a \nresponsibility to the American public to exercise fiscal responsibility \nand discretion rather than allowing this type of unchecked spending to \ncontinue. It is shameful the way we are squandering the public's trust \nand money, and it will be the burden of the taxpayers to shell out the \n$280 million for needless and wasteful spending included in this bill.\n  The list of objectionable provisions in this bill that I compiled is \nmore than 19 pages long and is unfortunately too lengthy to print in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S7101]]\n\nHowever, the list is available from my Senate office.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman, Snowe, Jeffords, Leahy and Torricelli in offering \nan amendment to the Interior Appropriations for FY 2001. Our amendment \nwould provide $4 million in funding for the maintenance of a Northeast \nHome Heating Oil Reserve, with an offset of $3 million from the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) Petroleum account and $1 million from \nthe Naval Petroleum and Oil Shales Account.\n  This amendment is critically important to the people of Connecticut \nand throughout the Northeast because most homes and many schools and \nbusinesses rely on oil for heating. Last winter, the Northeast region \nwas gripped by cold weather and skyrocketing oil prices.\n  Last week, the President issued a directive to establish a heating \noil reserve in the Northeast by exchanging crude oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve for 2 million barrels of heating oil to be stored \nacross the Northeast. In addition, the Secretary of Energy transmitted \na permanent plan that must lay before Congress for 60 days. Our \namendment would fund the maintenance of that reserve and we will \ncontinue to work with the members of the Energy Committee to authorize \na trigger that is appropriate to the Northeast situation.\n  Mr. President, with increased demand for gasoline and refineries at \nor near capacity, experts agree that heating oil stocks will remain low \ngoing into the winter season. Even now, the heating oil stocks are more \nthan 60 percent lower than last year. The writing is on the wall.\n  This amendment will mean that the heating oil reserve will be \nmaintained. Heating oil will be stored within the Northeast. Residents \nof my state need not have to choose among filling their oil tanks, \nputting food on the table, paying for their medication or paying the \nrent or mortgage.\n  I thank my colleagues, especially Chairman Gorton and Senator Byrd \nfor their interest in this amendment and I urge its immediate \nacceptance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, Today I want to express my support for \nthe NEA which plays an important role in preserving our culture and is \nfunded in this bill.\n  The bill before us provides $105 million for the NEA, an increase of \n$7.3 million over FY 2000. This is of vital importance to the survival \nof the arts in both California and in the United States. National \ninterest in the arts continues to increase. The number of artists in \nAmerica has more than doubled since 1970. Today, the arts industry \nsupports nearly 1.3 million jobs nationally; 391,200 indirectly, and \n908,800 directly.\n  Despite this growth, the United States still spends nearly 50 times \nless on the arts than in any other countries: While the U.S. spends \n$6.00 per person on the arts, the United Kingdom spends $26.00; France \nspends $57.00; Finland spends up to $91.00.\n  In 1999, NEA funded projects in every county in the state of \nCalifornia, awarding 210 grants totaling $5.6 million. To date, in FY \n2000, the NEA has provided 225 grants in California, totaling $7.3 \nmillion.\n  Here are three examples of how the National Endowment for the Arts \nhelps preserve our national cultural heritage.\n  This year, the NEA awarded a grant to the City of San Diego \nCommission for Arts and Culture to support the Living Traditions \nInitiative. Living Traditions teaches a wide array of skills in music, \ndance, language arts, history, folklore, crafts and visual arts though \nclasses, publications, recordings and the broadcast media.\n  In 1999, the NEA funded a collaborative project of the Brooklyn, New \nYork, Historical Society to increase public access to visual materials \ndocumenting Prospect Park, the location of the 1776 Battle of Long \nIsland, the first major conflict between the Continental and British \nArmies in North America, following the signing of the Declaration of \nIndependence. The project will increase a historic image database, \nproduce a guide for the database and make it Internet accessible.\n  In 1999, the NEA funded Documentary Arts, Inc. of Dallas, Texas, to \nsupport a series of films that explore the complexity of American life \nthrough the spoken word and community-based sounds of folk artists \nacross the country.\n  Preserving national and community culture is one way to encourage \npatriotism and a sense of community that can help combat the apathy \nthat keeps people from actively involving themselves in the daily life \nof their community.\n  The NEA can be a force to engage the imagination. The NEA funds arts \neducation for children, such as these:\n  The Magic Theater in San Francisco, promotes the Young California \nWriters Project, an educational program designed to support young \nplaywrights.\n  Class Act is a music education program in Orange County, California, \nelementary and middle schools supported by NEA.\n  Stagebridge in Oakland, California, provides a literacy program for \nboth children and adults.\n  The National Book Foundation does literary outreach to link leading \nauthors with underserved communities throughout the country. For \nexample, American Voices brings established writers to American Indian \nreservations nationwide and conducts a summer writing camp for inner-\ncity teens and adults.\n  The MoveSpeakSpin program in Santa Cruz, California uses dance \neducation activities as a tool in teaching curriculum subjects in math \nand science, subjects which often are difficult for children to learn.\n  Given the demands on our school budgets in California, many school \ndistricts in California were forced to cut funding for music and art \nprograms from their schools' curriculums. NEA funding in the schools \nhelps assure that our children will still have access to arts \neducation.\n  Additionally, students who participate in the arts do notably better \non standardized testing. Research from the 1995-1997 College Entrance \nExamination Board shows that students who studied the arts scored an \naverage of 83 points higher than non-art students on the SAT.\n  Arts can also provide a constructive outlet for young people. A \nthree-year research study of YouthARTS, funded by the NEA and the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice in 1999, demonstrated that arts programs help \ndecrease youth delinquency. Several NEA-funded projects have \ndemonstrated this:\n\n  NEA awarded a grant to the Richmond Art Center in California to \nsupport expansion of the ``Art Reach'' program for at-risk youths in \nWest Contra Costa County.\n  Creative Links: Positive Alternatives for Youth funds residency \nprojects across the nation in which young people work with artists \nafter school and during the summer. Programs are supported through arts \norganizations, community centers, low-income housing projects, tribal \ncommunities and juvenile facilities.\n  By encouraging at-risk teens to express themselves through art \ninstead of antisocial behavior, the NEA can help deter delinquency.\n\n  For much of American history, art has been considered to be a \n``luxury'' of the elite. Through traveling programs and other outreach \nprograms, the NEA has made art accessible for Americans in all corners \nof the nation and to all economic strata. Here are some examples in \nCalifornia:\n  The Rural Journeys Project, run partially by Independent Eye, Ltd. in \nSebastopol provides residencies that offer performances from the \nrepertoire and workshops to rural communities nationally.\n  A grant to the Humboldt Arts Council in Humboldt supports a \nconsortium of multi disciplinary arts workshops and activities to \nrural, low-income populations.\n  A Fresno Arts Council program compiles and assesses data on the \nstate's artistic resources, including identification of traditional \nartists, and the creation of a database and report on artistic \nresources and needs.\n  NEA has opened up the artistic world to the visually and audibly \nimpaired.\n  Deaf West Theater Company in North Hollywood supports a multi-\ndisciplinary production of ``Oliver,'' the musical, and production \nworkshops in schools that serve deaf and disadvantaged youth.\n  ARTREACH, Inc. of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, creates a Cultural \nAccess Guide for the Disabled for the\n\n[[Page S7102]]\n\nGreater Philadelphia region. The guide describes architecture and art \nfor the physically disabled, blind, deaf, and hard of hearing \npopulations to cultural venues.\n  Many private organizations which fund art base their grants on the \nprofitability of an artist or on their organizations' goals. The NEA \ngives special attention to underrepresented groups. Here are two \nexamples:\n  The NEA-funded Women's Philharmonic supports women conductors and \nmusic directors in leading national orchestras.\n  The San Francisco group, American Indian Contemporary Arts, with NEA \nfunding, mounts thematic exhibitions of contemporary Native American \nartists' work.\n  Art is a ``language'' which crosses lines of race, ethnicity, \nculture, age, education, geography, and disability. Many of the \nprojects which the NEA funds promote an understanding of our nation's \ndiverse heritage:\n  The Hmong Cultural Arts, Crafts, Teaching & Museum project in \nCalifornia provides instruction in Hmong Pa Dao embroidery and \ninstruction in the ancient musical instruments of Kheng and Xee Xo.\n  The Lake Tahoe Arts Project produces the Ballet Folclorico do Brasil\n  The American Musical Theater of San Jose produces ``Musicals in the \nNeighborhood,'' multi-lingual musical performances that focuses on \nuniversal themes.\n  Supporting arts representing different cultures is especially \nimportant to my state, the state with the most diverse population in \nthe nation. Currently, California has 12 percent of the total \npopulation in the United States, 33 percent of the Hispanic population, \n37 percent of the Asian/Pacific Islanders population, 7 percent of the \nAfrican-American population, and 13 percent of the American Indian \npopulation. California is the true melting pot. By funding arts which \nexpress many cultures, the NEA helps to foster cultural understanding \namong these many groups.\n  The NEA provides Americans with valuable cultural programs, with an \nimpact far beyond art. Through its work, the NEA has made great \ncontributions to preserving American culture, educating American \ncitizens, and assuring equal access to the arts and arts funding. To \ncontinue reaping these benefits, we must continue to support the NEA.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, with final passage of the Fiscal Year 2001 \nInterior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, I wish to take a \nmoment to thank all Senators for their time and effort in helping to \nmake this important measure a better product. As I have frequently \nnoted, crafting the Interior bill is not an easy charge. Weighing the \nthousands of Member requests that come in to the Interior subcommittee \nagainst the limited resources made available to us is an arduous task, \nindeed.\n  Yet, this year, as in past years, that job has been handled with \ngreat skill by the subcommittee chairman, Senator Gorton. My friend \nfrom Washington is, I can say unequivocally, the best subcommittee \nchairman I have ever had the pleasure of working with. His dedication \nto duty, his graciousness under fire, and his commitment to working \nwith me in a bipartisan manner are simply unparalleled. Moreover, the \nfact that this legislation will be adopted by the Senate by an \noverwhelming vote is testament, I believe, to the incredible job done \nby the distinguished subcommittee chairman.\n  Let me also extend my appreciation to all subcommittee staff, in \nparticular, Bruce Evans, who serves Senator Gorton in an efficient and \ncapable manner. And, on the minority side, I wish to offer a special \nthanks to Peter Kiefhaber. Although this young man has been on my staff \nfor more than eight years, this is his first year working for the \nAppropriations Committee. In the span of less than 6 months, he has \nworked hard, distinguishing himself not only to me, but obviously to \nother Members of the Senate, who have told me personally of his good \nwork.\n  Finally, let me again thank all Senators and say that I look forward \nto working with the subcommittee chairman as we proceed to conference \nwith the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for the yeas and nays on final passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendments and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read \nthe third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Coverdell) \nis absent due to illness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendment, requests a conference with the House, and the Chair \nappoints Mr. Gorton, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nHollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kohl, and Mrs. Feinstein conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, at the closing of this bill, this is one \nmore opportunity for me to thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for his \nguidance, cooperation, and many courtesies in moving this bill through \nto final passage. He has been very complimentary of me. I can simply \nsay that much or most of what I have learned about managing a bill I \nhave learned from the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and I \nhope he regards me as an apt pupil.\n  I also thank his staff for all of their hard work. The minority \nclerk, Peter Kiefhaber, who is new to this job, has been a tremendous \nasset to the subcommittee and has been a forceful advocate for Members \non his side of the aisle. Peter has been ably assisted by Carole \nGeagley of the minority staff, and by Scott Dalzell, who has been with \nus on detail from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  My own subcommittee staff has also had the benefit of an agency \ndetailee--Sheila Sweeney from the Forest Service. Sheila has kept her \ngood humor even while struggling to track the thousands of Member \nrequests that the subcommittee receives from Members of this body. We \nhave enjoyed having her with us. She has been extremely productive.\n  The subcommittee professional staff on my side has done yeoman work: \nGinny James, Leif Fonnesbeck, Joe\n\n[[Page S7103]]\n\nNorrell, and Christine Drager, who is in her first year with the \nsubcommittee. All have contributed to making the passage of this bill a \nrelatively smooth process, something I think speaks well of their \ndedication, professionalism, and knowledge of the programs and issues \nin this bill.\n  Finally, of course, there is my chief subcommittee aide, Bruce Evans, \nwho has guided this bill in each of the years that I have worked on it. \nI could not possibly have any better staff. I am certain that no Member \nof the Senate has better, more dedicated, or more effective staff in \nseeking passage of a particular bill.\n\n  I also thank Kari Vander Stoep of my own personal staff for her \noutstanding work on the issues in this bill that are of particular \nimportance to the people of the State of Washington.\n  As many hours as we put in here on the floor, each of these \nindividuals has spent that multiplied by 10 in late nights and early \nmornings, in literally months of putting the bill together. They are \nlikely to do exactly the same as we go through to the conference \ncommittee and final adoption of the bill.\n  I express my gratitude for their good work and the appreciation, I am \nsure, of Senator Byrd and of the Senate as a whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7103-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7103-S7104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment that I have offered to this \npiece of legislation is a freestanding bill, S. 2005, the Installment \nTax Collection Act of 2000.\n  Basically, it allows small businesses or farms that sell their \nbusinesses on the installment plan to pay their capital gains taxes as \nthey receive the money. Right now, they are required to pay the capital \ngains taxes in one lump sum. In other words, in some cases, when \nproperties are sold, they even have to borrow the money to pay the \ncapital gains up front.\n  It is no cutback in revenue to the Government. We just receive the \nmoney whenever the owners receive their payments for their property.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the next amendment \nis Senator Hollings' amendment.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, do you want to make $1 million? Do you \nwant to become a millionaire? All you have to do is find the surplus \nthat is in the headlines.\n  This morning, USA Today said ``surplus doubles.''\n  That crowd knows how to write, but they do not know how to read.\n  I have the Congressional Budget Office report that they quoted. On \npage 17, the debt goes from $5.617 trillion to $6.370 trillion. The \ndebt is going up. The surplus is going down.\n  I thought maybe they had gotten it from the President's midyear \nreview just given 2 weeks ago. Of course, you know how they mix these \nthings up. The last page tells the truth. On page 23, President Clinton \nfinds that the debt goes up to $1 trillion--no surplus. The debt \nincreases.\n  I then go to the public debt to the penny. Call up Treasury. They \ngive this out every day. You find how the debt goes up.\n  What they are trying to do is increase the debt with this $248 \nbillion.\n  I am for paying down the debt.\n  Vote for the amendment if you are for paying down the debt, please.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will support the Hollings amendment to \nstrike the tax cuts proposed in this legislation and devote those funds \nto reduction of the national debt.\n  I supported and would prefer the Democratic proposal to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty in the Tax Code. I voted for the Democratic plan and \nhad it passed would not have supported the Hollings amendment. However, \nsince the Democratic alternative to the pending bill was defeated \nyesterday by a 46-50 vote, and since the Republican bill would cost a \nwasteful $40 billion a year, reflecting the wrong priorities, I will \nsupport the Hollings amendment to better use those funds to pay down \nthe national debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, evidently the proponent of the amendment \ndoes not believe any marriage tax relief is in order.\n  Let me say that I find this position to be incredible. The Federal \nGovernment is taking a record level of the economy in revenue over 20 \npercent. The Federal take has not been this high since World War II.\n  Income taxes have doubled since the Clinton administration came to \noffice. Clearly, it is the taxpayers--especially America's hard-working \nfamilies--who have caused the surplus.\n  This bill returns less than 3 percent of the non-Social Security \nsurplus to virtually every married couple in the country. Both \nRepublicans and Democrats agree that marriage tax relief is an \nappropriate use of the non-Social Security surplus. We differ on how \nthe relief is delivered.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject Senator Hollings' amendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask consent that immediately following the \nreconvening at 2:15, there be 5 minutes for the managers or their \ndesignees for closing remarks, to be followed immediately by a vote on \npassage of H.R. 4810.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3881\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do have brief remarks before the vote on \nthe next amendment. Are we ready to proceed to that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes for debate, equally \ndivided. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the amendment we have before us will return \nto the text of the committee-reported bill. If this amendment is agreed \nto, we will then be voting on a clean marriage penalty relief bill with \nthe exact text that was reported from the Finance Committee. It is a \nsimple vote. It is a simple choice. Last night the Senate did accept \nsome amendments on several issues that are not relevant to marriage \npenalty relief, several of them on voice vote, perhaps a couple of them \nalong the way on recorded votes.\n  Some of them are good amendments. We will have another opportunity to \nvote for them or have them included in other legislation. They are good \nideas that deserve to be on another bill. This bill is about tax relief \nfor married couples and about eliminating the marriage penalty when a \ncouple gets married, so I urge my colleagues to support cleaning up the \nbill so we can pass a clean marriage penalty bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me explain to the body what the Lott \namendment does. If you voted in favor of the Durbin-Bond amendment to \ngive full deductibility of insurance premiums to self-employed small \nbusinesses and farmers, the Lott amendment eliminates that vote. If you \nvoted with Senator Torricelli of New Jersey for lead screening under \nMedicaid to protect children, the Lott amendment eliminates that. If \nyou voted with Senator Torricelli on special provisions in Medicare for \nthose suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease, the Lott amendment \neliminates that. If you voted with Senator Burns to change business \naccounting to make it more fair to small businesses, the Lott amendment \neliminates it.\n  This is done over and over in the House of Representatives by the \nRules Committee. It clears the deck of all the activity and progress we \nhave made. It is an effort to make a tabula rasa the last amendment of \nthe day. If you believe the amendments we voted for are worth standing \nbehind, I urge you to vote ``no'' on the Lott amendment.\n  Mr. CRAIG.

The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we are poised to approve the Marriage Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2000. This is a great victory for the \nAmerican family--all America's families. It is not one that has been \nwon, as much as it has been earned.\n  This bill is the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the tax \noverpayment by American families. It is fair, it is responsible, it is \nthe right thing to do for American families. And it is long overdue \nthat they receive it.\n  The provisions in this bill will help over 45 million families. That \nis virtually every family in the U.S. Some of my colleagues have argued \nthat almost half of those families--21 million families located in \nevery state in this country--do not deserve any tax relief. I reject \nthat argument. I reject it because in my home state of Delaware it \nwould mean leaving over 30,000 families that contributed to our ever-\ngrowing budget surplus out of family tax relief.\n  All of these American families have contributed to the record surplus \nthat we have in Washington. They deserve to get some of it back. I \nbelieved that\n\n[[Page S7105]]\n\nthree months ago when I first unveiled this package. And I believe it \neven more so today with the new numbers released by the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  Today's bill amounts to just 3 percent of the total budget surplus \nover the next five years. It amounts to just 8 percent of the total \nnon-Social Security surplus over the next five years. That is less than \na dime on the dollar of American's tax overpayment. By any comparison \nor estimation, this marriage tax relief is fiscally responsible.\n  I would ask those who oppose this family tax relief: Just how big \nwill America's budget surplus have to get before America's families \ndeserve to receive some of their tax dollars back? If not now, when? if \n8 percent of just the overpayment is too big a refund, how little \nshould it be? How long do they have to wait? How hard do they have to \nwork? How large an overpayment do they have to make?\n  This bill is fair. We have addressed the three largest sources of \nmarriage tax penalties in the tax code--the standard deduction, the \nrate brackets, and the earned income credit. And we have done so in a \nway that does not create any new penalties--any new disincentives in \nthe tax code. We have ensured that a family with one stay-at-home \nparent is not treated worse for tax purposes than a family where both \nparents work outside the home. This is an important principle because \nthese are important families.\n  Despite the red flags thrown up by those who want to stand in the way \nof marriage tax relief, this bill actually makes the tax code more \nprogressive. Families with incomes under $100,000 pay less than 50 \npercent of the total federal taxes; yet under our bill, these same \nfamilies receive substantially more than 50 percent of the benefits.\n  I do not understand how people can claim that this bill is tilted \ntowards the rich. I believe that the real complaint of those who oppose \nthis bill is not that it is tilted towards the rich--because it is \nnot--but because it is tilted away from Washington. As a result, some \nof America's tax overpayment will flow back to America's families.\n  Mr. President, it is time for us to act. Families across America are \nwaiting for us to make good on our promise. They are waiting for us to \nreturn some of this record surplus to them. Let's approve the Marriage \nTax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 and let's divorce the marriage \ntax penalty from the tax code once and for all.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the current tax code is at war with our \nvalues--the tax code penalizes the basic social institution: marriage. \nThe American people know that this is unfair--they know it is not right \nthat the code penalizes marriage. I commend the Senate on the vote we \nare going to take today to end this long-standing problem.\n  Twenty-five million American couples pay an average of approximately \n$1,400 in marriage penalty annually as a result of the marriage \npenalty. Ending this penalty gives couples the freedom to make their \nown choices with their money. Couples could use the $1,400 for: \nretirement, education, home, children's needs.\n  This bill will also provide needed tax relief to American families--\n39 million American married couples, 830,000 in Missouri. Couples like \nBruce and Kay Morton, from Camdenton, MO, who suffer from this unfair \npenalty. Mr. Morton wrote me a note so simple that even a Senator could \nunderstand it: ``Please vote yes for the Marriage Tax relief of 2000.''\n  Another Missourian, Travis Harms, of Independence, Missouri, wrote to \ntell me that the marriage penalty hits him and his wife, Laura. Mr. \nHarms graciously offered me his services in ending the marriage \npenalty. ``I would like to thank you for your support and effort \ntowards the elimination of the unfair `marriage tax.' If there is any \nway I can support or encourage others to help this dream become a \nreality, I would be honored to help.''\n  I am grateful to Travis Harms and Bruce Morton for their support. And \nI want to repay them by making sure we end this unfair penalty on \nmarriage.\n  The marriage penalty places an undue burden on American families. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of \ntheir family budget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. The tax bill should not be the biggest bill families \nlike the Morton's and Harms' face.\n  And families certainly should not be taxed extra because they are \nmarried. Couples choosing marriage are making the right choice for \nsociety. It is in our interest to encourage them to make this choice.\n  Unfortunately, the marriage penalty discourages this choice. The \nmarriage penalty may actually contribute to one of society's most \nserious and enduring problems. There are now twice as many single \nparent households in America than there were when this penalty was \nfirst enacted.\n  In its policies, the government should uphold the basic values that \ngive strength and vitality to our culture. Marriage and family are a \ncornerstone of civilization, but are heavily penalized by the federal \ntax system.\n  The marriage penalty is so patently unfair no one will defend it. \nThose on the other side of the aisle are making a stab at addressing \nthe marriage penalty, even though they are not willing to provide \nrelief to all couples who face this unfair penalty. Their bill \nimplements a choose or lose system for some couples who are subject to \nthe marriage penalty. Their bill phases out marriage penalty relief, \nand does not cover all of the couples who face this unfair penalty.\n  This issue, however, is not about income, it's about fairness. It is \nunfair to tax married couples more than single people, no matter what \ntheir income. The Finance Committee bill provides tax relief to all \nmarried couples.\n  In addition, the Finance Committee bill makes sure that couples do \nnot face the risk of differential treatment. Under the minority bill, \none family with a husband earning $50,000 and a mother staying home \nwith her children will pay more in taxes than a family with a combined \nincome of $50,000, with the wife and husband each earning $25,000. This \nsystem creates a disincentive for parents to stay at home with their \nchildren. The Republican plan will treat all couples equally.\n  While the minority bill is flawed, I am encouraged that they are \nfinally acknowledging that the marriage penalty is a problem. I am also \nencouraged that President Clinton has also acknowledged the unfair \nnature of the marriage penalty. But unfortunately, Treasury Secretary \nLarry Summers has announced that he would advise the President to veto \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  I say to the President and to my colleagues on the other side: being \nagainst the marriage penalty means that you have to be willing to \neliminate it. You cannot just say you oppose the penalty, and then \nfight to keep the penalty in law, or to keep part of the penalty in law \nfor some people. Join us to vote for the elimination of the penalty, \nand let us bring this important tax relief bill to the American people \ntogether.\n  The marriage penalty has endured for too long and harmed too many \ncouples. It is time to abolish the prejudice that charges higher taxes \nfor being married. It is time to take the tax out of saying ``I do.''\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Marriage \nTax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act. This bill would eliminate much \nof the so-called marriage penalty contained in the current tax code by \nexpanding the standard filing deduction for married couples filing \njointly, widening the tax brackets, increasing the income phase-outs \nfor the earned income credit, and extending permanently the \npreservation of the family tax credits.\n  My main reason for supporting this measure is the simple fact that I \ndo not believe that the federal government should be penalizing \nmarriage. If two people meet and fall in love, they should not have to \nworry about whether their formal union will bring about adverse tax \nconsequences. After all, newly married couples have enough to worry \nabout, without the added burden of increased tax liability.\n  Mr. President, one of the basic principles of our tax system is that \nit treats individuals in similar situations in the same way. In other \nwords, if two individuals make the same amount of money and the rest of \ntheir lifestyles are similar, they pay the same amount of tax.\n  When two people marry, these principles of fairness should remain in\n\n[[Page S7106]]\n\nplace, even if the basis of tax liability changes from the individual \nto the family. Two people, as a married couple, simply should not have \nto pay higher taxes than they would as singles. And furthermore, two \ncouples who make the same income should pay the same amount of taxes. \nThe proposal before us today adheres to those principles. The \nalternative offered by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, \ndoes not.\n  Mr. President, I support the marriage tax relief proposal currently \nbefore us now--it is a step toward eliminating one of the most \negregious examples of unfairness and complexity in the tax code today. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support its final passage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to section 313(c) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I submit for the Record a list of \nmaterial in S. 2839 considered to be extraneous under subsections \n(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of section 313. The inclusion or \nexclusion of material on the following list does not constitute a \ndetermination of extraneousness by the Presiding Officer of the Senate.\n  To the best of my knowledge, S. 2839, the Marriage Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2000, contains no material considered to be \nextraneous under subsections (b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B), and (b)(1)(E) of \nsection 313 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this week the Senate was required to \nchoose between two plans to correct the marriage tax penalty. \nUnfortunately, both of them were flawed.\n  Make no mistake. The marriage penalty is wrong. The tax code should \nnot penalize people simply because they choose to marry. As our economy \ncontinues to thrive, we have the opportunity to address the unfairness \nin the tax code. But we must do so in a manner that is fiscally \nresponsible. We must provide relief to those unfairly penalized, but \navoid an unwarranted windfall to those who already receive favorable \ntreatment.\n  I believe the only way to fully eliminate the marriage penalty is to \nallow couples to decide whether to file jointly, or as individuals. As \nwe have heard throughout this debate, there are 65 different places in \nthe tax code which can cause married couples to pay more tax than they \notherwise would. By allowing couples to choose between filing singly or \njointly, we allow each couple to choose the best outcome for their \npersonal situation. That is the approach I favor.\n  And that is why I supported Senator Moynihan's proposal. His plan \ntakes the right approach, and would completely eliminate the marriage \npenalty for couples making $100,000 or less. However, I believe Senator \nMoynihan's proposal did not go far enough to completely restore \nfairness for all couples, no matter what their income.\n  I did not support the plan proposed by Senator Roth. It would deal \nwith only three of the instances in the tax code that can result in a \nmarriage penalty, and would direct even greater benefits to people who \nalready experience a ``marriage bonus'' under current tax law. The Roth \nproposal carries a tremendous price tag, with costs ballooning out of \ncontrol as the baby boomers begin to retire--and despite its costs, \nwould provide only modest relief from the marriage penalty for the \ngreat majority of couples over the next ten years.\n  We have heard that this legislation faces a veto. We will have the \nopportunity to return to this issue, and find a better solution, one \nthat is affordable, simple, and effective.\n  The plan I offered in the Finance Committee in April could, I \nbelieve, form the basis for a compromise. It provides a simple, \nelegant, and complete solution to the marriage penalty, based on the \nconcept of optional single filing.\n  Optional single filing could not be simpler--taxpayers decide whether \nto file as a couple or as two single individuals, whichever method \nproduces the smallest family tax bill. Optional single filing means \nthat couples who actually pay the marriage penalty get the relief from \nit.\n  Let's review one more time why the marriage tax penalty happens. \nUnder our system, marriage affects tax liabilities because married \ncouples pay income taxes jointly rather than as two individuals. \nBecause tax brackets, deductions, and credits for couples are not \nalways set at exactly twice the levels for individuals, married couples \ndo not always pay the same taxes as they would if the same two people \nwere unmarried. As I said, experts have identified 65 separate \nprovisions in the Internal Revenue Code that can affect taxpayers \ndifferently based on marital status.\n  About 42 percent of couples pay more filing jointly than if they were \nnot married and filed as two individuals. This is defined as a marriage \ntax penalty. About half of all married couples pay less. This is known \nas a marriage tax bonus. The remainder see no significant difference \neither way.\n  The Roth proposal dealt conclusively with only one of the provisions \nthat gives rise to a marriage penalty. If the difference in the \nstandard deduction is responsible for your marriage penalty, the \nRepublican plan has all the relief you need.\n  If the widths of the rate brackets causes you to pay more as a \nmarried couple than you would if you were two single individuals, the \nRoth plan will give you some help. Likewise, if your penalty stems from \nthe structure of the earned income tax credit, the Republicans have a \nlittle something to offer. But for those two marriage penalty \nsituations--and the 62 other provisions in the Internal Revenue Code \nthat could result in a couple paying a marriage penalty--only optional \nsingle filing can provide complete relief.\n  That's why I so strongly support optional single filing. It's the \nbest way of dealing with the marriage penalty--give people the \nflexibility to decide what's best for them.\n  And, because optional single filing would not give tens of billions \nof dollars in new tax breaks for wealthy individuals who already get a \nmarriage bonus, it would allow us to pay down the national debt faster. \nEvery time I visit with North Dakotans, they tell me that paying down \nthe national debt should be a top priority. Paying down debt will \nstrengthen our economy and reduce interest costs. And it will ensure \nthat our children and grandchildren are not saddled with future tax \nincreases to pay for the debt we ran up in the past three decades.\n  This plan is simple. It is complete. And it matches our nation's \npriorities. I hope that as this debate moves forward, we can use the \nplan as a basis for an effective compromise.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of eliminating the \nmarriage penalty for working families. Eliminating the marriage \npenalty--which results when a married couple pays more in taxes than \nthey would if they had remained single--is the right thing to do. \nUnfortunately, the approach the majority offers is fiscally \nirresponsible and provides more than half its benefits to couples who \npay no marriage penalty. By contrast, the approach I support provides \ntax relief only to those who actually pay marriage penalties, and it \nallows us to provide additional, targeted tax cuts.\n  A few months ago, I introduced my own approach to the marriage \npenalty problem, the Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief Act of 2000, S. \n2043. My bill provides a dollar-for-dollar tax credit--up to a maximum \nof $500 in 2001, rising to $1,700 in 2004--that reduces or eliminates \nthe marriage penalty on a couple's earned income. My bill provides \nimmediate marriage penalty relief to millions of American families, \ncompletely eliminating the penalty for 59 percent of families that face \na penalty in the first year. Plus, it provides tax relief only to those \nfamilies who currently pay more when they marry than they would if they \nhad remained single, which is the true measure of the marriage penalty.\n  Because it is more targeted to those with marriage penalties, my bill \nis also more fiscally responsible. The Targeted Marriage Penalty Relief \nAct costs $80 billion over ten years--$33 billion in the five-year \nreconciliation window--or just over $10 billion a year by the year \n2010. It costs only one-third as much as the Republican plan, yet it \neliminates the marriage penalty within four years for more than 80 \npercent of families.\n  In other words, Mr. President, my bill is targeted, simple, and \naffordable, as is the Democratic alternative offered by Senator \nMoynihan. Both approaches allow us to honestly deal with\n\n[[Page S7107]]\n\nthe marriage penalty while also providing enough room for other \npriorities, such as prescription drug coverage, a college tuition tax \ncredit, or a long term care tax credit. Given the likelihood that the \nDemocratic alternative will fail, and the Republican bill will be \nvetoed by the President, it is my hope that my proposal will eventually \nreceive serious consideration.\n  Compare the advantages of both the Democratic alternative and the \nBayh approach to the Republican bill that we are debating here today. \nThe Republican bill is expensive, costing $248 billion over ten years \nand $56 billion over five years. If allowed to continue until the year \n2010, it would cost more than $40 billion every year. The bill is \npoorly targeted, with nearly 60 percent of the total tax relief going \nto couples who today pay less in tax when they marry, rather than more.\n  In addition, the Republican bill provides immediate relief only to a \nsmall number of families because it phases in over a seven-year period. \nIn fact, the Republican bill has not even completely phased in by the \nend of the five-year budget window, thereby hiding its true cost.\n  I appreciate the argument made by the other side of the aisle that \nwith significant surpluses on the horizon, some of that money ought to \nbe returned to taxpayers. I also agree that we ought to do something \nabout the marriage penalty, because people should not have to pay more \ntax simply because they fall in love and get married, as the two \nSenators from Texas point out often with both irony and humor. But \nunfortunately, eliminating the marriage penalty is not the only \nchallenge we face. The majority's proposal severely hampers our ability \nto cut other taxes, pay down the debt, and make needed investments in \nMedicare and education. It provides most relief for those who pay no \nmarriage penalty and offers incomplete relief for those who do. I \nsupport a better, more balanced approach and look forward to the day \nwhen it is adopted.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I do not like the marriage penalty. I think \nit is poor public policy. Unfortunately, the Senate Finance Committee \nhas presented us with a bill, sponsored by Senator Roth, that does not \ncompletely eliminate the marriage penalty. What this bill would do \ninstead is direct a majority of its tax benefits to married couples who \nalready benefit from a marriage bonus and to certain individuals who \nhave never even been married. Hard working married couples in Vermont \ndeserve an honest, targeted measure to eliminate the marriage penalty, \nnot the proposal that is before us today.\n  Of the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code, the Republican bill \neliminates only one and partially addresses only two more. It would do \nabsolutely nothing to get rid of the 62 other marriage penalties in \nareas such as the Hope and Lifetime Learning Credits, Individual \nRetirement Accounts, and the taxation of Social Security benefits, \nprograms that are important to Vermonters. In addition, by increasing \nthe deduction and expanding brackets, this bill would benefit married \ncouples who experience a marriage bonus, at a cost of $55.6 billion \nover five years and $40 billion per year after that.\n  I support the alternative amendment, proposed by Senator Moynihan, \nbecause it would eliminate all 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code \nfor couples with up to $100,000 in adjusted gross income. This common \nsense plan would accomplish this relief by allowing married couples to \ncalculate their tax liability jointly or as single individuals. The \nalternative would also significantly shrink the marriage penalty for \ncouples with between $100,000 and $150,000 in adjusted gross income. \nAccording to the Vermont Department of Taxes, in 1998, 113,132 married \ncouples in Vermont had an adjusted gross income under $150,000. That is \n94.5 percent of all married couples ion Vermont that filed taxes that \nyear. Under Senator Moyinhan's proposal, Vermonters get more bank for \ntheir buck and those married couples who are truly hurt by the marriage \npenalty get a break.\n  Senator Roth's bill, when fully phased in, would cost American \ntaxpayers $40 billion a year, $10 billion more than Senator Moynihan's \nproposal, but would leave 62 marriage penalties untouched. In addition, \nan analysis by the Department of Treasury indicates that only 40 \npercent of the benefits of this bill would actually reduce the marriage \npenalty. This means that 60 percent of the benefits are directed to \nother cuts--expensive cuts that do nothing to provide senior citizens \nwith a prescription drug benefit, nothing to improve our children's \neducation, nothing to help repay our national debt.\n  If the Republican bill is enacted, we will have made little progress \nin eliminating the marriage penalty--one small step as opposed the \ngiant leap that we would get with Senator Moynihan's alternative. I \nsupport an end to the marriage penalty and I will continue to work with \nother Senators to pass affordable legislation that is targeted at \neliminating all of the marriage penalties in our Tax Code. Vermonters \nand all hard working Americans deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the marriage tax penalty is an injustice \nin the Federal income Tax Code that results in a married couple filing \na joint return paying more in taxes than if the same couple were not \nmarried and filed as individuals. Today, the Senate will vote to end \nthis injustice.\n  There is no question that the American people, both married and \nsingle, are troubled and upset by the marriage tax penalty, and that \nthey are telling Congress and the President to end this injustice in \nthe Tax Code. I know every one of my 99 colleagues in the Senate \nreceives letters like those that arrive in my mail every day from \nWashington state--letters urging support for legislation to eliminate \nthe marriage tax penalty.\n  I will share just one of the hundreds and hundreds I have recently \nreceived. The Gaylord's of Sumner, Washington wrote to me and described \nhow they learned of the penalty the Tax Code imposed on them for being \nmarried when preparing their tax filings for this year. The letter \nreads, ``Here is what I did to see the penalty: I simply clicked on the \n`single' box on my wife's return (as it is on the computer, it is a \nsimple thing to do) and her tax went from sending $400 to the IRS, to \nan instant recalculation of getting $500 back!'' Computer tax software \nmade it easily and brutally clear to the Gaylord's that they were being \npunished by the Tax Code for being married to each other, that they \nwould pay less in taxes if they were single.\n  Mr. President, the marriage tax penalty is as outrageous as it is \nindefensible. President Clinton, however, has threatened to veto this \nmarriage tax penalty legislation. President Clinton should reverse his \nthreatened veto, sign marriage tax penalty legislation into law and \nbring fairness to the Tax Code. No longer should those who fall in love \nand get married be penalized by the Tax Code.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican marriage penalty \ntax reform proposal and support the Democratic alternative for three \nsimple reasons: the Democratic alternative is targeted, provides \ncomprehensive relief, and is fiscally responsible, and the Republican \nplan is not.\n  First, the Democratic relief plan is targeted: It confers 100% of its \nbenefits on couples suffering a marriage penalty--when two individuals \npay more in income taxes as a married couple, filing jointly than they \nwould if they remained single. The Republican plan confers only 40 \npercent of its benefits to taxpayers who currently suffer a penalty. Of \nthe remaining benefits, 37 percent go to couples currently receiving a \nmarriage bonus--when two individuals pay less in income taxes as a \nmarried couple, filing jointly than they would if they remained single. \nSo the Republican plan is effectively a singles penalty bill.\n  Second, the Democratic relief plan is comprehensive: There are 65 \nareas of the tax code where a marriage penalty occurs--from the \nstandard deduction to the earned income tax credit. The Democratic plan \naddresses all of them. In fact it completely eliminates the penalty--in \nall its forms--for couples earning up to $100,000, 80% of all married \ncouples. The Republican plan addresses only 3 of the 65 places in the \ntax code where the marriage penalty occurs--it doesn't address the \nother 62. So the Republican plan provides inadequate, incomplete \nrelief.\n  Despite these deficiencies, or perhaps, because of them, the \nRepublican plan carries an enormous, fiscally irresponsible price tag \nof $40 billion per\n\n[[Page S7108]]\n\nyear when fully in place--compared with $29 billion per year for the \nDemocratic alternative. Allocating so much money to an inefficient, \npoorly targeted tax cut leaves no room for other important national \npriorities and threatens the very prosperity that has made tax cuts \npossible. The Democratic proposal is simply a better value for the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes off the majority leader's \ntime to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we are not talking about a tax cut \ntoday. We are talking about a tax correction. We are talking about 21 \nmillion married couples in this country having tax equity.\n  We have heard the arguments: This is a tax for the rich. Is a \nschoolteacher who makes $30,000 a year and a policeman who makes \n$32,000 a year a couple who are rich? That is what the other side would \nhave you believe. They think this is a tax cut for the rich.\n  I ask the question: Does a schoolteacher and a policeman believe the \nFederal Government can decide better how they should spend their own \nmoney than they can decide for themselves? That is what it gets down \nto.\n  When I hear the other side saying this is going to cost the \nGovernment too much, I think: Who do they think this money belongs to? \nDo they think it belongs to the people who earn it or do they think it \nbelongs to people in Washington, DC, who have never met the families \nwho are paying these taxes? I think the money belongs to the people who \nearn it.\n  We are looking at a $2 trillion non-Social Security surplus. We are \ntalking about tax cuts. With the death tax and the marriage tax penalty \nrelief that we have given in the last week in this Senate, it would be \n10 percent of the projected non-Social Security surplus--10 cents on \nthe dollar.\n  What are we going to do with this money if we don't let people keep \nmore of the money they earn? Are we going to dream up new programs that \nwill not affect these people? I don't think that is the right approach.\n  We are talking about tax relief for hard-working American families--\npeople who make $30,000 a year or $32,000 a year or $35,000 a year--\nbecause we believe marriage should not be a taxable event. We believe \npeople should be treated the same if they get married. If they are two \nworking people who are trying to save their money to buy their first \nhome, they should have the right to do it with their own money, \nespecially since we are talking about 10 percent of the non-Social \nSecurity surplus.\n  We are talking about being good stewards of taxpayer dollars today. \nWe are talking about letting hard-working families keep the money they \nearn to do a little bit better for their children or to be able to \nstart a family or buy their American dream home.\n  That is what we are talking about. We believe the family can make the \ndecisions for themselves better than someone in Washington.\n  Marriage penalty relief is what we are talking about. Tax equity is \nwhat we are talking about. We are talking about fairness today for \nhard-working Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to make five points in a \nvery short period of time before we vote.\n  The first goes to the issue raised by the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nhaving to do with the surplus.\n  Over the course of the last 6 months we have seen the surplus \nincrease--projected now to be about $2.1 trillion. In 6 months, we have \ngone from roughly $800 billion in projected surplus to $2.1 trillion. I \nwill predict that surplus is going to change one way or the other over \nthe next 6 months, the next 6 years--for any length of time. In fact, I \nthink the surplus projections are the fiscal equivalent of the dot-com \nstock market. They will continue to be volatile. We know how volatile \nthey can be. We projected deficits as far as the eye could see a few \nyears ago. We could see those deficits come back completely in a very \nshort period of time. We don't know. There will continue to be \nvolatility in predictions of surplus just as there has been volatility \nin the dot-com stock market. Let's keep that in mind.\n  When you add all the Republican tax breaks to date, and add the Bush \nSocial Security privatization proposal and it comes to $3.4 trillion. \nThat exceeds by more than 50 percent the available surplus.\n  Last week, we dealt with the estate tax. Today, we are dealing with \nmarriage penalties. But when you add all of them up, we exceed by more \nthan 50 percent of the projected surplus.\n  They are counting on this surplus continuing to go up, No. 1, or they \nare going to do something they say they don't want to do, which is to \ntap the Social Security surplus and the Medicare surplus in order to \npay for the tax cuts in the first place. That is point No. 1.\n  We don't have the surplus in the bank until it is there. They can \nproject all they want to project. But that surplus could be eliminated \nvery quickly.\n  The second issue: If you are going to say you are going to fix the \nmarriage penalty, fix the marriage penalty. There are 65 marriage \npenalties in the Tax Code. The Republicans chose to deal with three of \nthem. The cost in dealing with those three is $248 billion. They filed \namendments in the Finance Committee for an additional $6 billion, \ntotaling another $81 billion. I don't know what it would cost if they \nwere actually going to fix all 65. We don't know how many hundreds of \nbillions of dollars there would be in addition to the $248 billion. \nKeep that in mind. This does not fix the marriage penalty. Anyone who \nis voting under that impression ought to recognize that they can say \nwhat they will but they are only fixing 3 of the 65 problems that are \ncurrently incorporated in the tax law. That is the second point.\n  This is the third point related to the second point. Let's take this \nteacher and this policeman the distinguished Senator from Texas was \ntalking about. She mentioned a teacher and a policeman and having the \nneed to address their concern. For this couple who has been penalized, \nlet's assume each of them were making $35,000, which in the case of a \nteacher is very difficult to assume. But we will assume that for the \nmoment. The husband and wife jointly would pay $9,532. If they were \nable to file singly, they would pay $8,407. So their actual marriage \npenalty is $1,125.\n  The Republican plan only provides 39 percent of the relief for that \ncouple making $70,000--$443. That is all the relief this Republic plan \nprovides. That is another reason the Democrats felt compelled to offer \nour alternative.\n  It is no accident that the Democratic plan authored by the \ndistinguished Senator from New York and the Finance Committee Democrats \nprovide 100-percent relief--$1,125 in the case of this particular \ncouple making $70,000.\n  The fourth point: This bill actually creates a new inequity. We call \nit a singles penalty. I promise you somebody is going to come to the \nfloor saying we have to deal with the singles penalty.\n  That $70,000 joint income I was talking about creates a joint tax \nliability of $10,274 under current law. They get some tax relief under \nthe GOP plan, and end up with a liability of $8,743. However, a widow \ndoes not get any relief at all. A single widow, a person trying to make \nends meet with the same kind of income, doesn't get any kind of \nreduction in her tax liability at all. In fact, because they now create \na singles penalty, that widow will actually pay $1,531 in additional \ntaxes over a couple getting relief under the marriage penalty. We are \ninadvertently creating a singles penalty in the name of trying to \naddress this marriage penalty relief under the Republican plan. That is \nsomething I hope Members will take a close look at.\n  The fifth point I raise, I heard several colleagues discuss the fact \nthis does not benefit the wealthy at the expense of the rest. According \nto the Joint Tax Committee, it sure does. The Joint Tax Committee said \na couple making $50,000 a year, as a joint couple, the Republican tax \nbill is going to allow $240 in relief when paying a marriage penalty \nwith $50,000 worth of income. Someone earning $200,000, their benefit \nunder the Republican plan is $1,335. The Democratic plan is shown in \ncontrast. Someone earning $30,000 under the Democratic plan receives \n$4,191 in relief. Under the Republican plan, they receive $807.\n\n[[Page S7109]]\n\n  When representing the vast majority of the American working families \nin that $30,000 to $50,000, why vote for a plan that actually reduces \ntheir opportunity to generate meaningful relief by giving them $240 in \nthe case of a $50,000 income earner, and $807 relief for those in the \n$30,000 category? Why vote for such a plan?\n  It goes to the very point that many have made all along, and the \ndistinguished Senator from New York has made so eloquently. Mr. \nPresident, 60 percent of the benefit in this bill we are about to vote \non actually goes to those who get a marriage bonus; only 40 percent of \nthat $248 million actually goes to those who face a marriage penalty.\n  Why give, in the name of marriage penalty relief, 60 percent of the \nbenefit to those who are actually getting a marriage bonus under \ncurrent law? Why exacerbate the inequities in current law already? That \nis what we are doing.\n  The Democrats have a far better plan. This chart shows that better \nplan. The Republicans, as I noted earlier, deal with 3 of the 65 \ninequities for $248 billion, 60 percent of which goes to those who get \na marriage surplus. The Democrats deal with every single inequity \ncurrently in the code, all 65, and in one sentence.\n  That is the choice. Do we want to fix it or do we want to talk about \nit? Do we want to create new inequities and singles penalties, or do we \nwant to deal with the problem? Do we want to fritter away $248 billion, \nthinking we have fixed the marriage problem, or do we want to deal with \nthe real problem for a lot less money?\n  The Democratic plan allows married couples to file separately or \njointly. Very simply, taxpayers get a choice. Why deny them that \nchoice? We provide them, for the first time, an opportunity to do one \nor the other, in a single sentence.\n  We eliminate all marriage tax penalties for those making less than \n$100,000. We don't expand the marriage bonus, and we provide fiscally \nresponsible relief.\n  You cannot get much better than that. I am hopeful my colleagues will \nthink very carefully before they vote for a plan that does not solve \nthis problem. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Republican plan on marriage \npenalty relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo).

Mr. President, the peace talks that President Clinton has \nbeen hosting at Camp David between Prime Minister Barak of Israel and \nChairman Arafat of the Palestinian Authority appear to be reaching \ntheir climax. The President has made clear from the outset that the \nnegotiations would be difficult, but that it was his hope to recreate \nthe spirit of the Camp David summit hosted by President Carter more \nthan 20 years ago that resulted in the historic peace treaty between \nEgypt and Israel.\n  The goal of the current discussions is no less ambitious than the \npeace treaty between Israel and Egypt that was enshrined in the first \nCamp David accords. Certainly, a peace agreement between the Israelis \nand the Palestinians would be a welcome advance in the quest for a \nlasting peace in the Middle East. We would all like these discussions \nto lead to an end to the conflict that has caused so much suffering and \ninstability in that troubled region.\n  Whether such a positive outcome is possible is still very much in \ndoubt. There is no guarantee of success; indeed, many think the chances \nare dim. But when there is a chance for peace, the opportunity should \nbe seized.\n  That being said, Mr. President, it should be made clear what the role \nand responsibility of the United States are here. The most important \nrole of the United States is our ability to serve as the facilitator of \nthese discussions. That is due to the nature of our relations with \nIsrael and the Palestinians, and the personalities of the leaders \ninvolved at this time in history.\n  But providing a forum and encouragement for the Israelis and \nPalestinians to solve their own conflict should\n\n[[Page S7110]]\n\nnot be translated into a commitment to solve the conflict for them. \nStability in the Middle East, including the state of relations between \nIsrael and the Palestinians, is a matter of great importance to the \nUnited States, but it is not our conflict. It is theirs. We can help \nthem find common ground, but ultimately it is their ground to find.\n  This distinction is significant in light of the potential cost of a \npeace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Figures \nranging from $15 billion to $40 billion have been floated in the media \nover the past several days as the possible sums that U.S. taxpayers \nwill be asked to contribute to a peace agreement. If history is any \nguide, this is only the beginning.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, from 1979 through \n2000, the United States has provided over $68 billion to Israel, and \nover $47 billion to Egypt to support the Camp David accords. That \namounts to more than $115 billion in U.S. tax dollars to two countries \nalone. Besides that, from 1994 and 2000, the United States has provided \n$927 million--almost a billion dollars--to the Palestinians.\n  I wonder how many Americans are aware of this. I wonder how many \nAmericans knew, at the time of the first Camp David summit, that the \nprice of an Israeli-Egyptian peace agreement would be an open-ended \nfinancial commitment of U.S. tax dollars exceeding $100 billion. Yet \nafter more than 20 years of paying the bills, that is indeed the cost. \nAnd there is no end in sight.\n  Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk about President Clinton's \nlegacy and Secretary of State Albright's legacy. I appreciate their \nzeal to achieve historic agreements and to be remembered for their \nachievements. I recognize that peace between the Israelis and the \nPalestinians would be a crowning achievement. But what legacy at what \nprice? Are we going to be told somewhere down the line that in order \nfor the Israelis and Palestinians to agree--and this does not include \nthe Syrians--the Administration had to promise them billions and \nbillions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer aid? Why is it the responsibility \nof the United States Congress to pay to implement an agreement that we \nare not a party to, and about which we have, so far, received no \ndetails?\n  There is a disturbing tendency on the part of the Administration, and \nit is by no means unique to this Administration, to negotiate \nagreements and make costly financial commitments behind closed doors, \nand then inform the Congress, in so-called ``consultations,'' after the \nfact. I fear that is what is contemplated again, and I think it is \nwrong.\n  If consultations are happening, that is news to me. As ranking member \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have not been consulted, and \nperhaps for good reasons. I am not aware of any other Senator who has \nbeen approached by any administration official who has suggested what \nthe price of implementing a peace agreement might be, or why it is the \nresponsibility of the American taxpayers to pay that price. I say this \nparticularly when it was only last year that the Congress provided a \ntotal of $1.6 billion to Israel and the Palestinians to implement the \nWye River agreement--another deal that was made without any prior \nconsultations, as far as I know, with Congress. Again, I fear we are \nbeing led down the path of ``sign now, pay later'' without even knowing \nhow much we are going to be asked to pay later, or why.\n  Now, I recognize that the discussions underway at Camp David may \nfail. There may be no agreement. That would be unfortunate. But \nwhatever the outcome, I want to remind the administration, and the \nIsraelis and Palestinians, that the negotiations are being hosted by \nthe administration, not by the Congress, not by the Appropriations \nCommittees of the Congress. No one should assume that the check is in \nthe mail. No one should assume that we are going to dig another hole \nfor ourselves the way we did the last time there was such a negotiation \nat Camp David.\n  We all want to see peace in the Middle East, and if there is a \nlegitimate need for funding to implement a peace agreement, we can \ndiscuss what role the United States should play--but not after the \ncommitments have already been made, not after the ink has already \ndried, not if this ancient Senator has anything to say about it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PASTORE\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, Rhode Island and the Nation have lost an \nextraordinary statesman and patriot, Senator John O. Pastore. Senator \nPastore passed away Saturday at the age of 93. He served in this body \nfrom December 1950 until January 1977. He served with distinction, he \nserved with integrity, and he served with the utmost commitment to \nhelping the people of Rhode Island and the people of this Nation to \nachieve the noblest aspirations of this country. He committed his life \nto public service. Senator Pastore was, in turn, a State \nrepresentative, an assistant attorney general of the State of Rhode \nIsland, a lieutenant governor, a Governor, and then, for over 26 years, \na U.S. Senator.\n  He began his life on March 17, 1907, on Federal Hill, the Italian \nAmerican community in Rhode Island. It was an interesting combination \nof a young Italian American born to immigrant parents on St. Patrick's \nDay. He would never let anyone around forget that he was both proudly \nItalian and fortuitously Irish--at least for 1 day of the year. He grew \nup in an immigrant household that was experiencing all the difficulty \nand travail of people who come to a new land to find themselves and \nmake a better life for their children. It was not glamorous; it was \ndifficult. He endured the difficulties with the same kind of \ndetermination that marked his whole life.\n  In his own words:\n\n       We lived in the ghetto of Federal Hill. We had no running \n     water, no hot water. I used to get up in the morning and have \n     to crank the stove and go out in the back yard and sift out \n     the ashes and come back with a coal that I could recoup. I \n     had to chisel ice with an ice pick in the sink so that I \n     could wash up in the morning. And that was everybody in the \n     family. That wasn't me alone. That was my wife's family. That \n     was everybody's family.\n\n  The hard, difficult life of a young immigrant family in Providence, \nRI, in the early part of the century became even more difficult because \nwhen Senator Pastore was 9 years old, his father, a tailor, passed \naway. At the age of 9, he became the man of the family. His mother went \nto work as a seamstress to support Senator Pastore and four other \nchildren. She labored all of her life to do that.\n  Senator Pastore was a bright and gifted student. He progressed \nthrough the Providence public schools and finished Classical High \nSchool, which was the preeminent public high school in the State of \nRhode Island. He did so well that he was offered an opportunity to \nattend Harvard College so that he could fulfill his dream to become a \ndoctor. He did so well, not only by studying but at the same time \nsupporting his family, working in a jewelry factory in Providence, RI. \nBut the reality and the truth was, he was poor, he was without a \nfather, and he felt the keen obligation to ensure that he protected and \nhelped his family. And so he would forego that opportunity. He was \nwithout the funds. He had to work to support his brothers and sisters \nand help his mother. It is said--and he has said it, in fact--that he \nwept on the night of his graduation, thinking that his great talent \nwould never be fully utilized, that he would forever be committed to a \nlife of perhaps even menial work. But he did so willingly and \nvoluntarily because he, too, wanted to help his mother and his brothers \nand sisters to make it in this great country.\n  As we all recognize, all of us who have in any way briefly come in \ncontact with Senator John O. Pastore, he was a man of extraordinary \ndetermination. He went to work as a clerk at the Narragansett Electric \nCompany, and during the day he worked hard. But in the evening he \nenrolled at the Northeastern University Law School extension, held at \nthe Providence YMCA. Those were the days when you could become a lawyer \nwithout going to college and then going from college into law school. \nAt night, while working and supporting his family, he became a lawyer. \nAfter he became a lawyer, he opened up his practice in the basement of \nhis family's home in Providence. The clientele did not rush to him, \nfrankly, but he also discovered that he\n\n[[Page S7111]]\n\nhad a knack for politics. He ran as a State representative in the \nthirties. He was elected twice and, at that point, he began to create a \nname for himself as an articulate advocate, someone who was a hard-\nworking, determined champion, not only for his people but for all \npeople.\n  He was made an assistant attorney general for the State, and then he \nwas selected to run as lieutenant governor. He served as lieutenant \ngovernor for the State of Rhode Island. And then, fortuitously--because \nthe Governor accepted a position in the Democratic administration--he \nbecame the first Italian American Governor in this great country. Then, \nhe moved on to the U.S. Senate to become the first Italian American \nSenator in the history of this country. An extraordinary individual. He \ncame here and worked on so many different issues. He was the chairman \nof the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy at the time when atomic energy \nwas becoming a powerful force in all of our lives.\n  He committed himself to the peaceful use of atomic energy to try to \ndevelop its potential to help rather than to destroy. He worked \nceaselessly to ensure that we were controlling atomic energy throughout \nthe world. He worked very hard on the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. He \nworked with many colleagues--some colleagues who are here today--on \nthat landmark legislation.\n  He also served on the Commerce Committee where he was the chairman of \nthe telecommunications subcommittee. I daresay many of the fundamental \nfoundations and principles that have guided this huge explosion of \ntelecommunications that have opened up the cyberspace of the world \nbegan years ago under his deliberations on that committee.\n  Also, in 1974 at the end of his career, he was very active in \ncampaign finance reform in the wake of the Watergate affair.\n  Those are accomplishments, but what is so compelling and so \nemblematic of the man is that his whole life represented something so \nfundamentally American. He was modest and humble. He seized the \nopportunity that is America--the chance to succeed. Then he committed \nhimself in his public life, day in and day out, to ensure that every \nAmerican had those types of opportunities.\n  That is why he and his colleagues in the 1960s embraced the idea of \nproviding educational support to the talented but poor Americans who \ncould get into college but couldn't afford to go to college. That was \nnot some theoretical flourish he discovered in a lecture hall at a \ngreat university; that was from his heart, from having lived it, from \nhaving seen so many of his contemporaries with the talent, the skills, \nand the ambition frustrated and thwarted because they didn't have \nthe money to go to college. In so many other ways, he tried to ensure \nthat ``opportunity'' was the watchword of America.\n\n  His greatest contribution perhaps is the fact that he lived what we \nall think America should be and is--that someone can rise up from an \nimmigrant household, from a place where English is not the first \nlanguage, to the highest positions in this country through hard work, \ndedication, and commitment. That example alone, that inspiration alone, \nis extraordinarily important to all of us.\n  We in Rhode Island are very lucky because we have a chance to see our \npublic officials close up. All of us have stories about our leaders. In \nRhode Island, Senator Pastore was no exception. We all understood early \non that he was one of the most extraordinary debaters and oral \nadvocates this body has seen in a very long time.\n  In 1964, President Johnson asked Senator Pastore to be the keynote \nspeaker at the Democratic National Convention. I was 14 years old then. \nI, as every other Rhode Islander, was crowded around the television set \non a hot summer's night waiting for our Senator to speak to the Nation. \nHe spoke in his typical powerful and forceful way. He spoke about \njustice and opportunity. He spoke about the Democratic Party, and he \nspoke about our commitment to help everyone. He spoke with both passion \nand precision. He moved that convention, and he moved the Nation. We \nwill never forget those words.\n  Also, again because of the proximity of everyone to everyone else in \nRhode Island, I had the chance to see him when I was a younger person \nin my early teens because my parents would summer down at Narragansett, \nRI, and his family would summer there also. It was a very modest summer \nresort. My father was a school custodian. So this was not exactly the \nRiviera. But he was there because that is where the people were. That \nis where he went for his summer vacation.\n  I can remember going to mass on a hot summer's day. We were all lucky \njust to be in long pants because it was summertime. However, he would \nbe there in his suit and tie looking every inch the sartorial master \nthat he was, with a bearing and a dignity that was beyond senatorial, \nit was regal, but also with a kindness and a humility that came through \nequally well.\n  Finally, with a great deal of appreciation and gratitude, Senator \nPastore was the individual who appointed me to the military academy at \nWest Point. He gave me the greatest opportunity of my life. He did it \nin a nonpartisan, nonpolitical way. I had never really met the Senator. \nI had asked for the appointment. I sent him a letter. He had his staff \ndirect me to take a test. I took a test. I took a physical. I took a \nphysical aptitude test. I still remember the moment when his executive \nassistant called me and told me I was going to West Point.\n  In my office in Washington I have both his picture and the letter he \nsent me on that day. In my office in Rhode Island I have his picture \nand the telegram he sent to follow up. He gave me a great opportunity. \nI like to think that the good things I have done in a way have been a \nresponse to that confidence he showed in me as a very young man.\n  He also was someone who had a great sense of humor about himself and \nabout many things. He once quipped that he was very grateful his \nparents named him John O. Pastore rather than Giovanni Orlando Pastore \nbecause in the latter case his initials would have been ``GOP,'' which \nis something he would have been hard pressed to deal with because of \nhis very strong Democratic life and career.\n\n  I can remember also that Senator Mansfield spoke to me one time. He \nsaid: You know, every St. Patrick's Day, Senator Pastore insisted that \nhe be the President pro tempore. It was his birthday. He wanted to \npreside. He also reminded everyone that his name was really John O. \nPastore with the accent one would have if one were John O'Rourke, or \nJohn O'Neill, or John O'Donnell.\n  He was an extraordinary man. He graced us with a life of service. He \ngraced us with a life that is an example to all of us. He has honored \nus by doing his best every day, by taking his work much more seriously \nthan himself, and by doing this great work and then quietly and \ngracefully returning home, back to Rhode Island, to his beloved wife \nand his family--to his simple life with the people he respected and \nadmired. He is beloved in my State of Rhode Island. He is well \ndeserving of that great love.\n  To his wife, Mrs. Pastore, to his son John, to his daughters \nFrancesca and Louise, to his sisters Elena and Michelina, our sincere \ncondolences. But today we not only commemorate his passing but we \ncelebrate his great life.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7111-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The United States has changed a lot in the last 7\\1/2\\ \nyears. Mr. President, 7\\1/2\\ years ago we were deep into deficits. We \nwere spending more each year than we collected in taxes. We were \nrunning up the largest national debt in the history of the United \nStates. We have $6 trillion in debt to show for that experience.\n  Many people have lost faith in the ability of this institution to \ncorrect this problem and to respond to what was truly a national \ncrisis. In fact, some went so far as to suggest we should amend the \nConstitution of the United States to pass what was known as the \nbalanced budget amendment.\n  On the floor today with me is Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, \nacknowledged to be probably the most gifted Senator when it comes to \nthe rules of this body and knowledge of the Constitution. He fought a \nbattle, sometimes lonely but ultimately successful, in stopping Members \nfrom amending the Constitution and giving power to the Federal courts \nto tell the Congress to stop spending. Some in this body thought that \nwas the only way we could stop the red ink cascading over the Treasury \nin Washington, DC. Senator Byrd prevailed. The amendment was defeated.\n  Amazingly, we stand today in this Senate, in this Capitol, in \nWashington, DC, with a complete change of events. We are no longer \ntalking about the yearly deficits. We are talking about the yearly \nsurpluses, the fact that the economy is so strong, so many people are \nworking, so many people are earning a good income, businesses are \nsuccessful, people are building homes, America is on the move. For 7\\1/\n2\\ years or more now, we have seen that prosperity not only lift the \nboats of the American people but also bring a new opportunity in \nCongress. For the first time in many years, we can honestly sit back \nand discuss and debate what to do with the surplus in the Treasury.\n  I think many Democrats share the feeling that we should be \nconservative in our approach with this surplus. I am not sure what \ntomorrow, next year, 3 years, or 5 years down the line will bring. I \nthink the decisions we should make as to this surplus should be \nthoughtful. First and foremost, let's retire our national debt, the $6 \ntrillion debt. We collect $1 billion a day in taxes from Americans, \nbusinesses, families, and individuals to pay interest on our old \nnational debt. It is as if to say to our children, we are going to \nleave you the mortgage on the home we enjoyed our entire lives.\n  I agree with President Clinton and most Democrats; our first priority \nshould be reduce the publicly held national debt to zero. We can do it. \nWe can do it in a short period of time. It will call for some \ndiscipline and some honest dialog with the American people. We can take \nthe money from our surplus, pay down the debt in Social Security, pay \ndown the debt in Medicare, strengthen those two very important \nprograms, and bring down our national debt. That is our policy on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. That, we think, should be the first step \nthat we make, the most important, the most conservative, the most \ndisciplined.\n  The Republican side sees things quite differently. They believe if we \nare going to have a surplus, the first and most important thing we \nshould do with that surplus is to give tax cuts. There isn't a \npolitician alive who wouldn't like to address a crowd in his hometown \nand announce a tax cut. There is just no more popular set of words we \ncan use in this business than: I'm going to cut your taxes. Is it the \nright thing to do? Is it the responsible thing to do?\n\n  Equally important, if we are to give tax cuts, who should be the \nbeneficiaries? If we are going to have a surplus for the first time \nvirtually in modern memory, what are we going to do with that surplus? \nWho will benefit from that surplus?\n  Over the last week and a half, we have heard the Republican answer to \nthose questions. They have suggested if we have a surplus in America, \nif times are good and we can help somebody in America, the very first \npeople in line for help should be the wealthiest in America. Now, is \nthat the conclusion most American families would reach? I don't think \nso.\n  If you take a look at the proposal of the Republicans to eliminate \nthe estate tax, and the bill that just passed to eliminate the so-\ncalled marriage penalty, you can see who the winners are. This chart I \nam presenting shows the Republican tax plan, their spending of our \nsurplus. Almost half of our surplus is going to benefit the wealthiest \npeople in America. The biggest winners? Mr. President, 43 percent of \nthe total tax cut proposed by the Republicans goes to people making \nover $319,000 a year. They get 43 percent of the tax breaks. It means \nfor them, on average, an annual tax cut of $23,000. That is almost \n$2,000 a month.\n  The Republicans believe in good times, after we have been through all \nthis pain, and we now have a surplus, the first group who deserves a \nbreak, the first group to deserve a benefit is the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, those making over $319,000 a year.\n  What about those on the other end? What about the people who get up \nand go to work every single day and may make a minimum wage or a little \nbetter than that? How will they fare under the Republican proposal? How \nwere they considered when the Republicans sat down and said where our \npriorities will be, here are the people we will help. The lowest 20 \npercent of wage earners in America, those making less than $13,600 a \nyear, get less than 1 percent of the Republican tax cut. It is worth \n$24 a year to them, $2 a month. The Republicans didn't forget them, \nthey will send them $2 a month. For the wealthiest, it is almost $2,000 \na month.\n  The next group, those making up to $24,400, see about $82 a year from \nthe Republican tax cuts. That comes to $7 a month. Think about that for \na second. If we are going to help the people in America who need help \nthe most, shouldn't we be rewarding hard-working families who get up \nand go to work every single day, play by the rules, try to buy a home, \ntry to build a community, try to provide for their children and their \nfuture or should we take this surplus and give it, first, to those who \nare making over $300,000 a year?\n  Some people say that being in Congress is about a question of being \n``in touch'' or ``out of touch.'' The Republican tax plan is in touch \nwith the wealthiest people. It is out of touch with regular families.\n  The Democratic side believes after bringing down the national debt, \nwe should target tax cuts to help these working families who have been \nvirtually ignored by the Republicans in their tax benefits.\n  On the floor of the Senate, we offered an amendment to say every \nfamily in America, every single family, can deduct every year $12,000 \nin college education expenses. I have seen a lot of families with new \nbabies. Everybody is happy to see the child arrive. After a few \nminutes, people turn and say: What a cute little boy. How in the world \nare we ever going to pay for his college in 18 years? People know that \ncost is going up. The average family knows how tough it is to pay it.\n  We say on this side, you deserve a helping hand to help your son or \ndaughter be the absolute best they can be. We offered an amendment. \nInstead of the Republican plan for the wealthiest, we said let the \npeople of America deduct $12,000 a year in college education expenses \nfrom their taxes. It is a deduction which would mean, for some \nfamilies, as much as $3,000, and a helping hand to pay for tuition. \nRejected, rejected on the floor of the Senate last week. They don't \nwant that kind of tax cut. They want the kind of tax cut that gives \n$23,000 a year to the wealthiest people in America but would not give \nto average families, worried about their kids going to good schools and \nhaving a bright future, a helping hand.\n  We also considered a prescription drug benefit. I think everybody \nknows what that is about. Your parent and your grandparents, on \nMedicare, are struggling to pay for their prescription drugs. On the \nDemocratic side, we think there should be a program under Medicare to \nmake sure the elderly have a chance to fill those prescriptions, stay \nhealthy, stay strong, stay independent. We have been fighting for that. \nWe offered it as an alternative. Instead of giving money to the \nwealthiest in this country, why don't you help those under Medicare, \ngive them a helping hand in paying for some of the drugs? Rejected. The \nRepublicans had a chance to vote for that tax benefit and rejected it \non the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7113]]\n\n  Having been across the State of Illinois, with public hearings on \nprescription drug benefits, the stories will break your heart. Men and \nwomen coming to those hearings get their prescription from the doctor. \nThey go to the pharmacy, and before they ask them to fill it they ask \nhow much will it cost. If it is too much, they either don't fill it or \ntake half the prescription many times, depriving themselves of the \nbasics of life so they can have prescription drugs.\n  That was the choice: To give to people earning over $300,000 a year \nin income a tax break of $23,000 or to give to seniors and the disabled \na chance to pay for the prescription drugs. These are the values we \ntested on the floor of the Senate, and Republicans rejected the idea of \na prescription drug benefit proposed by the Democrats.\n\n  On child care, do you know a working family with small children? \nUnless they have someone in the family they can count on, who doesn't \nworry about safe, quality child care for the kids? I think about it as \na grandfather. I have a little 4-year-old grandson, and it finally \ndawned on me when my daughter told me she was looking for day care, \nsomebody was going to have my little Alex for 8 hours a day. I said, \n``Who are these people? I want to know who they are if they are going \nto have my grandson.''\n  Every mother and father asks that same question, and they struggle to \ncome up with the money to pay for good child care to guard each day the \nmost precious thing in their lives, and Senator Dodd said, can't we \ngive a tax break to working families to help them pay for child care? \nWouldn't that be something good for America, so the kids are in good, \nsafe hands during the course of the day so working families have that \npeace of mind? Rejected by the Republicans in the Senate. No, sir, we \nare not going to give a child care tax break for working families. We \nare going to give to the wealthiest in America $23,000 a year in tax \ncuts.\n  When it comes to putting people in the front of the line for help \nfrom this Government, the Republican leadership has said time and \nagain: We are not there helping working families pay for college \neducation. We are not there helping working families pay for child \ncare. We are not there for prescription drug benefits. We are there for \nchanges in the Tax Code that literally help the wealthiest people in \nAmerica.\n  Another challenge many of us face is the whole question of taking \ncare of aging parents. If you are a baby boomer, you probably know what \nI am talking about. Your parents, now, who want to live as long as they \npossibly can as independently as they can, basically come to you at \nsome point and say, ``We are going to need a hand.'' People make \nsacrifices for their parents in those circumstances. We think the Tax \nCode should recognize that, and reward that as well, and give to \nfamilies who are struggling to take care of their aging parents and \nthose with serious illness a helping hand. That is another idea for a \ntax cut that helps real American families, another idea rejected by the \nRepublican leadership in the Senate. No, these people are not on their \nradar screen. First and foremost, the tax break suggested by the \nRepublicans has to go to the very wealthiest among us.\n  So half the surplus we are now generating and hope to see in the next \n10 or 20 years is not going to the working families of America. It is \ngoing to those who already are well off, those who are doing well, \nthose who, frankly, don't need a helping hand.\n  Imagine, if you will, if you are making $300,000 a year, what an \nextra $2,000 a month means to you. What are you going to do with it? \nSurely you will find something to do with it. But could it possibly be \nas valuable as providing what a family needs to help pay for a college \neducation expenses? Prescription drugs? Day care? Taking care of an \naging parent? That is the battle that is underway.\n  President Clinton said he is going to veto these bills, and he \nshould, because he was elected by people across America, 98 percent of \nwhom will see no benefit whatsoever from these bills. Let us at least \nstart listening to families across America when it comes to our tax \npolicy. Let us sit down and correct the inequities in the Tax Code. But \nalso let us decide who is most deserving of our tax assistance. I do \nnot believe it is people making over $300,000 a year. They are doing \nquite fine by themselves. Let's be sensitive, though, to those families \nstruggling every day to realize the American dream and to have \nopportunity.\n\n  When you take a look at this Nation we live in, it is the greatest on \nEarth. God blessed each one of us who had a chance to call this home. \nBut we have an obligation to people who live in this country to make \nsure they have a chance for opportunity, too. You heard the wonderful \nstory Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told about John O. Pastore, one \nof the giants in the history of the Senate. A son of immigrants, he \nrose to serve in this Chamber and be an ideal and to serve as a model \nfor so many people and so many generations.\n  There are many others like John Pastore out there who need their \nchance to prove themselves in America. They are not worried about \nestate taxes paid by fewer than 2 percent of the American people. They \nare folks who are worried about making sure they have a safe, healthy \nhome, making sure they have health care, have college education \nexpenses taken care of. Those people have been forgotten in the debate \nover the last 2 weeks. It is up to President Clinton to remind us of \nour priorities. It is up to him to lead us, now, into meaningful tax \nrelief targeted to help families who really need it.\n  When it comes to prescription drug benefits, I do not think there is \na more important issue we can consider during the course of this \nremaining congressional session. Prescription drug expenditures have \nbeen growing at double-digit rates for almost every year since 1980, \nand the drugs that seniors need the most have increased at four times \nthe rate of inflation. The average prescription drug cost for Medicare \nbeneficiaries will reach $1,100 per year this year.\n  The Republicans have proposed, in a manner to try to deal with this, \nthe suggestion that we should turn to the health insurance companies to \nlet them take care of prescription drugs. Pardon me, we have seen what \nthose same managed care companies and health insurance companies do to \nfamilies when the families really need help. They turn them down when \nthey need medical care. They let decisions be made by insurance clerks \nrather than doctors. They force people to go to court to sue for basic \nhealth care. That is the same group to whom Republicans would turn over \nthe prescription drug benefit. That will never work. It is best for us \nto put together a plan that is guaranteed and universal and under \nMedicare that we can count on.\n  It is also important we have the leverage and the power to make sure \nwe can negotiate for reasonable drug prices. It is just inconceivable \nto me that some of the same drugs we approve in the United States, some \nof which we spent taxpayers' dollars to research and develop, end up \nbeing sold in Canada for a fraction of the cost. Americans are now \ngetting in buses and driving over the Canadian border to buy their \ndrugs, fill their prescriptions for prescription drugs made by American \ndrug companies at taxpayers' expense because they have to pay three and \nfour times as much in the United States as they would in Canada. That \nis disgraceful. If this Congress does not address it with not only a \nprescription drug benefit but also some effort to have reasonable \ncontrol of price increases, we are not listening to the people we were \nsent here to represent.\n\n  We can talk about estate taxes. We can talk about people making over \n$300,000 a year. But we have lost touch with reality and we have lost \ntouch with America if we do not understand the cost of prescription \ndrugs is something that haunts literally millions of Americans every \nsingle day. That is something we can and must do something about in the \nimmediate future.\n  We have to bring Medicare in line with reality. The reality is that \nprescription drugs can keep you out of the hospital, keep you home and \nhealthy, keep you independent and strong. When Medicare was created, \nthere was no prescription drug benefit. Forty years ago, there were not \nthat many drugs around, for that matter. But the world has changed. You \nwould not buy a health insurance policy today that did not have some \nprescription drug benefit in it. Today, the most vulnerable people in \nAmerica are seniors and\n\n[[Page S7114]]\n\ndisabled under Medicare who virtually have no prescription drug \nprotection whatsoever.\n  We want to change that. We, on the Democratic side, believe if we do \nnothing else this year, we should enact a prescription drug benefit. We \ncan then say to our parents and grandparents and the elderly we love in \nthis country: We have heard your message. Again, I say while we should \nhave been debating that, we were debating an estate tax change that \nends up giving almost $23,000 a year to some of the wealthiest people \nin America.\n  Look at how this works out in terms of the different income groups \nand how much they receive. As I mentioned, the lowest 20 percent of \nwage earners in America, under the Republican plan, get $2 a month. \nWhat can you buy with that nowadays? Maybe a coke at McDonald's, I \nguess. Then up here at the highest level, those making over $300,000 a \nyear, $23,000 in breaks on the Republican tax plan. Again, the inequity \nis so obvious--the fact that the people who are struggling the hardest, \nworking the hardest, doing the most to make America strong, are the \npeople who are being ignored by the Republican tax relief.\n  This is not the first time that has occurred. Take a look at some of \nthese charts involving Republican tax cuts from years gone by. You will \nsee every single time the Republicans have had a chance--in August of \n1999; in May of 2000, the House minimum wage proposal; in March of \n2000, and the Republican Congress estate tax repeal--at least 41 \npercent of all the tax benefits went to the very richest, the top 1 \npercent in America.\n  When it came to the minimum wage, the same thing was true. Think \nabout that minimum wage for a second. How long could you survive on \n$5.15 an hour on a job? Well, 350,000 people in my home State of \nIllinois got up this morning and went to work, and they are being paid \ntoday $5.15 an hour. These are not lazy people. These are some of the \nhardest working people in my State. These are people cleaning the \ntables, making the beds, doing the laundry, doing the dry cleaning, \nwatching our children in day care, and these people are being paid \n$5.15 an hour.\n  We have tried, with Senator Kennedy, for over 2 years to increase the \nminimum wage in this country, and we have been told America just cannot \nafford it. We cannot afford to give people who go to work every single \nday a livable, decent wage of $6.15. That is hardly a great sum of \nmoney, but at least it tries to keep up with the cost of living.\n  The same Congress and the same leadership that has rejected a 50-\ncent-an-hour wage increase for some of the hardest working people in \nAmerica wants to turn around and give a tax break of $23,000 a year to \nthose making over $300,000.\n  Doesn't it strike you as odd that they are willing to give a tax \nbreak to folks making over $300,000 a year, which is the equivalent of \nmore than twice the income of a person earning the minimum wage? Where \nis the sensitivity to America? I can't understand how the Republicans \ncan feel the ``pain'' of the wealthy but can't feel the pain of those \nwho are working hard every single day to try to make a living and to \ntry to make America better.\n  Again and again, given the chance to come up with the Republican tax \ncuts, we find that the richest in America are the ones who profit. We \njust ended up passing the so-called marriage penalty tax cut and \nexactly the same rules apply. Who are the people who will benefit from \nthis? Under the Republican plan, this so-called marriage penalty turns \nout to be a marriage bonus.\n  The idea, of course, behind it is if two individuals are earning a \ncertain income and decide to get married and they combine their income \non a joint return, many times they find themselves moving up to a \nhigher income tax bracket. That is wrong. We should change it. The \nDemocrats support that change and that reform.\n  The Republicans say that is not enough. They say: For those who \nhappen to get married--and one is working and one isn't--we want to \nlower the tax rate in their situation, even though there is no tax \npenalty. You end up giving a break where, frankly, it is not needed. So \nthe tax break goes to whose who are not being penalized.\n  When you look at the ultimate benefit of it, you see, once again, the \ntop 20 percent of earners in America are the ones who benefit the most \nfrom the Republican plan. And 25.7 percent of all the benefits under \nthis plan go to the richest 5 percent in the country, and 78 percent of \nit goes to the richest 20 percent in the country.\n  Again and again, given a chance to help working families and young \nmarried people who are struggling to get a start in life, the \nRepublicans have said, no. They say the first people to help are the \nrichest people in our society. That, to me, does not make sense.\n  What we have suggested, under the marriage penalty, is that we should \nhave a simple, straightforward plan. We should define the marriage \npenalty as when a married couple pays more as a married couple than \nthey would as two singles. Very simple. We say let married couples \nearning below $100,000 have a choice in filing. They can file as two \nsingles or as a couple. The proposal could not be more simple.\n  The Democratic alternative completely eliminates each and every one \nof the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code for taxpayers making \n$100,000 a year or less. It reduces the marriage penalty for taxpayers \nmaking between $100,000 and $150,000. I think it is realistic, \ngenerous, and makes a lot of sense. I supported that, but that is not \nwhat passed the Senate a few minutes ago.\n  What passed is a benefit that will, frankly, go to the wealthiest \npeople in this country. Again and again, we forget those who are making \nAmerica great, working every single day. We forget those who need help \nin paying college education expenses.\n  We forget those who, frankly, have to make a tough decision at some \npoint in the life of their son or daughter: Where are they going to go \nto college? Every parent dreams of their son or daughter getting into \nthe very best school, and then they try to think of how they are going \nto pay for it. Many times they can't; they are unable to pay for it. \nThey have to have that sad meeting in their household where they \ndiscuss it and say: Maybe you will have to stay home for a year. Maybe \nyou will go to a school closer to home for a couple years, and then \nmaybe, just maybe, if we save enough, you will get your chance to \nrealize your dream and go to the very best school where you have been \naccepted.\n\n  That is a sad situation for a lot of families, but it is a real \nsituation. We know what has happened to college education expenses. \nAnybody you talk to can tell you that particularly private schools but \nmany public educational institutions have seen their costs increase \ndramatically. Families struggle with paying for that.\n  We came up with a suggestion on the floor of a tax deduction to help \nfamilies pay for college education expenses. Rejected by the Republican \nmajority, their belief was, if we are going to give tax relief, let's \ngive it to the folks who are making over $300,000 a year.\n  Prescription drugs, college education expenses, child care, helping \nto pay for your aging parents, that is my top list when it comes to tax \nrelief in this country. But, sadly, with the Republican majority in \ncontrol of the Congress now, that will not be the list that is listened \nto or followed when you talk about tax relief.\n  In just a few weeks, the major political parties will go through the \nquadrennial exercise of heading off for their national conventions--the \nRepublicans to Philadelphia, the Democrats to Los Angeles. Of course, \nthere will be a lot of speeches. The networks have decided it is not \nworth listening to, and they are going to tune us out most of the time. \nBut you will read about it and probably catch some items in the news. \nYou will hear a lot of claims being made.\n  You can count on the message coming out of Philadelphia--the \nRepublican Convention--where they will say: President Clinton had a \nchance to cut your taxes, and he didn't do it. He vetoed the bills that \nthe Republicans passed in the Congress.\n  A lot of people back home might say: That is a shame because I need a \ntax cut.\n  But for 98 percent of the American families listening to those shows, \nguess what, you were not protected or improved in any way by those tax \ncuts. They go to the top 2 percent of the American people. Those are \nthe ones, the biggest wage earners in America, who will benefit.\n\n[[Page S7115]]\n\n  Of course, at the Democratic Convention, you will hear us talk about \nissues that this Congress has refused to even consider--the \nprescription drug benefit, an increase in the minimum wage, and gun \nsafety legislation. Think about that. Of course, if you turn on the \ntelevision in the morning or pick up a newspaper, you hear of another \nincident of a child shooting up a school. And you think to yourself: \nWhat is America coming to that this can happen, in what is supposed to \nbe one of the safest places in our country, that kids can take guns to \nschool?\n  We were paralyzed a year ago--a little over a year ago now--at the \ntragedy at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. To think that 12 \nkids could be killed, and so many others terrorized by those who would \ncome upon these weapons and take them to school and open fire.\n  Every mother and father, and every schoolteacher and administrator, \nand many students across America said: What are we going to do to \nprotect ourselves? They turned to Congress because we are representing \nthese people and their families and said: Can you do something?\n\n  We came up with gun safety legislation. Let me tell you what it \nproposed. It wouldn't end gun violence in America, but it was an effort \nto try to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children. We \nsaid: If you are going to buy a gun from a gun dealer in America, we \nare going to check on who you are. We want to know something about your \nbackground. It is the Brady law. We stopped a half a million people \nfrom buying guns who should not have bought them because they were too \nyoung, they had a criminal history or a history of mental illness. That \nlaw has worked.\n  But the same people could have turned around and gone to a gun show \nat the local armory and bought the same guns without any background \ncheck. Those are the guns that we are finding more and more popping up \nin high schools and schools across America, guns purchased at gun \nshows, by those who were ineligible or questionable. They turn around \nand sell them. Kids get their hands on them. So we enacted legislation \nthat said: We will do a background check at gun shows, too, to try to \nkeep guns out of the hands of criminals and children and those who \nwould misuse them.\n  That bill passed. It was a tie vote, 49-49, when Vice President Gore \ncame and cast the tiebreaking vote. That was over a year ago. Nothing \nhas happened to that bill since. It went over to the House of \nRepresentatives, and the gun lobby ripped it to shreds. They sent it to \na conference committee, where it has been sitting moribund for \nliterally a year, while gun violence continues in America and claims \nthe lives of 12 or 13 of our children every single day.\n  One of the other provisions in that bill came from Senator Kohl of \nWisconsin. He said: When you sell a handgun in America, it should have \na child safety device or a trigger lock on it so kids can't get their \nhands on them and hurt themselves or their playmates or their \nclassmates. That was part of the bill that we passed out of here. That \nwas stopped by the gun lobby, as well.\n  When you think about it, many parents who decide not to have a \nfirearm in their homes because they have small children never know, \nwhen their son or daughter goes to play next door, what the \ncircumstances might be--whether those same kids are going to be \nvulnerable to some child finding a gun in a drawer or up on a shelf, \nplay with it, and kill their playmate. You read about it almost every \nsingle day.\n  So this commonsense idea that we will have child safety devices or \ntrigger locks on handguns in America was in the bill we sent over to \nthe House. It was stopped cold--stopped dead in its tracks--by the gun \nlobby. They said: We have just gone too far. It is just too radical a \nsuggestion that we would sell child safety devices with handguns.\n  The third provision was from the Senator from California, Mrs. \nFeinstein, who said: It is against the law to manufacturer and sell \nhigh-capacity ammo clips in the United States, but there is a loophole. \nYou can import them from overseas. And it is pretty simple to do.\n  She put into law the provision that you won't be able to buy high-\ncapacity ammo clips that hold up to 100 cartridges and bullets. You \nhave to ask yourself: What sportsman or hunter needs 100 cartridges or \nbullets? I believe if you need a high-capacity ammo clip and a \nsemiassault weapon to go and shoot a deer, perhaps you ought to stick \nto fishing.\n  In many instances in America, the people who are buying these high-\ncapacity ammo clips are turning around and using them for these gang \nbanger activities and drive-by shootings that you read about, sadly, \nhere in Washington, DC, and Chicago and cities across America.\n  That was the third provision in the gun safety bill. That was the \nthird provision that the National Rifle Association said was \nunacceptable: We cannot restrict the right of American hunters and \nsportsmen to have high-capacity ammo clips that hold over 100 \ncartridges.\n  To my way of thinking, common sense requires us to say to people who \nwant to exercise their right to legally and safely use a firearm that \nthey, too, have to face some restriction on their activity. Those who \nhave visited Washington, DC, as tourists may have gone through an \nairport and through a metal detector. It is an inconvenience we accept \nbecause we want to be safe when we get on that airplane. To ask that \nthose who own firearms face similar inconveniences is not unreasonable, \nunless you happen to be the National Rifle Association. They think it \nis unreasonable to impose any restrictions whatsoever.\n  As a result, sadly, every morning in America, when you pick up the \npaper, you see instances where children are being killed, instances \nwhere kids are taking guns to school, instances where with some \nforesight and some political courage, this Congress might have been \nable to do something. We have not.\n  This has been a do-nothing-for-the-people Congress, as Vice President \nGore has said. It has failed to take into consideration what the \naverage working family in this country expects of us, not only to \nbalance the books but to balance our priorities, to make sure the \npeople who prosper because of our judgments and our decisions and our \nlegislative leadership are the families across America.\n  I think also of the uninsured in this country. To think that in this \ntime of prosperity in America, after the longest run of economic \nprogress in the history of the United States, at a time when we are \nenvisioning surpluses that have never been seen in our history, that we \nstill live in a country with 40 million people who are uninsured. I \noffered an amendment to my friends in the Senate that said we ought to \ngive a tax credit to small businesses to help pay for health insurance \nfor their employees. These are the businesses that pay the highest \nhealth insurance premiums to protect the family who owns the business \nas well as their employees. These are the employees working for small \nbusinesses who make the lowest incomes. Not surprisingly, they turn out \nto be the largest source of uninsured people in this country, those \nworkers and their children.\n  What I propose, as part of our tax package on the Democratic side, is \nto say to small businesses: We will give you a helping hand. We will \ngive you a tax credit so that you can offer health insurance to your \nemployees. It strikes me as one of the basics we should consider.\n  Just a few years ago, we initiated a nationwide plan to help the \nStates pay for covering the children of working parents with health \ninsurance. It is called the CHIP program. It is working well in my \nState of Illinois and across the Nation. Congress is trying to plug the \nholes of 40 million uninsured people in America.\n  We had a hearing the other day that would have broken many hearts. \nThe mothers and fathers of very disabled children came to tell us about \ntheir plight. They depend on SSI, a program under Social Security and \nMedicaid, to provide for kids who are profoundly retarded or disabled. \nThey find, sadly, they earn too much money. We heard from a woman who \ntalked about a situation where her State came to her and said: You can \nno longer provide for your child with your income; you just don't have \nenough money. We want you to turn your child over to be a ward of the \nState.\n  Imagine, in America, in the country in which we live, parents who are \nstruggling to raise disabled children\n\n[[Page S7116]]\n\nare told that the only answer is to turn their child over to become \na ward of the State. That was what she faced. Her health insurance did \nnot cover her needs.\n\n  Then there was a sergeant in the Air Force who came to see us with \nhis lovely little 9-year-old daughter, Lauren, who has some serious \nmedical difficulties. This is a man who has given most of his adult \nlife to his country in the Air Force. He was recently given a promotion \nto E-6, where he would make $200 more a month. With that $200 more a \nmonth, he was disqualified from receiving Medicaid and SSI. He said it \nwould cost him over $500 a month to take care of his little daughter. \nSo as he gets a tiny increase in pay of $200 a month, he sees that $500 \nof medical bills fall on his shoulders.\n  These are people in America without health insurance. These are \npeople who I think about when I think about the surplus that we are \nexperiencing. What are we going to do with this to extend health \ninsurance coverage to more and more Americans so it is no longer a \nquestion that parents ask their emancipated kids, as I have asked my \ndaughter, Jennifer: Do you have health insurance now? She is a student \nwho works from time to time, does her very best, but I worry about it \nas a father. I shouldn't have to. No one should have to in this \ncountry. Health insurance ought to be a given in America--not the \nfanciest and most expensive policy but a basic policy.\n  Is Congress debating that? Is Congress even thinking about it? Is \nCongress sensitive to it? No. We are debating tax breaks for people \nmaking over $300,000 a year. That is our priority. The priority is not \nthe parents of the handicapped children, the children of America who \nare uninsured, the 40 million uninsured Americans in general. That is \nwhere we lost sight of the true reality of the challenges facing \nAmerican families.\n  The choices on the floor of the Senate are clear, and the choices for \nthe American people in the election will be clear in terms of the \nvalues that should be represented when we decide who will benefit from \nthe surplus we have generated and the strong economy of the last 8 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, in the year-and-a-half that I have been \nin the Senate, I have taken several opportunities to come to the floor \nto talk about the need to reduce our national debt.\n  Every chance I get, I remind my colleagues that we cannot let the \nexcitement of having a record-high surplus allow us to lose sight of \nthe fact that we must keep spending in check, and use our Social \nSecurity surplus and on-budget surplus dollars to pay down our $5.7 \ntrillion national debt.\n  I can't help but wonder why the media is quick to report that we have \nsuch tremendous surpluses, but is virtually silent when it comes to \nreporting that we have such a huge national debt.\n  I think the people need to know that we have a national debt that is \ncosting us $224 billion in interest payments a year, and that \ntranslates into $600 million per day just to pay the interest. Out of \nevery federal dollar that is spent this year, 13 cents will go to pay \nthe interest on the national debt. In comparison, 16 cents will go for \nnational defense; 18 cents will go for non-defense discretionary \nspending; and 53 cents will go for entitlement spending. Right now, we \nspend more federal tax dollars on debt interest than we do on the \nentire Medicare program.\n  This debt didn't accumulate overnight. In fact, it took decades of \nmisguided fiscal policies on the part of the Congress and the Executive \nBranch to get this way. But, fortunately, we have an opportunity, with \nour strong economy and low unemployment, to make some headway on paying \ndown our debt.\n  Nearly every family in America or every business owner in America, \nwhen they come into some extra money, would use that surplus money to \npay off their loans, their credit cards, etc.--whatever debt they had \naccumulated.\n  And that's precisely what the U.S. government should do.\n  I don't think our Nation is any different from our families. If we \nhave some extra money, we ought to get rid of the debt we are carrying \non our back.\n  As my colleagues know, because of the expanding economy, CBO's April \nsurplus estimates showed that we had attained a $26 billion on-budget \nsurplus in fiscal year 2000.\n  And I would like to remind my colleagues that $22 billion of that $26 \nbillion surplus was from payroll tax overpayments to the Medicare Trust \nFund.\n  However, of that $26 billion surplus amount, the fiscal year 2001 \nbudget resolution assumed we would spend $14 billion of it.\n  That left $12 billion, which I felt should be used for debt \nreduction, and so I sought to find a legislative remedy to have those \nfunds allocated solely for the purpose of debt reduction.\n  On June 15th, by a vote of 95-3, the Senate passed an amendment to \nthe Transportation Appropriations bill that Senator Allard and I \nsponsored, directing the remaining $12 billion on-budget surplus to be \nused for debt reduction. It was a tremendous victory, but, recognizably \nshort-lived.\n  Over the last two months, Congress has spent $13.8 billion in an \n``emergency'' supplemental appropriations package that was included as \npart of the Military Construction Appropriations Conference Report, and \nan additional $5.5 billion has been allocated for payments for another \n``ag bailout'' bill with the passage of the Crop Insurance Reform \npackage.\n  Thus, nearly all but $4 billion of the $26 billion surplus has been \nspent, including just about all of the $22 billion in overpayments to \nthe Medicare Trust Fund--money that we in Congress have been talking \nabout ``lock-boxing'' to prevent it from being spent in just such a \nmanner.\n  With all this added spending, I would like to remind my colleagues \nthat we are significantly raising discretionary spending this year--a \nhabit Congress seems reluctant to break. For example, in fiscal year \n1998, Congress spent $555 billion on discretionary spending. In fiscal \nyear 1999 we increased discretionary spending to $575 billion--a 4% \nincrease over that one year.\n  In fiscal year 2000, if you factor in the emergency supplemental \nappropriations we approved two weeks ago, discretionary spending will \nbe $618 billion. Compared to last year's $575 billion, if my figures \nare right, that is a 7.5% increase so far in discretionary spending.\n  How many people in this country can say that they received a 7.5% pay \nincrease from last year?\n  This is outrageous, and all the more reason we can't allow spending \nto grow any further in FY 2000.\n  When given the opportunity to spend more or bring down our national \ndebt, Congress has to learn to make the tough choices--the fiscally \nprudent choices.\n  Fortunately, we will have another opportunity to curb spending and \nmake a dent in our national debt.\n  Today, we have received the expected news from CBO that our fiscal \nyear 2000 on-budget surplus has grown to $84 billion--$60 billion more \nthan was projected in January.\n  With such a large amount of on-budget surplus dollars at stake, I \nfear that, again, the temptation will be enormous to spend these \ndollars--and with even greater zeal than before. We must ignore the \nallure of spending these surpluses, and remember that the best thing we \ncould do with these funds is use them to pay down the debt.\n  For those of my colleagues who support tax cuts, I would like to \nremind them that the only thing that we can do with these FY 2000 \nsurplus funds this year is use them to increase spending or pay down \nthe national debt. That's it. They cannot be used for tax cuts because \nthe fiscal year is almost over.\n  I have recently read an excellent paper written by Peter B. Sperry, \nwho is the Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at the \nHeritage Foundation, regarding our obligation to use our surplus \ndollars to pay down our national debt.\n\n[[Page S7117]]\n\n  I believe each of my colleagues should read this compelling article, \nand I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the article be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit I.)\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I agree with the conclusion that Mr. \nSperry reaches in his paper, and that is, Congress needs to enact \nlegislation that will automatically take the $60 billion windfall we \njust received for fiscal year 2000 and use it to pay down the debt.\n  The bill that Mr. Sperry says that Congress needs to pass is H.R. \n4601, the Debt Reduction Reconciliation Act of 2000. Fortunately, on \nJune 20th, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 4601, by a vote of \n419-5. An overwhelming majority--just think of it.\n  I have reviewed this bill, and I believe H.R. 4601 is our last hope \nto pass meaningful debt-reduction legislation this year. That is why I \nasked that this bill be held at the desk and put on the Senate's \ncalendar, instead of being sent to Committee. We must consider this \nlegislation now, and we need to let the American people know that \nCongress is serious about reducing the national debt and not merely \npaying lip-service towards that goal.\n  In particular, the bill establishes an off-budget account at the U.S. \nTreasury that would be called the Public Debt Reduction Payment \nAccount. Any funds that are over the amount specified in CBO's January \nsurplus estimate of $24 billion would be transferred to the Account, \nwhere they would be automatically used to reduce the debt. Thus, $60 \nbillion in on-budget surplus funds for FY 2000 would be directed \ntowards debt reduction.\n  My fear is that before any of the extra FY 2000 funds actually go \ntowards debt reduction, Congress and the President--especially the \nPresident--will say, ``well, we've got the money, let's spend it and \nget out of town.'' But Mr. President, that's definitely not how it \nshould work.\n  We have a moral obligation to use this money to pay down the debt, \nand I would like to read a quote from General Accounting Office (GAO) \nComptroller General David Walker that hits the nail right on the head \nregarding that obligation. In testimony before the House Ways and Means \nCommittee last year, Mr. Walker said:\n\n       This generation has a stewardship responsibility to future \n     generations to reduce the debt burden they inherit, to \n     provide a strong foundation for future economic growth, and \n     to ensure that future commitments are both adequate and \n     affordable. Prudence requires making the tough choices today \n     while the economy is healthy and the workforce is relatively \n     large--before we are hit by the baby boom's demographic tidal \n     wave.\n\n  To me, the most important thing that we can do on behalf of our \nchildren and our grandchildren is to remove the yoke of this debt \nburden from their backs. If we do so, it will strike a blow for their \nfuture and for the future of our nation.\n  It is the responsibility of the House and the Senate to ``stop the \nhemorrhaging of spending'' by agreeing to let the remaining on-budget \nsurplus for FY 2000 go towards paying down the national debt. H.R. 4601 \nwill meet that challenge, and it is now up to the Senate to pass this \nbill. Let's get it done, Mr. President, and let's get it done now.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n             [From The Heritage Foundation, June 13, 2000]\n\n           How To Protect the Surplus From Wasteful Spending\n\n                          (By Peter B. Sperry)\n\n       Although most Americans assume that a federal budget \n     surplus in any year is automatically used to reduce the \n     national debt, or at least the debt held by the public, this \n     actually is not the case. The U.S. Department of the Treasury \n     must implement specific financial accounting procedures if it \n     is to use a cash surplus to pay down the debt held by the \n     public. If these procedures are not followed, or if they \n     proceed slowly, then the surplus revenue just builds up in \n     the Treasury's operating cash accounts.\n       This excess cash could be used in the future to further \n     reduce the debt, but only if it is protected from other uses \n     in the meantime. Until the excess cash is formally committed \n     to debt repayment, Congress could appropriate it for other \n     purposes. Consequently, the current surplus will not \n     automatically reduce the publicly held national debt of $3.54 \n     trillion unless Congress acts now to make sure these funds \n     are automatically used for debt reduction and for no other \n     purpose.\n       There is a parallel to this in household finance. When a \n     family with a large mortgage, credit card debt, and several \n     student loans receives an unexpected financial windfall, it \n     usually deposits the funds in a checking account and takes a \n     little time to consider how best to allocate the revenue--\n     whether to refinance the mortgage, pay off credit cards, or \n     establish a rainy day fund. Meanwhile, the family's debt \n     remains, and will not be reduced until the family formally \n     transfers funds to one or more of its creditors. If the \n     family does not take some action in the interim to wall off \n     the cash, it often ends up frittering away the money on new \n     purchases, and the debt remains.\n       The federal government faces a similar situation. Surplus \n     revenues are accumulating in the Treasury Department's \n     operating cash accounts faster than the Bureau of the Public \n     Debt can efficiently dedicate them to reducing the public \n     debt. Consequently, surplus balances in these accounts have \n     reached historic levels, and they are likely to accumulate \n     even faster as the size of the surplus grows. Unless Congress \n     takes formal action to protect these funds, they are \n     available to be used or misused at anytime in the \n     appropriations process. Fortunately, the House soon will \n     consider a bill (H.R. 4601) that would protect the budget \n     surplus from being raided by appropriations until prudent \n     decisions can be made about its use.\n\n\n                    WHY DEBT REDUCTION NEEDS A BOOST\n\n       Thanks to unexpected budget surpluses, the U.S. Department \n     of the Treasury issued less new debt than it redeemed each \n     year. It conducted several ``reverse'' auctions to buy back \n     old high-interest debt. And it successfully reduced the \n     amount of federal debt held by the public in less than three \n     years by $230 billion, from $3.77 trillion in October 1997 to \n     $3.54 trillion in April 2000. Chart 1 clearly shows that its \n     efforts have been successful and impressive.\n       Despite this effort, the Treasury still is awash in cash. \n     Examining the Treasury Department's monthly reports over this \n     same period (see Appendix) reveals that, after accounting for \n     normal seasonal fluctuations, the closing balances of its \n     operating cash accounts have grown dramatically and, more \n     important, the rate at which cash is accumulating in them has \n     accelerated. The linear trend line in Chart 2 shows both the \n     growth in the closing balances in the cash accounts and the \n     projected growth under current conditions. Essentially, if no \n     provisions are made to protect these balances, in August \n     2002--two months before the midterm elections--appropriators \n     would have access to almost $60 billion in non-obligated \n     cash.\n       Unfortunately, even this projection may be too \n     conservative. Examination of month-to-month changes in the \n     closing balances indicates that the rate of cash accumulation \n     has started to accelerate, which will cause the closing \n     balances to grow even faster. The trend line in Chart 3 shows \n     that the amount of positive monthly change in closing cash \n     balances has, after accounting for normal fluctuation, \n     increased since October 1997, and cash balances could start \n     to increase by an average of $20 billion per month within two \n     years.\n       The Treasury Department faces extraordinary cash management \n     challenges as it attempts to repay the debt held by the \n     public steadily and without destabilizing financial markets \n     that depend on federal debt instruments as a standard of \n     measurement. By protecting accumulated cash balances from \n     misuse, Congress could provide the Treasury Department with \n     the flexibility it needs to do its job more effectively.\n\n\n                treasury's limited debt management tools\n\n       The Treasury relies on three basic debt management tools to \n     reduce the debt held by the public in a controlled manner.\n       Issuing Less Debt. As old debt matures and is redeemed, the \n     Treasury Department issues a slightly smaller amount of new \n     debt in return, thereby reducing the total debt held by the \n     public. This is the federal government's most cost-effective \n     and preferred method of debt reduction. However, it is not a \n     simple process to determine how much new debt should be \n     issued. If the Treasury Department returns too much debt to \n     the financial market, it misses an opportunity to retire \n     additional debt. If it returns too little to the markets, the \n     cost of federal debt instruments will rise, driving down \n     their yields and disrupting many private-sector retirement \n     plans.\n       Reverse Auctions. The Treasury Department periodically \n     conducts reverse auctions in which it announces that it will \n     buy a predetermined amount of specific types of debt \n     instruments from whoever will sell them for the best price. \n     This method quickly reduces debt held by the public, but it \n     can be expensive. Investors holding a T-bill that will be \n     worth $1,000 in 20 years may be willing to sell it for $995 \n     if they need the money now and believe that is the best price \n     they can get. However, if they know the Treasury Department \n     has made a commitment to buy a large number of T-bills in a \n     short period of time, investors may hold out for $997--a \n     premium of $2 million on every $1 billion of debt the \n     Treasury Department retires.\n       Purchasing Debt Instruments. The Treasury Department can \n     use private-sector brokers to purchase federal debt \n     instruments on the open market without having it revealed \n     that the client is the federal government.\n\n[[Page S7118]]\n\n     This method is slow, but it allows the Treasury Department to \n     take advantage of unpredictable fluctuations in financial \n     markets to buy back federal debt instruments for the best \n     possible price. This method must be used carefully and \n     discreetly to aovid having investors, upon realizing that the \n     true buyer is the federal government, hold out for higher \n     prices.\n\n\n                WHY TIMING AND FLEXIBILITY ARE IMPORTANT\n\n       The Treasury Department needs time and flexibility to use \n     debt management tools effectively. It often will need to \n     allow large balances to accumulate in the operating cash \n     accounts while it waits for the opportunity to buy back \n     federal debt instruments at the best possible price. If these \n     balances are unprotected, they may prove irresistible \n     temptations for appropriators with special-interest \n     constituencies.\n       A prudent Secretary of the Treasury would not risk \n     disrupting financial markets by recklessly reducing the \n     amount of new debt issued each year, but might increase the \n     number and size of reverse auctions to ensure that surplus \n     revenues are used for debt reduction rather than remain \n     available to congressional appropriators. The taxpayers \n     would, at best, pay more than necessary to retire the federal \n     debt, and they might find that appropriators have spent the \n     surplus before it could be used to pay down debt.\n\n\n                    MAKING DEBT REDUCTION AUTOMATIC\n\n       Fortunately, Congress has the opportunity to ensure that \n     the Treasury's large cash balances are not misused in the \n     appropriations process. The U.S. House of Representatives \n     will soon consider H.R. 4601, the debt Reduction \n     Reconciliation Act of 2000, recently approved by the House \n     Ways and Means Committee. This legislation, sponsored by \n     Representative Ernest Fletcher (R-KY), is designed to give \n     the Treasury Department the time and flexibility it needs to \n     use debt management tools most effectively. It would protect \n     the on-budget surplus revenues collected during the \n     remainder of fiscal year (FY) 2000 and appropriate them \n     for debt reduction by depositing them in a designated \n     ``off budget'' Public Debt Reduction Account.\n       Although the surplus revenues could still cause an increase \n     in cash balances, the cash would be dedicated in the Debt \n     Reduction Account rather than in the Treasury Department's \n     operating cash account. Appropriators would be able to \n     reallocate these funds only by first rescinding the \n     appropriation for debt reduction in legislation that would \n     have to pass both houses of Congress and gain presidential \n     approval. Once surplus revenues are deposited in the Debt \n     Reduction Account, appropriators would have very limited \n     ability to increase spending without creating an on-budget \n     deficit, which many taxpayers would perceive as a raid on the \n     Social Security trust fund.\n       H.R. 4601 would effectively protect the surplus revenues \n     that are collected during the remainder of FY 2000; moreover, \n     it serves as model for how Congress should allocate \n     unexpected windfalls in the future. It does not preclude tax \n     reform because it is limited to the current fiscal year and \n     therefore affects only revenues that have already been \n     collected or that will be collected before any tax reform \n     legislation takes effect. Nevertheless, once the Debt \n     Reduction Account is established, Congress could continue to \n     appropriate funds to the account at any time. Consequently, \n     Congress would retain the option to reduce revenues through \n     tax reform and still have a mechanism to prevent unexpected \n     surplus revenues, once collected, from being used for any \n     purpose other than debt reduction.\n       H.R. 4601 would give the Treasury flexibility to use its \n     debt reduction tools in the most effective manner. Surplus \n     revenues deposited in the Debt Reduction Account would remain \n     available until expended, but only for debt reduction. The \n     department would be able to schedule reverse auctions at the \n     most advantageous times, make funds available to brokers \n     buying back debt on the open markets or decrease the size of \n     new debt issues--depending on which mechanism, or combination \n     of tools, proves most cost effective. There would no longer \n     be pressure to ``use it or lose it.''\n\n\n                        how to improve h.r. 4601\n\n       Although H.R. 4601 demonstrates a real commitment of \n     members of the House to fiscal discipline, the legislation \n     could be improved. Congress should consider requiring the \n     Secretary of the Treasury also to deposit all revenue \n     received from the sale of Special Issue Treasury Bills \n     (which are sold only to the Social Security \n     Administration) in the Debt Reduction Account. This would \n     preclude the possibility of any future raids on the Social \n     Security trust fund.\n       Congress should also consider adding language to H.R. 4601 \n     to automatically appropriate future real (rather than \n     projected) surplus revenues to the Debt Reduction Account. \n     This would allow Congress the flexibility to implement tax \n     reforms while also guaranteeing that surplus revenues, once \n     collected, could be used only for debt reduction.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Many Americans assume that if surplus revenues are not used \n     for spending or tax cuts, they automatically reduce the \n     national debt. Indeed, this has become an unstated premise in \n     discussions of fiscal policy, whether in the press, academia, \n     or Congress. Unfortunately, the premise is incorrect.\n       To make the premise true, the Treasury Department should be \n     able to make specific provisions for retiring debt. If it is \n     not given the power and obligation to do so, the surplus \n     revenues accumulating in its operating cash accounts will be \n     subject to misuse by appropriations. Congress has an \n     opportunity and obligation to give the Treasury Department \n     the time and flexibility it needs to utilize its debt \n     management tools effectively when it considers H.R. 4601. \n     This bill offers an effective first step toward the goal of \n     making sure that budget surpluses do not disappear in new \n     spending programs.\n\n\n                       what is the national debt?\n\n       The national debt consists of Treasury notes, T-bills, and \n     savings bonds that were sold to raise cash to pay the ongoing \n     operational expenses of the federal government. National debt \n     held by the public consists of debt instruments sold to \n     anyone other than a federal trust fund. Most federal debt \n     held by the public is owned by state and local governments, \n     pension plans, mutual funds, and individual retirement \n     portfolios.\n       Most investors consider federal debt instruments to be cash \n     equivalents that pay interest, and they are strongly \n     motivated to hold them until maturity--up to 30 years in the \n     case of T-bills. Many institutional investors, particularly \n     pension funds, are required to maintain a certain portion of \n     their portfolio in cash equivalents, and they depend on the \n     federal government to issue new debt when their old \n     investments mature and are redeemed. In additional, many \n     lenders, particularly mortgage companies, use the market \n     price of federal debt instruments as a measurement device to \n     determine appropriate rates of return on alternative \n     investments. These lenders rely on the federal government to \n     maintain enough federal debt in circulation to make this \n     measurement valid.\n\n                                Appendix\n\n

Mr. President, we are working with the managers of various \npieces of legislation to determine the best way to proceed. Senator \nDaschle and I have been discussing how to proceed. We have had a very \nbusy time over the past 8 days. We have had a lot of votes. We have \ncompleted a lot of work: The Department of Defense authorization bill--\nactually, we completed that with debate at night--the Interior \nappropriations bill today, the death tax elimination legislation last \nFriday, and the marriage tax penalty today.\n  The question is how to proceed at this point. We hope we can complete \naction on the foreign operations appropriations bill so it can go to \nconference, as we did yesterday on the legislative appropriations bill.\n  Our colleagues will recall, we did take that up but didn't complete \nit. We need to get that done so that can go to conference and the House \nand Senate conferees can begin working with the administration to get \nthat important legislation passed. I know they have interest in it. We \ndo, too.\n  We are also committed to getting four appropriations bills done \nbefore we go out for the August recess: Agriculture, which is, I \nbelieve, ready to proceed. The managers are in the area. Senator \nCochran and Senator Kohl are in the area; The energy and water \nappropriations bill is ready to go when we complete Agriculture; \nTreasury-Postal Service will be ready next week, and Commerce-State-\nJustice.\n\n  That would be 11 appropriations bills. That would still leave the \nHUD-VA appropriations bill and the DC appropriations bill. But for a \nvariety of reasons, we probably could not get those two done until some \ntime in September, maybe even the middle of September anyway.\n  Now, there are other issues in which Senators are interested. We have \nbeen discussing ways to proceed to them, or if we could proceed to \nthem. We had discussed the possibility of going to the NCAA gaming \nissue. I discussed that with some of the advocates on this side of the \naisle at noon today. I understand, in fact, we may not be able to \nproceed to that because we have to clear it with a lot of different \nSenators. But we will continue to look to see if we can find a way to \nhave that legislation considered.\n  Senator Daschle will want to comment on a number of these things, and \nmaybe ask questions, too.\n  We still have pending the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We \nput about a week or more into that legislation. A lot of amendments \nhave been offered and voted on. There is a feeling, I hope, on both \nsides of the aisle that we would still like to actually complete that \nlegislation.\n  I would like to consider working on it and at some point proceed the \nway we did on the Defense authorization bill so we actually get it \ncompleted. I am going to talk more with Senator Daschle about that. He \nwill want to consult, I am sure, with the ranking member on his side. I \nwill want to consult with the chairman on our side, Senator Jeffords, \nand Senator Craig, and others who are involved in that.\n  I continue to urge the Judiciary Committee to make progress on \njudicial nominations. There are a number of nominations that have had \nhearings, nominations that are ready for a vote, and other nominations \nthat have been pending for quite some time that should be considered.\n  I have discussed this matter regularly with Senator Hatch, including \nlast Friday afternoon and, again, just briefly yesterday. I cannot make \nthe Judiciary Committee vote. I cannot tell them who to vote on, but I \ncan urge them to continue to work on those nominations that can be \ncleared and can be reported to the Senate.\n  I have been assured by the chairman that they are going to have a \nmarkup and report out some judges on Wednesday of this week or--I \nthought it was Wednesday. Has it been moved to Thursday? I thought it \nwas 10 o'clock on Wednesday. But they are going to report out judges \nthis week and have at least one more hearing before the August recess. \nThey expect to report out another group of judges next week. In that \ngroup will be not only district judges but circuit judges. So I want to \nmake that record clear.\n  With regard to the issue a lot of Senators are interested in, the \nChina permanent normal trade relations issue, we have to finish the \nappropriations bills. But we are discussing now a procedure, which we \ncan discuss, that would allow us to go ahead and proceed to it, take \nsome action on it next week but recognize that because of the time that \ncould be required in having to debate and file cloture on a motion to \nproceed, and other cloture motions that might be necessary, we would \nnot be able to complete it and do the appropriations bills next week.\n  Also, I continue to have a desire to find a way for the Thompson-\nTorricelli issue to be considered, either freestanding or as an \namendment. So we need to get that resolved before we actually move to \nproceed to the China PNTR bill.\n  But I can see, again, the possibility of doing some work on that \nfreestanding at night or doing it as an amendment, or, of course, he \nmay reserve his right and may, in fact, believe he has to actually \noffer it when we go to China PNTR.\n  So what I am proposing here--and I would like Senator Daschle to \ncomment on it--is that we go ahead and complete action on the foreign \noperations appropriations bill, send it to conference; that we go to \nthe Agriculture appropriations bill; that we then take up the other \nappropriations bills in this group --energy and water, Treasury-Postal \nService, and CJS--but that we work to see if we can proceed at night, \nperhaps on Thursday, perhaps next Monday, on the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. I need to consult with Senators that have been \ninvolved in that from the committee--the chairman and others I \nmentioned--and Senator Daschle needs to do the same thing.\n  If we could get an understanding that we would work on all these, we \nwould also entertain the idea of proceeding to the China PNTR \nlegislation next Wednesday. I believe, as it now stands, I would have \nto file a cloture motion on that. That cloture, then, would ripen on \nFriday; I believe that would be the 28th of July, which would be the \nFriday that we would hope to go out for the August recess. That would \nbe the final action, unless 30 hours had to be run off of it at that \ntime. Then we would go back to that when we come back after the August \nrecess in September. The positive effects of that\n\n[[Page S7120]]\n\nwould be that we would show clearly we intend to go to this \nlegislation.\n  We are going to work together to get these appropriations bills done. \nWe are going to go to China PNTR. We are going to get over the first \nhurdle, recognizing that there are several other hurdles that could \nrequire quite a bit of time to complete.\n  But those are sort of the parameters of what Senator Daschle and I \nand others have been talking about.\n  I say to Senator Daschle, why don't I yield the floor so you can make \ncomments on that and/or ask any questions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask a brief question.\n  The majority leader discussed with me earlier, off the floor, about \nthe possibility of bringing up the NCAA prohibition of betting on \ncollege sports. This bill was passed overwhelmingly through the \ncommittee after hearings. Every college coach in America is committed \nto this proposition that betting on college sports should stop.\n  I would allege there would be a vote of 98-2 in this Senate, if it \ncame to a vote. It is something I think we could get done. I think we \ncould get it done quickly. Every college coach in America, the most \nrespected men and women in America, are saying that these young people \nare tempted by this gambling and by this betting.\n  It was a unanimous recommendation of the National Gaming Impact Study \nCommission. I hope that the majority leader and the Senator from South \nDakota would enter into a time agreement so we could get this done and \nstop what every college coach in America is saying is an outstanding \nevil and temptation that needs to be removed from these young Americans \nwho have been basically put in their charge.\n  I hope the majority leader will consider, in consultation with the \nDemocratic leader, that we bring this bill up, get it passed, and get \nit on the President's desk.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to Senator McCain's comments, as I \nindicated to him at lunch, I was prepared and am prepared to move to \nproceed to that issue. I understand perhaps there may be objection to \nproceeding. I had hoped maybe we could get an agreement to go ahead and \nproceed. But we can call it up, and if there is objection, there is \nobjection. We will have to deal with it at that point.\n  Of course, one option is to file cloture to try to overcome that \nobjection. But we would have to factor in the time that would take and \nhow that would play in all these other issues we are trying to balance.\n  Senator Daschle and I thought maybe we could go to it, but we have an \nobligation. Just like I had to talk to Senator McCain, I need to talk \nto Senator Brownback. He has Senators he needs to talk to. I believe--I \ndo not want to speak for him--he indicated he thought perhaps there \nwould be an objection to proceeding. We did not think that was the case \nas early as 11 o'clock today. We will continue to work with the Senator \nbecause I am committed to working with him and Senator Brownback to \nfind a way for this issue to come up and be considered. If we can ever \nget it to a vote, I think the Senator is right; it is going to pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of \nthe majority leader in regard to the NCAA bill. I think there is broad \nsupport for it. But I also recognize that every Senator is within his \nor her rights to object and to prolong consideration of any bill for \nwhatever length of time the rules might allow.\n  We have colleagues on this side of the aisle who have indicated to me \nthat is their intention. I know we have to take that into account as we \nschedule legislation for the balance of this work period. I will \ncertainly work with the distinguished chair of the Commerce Committee \nand the majority leader to find a time, either through an amendment or \nthrough a freestanding bill, to bring it up.\n  Senator Lott has articulated very clearly the discussions he and I \nhave had over the last hour or so. He has expressed the desire to me--\nnot only to me, to the Senate on several occasions--that we finish at \nleast 11 appropriations bills. I have indicated my hope that we could \naccommodate that kind of schedule, even though we recognize the \ndisruptions in the schedule, even tomorrow, necessary disruptions. I \nthink it is accomplishable. I would like to work with him to attempt to \ntry to resolve these matters. I have indicated to him that a number of \ncolleagues on this side of the aisle have indicated to me that in order \nfor us to do that there would be a need to address a number of other \nissues.\n  The majority leader has identified each of those issues and responded \njust as we discussed. It is my understanding that there will be a \nmarkup in the Judiciary Committee on future judicial nominations. I \nhope, as the majority leader has indicated, it will include both \ncircuit and district judges. It is my understanding that is likely to \noccur. He has also now indicated that we will get another batch of them \ndone next week and that a mix of circuit and district judges is also \nanticipated. I am very pleased with that information and commend him \nfor his efforts to move this process along. He has operated in \nextraordinarily good faith in working with me to try to move these \nnominations along. I know it is not easy. It is very difficult. But he \nhas certainly been a major factor in getting us to this point.\n  We have again indicated the desire, as we have on several occasions, \nto bring up PNTR, at least through a motion to proceed beginning next \nWednesday. I subscribe to his suggestion or his proposal that would \nallow us to vote on cloture on the motion to proceed on Friday. We \nwould then have 30 hours of debate. Senators who wish to discuss the \nmatter beyond the vote or perhaps preceding the vote would certainly be \nentitled to do so. We could have the vote either on Friday or \nimmediately after we come back. That would accommodate at least \novercoming one major hurdle. I applaud him for approaching the issue in \nthat way.\n  Third, we have discussed on several occasions on the floor our hope \nand desire that we can use the dual track that worked very successfully \nin accommodating Senators' needs to address a number of issues but also \nin finishing legislation, as we did with the Defense authorization \nbill. There came a point when we had exhausted the amendment process \nand rightfully brought the issue to closure. I hope, as Senator Lott \nhas noted, that we might be able to do that with ESEA as well. It is \nimportant for us to resume this dual track. I am very pleased with the \nmajority leader's commitment to continue a dual-track process over the \ncourse of the next couple of weeks. We have the opportunity to get a \nlot of work done--work on appropriations bills, work on judges, work on \nPNTR, and work on ESEA--as a dual-track vehicle with which we can work \nto offer other amendments. I am pleased with our discussions and hope \nwe can proceed with that understanding.\n  I, again, thank the majority leader for his willingness to work with \nus and accommodate all of these important matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment both leaders. This is \nincredibly complex, all of the scheduling. We have had lots of \nconversations. Every Senator in this body has had conversations with \nboth of them, and I know they are trying to do their very best to work \nall this out. Not getting into any specific item, I am appreciative of \nthe tone and nature of the conversation I have just heard and of the \nitems mentioned. As one Senator, I wanted to tell them how much I \nappreciate their working together to get these things up along the \nlines they have outlined.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am glad to yield to the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I add my thanks to the two leaders for \ntheir efforts. We watch them with admiration as they seek to work \nthrough these multiple challenges. We have had many discussions \nconcerning one of the items about which they talked. I just couldn't \nsit here without adding my gratitude to both of them.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator.\n  Let me note, for instance, the types of things we do need to \naccommodate. The Senate tomorrow will want to accommodate Senators \nwishing to attend the services for Senator Pastore, a\n\n[[Page S7121]]\n\ngreat Senator from the State of Rhode Island. A delegation will be \nattending those services tomorrow morning. We will continue to work, \nbut we will withhold the votes or stack the votes, if any are required, \nuntil the afternoon at 2 or 2:30. I don't know exactly what time it \nwould be, but I know Senator Cochran would want to do that. That is the \nkind of situation we have to try to accommodate. We can't always \ndictate how we will proceed because we want to do this in memory of a \nSenator who served in this body for many years.\n  We will continue to act in good faith to try to make sure Senators' \nwishes are known and accommodated. We may not be able to get them all \nworked out. As to the NCAA gaming, I thought maybe we could move to \nproceed to that without objection, but there may be a legitimate one. I \nhad promised a couple of Senators we would make sure they knew of that.\n  I will also need to talk to Senators about the best night that we \ncould do some work on ESEA. Senator Daschle will want to do the same in \nview of that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the majority leader will withhold, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand there may be some clarification that needs to \nbe completed before we can proceed to the appropriations bill for \nAgriculture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7121-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7121-S7142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                       APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the programs contained in the Department of State's \n     Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related \n     Programs (NADR) budget line are vital to the national \n     security of the United States; and\n       (2) funding for those programs should be restored in any \n     conference report with respect to this Act to the levels \n     requested in the President's budget.\n\n\n     MOTHER-TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION OF HIV/AIDS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA\n\n       Sec. 596. (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) According to the World Health Organization, in 1999, \n     there were 5,600,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS throughout the \n     world, and two-thirds of those (3,800,000) were in sub-\n     Saharan Africa.\n       (2) Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world \n     where a majority of those with HIV/AIDS--55 percent--are \n     women.\n       (3) When women get the disease, they often pass it along to \n     their children, and over 2,000,000 children in sub-Saharan \n     Africa are living with HIV/AIDS.\n       (4) New investments and treatments hold out promise of \n     making progress against mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS. For example--\n       (A) a study in Uganda demonstrated that a new drug could \n     prevent almost one-half of the HIV transmissions from mothers \n     to infants, at a fraction of the cost of other treatments; \n     and\n       (B) a study of South Africa's population estimated that if \n     all pregnant women in that country took an antiviral \n     medication during labor, as many as 110,000 new cases of HIV/\n     AIDS could be prevented over the next five years in South \n     Africa alone.\n       (5) The Technical Assistance, Trade Promotion, and Anti-\n     Corruption Act of 2000, as approved by the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee on March 23, 2000, ensures that not less \n     than 8.3 percent of the United States Agency for \n     International Development's (USAID) HIV/AIDS funding is used \n     to combat mother-to-child transmission.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that of the funds provided in this Act, the USAID should \n     place a high priority on efforts, including providing \n     medications, to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS.\n\n\n                     REPORTING REQUIREMENT ON SUDAN\n\n       Sec. 597. One hundred and twenty days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit a report to \n     the appropriate congressional committees--\n       (1) describing--\n       (A) the areas of Sudan open to the delivery of humanitarian \n     or other assistance through or from Operation Lifeline Sudan \n     (in this section referred to as ``OLS''), both in the \n     Northern and Southern sectors;\n       (B) the extent of actual deliveries of assistance through \n     or from OLS to those areas from January 1997 through the \n     present;\n       (C) areas of Sudan which cannot or do not receive \n     assistance through or from OLS, and the specific reasons for \n     lack or absence of coverage, including--\n       (i) denial of access by the government of Sudan on a \n     periodic basis (``flight bans''), including specific times \n     and duration of denials from January 1997 through the \n     present;\n       (ii) denial of access by the government of Sudan on an \n     historic basis (``no-go'' areas) since 1989 and the reason \n     for such denials;\n       (iii) exclusion of areas from the original agreements which \n     defined the limitations of OLS;\n       (iv) a determination by OLS of a lack of need in an area of \n     no coverage;\n       (v) no request has been made to the government of Sudan for \n     coverage or deliveries to those areas by OLS or any \n     participating organization within OLS; or\n       (vi) any other reason for exclusion from or denial of \n     coverage by OLS;\n       (D) areas of Sudan where the United States has provided \n     assistance outside of OLS since January 1997, and the amount, \n     extent and nature of that assistance;\n       (E) areas affected by the withdrawal of international \n     relief organizations, or their sponsors, or both, due to the \n     disagreement over terms of the ``Agreement for Coordination \n     of Humanitarian, Relief and Rehabilitation Activities in \n     the SPLM Administered Areas'' memorandum of 1999, \n     including specific locations and programs affected; and\n       (2) containing a comprehensive assessment of the \n     humanitarian needs in areas of Sudan not covered or served by \n     OLS, including but not limited to the Nuba Mountains, Red Sea \n     Hills, and Blue Nile regions.\n\n\n                                  PERU\n\n       Sec. 598. (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the \n     Senate that:\n       (1) The Organization of American States (OAS) Electoral \n     Observer Mission, led by Eduardo Stein, deserves the \n     recognition and gratitude of the United States for having \n     performed an extraordinary service in promoting \n     representative democracy in the Americas by working to ensure \n     free and fair elections in Peru and by exposing efforts of \n     the Government of Peru to manipulate the national elections \n     in April and May of 2000 to benefit the president in power.\n       (2) The Government of Peru failed to establish the \n     conditions for free and fair elections--both for the April 9 \n     election as well as for the May 28 run-off--by not taking \n     effective steps to correct the ``insufficiencies, \n     irregularities, inconsistencies, and inequities'' documented \n     by the OAS Electoral Observation Mission.\n       (3) The United States Government should support the work of \n     the OAS high-level mission, and that such mission should base \n     its specific recommendations on the views of civil society in \n     Peru regarding commitments by their government to respect \n     human rights, the rule of law, the independence and \n     constitutional role of the judiciary and national congress, \n     and freedom of expression and journalism.\n       (4) In accordance with Public Law 106-186, the United \n     States must review and modify as appropriate its political, \n     economic, and military relations with Peru and work with \n     other democracies in this hemisphere and elsewhere toward a \n     restoration of democracy in Peru.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress a report evaluating \n     United States political, economic, and military relations \n     with Peru, in accordance with Public Law 106-186. Such report \n     should review, but not be limited to, the following:\n       (1) The effectiveness of providing United States assistance \n     to Peru only through independent non-governmental \n     organizations or international organizations.\n       (2) Scrutiny of all United States anti-narcotics assistance \n     to Peru and the effectiveness of providing such assistance \n     through legitimate civilian agencies and the appropriateness \n     of providing this assistance to any military or intelligence \n     units that are known to have violated human rights, \n     suppressed freedom of expression or undermined free and fair \n     elections.\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\n       (3) The need to increase support to Peru through \n     independent non-governmental organizations and international \n     organizations to promote the rule of law, separation of \n     powers, political pluralism, and respect for human rights, \n     and to evaluate termination of support for entities that have \n     cooperated with the undemocratic maneuvers of the executive \n     branch.\n       (4) The effectiveness of United States policy of supporting \n     loans or other assistance for Peru through international \n     financial institutions (such as the World Bank and Inter-\n     American Development Bank), and an evaluation of terminating \n     support to entities of the Government of Peru that have \n     willfully violated human rights, suppressed freedom of \n     expression, or undermined free and fair elections.\n       (5) The extent to which Peru benefits from the Andean Trade \n     Preferences Act and the ramifications of conditioning \n     participation in that program on respect for the rule of law \n     and representative democracy.\n       (c) Determination.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the President shall determine \n     and report to the appropriate committees of Congress whether \n     the Government of Peru has made substantial progress in \n     improving its respect for human rights, the rule of law \n     (including fair trials of civilians), the independence and \n     constitutional role of the judiciary and national congress, \n     and freedom of expression and independent journalism.\n       (d) Prohibition.--If the President determines and reports \n     pursuant to subsection (c) that the Government of Peru has \n     not made substantial progress, no funds appropriated by this \n     Act may be made available for assistance for the Government \n     of Peru, and the Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors to the international \n     financial institutions to use the voice and vote of the \n     United States to oppose loans to the Government of Peru, \n     except loans to support basic human needs.\n       (e) Exception.--The prohibition in subsection (d) shall not \n     apply to humanitarian assistance, democracy assistance, anti-\n     narcotics assistance, assistance to support binational peace \n     activities involving Peru and Ecuador, assistance provided by \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, or assistance \n     provided by the Trade and Development Agency.\n       (f) Waiver.--The President may waive subsection (d) for \n     periods not to exceed 90 days if he certifies to the \n     appropriate committees of Congress that doing so is important \n     to the national security interests of the United States and \n     will promote the respect for human rights and the rule of law \n     in Peru.\n       (g) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section, \n     ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means the Committee on \n     Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations in the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and Committee on \n     International Relations in the House of Representatives. For \n     the purposes of this section, ``humanitarian assistance'' \n     includes but is not limited to assistance to support health \n     and basic education.\n\n\n                   SENSE OF SENATE REGARDING ZIMBABWE\n\n       Sec. 599.

It is the sense of the Senate that nothing in \n     this Act regarding the assistance provided to Estonia, \n     Latvia, and Lithuania under the heading ``Foreign Military \n     Financing Program'' should be interpreted as expressing the \n     sense of the Senate regarding an acceleration of the \n     accession of Estonia, Latvia, or Lithuania to the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\n\n             ELIMINATION OF DOWRY DEATHS AND HONOR KILLINGS\n\n       Sec. 599B. (a) In General.--The Secretary of State should \n     meet with representatives from countries that have a high \n     incidence of the practice of dowry deaths or honor killings \n     with a view toward working with the representatives to \n     increase awareness of the practices, to develop strategies to \n     end the practices, and to determine the scope of the problem \n     within the refugee population.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Dowry death.--The term ``dowry death'' means the \n     killing of a woman because of a dowry dispute.\n       (2) Honor killing.--The term ``honor killing'' means the \n     murder of a woman suspected of dishonoring her family.\n\n\n                ELIMINATION OF FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION\n\n       Sec. 599C.

and\n       (8) the relationship between the Government of the Russian \n     Federation and the Governments of the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia and Serbia only encourages the regime of Slobodan \n     Milosevic to foment instability in the Balkans and thereby \n     jeopardizes the safety and security of American military and \n     civilian personnel and raises questions about Russia's \n     commitment to its responsibilities as a member of the North \n     American Treaty Organization-led peacekeeping mission in \n     Kosova.\n       (b) Actions.--\n       (1) Fifteen days after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing all \n     loans, financial assistance, and energy sales the Government \n     of the Russian Federation or entities acting on its behalf \n     has provided since June 1999, and intends to provide to the \n     Government of Serbia or the Government of the Federal \n     Republic of Yugoslavia or any entities under the control of \n     the Governments of Serbia or the Federal Republic of \n     Yugoslavia.\n       (2) If that report determines that the Government of the \n     Russian Federation or other entities acting on its behalf has \n     provided or intends to provide the governments of Serbia or \n     the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia or any entity under their \n     control any loans or economic assistance and oil sales, then \n     the following shall apply:\n       (A) The Secretary of State shall reduce assistance \n     obligated to the Russian Federation by an amount equal in \n     value to the loans, financial assistance, and energy sales \n     the Government of the Russian Federation has provided and \n     intends to provide to the Governments of Serbia and the \n     Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n       (B)(i) The Secretary of the Treasury shall instruct the \n     United States executive directors of the international \n     financial institutions to oppose, and vote against, any \n     extension by those institutions of any financial assistance \n     (including any technical assistance or grant) of any kind to \n     the Government of the Russian Federation except for loans and \n     assistance that serve basic human needs.\n       (ii) In this subparagraph, the term ``international \n     financial institution'' includes the International Monetary \n     Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and \n     Development, the International Development Association, the \n     International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral \n     Investment Guaranty Agency, and the European Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development.\n       (C) The United States shall suspend existing programs to \n     the Russia Federation provided by the Export-Import Bank and \n     the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and any \n     consideration of any new loans, guarantees, and other forms \n     of assistance by the Export-Import Bank or the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation to Russia.\n       (D) The President may waive the actions described in \n     subparagraphs (2)(A), (2)(B), and (2)(C) if he determines and \n     reports to Congress that it is in the national interest of \n     the United States of America.\n       (3) It is the sense of the Senate that the President of the \n     United States should instruct his representatives to \n     negotiations on Russia's international debt to oppose further \n     forgiveness, restructuring, and rescheduling of that debt, \n     including that being considered under the ``Comprehensive'' \n     Paris Club negotiations.\n\n\n  REHABILITATION OF THE TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE OF BULGARIA AND \n                                ROMANIA\n\n       Sec. 599E. Of the funds appropriated under the heading \n     ``Support for East European Democracy'', rehabilitation and \n     remediation of damage done to the Romanian and Bulgarian \n     economies as a result of the Kosova conflict should be given \n     priority especially to those projects that are associated \n     with the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe, done at \n     Cologne June 10, 1999 (commonly known as the ``Balkan \n     Stability Pact''), particularly those projects that encourage \n     bilateral cooperation between Romania and Bulgaria, and that \n     seek to offset the difficulties associated with the closure \n     of the Danube River.\n\n\n UNITED STATES-CUBAN MUTUAL ASSISTANCE IN THE INTERDICTION OF ILLICIT \n                                 DRUGS\n\n       Sec. 599F. Of the amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``Department of State, International Narcotics Control and \n     Law Enforcement'', up to $1,000,000 shall be available to the \n     Secretary of Defense, on behalf of the United States Coast \n     Guard, the United States Customs Service, and other bodies, \n     to work with the appropriate authorities of the Cuban \n     Government to provide for greater cooperation, coordination, \n     and other mutual assistance in the interdiction of illicit \n     drugs being transported over Cuban airspace and waters: \n     Provided, That such assistance may only be provided after the \n     President determines and certifies to Congress that--\n       (1) Cuba has appropriate procedures in place to protect \n     against innocent loss of life in the air and on the ground in \n     connection with interdiction of illegal drugs; and\n       (2) that there is no evidence of the involvement of the \n     Government of Cuba in drug trafficking.\n\n\n emergency funding to assist communities affected by hurricane floyd, \n                  hurricane dennis, or hurricane irene\n\n       Sec. 599G.

Sense of the Senate on United States Citizens \n     Held Hostage in Colombia. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) illegal paramilitary groups in Colombia pose a serious \n     obstacle to United States and Colombian counter-narcotics \n     efforts;\n       (2) abduction of innocent civilians is often used by such \n     groups to gain influence and recognition;\n       (3) three United States citizens, David Mankins, Mark Rich, \n     and Rick Tenenoff, who were engaged in humanitarian and \n     religious work were abducted by one such group and have been \n     held hostage in Colombia since January 31, 1993;\n       (4) these 3 men have the distinction of being the longest-\n     held American hostages;\n       (5) their kidnapers are believed to be members of the \n     Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) narco-\n     guerrilla organization in Colombia;\n       (6) the families of these American citizens have not had \n     any word about their safety or welfare for 7 years; and\n       (7) such acts against humanitarian workers are acts of \n     cowardice and are against basic human dignity and are \n     perpetrated by criminals and thus not deserving any form of \n     recognition.\n       (b) The Senate--\n       (1) in the strongest possible terms condemns the kidnaping \n     of these men;\n       (2) appeals to all freedom loving nations to condemn these \n     actions;\n       (3) urges members of the European Community to assist in \n     the safe return of these men by including in any dialogue \n     with FARC the objective of the release of all American \n     hostages;\n       (4) appeals to the United Nations Commission on Human \n     Rights to condemn the kidnaping and to pressure the FARC into \n     resolving this situation; and\n       (5) calls upon the President to raise the kidnaping of \n     these Americans to all relevant foreign governments and to \n     express his desire to see this tragic situation resolved.\n       Sec. 6109.

Mr. President, while some Members of the Senate are \nconversing about the schedule, I want to take a moment and comment \ntoday on a couple of items that have appeared in today's newspapers \nrelated to a very important matter that we will be addressing soon. The \nfirst item appeared in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       ``Drug benefit costs for large employers are expected to \n     jump 22.5 percent for employees and 23.4 percent for retirees \n     over the next year,'' according to a survey of 61 companies.\n\n  Drug costs are expected to jump 22.5 percent in a single year for \nemployees and employers.\n  The second item is a full-page ad that appeared in the Washington \nPost today. This ad is sponsored by the Pharmaceutical Research and \nManufacturers of America. It says:\n\n       One of these pills is a counterfeit. Can you guess which \n     one?\n\n  And then it says:\n\n       Congress is about to permit the wholesale importation of \n     drugs from Mexico and Canada. The personal health of American \n     consumers is unquestionably at risk. Counterfeit prescription \n     drugs will inevitably make their way across our borders and \n     into our medicine cabinets. Counterfeit prescription drugs \n     can kill. Counterfeit drugs have killed.\n\n  This is from the big pharmaceutical manufacturers. What they are \nalleging is that it would be unsafe to allow those in this country who \nwant to go to Canada to access a supply of prescription drugs from a \ndrugstore in Winnipeg that was originally made in the United States, in \na plant inspected by\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\nthe Food and Drug Administration, and then put in a bottle and sent to \na pharmacy in Canada.\n  It would not be unsafe. It would be cheaper, but not unsafe. Here is \nthe issue. This is a global economy, we are told, and the \npharmaceutical industry certainly benefits from that global economy. \nThey buy their chemicals all around the world to get the best prices, \nand they should. They use these chemicals to produce wonderful, life-\nsaving medicines. Then they ship that medicine all around the world. \nThey ship it to Pembina, ND, and to Emerson, Manitoba in Canada. Those \ntwo communities are about 5 miles apart. For the same medicine, \nproduced in the same manufacturing plant by the same company, in the \nsame dosage strength, put in the same bottle, the manufacturers will \ncharge the U.S. consumer triple, double, or quadruple the price charged \nthe Canadian consumer.\n  The question is this: Why should an American citizen have to go to \nCanada to buy a drug that was produced in the United States in order to \nfind that they will save 50 to 70 percent on the price of that same \ndrug? The answer is that they should not have to go to Canada to do \nthat. There ought to be fairer pricing of prescription drugs in this \ncountry.\n  There is a little sweetheart law on the books in this country that \nneeds to be amended. This law says that the only entity that can re-\nimport prescription drugs into the United States is its manufacturer. \nSo when a pharmaceutical manufacturer makes a drug in the United States \nand ships it to Canada for sale at a fraction of the price--and that is \nbecause Canada won't allow them to sell it at the price at which they \nsell it in the United States--they are able to say to pharmacists and \ndrug wholesalers in the United States that they can't go to Canada and \nbuy it and bring it back and pass the savings along to their customers. \nEven though it is the same drug, made in a plant in the United States, \nand the plant is approved by the FDA, they can't bring it back from \nCanada. Why? Because a law in this country prevents that. Talk about a \nsweetheart deal.\n\n  Some of us want to amend that law. Some Republicans and Democrats \nhave come together on legislation to allow pharmacists and drug \nwholesalers to import FDA-approved medicines. So in response, the \npharmaceutical industry spent a fortune putting full-page ads in \nnewspapers today, saying this is about ``counterfeit medicine'' that \nwill kill people. What a sack of lies. There is no counterfeit medicine \nproblem here. We are talking about the importation of prescription \ndrugs in this country only in instances where the chain of custody has \nbeen assured and guaranteed.\n  This is the most profitable industry in the world, and I understand \nthat it wants to protect its profits. I think the drug companies do a \nlot of wonderful things. But I don't think it is wonderful when they \ntell senior citizens in this country--all citizens, for that matter, \nbut especially senior citizens--we have a life-saving drug, but you \nwill pay double the price of what we charge anywhere else in the world. \nThat is not fair. But it happens all the time.\n  What we ought to do is decide that if this is a global economy, it is \na global economy for senior citizens and for pharmacists, as long as we \nassure the chain of custody and resolve the issue of safety.\n  A pharmacist in Grand Forks, ND, cannot go to Winnipeg, Canada, to \nbuy the same pill, in the same bottle, made in the same manufacturing \nplant, and bring it back and pass the savings along to senior citizens. \nSenior citizens are 12 percent of our population, yet they use one-\nthird of all the prescription drugs in this country. They have reached \ntheir retirement years, the years in which their incomes are limited, \nand they discover that they must pay the highest prices for \nprescription drugs of any group of consumers in the world. That is not \nfair.\n  Miracle drugs only perform miracles if you can afford to take them. \nLife-saving drugs only save lives if you can afford to access those \ndrugs. I have had hearings all across this country, and I have heard \nidentical testimony in every State. Senior citizens tell me: When I go \nto the grocery store, I must first go to the pharmacy at the back of \nthe store to buy my prescription drugs because only then will I know \nhow much money I have left to pay for food. Only then will I know how \nmuch money I have left with which to eat.\n  That is happening all across this country. The folks in the \npharmaceutical industry want to continue to charge U.S. consumers \ndouble, triple, or quadruple the prices they impose upon citizens of \nother countries. That is not fair. We ought to change it.\n  In the appropriations bill when it was considered by the House, the \nHouse enacted two amendments to essentially prevent the FDA from \nenforcing the current law.\n  In the Senate, there will be an amendment offered by one of my \nRepublican colleagues, myself, and others. The Senate amendment would \nalso allow pharmacists and drug wholesalers to import prescription \ndrugs that were produced in the United States, in plants that are \napproved by the FDA, but it includes provisions to ensure this is done \nin a safe manner. We hope enough Members of the Senate will agree so \nthat we will be able to get this done in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7143-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7143-S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION, AND \n               RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2001\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4461) making appropriations for Agriculture, \n     Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2001, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to present for the \nSenate's consideration the fiscal year 2001 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and related agencies \nappropriations bill. This bill provides fiscal year 2001 funding for \nthe programs and activities of the Department of Agriculture, the Food \nand Drug Administration, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. \nThe U.S. Forest Service is funded by the Interior appropriations bill.\n  This bill, as reported, also provides fiscal year 2000 supplemental \nappropriations and rescissions to respond to emergency needs resulting \nfrom natural disasters and other unanticipated funding requirements.\n  The fiscal year 2001 provisions are contained in Division A of the \nreported bill. It provides total new budget authority for fiscal year \n2001 of $75.3 billion. This is $295 million less than the fiscal year \n2000 enacted level, excluding emergency appropriations, and $1.5 \nbillion less than the President's budget request.\n  Just over eighty percent of the total recommended by this bill is for \nmandatory appropriations over which the Appropriations Committee has no \neffective control. The spending levels for these programs are governed \nby authorizing statutes. The mandatory programs funded by this bill \ninclude the\n\n[[Page S7144]]\n\nCommodity Credit Corporation, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, \nand the Food Stamp and Child Nutrition Programs.\n  About twenty percent of the total appropriations recommended by this \nbill is for discretionary programs and activities. Including \nCongressional budget scorekeeping adjustments and prior-year spending \nactions, this bill recommends total discretionary spending of $14.850 \nbillion in budget authority and $14.925 billion in outlays for fiscal \nyear 2001. These amounts are consistent with the Subcommittee's \ndiscretionary spending allocations.\n  I would like to take a few moments to summarize the bill's major \nfunding recommendations. For the Food Safety and Inspection Service, \nappropriations of $678 million are recommended, $29 million more than \nthe fiscal year 2000 level. For the Animal and Plant Health Inspection \nService, $468 million is recommended, $25 million more than the 2000 \nlevel.\n  Appropriations for USDA headquarters operations and for other \nagriculture marketing and regulatory programs are approximately $84 \nmillion more than the fiscal year 2000 appropriations levels. Included \nin this increase is $25 million to support information technology \ninvestments in support of the Department's Service Center Modernization \ninitiative; $42.4 million to support the Department of Agriculture's \nbuildings and facilities and rental payment requirements; $5.9 million, \nas requested, for costs associated with implementing the Mandatory \nLivestock Reporting Act; and $6.2 million for the Agricultural \nMarketing Service to implement a microbiological data program.\n  For farm credit programs, the bill funds an estimated $3.1 billion \ntotal loan program level, the same as the fiscal year 2000 level, \nexcluding additional loans funded through fiscal year 2000 emergency \nappropriations. The amount recommended includes $559.4 million for farm \nownership loans and $2.4 billion for farm operating loans.\n\n  For salaries and expenses of the Farm Service Agency, total \nappropriations of $1.095 billion are recommended. This is $89 million \nmore than the 2000 level and the same as the President's budget \nrequest.\n  The bill provides total appropriations of $1.4 billion for \nagriculture research, education, and extension activities. Included in \nthis amount is an increase of $3.8 million from fiscal year 2000 for \nAgricultural Research Service (ARS) buildings and facilities, an \nincrease of $41.2 million for research activities of the ARS; and a \n$19.2 million increase in funding for the Cooperative State Research, \nEducation, and Extension Service.\n  For conservation programs administered by USDA's Natural Resources \nConservation Service, total funding of $867.6 million is provided, $63 \nmillion more than the 2000 level. This includes $714 million for \nconservation operations, $11 million for watershed surveys and \nplanning, $99 million for watershed and flood prevention operations, \n$36 million for the resource conservation and development program, and \n$6 million for the forestry incentives program.\n  USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service is funded at a program level of \n$117.7 million, $4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. In \naddition, a total program level of $996.7 million is recommended for \nthe Public Law 480 program, the same as the fiscal year 2001 budget \nrequest and $51.4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level. This \nincludes $159.7 million for Title I and $837 million for Title II of \nthe program.\n  The bill also provides a total program level of $2.5 billion for \nrural economic and community development programs. Included in this \namount is $749 million for the Rural Community Advancement Program, $33 \nmillion for the Rural Business-Cooperative Service, and $75 million to \nsupport a total $2.6 billion program level for rural electric and \ntelecommunications loans.\n  In addition, the bill devotes additional resources to those programs \nwhich provide affordable, safe, and decent housing for low-income \nindividuals and families living in rural America. Estimated rural \nhousing loan authorizations funded by this bill total $4.6 billion. \nIncluded in this amount is $4.3 billion in section 502 low-income \nhousing direct and guaranteed loans and $114 million in section 515 \nrental housing loans. In addition, $680 million is included for the \nrental assistance program. This is the same as the budget request and \n$40 million more than the 2000 appropriations level.\n  Appropriations totaling $35 billion for USDA's nutrition assistance \nprograms continue to command the highest percentage of the total \nappropriations recommended by the bill--nearly 47 percent of the total \nnew budget authority provided. This includes $9.5 billion for child \nnutrition programs, including $6 million to complete funding for the \nschool breakfast pilot program; $4.05 billion for the Special \nSupplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC); \n$140 million for the commodity assistance program; $140 million for the \nelderly feeding program; and $21.2 billion for the food stamp program.\n  For those independent agencies funded by the bill, the Committee \nprovides total appropriations of $1.2 billion, $54 million more than \nthe 2000 level. Included in this amount is $67 million for the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission, and $1.1 billion for the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA). The bill also establishes a limitation of \n$36.8 million on administrative expenses of the Farm Credit \nAdministration.\n\n  Total appropriations recommended for salaries and expenses of the FDA \nare $33.7 million more than the 2000 appropriations level. This \nadditional amount, along with $34 million redirected from FDA's tobacco \nprogram in light of the recent Supreme Court decision, provides a total \nincrease of $67.7 million for fiscal year 2001. Included in this amount \nis the full increase requested in the budget for FDA rental payments to \nthe General Services Administration; an additional $24 million for FDA \nfood safety initiatives; and $25 million for premarket review \nactivities. The additional funding for premarket review will continue \nto strengthen FDA's ability to perform its core statutory mission of \nreviewing drugs, foods, medical devices and products within statutory \ntime frames and to ensure patients' speedy access to new products and \nthe latest technology.\n  The bill also makes available $149 million in Prescription Drug User \nFee Act collections, $4 million more than the fiscal year 2000 level.\n  The discretionary budget authority allocation for this bill is \napproximately $200 million more than the CBO baseline level, or a \n``freeze'' at the 2000 enacted appropriations level. To provide the \nincreases the Committee felt were necessary to maintain funding for \nessential farm, housing, and rural development programs, several \nmandatory funding restrictions are included in the bill. Modest \nlimitations on the Environmental Quality Incentives and Conservation \nFarm Option programs are maintained at the fiscal year 2000 levels. \nFunding for the Initiative for Future Agriculture and Food Systems and \nthe Fund for Rural America is deferred until fiscal year 2002, as \nproposed in the President's budget.\n  Although the total discretionary spending recommended by this bill is \napproximately $277 million in budget authority below the President's \nbudget request level, as reestimated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the President's proposed budget relies on additional revenues \nand savings to accommodate much higher levels of discretionary \nspending. The President's budget proposes to generate a net total of \n$564 million in collections from new user fee proposals, and to \nredirect funds from ongoing projects and Congressional initiatives to \npay for Presidential initiatives.\n  This Committee does not have the luxury of relying on revenues and \nsavings from legislative proposals that have not been acted on by the \nCongress and signed into law. Consequently, within the discretionary \nspending limitations established for this bill, we have not been able \nto afford many of the discretionary spending increases and new \ninitiatives proposed by the Administration, and still remain consistent \nwith the Budget Act.\n  Food safety continues to be a high priority of this Committee. This \nbill, as recommended to the Senate, provides the funds necessary to \nensure that American consumers continue to have the safest food supply \nin the world. Not only does this bill provide increased funds required \nfor meat and\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\npoultry inspection activities of the Food Safety and Inspection \nService, it provides total funding of $377 million, a $53 million \nincrease from the 2000 level, for USDA and FDA programs and activities \nincluded in the President's Food Safety Initiative.\n  Turning to ``Division B'', the reported bill recommended a net total \nof $2.2 billion for emergency and regular supplemental appropriations \nand rescissions for the fiscal year 2000.\n  A number of these provisions have been enacted into law as part of \nthe conference report on the fiscal year 2001 Military Construction \nAppropriations Act. The substitute amendment deletes those provisions \nand makes other accompanying technical and conforming changes to \nDivision B of the reported bill.\n  The Chairmen of the various Appropriations Subcommittees may speak to \nthose provisions in Division B of the reported bill under their \nrespective jurisdictions.\n  However, for programs and activities within the jurisdiction of the \nAgriculture Subcommittee, Division B, as modified, recommends $1.1 \nbillion in emergency supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2000.\n  Supplemental appropriations for emergency housing and relief to \nfarmers as a result of the North Carolina hurricane and other natural \ndisasters; for the Farm Service Agency to meet high workload demands; \nand to offset the assessment on peanut producers for program losses \nhave now been enacted into law.\n  The remaining emergency supplemental appropriations recommended in \nthe bill reported to the Senate still must be addressed.\n  These include the $13 million requested by the President to cover a \nshortfall in available funding for crop insurance premium discounts; \n$35 million to support ongoing acreage enrollments in the Conservation \nReserve and Wetlands Reserve programs; and an additional $130 million \nfor the Rural Community Advancement Program.\n  Just as devastating to producers as losses from hurricanes, drought \nand other natural disasters are losses from new and emergent diseases \nand pest infestations. The bill provides authority for the Secretary of \nAgriculture to compensate growers for losses as a result of the plum \npox virus which has devastated the stone fruit industry; citrus canker; \nMexican fruit fly; grasshoppers and Mormon crickets; and Pierce's \ndisease, a new problem plaguing the grape industry.\n  In addition, emergency assistance totaling an estimated $443 million \nis recommended for dairy producers and $450 million for livestock \nproducers.\n  Mr. President, this appropriations bill was reported by the Committee \non May 10th. It was one of the first of the thirteen fiscal year 2001 \nappropriations bills to be reported to the Senate by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  Although the companion bill was reported from the House \nAppropriations Committee around that same time, on May 16th, the House \ndid not begin consideration of the bill until June 29. The House \nresumed consideration of the bill immediately following the July recess \nand passed the bill on July 11 by a vote of 339-82.\n\n  There are approximately 26 legislative days remaining before the \nOctober 1 start of the fiscal year. It is my hope we can expedite the \nSenate's consideration of this bill so we can go to conference with the \nHouse and get this bill to the President as quickly as possible.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, the ranking member \nof the subcommittee, Mr. Kohl, as well as other members of the \nsubcommittee, for their support and cooperation in putting this bill \ntogether. It is never easy to determine funding priorities, or to \nbalance the many competing and legitimate needs that confront \nagriculture in this bill and stay within the subcommittee's required \nspending limitations. I believe this bill represents a responsible \nfunding recommendation. I ask the Senators to give it their favorable \nconsideration.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Mr. President, I would like to chat a little bit about \nenergy this evening because there are several misconceptions relative \nto the position that the United States is currently in relative to the \nhigh gasoline prices that we have been subjected to in the last several \nmonths.\n  First of all, the bad news is, there is no relief in sight. What we \ncurrently have is a situation where, simply, the available refining \ncapacity associated with gasoline production and the demand is such \nthat the two lines are almost parallel. In other words, our ability to \nproduce gasoline and the current consumption of gasoline are about \nequal. So as a consequence, in reality, we are drawing down our \nreserves. This is at a time when normally our reserves would be \nsubstantially higher.\n  There is a reason for this. I think the American people should \nunderstand and appreciate reality because what we have is a situation \nwhere our refining capacity has been reduced dramatically over the last \n8 years. We have lost about 37 refineries in the United States during \nthe last 10-year period. There has not been a new refinery built in the \nUnited States in almost two decades.\n  What we have, then, is a concentration of our existing refineries \noperating at near full capacity, producing the requirements associated \nwith the public's demand for gasoline, coupled with the problems \nassociated with meeting the Clean Air Act, which mandates certain \nreformulated gasolines in various parts of the country.\n  We had testimony before the committee of which I am chairman, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, earlier last week. One of the \nprincipals with the Environmental Protection Agency identified that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, under their interpretation of the \nClean Air Act, has mandated as many as nine specific cuts of \nreformulated gasolines that have a regional application around the \ncountry. That means in California you have one type of reformulated \ngasoline. You have another type in Chicago. You may have another type \nin Atlanta.\n  These have gone into effect as a consequence of the June 1 new \nmandates for reformulated gasoline in various parts of the country. \nWhat this means is, the refineries have to separate and move and store \nseparately these different cuts of gasoline. The cost, of course, is \nsignificant from the standpoint of what the American public has to pay.\n  We have seen, since the spiraling price of crude oil over the last \nyear--where a year ago prices were $11, $12, $13, $14 a barrel--an \naverage price of nearly $30 a barrel this year.\n  The difficulty we experience is, having become so dependent on \nimported\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\noil, currently imported oil is running at 56 percent of total U.S. \nconsumption. As we look at our neighbors in OPEC, we recognize that we \nhave an increasing dependence on their resources. In other words, they \ncontrol the supply and we are the market. As a consequence, when we \nhave significant demand increases of consumption, we go to OPEC, as our \nSecretary of Energy has done from time to time, encouraging more \nproduction.\n  However, OPEC seems to have learned from experience. They have \ndeveloped a strategy internally where they have set a price floor and a \nprice ceiling. The floor evidently is $22 a barrel of oil; the ceiling \nis $28 a barrel. In recent days, there has been an anticipation that \nOPEC will increase production, today we have the president of OPEC \nindicating that since the price fell temporarily below $28 a barrel, \nOPEC was not going to increase production and was going to review the \nmatter in another 20 days.\n  The American public should be aware that we are caught between a \nfloor-to-ceiling $22 to $28. The American public should be aware that \nas a consequence of OPEC's internal discipline, there is no relief in \nsight for a reduction of gas prices of anything appreciable. There will \nbe perhaps some regional reductions as we get the reformulated gasoline \nunder control in various parts of the country.\n  It is also important to recognize that one of the most significant \nadditives, MTBE, has been dismissed as contrary to the health of the \npublic in the sense that this reformulated portion does get into the \nwater table. As a consequence, we are substituting ethanol for MTBE, \nwhich is a grain and agriculture product that enjoys a partial subsidy \nbut nevertheless is a satisfactory additive to make reformulated \ngasoline to meet the market demands in the various regions of the \ncountry.\n  The point I want to make is that on gasoline, our demand is up. Our \nproduction is relatively stagnant, even though we are producing at the \nmaximum capacity for our refineries. We have a situation where we are \nactually pulling down our reserves. For many Members of this body, \nparticularly in the Northeast corridor, who are concerned legitimately \nabout the high cost of heating oil and the awareness that there might \nnot be adequate reserves being built up during the summer to meet the \ndemand if there is a cold winter, they justifiably should be concerned. \nWhat we should be doing now is dropping off substantially our \nproduction of gasoline and building up reserves for heating oil. But \nthat is not the case. Our reserves for heating oil are at an all-time \nlow.\n  We have had consideration from the Clinton administration and some \nMembers to set up some kind of a heating oil strategic reserve. This is \nrather an interesting dilemma, if you walk through it and understand \nit. It doesn't necessarily create the relief we want and may suggest \nthat the Government is involving itself in the manipulation of pricing \nof petroleum products.\n  Let me cite an example of what I fear. Currently, the thought is that \nthere will be an arrangement made by the Department of Energy to \nacquire up to 2 million barrels of heating oil reserve somewhere in the \nNortheast, perhaps in the New York City area, where they can lease \ntankage. The tradeoff on where the oil would come from would be crude \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana. That oil, of \ncourse, is not refined. If we take an equivalent of 2 million barrels \nplus, because we want to have value for value, and take the crude oil \nout of SPR and refine it, we are offsetting the refining capacity of \nthat refiner of making gasoline or perhaps heating oil with the \nsubstitution of the oil from SPR.\n  That is purchased by the Government, put in storage, and sits in \nstorage until such time as circumstances dictate the trigger be pulled \nand the oil released. Then the question is, What is the appropriate \ntriggering mechanism? Are we going to trigger the release of based on \nthe price of heating oil, or are we going to do it as a consequence of \na supply shortage?\n  Last year, we had a critical situation in the Northeast but did not \nactually have anyone go without heating oil. What happened last year is \nthe reserves were very low, but there was enough to meet the demand. \nThis year, the fear, rightly so, for many in the Northeast is that \nthere might not be enough fuel oil to meet the demand if the winter \ngets cold. The dilemma is, if the Government is putting in 2 million \nbarrels and going to basically store it, then is the industry that \nordinarily would build up an inventory and tie up its cash-flow for a \nperiod of time going to do that, knowing that the Federal Government is \ndoing the same thing? It is going to be a business decision, but it is \ngoing to be interesting to see what the private sector does.\n  It might be simply a tradeoff. Why should the private sector build up \nan inventory when it knows the Government has an inventory? In the end, \nis there any more fuel oil left for the Northeast corridor if indeed \nthere is a cold winter?\n  I bring this out to point to the difficulty we are having in coming \nto grips with the reality that we have a greater demand for oil than we \nhave of productive capability. We have become dependent again on our \nneighbors in OPEC--and not just the 10 official OPEC members. One of \nour other associates is a gentleman by the name of Saddam Hussein, who \nis the head of Iraq.\n  Many people forget that we fought a war over there just a decade ago. \nWe lost 147 lives; we had 427 Americans who were wounded; we had 23 \ntaken prisoner. Today, Iraq is the fastest growing source of oil for \nthe United States. Isn't that rather ironic? I can't understand why \nAmericans are not indignant over the fact that we are looking to this \ntyrant, who we know is selling oil, smuggling it out, generating funds \nfor missile development--there was just an article today relative to \nthe testing of a new missile by Iraq--developing his biological \ncapability. This man is a bad man. He is up to no good. Yet the United \nStates is looking to him to bail us out for our supply of oil. It is \nabsolutely ironic that we would look to Saddam Hussein.\n  August 2 will be the 10th anniversary of Saddam Hussein's invasion of \nKuwait. What a difference a decade makes. Let's do a little comparison. \nI think the American people should wake up and be a little sensitive to \nthe fact that we have lifted embargoes on technologies that would allow \nhim to increase his refining capacity. The U.N. no longer does any \ninspections of what is going on in Iraq or where his oil is going or \nwhether it is going for the Food for Peace Program.\n  Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to stimulate higher oil \nprices and to build up his war machine. We know that. That was 10 years \nago. Now high oil prices yield Saddam Hussein $75 million a day under a \nlegal U.N. oil-for-food program and $2 million a day in illegal \nsmuggling revenue which is used to build up his war machine.\n  Mr. President, we know this for a fact. We know what he is doing with \nthe funds he gets from smuggling oil. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was \nproved to be the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. As of \ntoday, it has cost thousands of lives, some $10 billion of U.S. \ntaxpayers' money, and 150,000 sorties, where we have flown to enforce \nour no-fly zone. It has cost the American taxpayers $10 billion to \nfence in Saddam Hussein.\n  Saddam Hussein is still the biggest threat to peace in the Mideast \nand certainly the biggest threat to Israel. I can't understand why \nthere is not more of an awakening of the fact that we are supporting \nthis tyrant. We are becoming more dependent upon him and we are playing \ninto his hands.\n  Where is the logic? Where is the American foreign policy? I can \nsimplify foreign policy with regard to Saddam Hussein and Iraq in one \nsingle syllogism. We buy his oil, we send him our dollars, we put his \noil in our airplanes, and fly over and bomb him. He puts out a press \nrelease saying how many people we injured or killed, they rally around \nSaddam Hussein, and the process starts all over again.\n  Is this the foreign policy of the United States that we support? Or \nwould we rather ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist? I think the \nlatter is probably the case. It is absolutely incredible that we don't \nface up to what is happening and the fact that we are condoning this \naction. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was using oil revenue to purchase \nweapons of mass destruction. Now, Saddam Hussein--the same guy--is \nusing his oil revenue to purchase weapons of mass destruction. We\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nknow this. They just tested them yesterday. He has the ability, with \nthe advanced weaponry he has developed, to extend the missile clear to \nIsrael.\n  Ten years ago, the United States purchased less than 400,000 barrels \na day from Iraq--before the war started. Now the United States is \npurchasing 750,000 barrels a day. Ten years ago, the United States \nbegan to import more than 50 percent of our oil, and OPEC became an \nimportant voice in U.S. energy policy. Now, the United States, as I \nhave indicated, is importing more than 56 percent of our oil. With \nIraq, the fastest-growing supplier, Saddam Hussein has become an \nimportant voice--imagine that--in our U.S. energy policy. Saddam \nHussein may have lost the war, but he certainly seems to have won the \npeace. With its energy policy--or lack thereof--the Clinton-Gore \nadministration has snatched defeat from the jaws of the gulf war \nvictory. I will repeat that. Saddam Hussein may have lost the war, but \nhe has won the peace. With its energy policy, or lack of an energy \npolicy, the Clinton-Gore administration has snatched defeat from the \njaws of the gulf victory.\n  We are very much dependent on this source, and the likelihood of \nreducing it is not going to take place until we send a clear message as \nto what our energy policy will be. Now, the alternatives aren't really \nvery complex. We either import more and pay the price, or we commit to \ndevelopment and exploration of our energy resources here in the United \nStates. Wyoming, Montana, Colorado--the overthrust belt--have a \ntremendous potential for oil and gas development, as does Illinois, \nPennsylvania, and numerous other States. We have withdrawn about 64 \npercent of the public land in the United States and exempted it from \nexploration, let alone production.\n  Now, we have a tremendous potential in OCS areas--off the shores of \nTexas, Alabama, Mississippi, and other States, some of which don't want \nto develop OCS areas off their States. That is their own business. But \nfor those who do they should be allowed to do so. It is kind of \ninteresting because our Vice President made a statement in Louisiana \nthat if he is elected President, he will make an attempt to buy back \nOCS oil leases and cancel other leases.\n  Mr. President, that leaves one with the question: Where is this \nenergy going to come from? We have energy coming from my State of \nAlaska. We have been producing 20 to 25 percent of our domestic crude \noil for the last twenty years. We have the potential for a major \ndiscovery in a small sliver of the Arctic area, the Coastal Plain. Let \nme explain how small that sliver is. In the general area of the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge, there are 19 million acres. That is as big as the size \nof the State of South Carolina. Half of that has been reserved in \nperpetuity as a wilderness. Nearly the other half has been set aside in \na refuge, also in perpetuity, subject to the Congress, who are the only \nones that can change it. Out of those 19 million acres, 1.5 million \nacres was left out to the discretion of Congress back in 1980. That was \ndone as a consequence of the belief that this was the area where a \nlikely discovery could be made.\n\n  Well, there have been a lot of estimates. When you look for oil, you \nnever know where you are going to find it or how much you are going to \nfind. If you are going to find it in Alaska, you better find a lot of \nit; otherwise, you can't afford to produce it. Recent estimates go as \nhigh as 16 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. That is based on \nthe latest discovery and production technology, even though much of \nthis area has not been made available for 3D seismic evaluation because \nit is under the Department of Interior. Sixteen billion barrels would \nbe as much as what we would import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year \nperiod. So it is a substantial amount.\n  What we need to do in this country--and we need to do it now; the \nlonger we wait, the more dependent we are going to be on OPEC--is to \nset a clear and decisive policy toward a commitment to reduce our \ndependence on imports. That is what we have done, along with Senator \nLott and several colleagues, in the legislation we introduced, which is \nthe National Energy Security Act of 2000. We have adopted a goal to \nguide our energy policy, and the goal is to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil to less than 50 percent by the end of the decade. When you \nhave that kind of objective, you have an opportunity to send a clear \nmessage.\n  We have to send a clear message. We have to send a message to Saudi \nArabia and to Kuwait, and we have to send it to Venezuela and Mexico, \nthat we are committed to reducing our dependence and we are committed \nto increase exploration and production here in the United States. I \nadmire the commitment of America's environmental community who, for the \nmost part, oppose domestic oil production and exploration in the United \nStates. But I remind them that we have the technology, the know-how, \nthe American can-do spirit, and we can make the impact of development \nmuch smaller here and keep the jobs and the dollars at home, as opposed \nto the exploration that occurs in other areas of the world where they \ndon't have the environmental safeguards. So what kind of a tradeoff is \nit? Is it better for the environment that we do it right here at home, \nor if we depend on those countries that don't have that internal \ndiscipline and consideration for the environment?\n  The industry says that if, indeed, they find oil in this sliver of \nthe Arctic, out of the 1.5 million acres, which is part of the 19 \nmillion acres, which is the size of South Carolina, the footprint would \nbe somewhere between 1,500 to 2,000 acres. My friends who are in the \nfarming business know what kind of a farm a 1,500-acre or 2,000-acre \nfarm is. The drilling and exploration would be done in the wintertime. \nThe roads would be ice roads. There would be no permanent community. \nThere would be a compatibility with the caribou. We have addressed all \nthe issues, and we have proven it in Prudhoe Bay, where 20 percent of \nthe crude oil has come from for the last two decades. But that was old \ntechnology; we have new technology now. Many don't want us to have an \nopportunity to find out if indeed the oil is there, and the oil is \nthere in the reserves that we have.\n  Some people more or less dismiss it, and say, well, we are in a \nsituation with oil. Don't worry. We have lots of natural gas.\n  As chairman of the Energy Committee, I have a little bit of a \ndifferent view about the situation with natural gas in this country. \nLet me start out by reminding you and the American people that there is \na rude awakening coming with regard to natural gas. It is going to \naffect Americans in their heating bills. It is going to affect \nAmericans in their electric bills.\n  This is what has happened. A year ago in this country the price for \nnatural gas was around $2.30. Six months ago, it was $2.56. Deliveries \nin January are $4.30. I know many utilities are going to their \ncommissions advising them of rate increases. This hasn't hit the \nAmerican public yet. If we thought the hue and cry on the increased \nprice of heating oil or gasoline was going to bring down the roof, wait \nuntil you hear the cry of the American people this winter when they get \ntheir gas bills.\n  How did this come about? Somebody said, well, we have 160 trillion \ncubic feet in reserve. That was last year. We have 150 trillion cubic \nfeet this year. We are, again, pulling down our reserves faster than we \nare finding new reserves. When you do that, you deplete your base.\n  What also is happening to put further pressure is the electric \nindustry is turning to gas turbines for power generation--turbines. The \npermitting process is much easier and much cheaper than for building a \ncoal-fired plant.\n  We have a situation where we are coming to grips. The American people \naren't aware of it. They are not reflecting on it because it doesn't \nreally hit them like they were hit in 1973 or 1974 when we had the Arab \noil embargo. Some people in this body might be old enough to remember. \nWe had gasoline lines around the block. The public was outraged: How \ncould this happen in this country? How could we have these kinds of \nshortages? We did. The public reacted. We played the blame game and \npointed the finger at everybody and everything. Gasoline and oil prices \nhad no relief in sight.\n  I can guarantee it, natural gas has spiraled. It is escalating with \nno relief in sight. How did we get in this situation? One reason is we \nhaven't had an energy policy for a long, long time.\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\n  What is our energy policy? Clearly, it is to provide more imports of \noil into this country as opposed to developing domestic oil reserves. \nWhat is our gas policy on natural gas? We have withdrawn from public \nlands areas that ordinarily would be available for exploration--64 \npercent of the overthrust belt, as I have indicated.\n  What have we done with regard to nuclear power? Twenty percent of our \npower generation is nuclear energy. We can't pass a bill in this body \nto deal with the waste. We can't override the President's veto. We are \none vote short to address what to do with our nuclear waste. There \nhasn't been a nuclear plant built in this country in 20 years. There is \nnot going to be. They are building them in China. They are building \nthem in Taiwan. They are building them in France. France is 76 percent \ndependent on nuclear energy. They don't have air quality problems. They \nare never going to be held hostage by the Mideast again. They learned \nthat in 1973.\n  We don't have a policy on oil other than to import more. We don't \nhave a policy for encouraging domestic gas exploration. We don't have a \npolicy to address what we are going to do with our nuclear industry let \nalone resolve the nuclear waste problem. We have lots of coal. Are we \nbuilding coal plants? Absolutely not. The permitting time for coal \nplants puts them out of reach of reality. There are none being built.\n  Tell me from where the energy is going to come. There are many who \nsay, well, we should find alternative energy. I am all for it. But you \nname it.\n\n  We have spent over $70 billion in the last two decades subsidizing \nthe development of alternative energy. What is it? Solar, biomass, \nwind? Some places in my State, such as Barrow, don't get much daylight \nin the wintertime. It is dark all the time. Sometimes the wind doesn't \nblow. These alternatives are fine. They have a place. We have to \nencourage them. But they are not going to take the place of oil and gas \nin the near future. By the time we are through evaluating our \nalternatives, it is not a very bright picture because the alternatives \njust aren't there. The alternatives provide us with about 4 percent of \nour current energy mix.\n  We have hydro. I have not spoken of hydro. It is a renewable \nresource. There is no question about it. But this administration \ncuriously enough has identified hydro as nonrenewable. I grew up in \nKetchikan, AK. We have a couple hundred inches of rain a year. I \nremember one year we had 226 inches of rain. We have a few little \nhydrodams.\n  To suggest rainfall and hydro are not renewable is beyond me. But, \nnevertheless, the administration proposes to remove some of the dams \nfrom the Columbia and Snake Rivers to rebuild the fish runs. \nUnfortunately, some time ago decisions were made, rightly or wrongly, \nwith regard to the tradeoff on posterity. It is just that simple. You \nare going to have your natural runs of fish. You are not going to have \ndams. But they trade it consciously or unconsciously for the \nagricultural industry associated and what dams those rivers could do \nwith benefits in low-cost power to the residents of the area. Whether \nyou have an aluminum plant, whether you have Boeing, whether you have \ntremendous agricultural productivity out of land that was once desert, \nthey traded those things off. You can't want it both ways. You want to \nrebuild the natural runs. Most of the biologists will tell you that you \ncan enhance runs by bringing in new stock, if your ability to rebuild \nthe native runs is pretty remote. Some people suggest it is not \npossible.\n  But if you tear down the dams, there is another tradeoff. How much \nbarge traffic that moves the grain and commerce up and down the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers is going to go back on the highways? It is \nall going to go back, isn't it? Somebody said there will be 700,000 \nmore trucks on our highways, if you tear down the dams. What kind of a \ntradeoff is that?\n  There is no energy policy identifiable with this administration. It \nis that simple--no oil, no domestic exploration, no hydro, no nuclear, \nno coal. That is the reality of where we are. It is a pretty bleak \npicture.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nfrom Richard Butler from the Washington Post dated Monday, July 17, \nentitled ``Guess Who's Back.'' It is our friend, Saddam Hussein. It is \nentitled ``Saddam Hussein is reconstituting his capability to deploy \nweapons of mass destruction.''\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nstatement that came out of Reuters today entitled ``Venezuelan OPEC \npresident Ali Rodriguez said Tuesday there would be no oil production \nrise at the end of this month because prices have fallen below the \nupper limit of OPEC's price target ban.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Washington Post, Monday, July 17, 2000]\n\n                            Guess Who's Back\n\n                          (By Richard Butler)\n\n       So you thought Saddam Hussein was out of your life? Sorry--\n     he's back, manufacturing the weapons of mass destruction with \n     which he threatens the Iraqi people, his neighbors and, by \n     extension, the safety of the world.\n       Two separate developments have returned Saddam Hussein to \n     the headlines. Earlier this month the administration revealed \n     that its satellites had detected Iraq test-firing Al-Samoud \n     missiles, home-grown, smaller versions of the Scuds last used \n     against Israel during the 1990 Gulf War. The chief of U.S. \n     Central Command, Gen. Tony Zinni, said that the range of the \n     Al-Samoud easily could be increased.\n       The administration also revealed that Saddam Hussein has \n     been hiding between 20 and 30 Russian Scuds as well as \n     working through front companies outside Iraq to acquire the \n     machine tools needed to build more missiles.\n       None of this is new. In my last report as executive \n     chairman of UNSCOM, the agency charged with disarming Saddam, \n     I warned the U.N. Security Council about Iraq's missile-\n     development activities. That was almost two years ago, just \n     before Iraq shut down all international arms control and \n     monitoring efforts. I've also publicly detailed Iraq's \n     refusal to yield or account for its holdings of at least 500 \n     tons of fuel usable only by Scud-type missiles. Iraqi \n     officials told me that a complete accounting for this fuel \n     was unnecessary because, after all, Iraq had no Scud \n     missiles. I disagreed, stating that the reverse was true: As \n     long as Iraq refused to yield the fuel, it clearly had \n     concealed Scuds or planned to acquire or build them.\n       Presumably unconnected with the administration's revelation \n     but simultaneous with it, former UNSCOM inspector Scott \n     Ritter, in an article in Arms Control Today, claimed that \n     Iraq is ``qualitatively disarmed.'' He failed to offer any \n     new information or evidence to support this dubious concept.\n       There were two levels of deception in Iraqi dealings with \n     UNSCOM: concealment and false declarations on the weapons \n     Iraq was prepared to put in play in the disarmament process. \n     When Ritter worked for me, he was in charge of the UNSCOM \n     unit responsible for finding and destroying the concealed \n     weapons, and he was vilified by Iraqi leaders as their major \n     persecutor. Now he says he has had private conversations with \n     unspecified Iraqi officials that have persuaded him they are \n     ``qualitatively disarmed'' and will accept a new monitoring \n     program if the Security Council first lifts all sanctions \n     against Iraq.\n       The facts are clear and alarming, and they do not support \n     this assertion. Iraq has been free of any arms control or \n     monitoring regime for almost two years, a consequence of the \n     breakdown of consensus among the permanent members of the \n     Security Council. Now Saddam Hussein is reconstituting his \n     capability to deploy weapons of mass destruction. I've seen \n     evidence of Iraq, attempts to acquire missile-related tools \n     and, even more chilling, of steps the Iraqis have taken to \n     reassemble their nuclear weapons design team. After the Gulf \n     War, experts assessed Iraq was only six months from testing \n     an atomic bomb. It retains that know-how. It also has rebuilt \n     its chemical and biological weapons manufacturing facilities.\n       If the United States is serious about addressing the threat \n     current developments raise, it should insist to its fellow \n     permanent members of the Security Council that there be a new \n     consensus on enforcing arms control in Iraq. Selective \n     revelations such as those recently issued by the \n     administration need to be accompanied by a robust policy \n     within the Security Council, making clear particularly to \n     Russia and France that the United States is not prepared to \n     accept their patronage of Saddam Hussein.\n                                  ____\n\n       Caracas, July 18 (Reuters)--Venezuelan OPEC President Ali \n     Rodriguez said Tuesday there would be no oil production rise \n     at the end of this month, because prices had fallen below the \n     upper limit of OPEC's price target band.\n       Speaking to reporters on his arrival in Venezuela after a \n     tour of OPEC countries, the Venezuelan energy and mines \n     minister said the mechanism to trigger an increase in \n     production depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying \n     above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days.\n       The price of OPEC's basket of crude fell to $27.46 a barrel \n     on Monday, according to the OPEC secretariat in Vienna.\n       Asked what would result from the fall in the basket price, \n     Rodriguez replied ``the 20-day process will begin again.''\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\n       OPEC's news agency carried a report on Monday quoting \n     Rodriguez as asking other members to prepare for an output \n     increase of 500,000 barrels a day if prices did not fall.\n       Asked whether he planned to consult with fellow OPEC \n     members on a possible increase, Rodriguez replied ``that does \n     not require consultation,'' By he added there is unanimous \n     consent in the cartel for an OPEC summit in Caracas in \n     September.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, that is the president of OPEC.\n  The article further states:\n\n       Speaking to reporters on his arrival in Venezuela after a \n     tour of OPEC countries, the Venezuelan energy and mines \n     minister said the mechanism to trigger an increase in \n     production depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying \n     above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days.\n\n  Our Secretary of Energy made a deal when he was over there several \nmonths ago and petitioned the Saudis for greater production. That was \nat the time we were first beginning to feel the price escalation. He \ndid generate a commitment for another 500,000 barrels of oil.\n  However, the American public and the American press made the \nassumption we were going to get all that increased production. We only \ngot 16 percent. That is our allocation in this country. Mr. President, \n16 percent of 500,000 barrels is not enough to fuel Washington, DC, in \n1 day. It is a drop in the bucket. Other areas of the world are \nrecovering, including Asia, Japan, and they are increasing in their \ndemand for oil.\n  In any event, speaking to reporters, the Venezuela Energy and Mines \nMinister says the mechanism to trigger an increase depended on the OPEC \noil basket price staying above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days. He \nfurther says the price of OPEC's basket of crude oil fell to $27.46 a \nbarrel on Monday, according to the OPEC secretary in Vienna. Asked what \nthe result from the fall in the basket price would be, Rodriguez \nreplied: The 20-day process will begin again.\n  So we are on another 20 days; no relief for at least 20 days. They \nare not going to produce more oil, so the price will stay around $30, \nwhere it is currently.\n  OPEC's news agency carried a report on Monday quoting Rodriguez and \nother members to prepare for an output increase of 500,000 barrels a \nday if prices did not fall. Well, they fell. And asked whether he \nplanned to consult with fellow OPEC members on a possible increase, \nRodriguez replied that does not require consultation. He added that \nthere is unanimous support in the cartel for an OPEC summit in Caracas \nin September. Remember where you heard it first. Right out of Caracas, \nfrom the president of OPEC, there is no relief in sight until \nSeptember.\n  Maybe we ought to go out and fill up our tanks today because it might \ngo up tomorrow.\n  There we are. A capsule, if you will, of the dilemma with regard to a \nlack of an energy policy, where we are on gasoline, where we are in \nheating oil, where we are in natural gas. Who bears the responsibility \nfor this? I think it is fair to say, at times this is a partisan body \nof some regard, I think we have seen from time to time situations where \nwe point the finger and don't want to bear the responsibility.\n  At the risk of generating some reaction from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, I think it is fair I point out some \ninconsistencies with regard to the position of our Vice President. As \nwe look at the coming election and the role of the candidate on energy \nand on the environment, I think we have to ask where the candidates \nreally stand. I will give one person's view. As the campaigns march \ntoward November, I think we have to ask ourselves where Vice President \nGore really stands in the minds of the voters. I served with the Vice \nPresident in this body and I have the deepest respect for him, but I \nthink we are aware that, while he is an expert politician, he is \nrecognized as an extreme environmentalist to some extent. He has a \nmixed bag. He is involved in policy but he also appears to be a zinc \nminer, an oil company shareholder, and has a record of shifting his \nposition on energy and environmental issues.\n  One looks back on gasoline prices, which I have talked a good deal \nabout this evening, but in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' the Vice \nPresident, who certainly structures himself as an environmentalist \nsaid: Higher taxes on fossil fuels is one of the logical first steps in \nchanging our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible \napproach to the environment.\n  ``Changing our policies'' is certainly legitimate. Even as the Vice \nPresident was casting a tie-breaking vote in this body to raise \ngasoline taxes--and it was his vote that raised them 4.3 cents--the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency determined that more expensive \nreformulated gasoline needed to be sold in many areas of the country. \nAccording to memoranda from the Department of Energy and the \nCongressional Research Service, EPA's gasoline requirements balkanized \nthe market and strained supply and raised prices.\n  One has to question whether, if the Vice President's policies were so \neffective in raising prices, one would expect the Vice President to be \nsomewhat satisfied. But obviously, confronted with angry consumers, Al \nGore, the politician, suggested that refiners and oil companies were to \nblame. There is a lot of blaming around here for anything that is an \ninconvenience to the public. We all scurry for cover. Again, I think we \nhave to look at whether what Al Gore wrote in his book, ``Earth in the \nBalance,'' suggests high energy prices would thwart the utilization of \ngasoline that, indeed, he might be satisfied with higher energy prices.\n  I have been handed a note relative to a matter that is of concern to \nall Members, and as a consequence I believe the leader is going to \nrequest the attention of this body.\n  I therefore suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald).

Mr. President, I would like to chat a little bit about \nenergy this evening because there are several misconceptions relative \nto the position that the United States is currently in relative to the \nhigh gasoline prices that we have been subjected to in the last several \nmonths.\n  First of all, the bad news is, there is no relief in sight. What we \ncurrently have is a situation where, simply, the available refining \ncapacity associated with gasoline production and the demand is such \nthat the two lines are almost parallel. In other words, our ability to \nproduce gasoline and the current consumption of gasoline are about \nequal. So as a consequence, in reality, we are drawing down our \nreserves. This is at a time when normally our reserves would be \nsubstantially higher.\n  There is a reason for this. I think the American people should \nunderstand and appreciate reality because what we have is a situation \nwhere our refining capacity has been reduced dramatically over the last \n8 years. We have lost about 37 refineries in the United States during \nthe last 10-year period. There has not been a new refinery built in the \nUnited States in almost two decades.\n  What we have, then, is a concentration of our existing refineries \noperating at near full capacity, producing the requirements associated \nwith the public's demand for gasoline, coupled with the problems \nassociated with meeting the Clean Air Act, which mandates certain \nreformulated gasolines in various parts of the country.\n  We had testimony before the committee of which I am chairman, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, earlier last week. One of the \nprincipals with the Environmental Protection Agency identified that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, under their interpretation of the \nClean Air Act, has mandated as many as nine specific cuts of \nreformulated gasolines that have a regional application around the \ncountry. That means in California you have one type of reformulated \ngasoline. You have another type in Chicago. You may have another type \nin Atlanta.\n  These have gone into effect as a consequence of the June 1 new \nmandates for reformulated gasoline in various parts of the country. \nWhat this means is, the refineries have to separate and move and store \nseparately these different cuts of gasoline. The cost, of course, is \nsignificant from the standpoint of what the American public has to pay.\n  We have seen, since the spiraling price of crude oil over the last \nyear--where a year ago prices were $11, $12, $13, $14 a barrel--an \naverage price of nearly $30 a barrel this year.\n  The difficulty we experience is, having become so dependent on \nimported\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\noil, currently imported oil is running at 56 percent of total U.S. \nconsumption. As we look at our neighbors in OPEC, we recognize that we \nhave an increasing dependence on their resources. In other words, they \ncontrol the supply and we are the market. As a consequence, when we \nhave significant demand increases of consumption, we go to OPEC, as our \nSecretary of Energy has done from time to time, encouraging more \nproduction.\n  However, OPEC seems to have learned from experience. They have \ndeveloped a strategy internally where they have set a price floor and a \nprice ceiling. The floor evidently is $22 a barrel of oil; the ceiling \nis $28 a barrel. In recent days, there has been an anticipation that \nOPEC will increase production, today we have the president of OPEC \nindicating that since the price fell temporarily below $28 a barrel, \nOPEC was not going to increase production and was going to review the \nmatter in another 20 days.\n  The American public should be aware that we are caught between a \nfloor-to-ceiling $22 to $28. The American public should be aware that \nas a consequence of OPEC's internal discipline, there is no relief in \nsight for a reduction of gas prices of anything appreciable. There will \nbe perhaps some regional reductions as we get the reformulated gasoline \nunder control in various parts of the country.\n  It is also important to recognize that one of the most significant \nadditives, MTBE, has been dismissed as contrary to the health of the \npublic in the sense that this reformulated portion does get into the \nwater table. As a consequence, we are substituting ethanol for MTBE, \nwhich is a grain and agriculture product that enjoys a partial subsidy \nbut nevertheless is a satisfactory additive to make reformulated \ngasoline to meet the market demands in the various regions of the \ncountry.\n  The point I want to make is that on gasoline, our demand is up. Our \nproduction is relatively stagnant, even though we are producing at the \nmaximum capacity for our refineries. We have a situation where we are \nactually pulling down our reserves. For many Members of this body, \nparticularly in the Northeast corridor, who are concerned legitimately \nabout the high cost of heating oil and the awareness that there might \nnot be adequate reserves being built up during the summer to meet the \ndemand if there is a cold winter, they justifiably should be concerned. \nWhat we should be doing now is dropping off substantially our \nproduction of gasoline and building up reserves for heating oil. But \nthat is not the case. Our reserves for heating oil are at an all-time \nlow.\n  We have had consideration from the Clinton administration and some \nMembers to set up some kind of a heating oil strategic reserve. This is \nrather an interesting dilemma, if you walk through it and understand \nit. It doesn't necessarily create the relief we want and may suggest \nthat the Government is involving itself in the manipulation of pricing \nof petroleum products.\n  Let me cite an example of what I fear. Currently, the thought is that \nthere will be an arrangement made by the Department of Energy to \nacquire up to 2 million barrels of heating oil reserve somewhere in the \nNortheast, perhaps in the New York City area, where they can lease \ntankage. The tradeoff on where the oil would come from would be crude \noil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana. That oil, of \ncourse, is not refined. If we take an equivalent of 2 million barrels \nplus, because we want to have value for value, and take the crude oil \nout of SPR and refine it, we are offsetting the refining capacity of \nthat refiner of making gasoline or perhaps heating oil with the \nsubstitution of the oil from SPR.\n  That is purchased by the Government, put in storage, and sits in \nstorage until such time as circumstances dictate the trigger be pulled \nand the oil released. Then the question is, What is the appropriate \ntriggering mechanism? Are we going to trigger the release of based on \nthe price of heating oil, or are we going to do it as a consequence of \na supply shortage?\n  Last year, we had a critical situation in the Northeast but did not \nactually have anyone go without heating oil. What happened last year is \nthe reserves were very low, but there was enough to meet the demand. \nThis year, the fear, rightly so, for many in the Northeast is that \nthere might not be enough fuel oil to meet the demand if the winter \ngets cold. The dilemma is, if the Government is putting in 2 million \nbarrels and going to basically store it, then is the industry that \nordinarily would build up an inventory and tie up its cash-flow for a \nperiod of time going to do that, knowing that the Federal Government is \ndoing the same thing? It is going to be a business decision, but it is \ngoing to be interesting to see what the private sector does.\n  It might be simply a tradeoff. Why should the private sector build up \nan inventory when it knows the Government has an inventory? In the end, \nis there any more fuel oil left for the Northeast corridor if indeed \nthere is a cold winter?\n  I bring this out to point to the difficulty we are having in coming \nto grips with the reality that we have a greater demand for oil than we \nhave of productive capability. We have become dependent again on our \nneighbors in OPEC--and not just the 10 official OPEC members. One of \nour other associates is a gentleman by the name of Saddam Hussein, who \nis the head of Iraq.\n  Many people forget that we fought a war over there just a decade ago. \nWe lost 147 lives; we had 427 Americans who were wounded; we had 23 \ntaken prisoner. Today, Iraq is the fastest growing source of oil for \nthe United States. Isn't that rather ironic? I can't understand why \nAmericans are not indignant over the fact that we are looking to this \ntyrant, who we know is selling oil, smuggling it out, generating funds \nfor missile development--there was just an article today relative to \nthe testing of a new missile by Iraq--developing his biological \ncapability. This man is a bad man. He is up to no good. Yet the United \nStates is looking to him to bail us out for our supply of oil. It is \nabsolutely ironic that we would look to Saddam Hussein.\n  August 2 will be the 10th anniversary of Saddam Hussein's invasion of \nKuwait. What a difference a decade makes. Let's do a little comparison. \nI think the American people should wake up and be a little sensitive to \nthe fact that we have lifted embargoes on technologies that would allow \nhim to increase his refining capacity. The U.N. no longer does any \ninspections of what is going on in Iraq or where his oil is going or \nwhether it is going for the Food for Peace Program.\n  Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait to stimulate higher oil \nprices and to build up his war machine. We know that. That was 10 years \nago. Now high oil prices yield Saddam Hussein $75 million a day under a \nlegal U.N. oil-for-food program and $2 million a day in illegal \nsmuggling revenue which is used to build up his war machine.\n  Mr. President, we know this for a fact. We know what he is doing with \nthe funds he gets from smuggling oil. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was \nproved to be the biggest threat to peace in the Middle East. As of \ntoday, it has cost thousands of lives, some $10 billion of U.S. \ntaxpayers' money, and 150,000 sorties, where we have flown to enforce \nour no-fly zone. It has cost the American taxpayers $10 billion to \nfence in Saddam Hussein.\n  Saddam Hussein is still the biggest threat to peace in the Mideast \nand certainly the biggest threat to Israel. I can't understand why \nthere is not more of an awakening of the fact that we are supporting \nthis tyrant. We are becoming more dependent upon him and we are playing \ninto his hands.\n  Where is the logic? Where is the American foreign policy? I can \nsimplify foreign policy with regard to Saddam Hussein and Iraq in one \nsingle syllogism. We buy his oil, we send him our dollars, we put his \noil in our airplanes, and fly over and bomb him. He puts out a press \nrelease saying how many people we injured or killed, they rally around \nSaddam Hussein, and the process starts all over again.\n  Is this the foreign policy of the United States that we support? Or \nwould we rather ignore it and pretend it doesn't exist? I think the \nlatter is probably the case. It is absolutely incredible that we don't \nface up to what is happening and the fact that we are condoning this \naction. Ten years ago, Saddam Hussein was using oil revenue to purchase \nweapons of mass destruction. Now, Saddam Hussein--the same guy--is \nusing his oil revenue to purchase weapons of mass destruction. We\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\nknow this. They just tested them yesterday. He has the ability, with \nthe advanced weaponry he has developed, to extend the missile clear to \nIsrael.\n  Ten years ago, the United States purchased less than 400,000 barrels \na day from Iraq--before the war started. Now the United States is \npurchasing 750,000 barrels a day. Ten years ago, the United States \nbegan to import more than 50 percent of our oil, and OPEC became an \nimportant voice in U.S. energy policy. Now, the United States, as I \nhave indicated, is importing more than 56 percent of our oil. With \nIraq, the fastest-growing supplier, Saddam Hussein has become an \nimportant voice--imagine that--in our U.S. energy policy. Saddam \nHussein may have lost the war, but he certainly seems to have won the \npeace. With its energy policy--or lack thereof--the Clinton-Gore \nadministration has snatched defeat from the jaws of the gulf war \nvictory. I will repeat that. Saddam Hussein may have lost the war, but \nhe has won the peace. With its energy policy, or lack of an energy \npolicy, the Clinton-Gore administration has snatched defeat from the \njaws of the gulf victory.\n  We are very much dependent on this source, and the likelihood of \nreducing it is not going to take place until we send a clear message as \nto what our energy policy will be. Now, the alternatives aren't really \nvery complex. We either import more and pay the price, or we commit to \ndevelopment and exploration of our energy resources here in the United \nStates. Wyoming, Montana, Colorado--the overthrust belt--have a \ntremendous potential for oil and gas development, as does Illinois, \nPennsylvania, and numerous other States. We have withdrawn about 64 \npercent of the public land in the United States and exempted it from \nexploration, let alone production.\n  Now, we have a tremendous potential in OCS areas--off the shores of \nTexas, Alabama, Mississippi, and other States, some of which don't want \nto develop OCS areas off their States. That is their own business. But \nfor those who do they should be allowed to do so. It is kind of \ninteresting because our Vice President made a statement in Louisiana \nthat if he is elected President, he will make an attempt to buy back \nOCS oil leases and cancel other leases.\n  Mr. President, that leaves one with the question: Where is this \nenergy going to come from? We have energy coming from my State of \nAlaska. We have been producing 20 to 25 percent of our domestic crude \noil for the last twenty years. We have the potential for a major \ndiscovery in a small sliver of the Arctic area, the Coastal Plain. Let \nme explain how small that sliver is. In the general area of the Arctic \nWildlife Refuge, there are 19 million acres. That is as big as the size \nof the State of South Carolina. Half of that has been reserved in \nperpetuity as a wilderness. Nearly the other half has been set aside in \na refuge, also in perpetuity, subject to the Congress, who are the only \nones that can change it. Out of those 19 million acres, 1.5 million \nacres was left out to the discretion of Congress back in 1980. That was \ndone as a consequence of the belief that this was the area where a \nlikely discovery could be made.\n\n  Well, there have been a lot of estimates. When you look for oil, you \nnever know where you are going to find it or how much you are going to \nfind. If you are going to find it in Alaska, you better find a lot of \nit; otherwise, you can't afford to produce it. Recent estimates go as \nhigh as 16 billion barrels of recoverable reserves. That is based on \nthe latest discovery and production technology, even though much of \nthis area has not been made available for 3D seismic evaluation because \nit is under the Department of Interior. Sixteen billion barrels would \nbe as much as what we would import from Saudi Arabia for a 30-year \nperiod. So it is a substantial amount.\n  What we need to do in this country--and we need to do it now; the \nlonger we wait, the more dependent we are going to be on OPEC--is to \nset a clear and decisive policy toward a commitment to reduce our \ndependence on imports. That is what we have done, along with Senator \nLott and several colleagues, in the legislation we introduced, which is \nthe National Energy Security Act of 2000. We have adopted a goal to \nguide our energy policy, and the goal is to reduce our dependence on \nimported oil to less than 50 percent by the end of the decade. When you \nhave that kind of objective, you have an opportunity to send a clear \nmessage.\n  We have to send a clear message. We have to send a message to Saudi \nArabia and to Kuwait, and we have to send it to Venezuela and Mexico, \nthat we are committed to reducing our dependence and we are committed \nto increase exploration and production here in the United States. I \nadmire the commitment of America's environmental community who, for the \nmost part, oppose domestic oil production and exploration in the United \nStates. But I remind them that we have the technology, the know-how, \nthe American can-do spirit, and we can make the impact of development \nmuch smaller here and keep the jobs and the dollars at home, as opposed \nto the exploration that occurs in other areas of the world where they \ndon't have the environmental safeguards. So what kind of a tradeoff is \nit? Is it better for the environment that we do it right here at home, \nor if we depend on those countries that don't have that internal \ndiscipline and consideration for the environment?\n  The industry says that if, indeed, they find oil in this sliver of \nthe Arctic, out of the 1.5 million acres, which is part of the 19 \nmillion acres, which is the size of South Carolina, the footprint would \nbe somewhere between 1,500 to 2,000 acres. My friends who are in the \nfarming business know what kind of a farm a 1,500-acre or 2,000-acre \nfarm is. The drilling and exploration would be done in the wintertime. \nThe roads would be ice roads. There would be no permanent community. \nThere would be a compatibility with the caribou. We have addressed all \nthe issues, and we have proven it in Prudhoe Bay, where 20 percent of \nthe crude oil has come from for the last two decades. But that was old \ntechnology; we have new technology now. Many don't want us to have an \nopportunity to find out if indeed the oil is there, and the oil is \nthere in the reserves that we have.\n  Some people more or less dismiss it, and say, well, we are in a \nsituation with oil. Don't worry. We have lots of natural gas.\n  As chairman of the Energy Committee, I have a little bit of a \ndifferent view about the situation with natural gas in this country. \nLet me start out by reminding you and the American people that there is \na rude awakening coming with regard to natural gas. It is going to \naffect Americans in their heating bills. It is going to affect \nAmericans in their electric bills.\n  This is what has happened. A year ago in this country the price for \nnatural gas was around $2.30. Six months ago, it was $2.56. Deliveries \nin January are $4.30. I know many utilities are going to their \ncommissions advising them of rate increases. This hasn't hit the \nAmerican public yet. If we thought the hue and cry on the increased \nprice of heating oil or gasoline was going to bring down the roof, wait \nuntil you hear the cry of the American people this winter when they get \ntheir gas bills.\n  How did this come about? Somebody said, well, we have 160 trillion \ncubic feet in reserve. That was last year. We have 150 trillion cubic \nfeet this year. We are, again, pulling down our reserves faster than we \nare finding new reserves. When you do that, you deplete your base.\n  What also is happening to put further pressure is the electric \nindustry is turning to gas turbines for power generation--turbines. The \npermitting process is much easier and much cheaper than for building a \ncoal-fired plant.\n  We have a situation where we are coming to grips. The American people \naren't aware of it. They are not reflecting on it because it doesn't \nreally hit them like they were hit in 1973 or 1974 when we had the Arab \noil embargo. Some people in this body might be old enough to remember. \nWe had gasoline lines around the block. The public was outraged: How \ncould this happen in this country? How could we have these kinds of \nshortages? We did. The public reacted. We played the blame game and \npointed the finger at everybody and everything. Gasoline and oil prices \nhad no relief in sight.\n  I can guarantee it, natural gas has spiraled. It is escalating with \nno relief in sight. How did we get in this situation? One reason is we \nhaven't had an energy policy for a long, long time.\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\n  What is our energy policy? Clearly, it is to provide more imports of \noil into this country as opposed to developing domestic oil reserves. \nWhat is our gas policy on natural gas? We have withdrawn from public \nlands areas that ordinarily would be available for exploration--64 \npercent of the overthrust belt, as I have indicated.\n  What have we done with regard to nuclear power? Twenty percent of our \npower generation is nuclear energy. We can't pass a bill in this body \nto deal with the waste. We can't override the President's veto. We are \none vote short to address what to do with our nuclear waste. There \nhasn't been a nuclear plant built in this country in 20 years. There is \nnot going to be. They are building them in China. They are building \nthem in Taiwan. They are building them in France. France is 76 percent \ndependent on nuclear energy. They don't have air quality problems. They \nare never going to be held hostage by the Mideast again. They learned \nthat in 1973.\n  We don't have a policy on oil other than to import more. We don't \nhave a policy for encouraging domestic gas exploration. We don't have a \npolicy to address what we are going to do with our nuclear industry let \nalone resolve the nuclear waste problem. We have lots of coal. Are we \nbuilding coal plants? Absolutely not. The permitting time for coal \nplants puts them out of reach of reality. There are none being built.\n  Tell me from where the energy is going to come. There are many who \nsay, well, we should find alternative energy. I am all for it. But you \nname it.\n\n  We have spent over $70 billion in the last two decades subsidizing \nthe development of alternative energy. What is it? Solar, biomass, \nwind? Some places in my State, such as Barrow, don't get much daylight \nin the wintertime. It is dark all the time. Sometimes the wind doesn't \nblow. These alternatives are fine. They have a place. We have to \nencourage them. But they are not going to take the place of oil and gas \nin the near future. By the time we are through evaluating our \nalternatives, it is not a very bright picture because the alternatives \njust aren't there. The alternatives provide us with about 4 percent of \nour current energy mix.\n  We have hydro. I have not spoken of hydro. It is a renewable \nresource. There is no question about it. But this administration \ncuriously enough has identified hydro as nonrenewable. I grew up in \nKetchikan, AK. We have a couple hundred inches of rain a year. I \nremember one year we had 226 inches of rain. We have a few little \nhydrodams.\n  To suggest rainfall and hydro are not renewable is beyond me. But, \nnevertheless, the administration proposes to remove some of the dams \nfrom the Columbia and Snake Rivers to rebuild the fish runs. \nUnfortunately, some time ago decisions were made, rightly or wrongly, \nwith regard to the tradeoff on posterity. It is just that simple. You \nare going to have your natural runs of fish. You are not going to have \ndams. But they trade it consciously or unconsciously for the \nagricultural industry associated and what dams those rivers could do \nwith benefits in low-cost power to the residents of the area. Whether \nyou have an aluminum plant, whether you have Boeing, whether you have \ntremendous agricultural productivity out of land that was once desert, \nthey traded those things off. You can't want it both ways. You want to \nrebuild the natural runs. Most of the biologists will tell you that you \ncan enhance runs by bringing in new stock, if your ability to rebuild \nthe native runs is pretty remote. Some people suggest it is not \npossible.\n  But if you tear down the dams, there is another tradeoff. How much \nbarge traffic that moves the grain and commerce up and down the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers is going to go back on the highways? It is \nall going to go back, isn't it? Somebody said there will be 700,000 \nmore trucks on our highways, if you tear down the dams. What kind of a \ntradeoff is that?\n  There is no energy policy identifiable with this administration. It \nis that simple--no oil, no domestic exploration, no hydro, no nuclear, \nno coal. That is the reality of where we are. It is a pretty bleak \npicture.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement \nfrom Richard Butler from the Washington Post dated Monday, July 17, \nentitled ``Guess Who's Back.'' It is our friend, Saddam Hussein. It is \nentitled ``Saddam Hussein is reconstituting his capability to deploy \nweapons of mass destruction.''\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a \nstatement that came out of Reuters today entitled ``Venezuelan OPEC \npresident Ali Rodriguez said Tuesday there would be no oil production \nrise at the end of this month because prices have fallen below the \nupper limit of OPEC's price target ban.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Washington Post, Monday, July 17, 2000]\n\n                            Guess Who's Back\n\n                          (By Richard Butler)\n\n       So you thought Saddam Hussein was out of your life? Sorry--\n     he's back, manufacturing the weapons of mass destruction with \n     which he threatens the Iraqi people, his neighbors and, by \n     extension, the safety of the world.\n       Two separate developments have returned Saddam Hussein to \n     the headlines. Earlier this month the administration revealed \n     that its satellites had detected Iraq test-firing Al-Samoud \n     missiles, home-grown, smaller versions of the Scuds last used \n     against Israel during the 1990 Gulf War. The chief of U.S. \n     Central Command, Gen. Tony Zinni, said that the range of the \n     Al-Samoud easily could be increased.\n       The administration also revealed that Saddam Hussein has \n     been hiding between 20 and 30 Russian Scuds as well as \n     working through front companies outside Iraq to acquire the \n     machine tools needed to build more missiles.\n       None of this is new. In my last report as executive \n     chairman of UNSCOM, the agency charged with disarming Saddam, \n     I warned the U.N. Security Council about Iraq's missile-\n     development activities. That was almost two years ago, just \n     before Iraq shut down all international arms control and \n     monitoring efforts. I've also publicly detailed Iraq's \n     refusal to yield or account for its holdings of at least 500 \n     tons of fuel usable only by Scud-type missiles. Iraqi \n     officials told me that a complete accounting for this fuel \n     was unnecessary because, after all, Iraq had no Scud \n     missiles. I disagreed, stating that the reverse was true: As \n     long as Iraq refused to yield the fuel, it clearly had \n     concealed Scuds or planned to acquire or build them.\n       Presumably unconnected with the administration's revelation \n     but simultaneous with it, former UNSCOM inspector Scott \n     Ritter, in an article in Arms Control Today, claimed that \n     Iraq is ``qualitatively disarmed.'' He failed to offer any \n     new information or evidence to support this dubious concept.\n       There were two levels of deception in Iraqi dealings with \n     UNSCOM: concealment and false declarations on the weapons \n     Iraq was prepared to put in play in the disarmament process. \n     When Ritter worked for me, he was in charge of the UNSCOM \n     unit responsible for finding and destroying the concealed \n     weapons, and he was vilified by Iraqi leaders as their major \n     persecutor. Now he says he has had private conversations with \n     unspecified Iraqi officials that have persuaded him they are \n     ``qualitatively disarmed'' and will accept a new monitoring \n     program if the Security Council first lifts all sanctions \n     against Iraq.\n       The facts are clear and alarming, and they do not support \n     this assertion. Iraq has been free of any arms control or \n     monitoring regime for almost two years, a consequence of the \n     breakdown of consensus among the permanent members of the \n     Security Council. Now Saddam Hussein is reconstituting his \n     capability to deploy weapons of mass destruction. I've seen \n     evidence of Iraq, attempts to acquire missile-related tools \n     and, even more chilling, of steps the Iraqis have taken to \n     reassemble their nuclear weapons design team. After the Gulf \n     War, experts assessed Iraq was only six months from testing \n     an atomic bomb. It retains that know-how. It also has rebuilt \n     its chemical and biological weapons manufacturing facilities.\n       If the United States is serious about addressing the threat \n     current developments raise, it should insist to its fellow \n     permanent members of the Security Council that there be a new \n     consensus on enforcing arms control in Iraq. Selective \n     revelations such as those recently issued by the \n     administration need to be accompanied by a robust policy \n     within the Security Council, making clear particularly to \n     Russia and France that the United States is not prepared to \n     accept their patronage of Saddam Hussein.\n                                  ____\n\n       Caracas, July 18 (Reuters)--Venezuelan OPEC President Ali \n     Rodriguez said Tuesday there would be no oil production rise \n     at the end of this month, because prices had fallen below the \n     upper limit of OPEC's price target band.\n       Speaking to reporters on his arrival in Venezuela after a \n     tour of OPEC countries, the Venezuelan energy and mines \n     minister said the mechanism to trigger an increase in \n     production depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying \n     above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days.\n       The price of OPEC's basket of crude fell to $27.46 a barrel \n     on Monday, according to the OPEC secretariat in Vienna.\n       Asked what would result from the fall in the basket price, \n     Rodriguez replied ``the 20-day process will begin again.''\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\n       OPEC's news agency carried a report on Monday quoting \n     Rodriguez as asking other members to prepare for an output \n     increase of 500,000 barrels a day if prices did not fall.\n       Asked whether he planned to consult with fellow OPEC \n     members on a possible increase, Rodriguez replied ``that does \n     not require consultation,'' By he added there is unanimous \n     consent in the cartel for an OPEC summit in Caracas in \n     September.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, that is the president of OPEC.\n  The article further states:\n\n       Speaking to reporters on his arrival in Venezuela after a \n     tour of OPEC countries, the Venezuelan energy and mines \n     minister said the mechanism to trigger an increase in \n     production depended on the OPEC oil basket price staying \n     above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days.\n\n  Our Secretary of Energy made a deal when he was over there several \nmonths ago and petitioned the Saudis for greater production. That was \nat the time we were first beginning to feel the price escalation. He \ndid generate a commitment for another 500,000 barrels of oil.\n  However, the American public and the American press made the \nassumption we were going to get all that increased production. We only \ngot 16 percent. That is our allocation in this country. Mr. President, \n16 percent of 500,000 barrels is not enough to fuel Washington, DC, in \n1 day. It is a drop in the bucket. Other areas of the world are \nrecovering, including Asia, Japan, and they are increasing in their \ndemand for oil.\n  In any event, speaking to reporters, the Venezuela Energy and Mines \nMinister says the mechanism to trigger an increase depended on the OPEC \noil basket price staying above $28 a barrel for 20 consecutive days. He \nfurther says the price of OPEC's basket of crude oil fell to $27.46 a \nbarrel on Monday, according to the OPEC secretary in Vienna. Asked what \nthe result from the fall in the basket price would be, Rodriguez \nreplied: The 20-day process will begin again.\n  So we are on another 20 days; no relief for at least 20 days. They \nare not going to produce more oil, so the price will stay around $30, \nwhere it is currently.\n  OPEC's news agency carried a report on Monday quoting Rodriguez and \nother members to prepare for an output increase of 500,000 barrels a \nday if prices did not fall. Well, they fell. And asked whether he \nplanned to consult with fellow OPEC members on a possible increase, \nRodriguez replied that does not require consultation. He added that \nthere is unanimous support in the cartel for an OPEC summit in Caracas \nin September. Remember where you heard it first. Right out of Caracas, \nfrom the president of OPEC, there is no relief in sight until \nSeptember.\n  Maybe we ought to go out and fill up our tanks today because it might \ngo up tomorrow.\n  There we are. A capsule, if you will, of the dilemma with regard to a \nlack of an energy policy, where we are on gasoline, where we are in \nheating oil, where we are in natural gas. Who bears the responsibility \nfor this? I think it is fair to say, at times this is a partisan body \nof some regard, I think we have seen from time to time situations where \nwe point the finger and don't want to bear the responsibility.\n  At the risk of generating some reaction from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, I think it is fair I point out some \ninconsistencies with regard to the position of our Vice President. As \nwe look at the coming election and the role of the candidate on energy \nand on the environment, I think we have to ask where the candidates \nreally stand. I will give one person's view. As the campaigns march \ntoward November, I think we have to ask ourselves where Vice President \nGore really stands in the minds of the voters. I served with the Vice \nPresident in this body and I have the deepest respect for him, but I \nthink we are aware that, while he is an expert politician, he is \nrecognized as an extreme environmentalist to some extent. He has a \nmixed bag. He is involved in policy but he also appears to be a zinc \nminer, an oil company shareholder, and has a record of shifting his \nposition on energy and environmental issues.\n  One looks back on gasoline prices, which I have talked a good deal \nabout this evening, but in his book ``Earth in the Balance,'' the Vice \nPresident, who certainly structures himself as an environmentalist \nsaid: Higher taxes on fossil fuels is one of the logical first steps in \nchanging our policies in a manner consistent with a more responsible \napproach to the environment.\n  ``Changing our policies'' is certainly legitimate. Even as the Vice \nPresident was casting a tie-breaking vote in this body to raise \ngasoline taxes--and it was his vote that raised them 4.3 cents--the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency determined that more expensive \nreformulated gasoline needed to be sold in many areas of the country. \nAccording to memoranda from the Department of Energy and the \nCongressional Research Service, EPA's gasoline requirements balkanized \nthe market and strained supply and raised prices.\n  One has to question whether, if the Vice President's policies were so \neffective in raising prices, one would expect the Vice President to be \nsomewhat satisfied. But obviously, confronted with angry consumers, Al \nGore, the politician, suggested that refiners and oil companies were to \nblame. There is a lot of blaming around here for anything that is an \ninconvenience to the public. We all scurry for cover. Again, I think we \nhave to look at whether what Al Gore wrote in his book, ``Earth in the \nBalance,'' suggests high energy prices would thwart the utilization of \ngasoline that, indeed, he might be satisfied with higher energy prices.\n  I have been handed a note relative to a matter that is of concern to \nall Members, and as a consequence I believe the leader is going to \nrequest the attention of this body.\n  I therefore suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, last Friday, the Senate concluded debate on \nthe Death Tax Elimination Act, H.R. 8, and passed the bill by a \nbipartisan vote of 59 to 39. I am very grateful to Senators on both \nsides of the aisle who supported this important legislation.\n  The broad, bipartisan support the death-tax repeal bill received \nsuggests that we have finally found a formula for taxing inherited \nassets in a fair and common sense way. Unrealized gains will be taxed, \nbut they will be taxed when they are earned--not at death. Death itself \nwill no longer trigger a tax.\n  This change--effectively substituting a capital-gains tax, which \nwould be due upon the sale of inherited assets, for an estate tax at \ndeath--is itself a compromise.\n  When I first introduced a death-tax repeal bill in 1995, I did not \npropose any change in the stepped-up basis--a change that is at the \nheart of this bill. My original legislation would have repealed the \ndeath tax and allowed heirs to continue to step up the tax basis in the \ninherited property to the fair market value at the date of death.\n  That is obviously the ideal world for taxpayers: No death tax, and a \nminimal capital-gains tax when the inherited assets are later sold. The \nproblem was, that approach sat idle for four years. We could not get it \nto the Senate floor for a vote, and we could not attract bipartisan \nsupport for it.\n  The idea behind this bill really came out of a hearing before the \nSenate Finance Committee in 1997. At the hearing, Senators Moynihan and \nKerrey acknowledged that the death tax was problematic, but expressed \nthe concern that, if we repealed the death tax without adjusting the \nbasis rules, unrealized gains in assets held until death could go \nuntaxed forever.\n  It struck me then that we had the basis for a compromise. If we could \nagree that death should not trigger a tax, we should be able to agree \nthat death should not confer a tax benefit, either. The answer was to \nsimply take death out of the equation. Coupling death-tax repeal with a \nlimitation on the step-up in basis does just that.\n  So H.R. 8 represents a compromise. And that is why, I think, we were \nable to win the votes of 59 Senators, including nine Democrats. And \nthat is why 65 Democrats were able to support the legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  During consideration of the death-tax repeal bill last week, some of \nour colleagues on the other side proposed a different kind of \ncompromise. They said theirs would repeal the death tax for virtually \nall family-owned businesses and farms. Some have suggested that, if \nPresident Clinton vetoes the death-tax repeal initiative, the \nDemocratic substitute might serve as a basis for further compromise. \nThe problem is, the approach taken in the substitute--while well-\nintentioned--is fatally flawed.\n  Here is how the Wall Street Journal put it in an editorial on July \n13:\n\n       Senate Democrats also offer to expand a small-business and \n     farm exception that is a tax-lawyer's dream. The loophole, \n     known as IRS Code section 2057, is so complicated and onerous \n     that few estates qualify.\n\n  Let me take a few moments to explain the deficiencies of this \nDemocratic substitute. First, there are requirements that more than 50 \npercent of the decedent's assets must be made up of the qualifying \nbusiness; that the decedent or immediate family must have actively \noperated the business for five of the eight years preceding death; and \nthat a member of the immediate family must agree to continue to operate \nthe business for at least 10 years after the decedent's death.\n  If any of these conditions is not adhered to for 10 full years after \ndeath, the government can still collect the original estate-tax that \nwas due, plus accrued interest.\n  And understand this: to protect its right to recapture the estate tax \nif the business fails to comply, the Federal Government attaches a \nFederal tax lien to the property for a full 10 years. For a business, \nlike farming, which is credit-dependent, such tax liens can make it \nvirtually impossible to secure loans and financing for business \noperations, for growth, and for viability. In addition, the heirs are \nheld personally liable for the estate tax and any penalties.\n  So, far from providing meaningful relief, the Democratic substitute \nleaves a cloud over the family business for up to a decade after death. \nThe government can come back any time and recapture the estate tax that \nwas due, plus interest, if the business, at any point, falls out of \ncompliance. The threat of reimposition of the tax absolutely limits the \nfamily's flexibility in managing and disposing of business assets in \nits best interest.\n  The Democratic substitute relies on the current law's onerous \nmaterial participation requirement, which, in effect, forces the family \nto work in the day-to-day operation of the business, or face the death \ntax, plus severe penalties. These requirements may be difficult to \nsatisfy if, for example, the present owners are disabled or other \nfamily members are not yet involved in the business.\n  It relies on very complex rules for determining the value of farms \nand closely-held business interests. Historically, the IRS has \nchallenged virtually every valuation method used, and these challenges \ntypically wind up in Tax Court.\n  There are currently 149 tax cases which have been decided and \nreported involving 2032A issues. The IRS has challenged the validity of \n2032A election or planning, and has won in approximately 67 percent of \nthe cases. An equal number may be embroiled in the administrative \nprocess before court action. So much for relief--two-thirds of the few \nwho do think they qualify, do not ultimately qualify and have to pay \nthe tax with interest.\n  The so-called family business ``carveout,'' which is embodied in \nSection 2057 of current law, is so bad that the Real Property and \nProbate Section of the American Bar Association has urged its repeal.\n  The reason the ABA condemns this section so strongly is that it is \nextremely complex and has an extremely limited application. It provides \nlittle practical help to families trying to preserve the family-owned \nfarm or small business. It incorporates 14 sections from Section 2032A, \nwhich the ABA considers the most dangerous section of the estate-tax \nlaw because of the risk of malpractice claims against estate-planning \nlawyers and accountants.\n  So the fact is, if you rely on these sections of the tax code, you \ncan raise the value of the estates eligible for relief as high as you \nwant, and still few estates are going to get the intended relief. \nEstimates are that only about three to five percent of estates would \nbenefit, and even then, as I said before,\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nif they do not continue to meet all requirements for 10 years after \ndeath, the government can still come back and collect the original \nestate-tax bill plus accrued interest. The government's interest is \nprotected by a lien that is maintained on the business for 10 years.\n  Of course, because the family-business carveout is so complex--\nbecause it requires determining compliance and ensuring continued \ncompliance for 10 years--business owners have to continue to engage in \nexpensive estate-tax planning. That is a tremendous waste of \nresources--resources that would otherwise be plowed back into the \nbusiness for new jobs, better pay for current employees, business \nexpansion, or research and development.\n  A recent report by the National Association of Women Business Owners \n(NAWBO) found that, ``on average, 39 jobs per business or 11,000 jobs \nhave already been lost due to the planning and payment of the death \ntax.'' NAWBO projects that, on average, 103 jobs per business, or a \ntotal of 28,000 jobs, will be lost as a result of the tax over the next \nfive years. That would not change under the Democratic substitute, \nbecause there would still be a need for expensive estate-tax planning.\n  Mr. President, 59 Senators voted for a better approach--one that \ntakes death out of the equation and taxes inherited assets like any \nother assets for tax purposes. A capital-gains tax would be paid when \nthe assets are sold, with only a limited adjustment in the decedent's \ntax basis to ensure that no one is subject to new tax liability.\n  That is the true compromise. Tinkering with an already unworkable \nsection of the tax code is not an effective substitute. I hope the \nPresident will sign the Death Tax Elimination Act when it reaches his \ndesk. If not, we will be back next year when a new President is in the \nWhite House, and I predict that we will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7151-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WILLISTON WATER TRANSMISSION LINE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nbill to authorize the Williston Water Transmission Line. Williston is a \nsmall town of 13,000 located in the Northwest corner of North Dakota \nabout twenty miles East of the Montana state line. Williston is located \nalong the Missouri River not far from where the Fort Union Trading Post \nexisted from 1828-1867. Today the fur trading post is a tourist \nattraction, and agriculture and oil productions are the main industries \nin the Williston area.\n  Mr. President, prior to construction of the existing Williston Water \nTreatment Plant, Williston obtained water to meet its municipal needs \nfrom the Missouri River. With the construction of the Garrison Dam and \nthe creation of Lake Sakakawea in 1954, Williston is in the delta area \nof Lake Sakakawea and had to relocate its water intake and water \ntreatment plant approximately five miles upstream to its present \nlocation. The Corps and Williston funded the construction of a large \ndiameter transmission line to convey the entire water supply from the \nwater treatment plant to the city of Williston.\n  All of the water treated by the water treatment plant must flow \nthrough this single existing transmission line to reach Williston. In \nthe 1970's and early 80's, siltation covered the existing intake valves \nfor the city's water supply, requiring the construction of two new \nintake valves. The lake is currently silting twice as fast as the \noriginal Corps estimate. Mr. President, in the spring of 1998, a leak \nin the transmission line caused by the saturated soil forced the city \nto forgo any supply of water for five and a half days. The lack of \naccessibility, unstable soil conditions and high ground water along the \nroute make the line's reliability a significant concern. Williston must \nnow construct a new water transmission line on higher ground.\n  This bill will authorize the construction of a new water transmission \nline to Williston. Because the old line has been damaged by the \nconstruction of the Garrison Dam, this authorization is appropriate and \nessential. Mr. President, I would like to commend the residents of \nWilliston who have worked so hard for so long to resolve this problem. \nThey have been tireless in their efforts to fix this problem--a problem \ncaused by the Federal government.\n  Mr. President, I join with Senator Conrad and look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure the citizens of Williston have a reliable \nwater transmission line.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7151-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE WHITE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Interior \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. Included in that legislation \nis a rider that exempts the White Mountain National Forest in New \nHampshire from the Forest Service's Roadless Initiative. While I \nsupported the passage of the Interior Appropriations bill, I want to \nexpress my concern over this rider.\n  I am concerned because the White Mountain National Forest is a \nnational resource, and it is completely appropriate for the federal \ngovernment to set forth policies to conserve and protect a national \nresource. Many of my constituents in Massachusetts hike, camp, sightsee \nand enjoy the great natural lands of the White Mountains. In fact, it \nwas a Massachusetts Congressman, John Weeks, who sponsored the \nlegislation creating the White Mountain National Forest. When the \nForest Service sought comment on a new management plan for the forest, \nmore than 54 percent of all comments were submitted by Massachusetts \nresidents. Proponents of the rider have argued that its purpose is to \nprotect local control of forest management. Certainly local residents \nshould have input in the management of the forest. I urge local \nparticipation in decisions at Cape Cod National Seashore. However, it \nsets a bad precedent when one forest is exempted from a national policy \nto protect the national interest.\n  Despite these concerns I did not move to strike this rider. The \nreason, ironically, is that I'm confident that the White Mountain \nNational Forest will remain protected because of local input. Time and \nagain, the local process, driven by the citizens of New Hampshire and \nMassachusetts, has resulted in sound management of the White Mountain \nNational Forest. So, while I oppose the amendment for the precedent it \nwill set, I expect and hope that it will have almost no impact on the \nhealth of the forest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7151-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Ecole \nClassique Academic Games team from Metairie, Louisiana, which is one of \nthe most successful Academic Games teams in America.\n  For the past seven years, Ecole Classique has competed in the \nNational Academic Games in Eatonton, Georgia. Over these years, the \nteam has won hundreds of first, second and third\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\nplace honors, more than 100 national titles, and seven sweepstakes \nchampionships as the finest team in the country. They have also won \nnational titles in all four divisions, something no other school in the \ncountry has ever achieved.\n  The Ecole Classique team undergoes an intense year of preparation and \nhard work to prepare for the Academic Games. At the tournament they \ndivide into fuor divisions and use creative problem solving skills and \nstrategies to compete against other students from across America in the \nareas of Social Studies, Language Skills, Mathematics and Logic.\n  Once again, their hard work has paid off. At this year's competition, \nthe Ecole Classique students won more than 100 trophies, 16 national \nchampionships and two sweepstakes titles--far outpacing their nearest \ncompetitors.\n  Making Ecole Classique's accomplishment even more remarkable is the \nfact that while other teams are comprised of all-star students pooled \nfrom multiple schools, Ecole Classique's team only consists of students \nwho attend this small school in Metairie, Louisiana.\n  I must also salute the team's coach, Don Shannon. An extraordinary \nleader and mentor, Mr. Shannon has distinguished himself by becoming \nthe only Academic Games coach in the nation to lead multiple \nsweepstakes champions in all four divisions.\n  I congratulate the remarkable students of Ecole Classique's Academic \nGames team who continue to make their family, school and community \nproud, and extend my very best wishes for their continued \nsuccess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7152-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM WENTWORTH--2000 ENTREPRENEUR OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor William Wentworth upon his recognition as the 2000 Entrepreneur \nof the Year by the New Hampshire High Technology Council.\n  Bill is the President and CEO of Source Electronics, a software \nprogramming company that he has increased in size from three employees \nin 1988 to its current number of 220. Bill's strong commitment to \ncustomer service and the highest levels of quality are the primary \nreason why Source Electronic was able to grow into such a successful \nbusiness.\n  Source Electronics illustrates true dedication to its clients by \ntailoring programs to meet their needs, such as an interactive website \nallowing customers the ability to submit and track their orders. It is \ncompetitive advantages like these that set Source Electronics apart \nfrom other companies and allows them to do business with large firms \nsuch as Lucent Technologies, Cabletron and Motorola, to name a few. The \nenthusiastic dedication to serve and support the customer is also \ndemonstrated by the entire staff at Source Electronics, undoubtedly a \nresult of the examples Bill has set for others. Under Bill's strong \nleadership, Source Electronics was voted one of the top ten companies \nin New Hampshire in 1997 and 1999.\n  The hard work Bill has invested into his company proves his keen \nbusiness skill. The dedication he has exhibited in placing customer \nconcerns first is truly commendable. It is companies like Bill's that \nprove New Hampshire's competitiveness in the technological field. Bill, \nit is an honor to represent you in the United States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7152-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7152-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO THE TALIBAN IN \n            AFGHANISTAN--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 120\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a \n6-month periodic report on the national emergency with respect to the \nTaliban (Afghanistan) that was declared in Executive Order 13129 of \nJuly 4, 1999.\n                                                  William J.

A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Illinois relative to the financial \n     structure of the Coal Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 564\n\n       Whereas, Illinois is a coal-producing and coal-consuming \n     State that has benefitted tremendously from the hard, \n     dangerous work of retired coal miners; and\n       Whereas, The United States government entered into a \n     contract with the coal miners in 1946 that created the United \n     Mine Workers of America Health and Retirement Funds; and\n       Whereas, This contract was signed in the White House in a \n     ceremony with President Harry Truman; and\n       Whereas, A federal commission established by U.S. Secretary \n     of Labor Elizabeth Dole concluded in 1990: ``Retired coal \n     miners have legitimate expectations of health care benefits \n     for life; that was the promise they received during their \n     working lives and that is now they planned their retirement \n     years. That commitment should be honored.''; and\n       Whereas, This promise became law in 1992 when Congress \n     passed, and President George Bush signed, the Coal Industry \n     Retiree Health Benefit Act (the Coal Act); and\n       Whereas, The Coal Act reiterated the promise of lifetime \n     health benefits for retired coal miners and their dependents; \n     and\n       Whereas, Congress intended the Coal Act to:\n       ``(1) remedy problems with the provision and funding of \n     health care benefits with respect to the beneficiaries of \n     multiemployer benefit plans that provide health care benefits \n     to retirees in the coal industry;\n       (2) allow for sufficient operating assets for such plans; \n     and\n       (3) provide for the continuation of a privately financed \n     self-sufficient program for the delivery of health care \n     benefits to the beneficiaries of such plans''; and\n       Whereas, Certain court decisions have eroded the financial \n     structure that Congress put in place under the Coal Act; and\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\n       Whereas, These court decisions have placed the continued \n     provision of health benefits to retired coal miners in \n     jeopardy; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     First General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge \n     the Congress and the Executive Branch of the United States to \n     work together to reform the financial structure of the Coal \n     Act and to ensure that retired coal miners continue to \n     receive the health care benefits they were promised and so \n     rightly deserve; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be sent \n     to the President of the United States and to each member of \n     the Illinois congressional delegation.\n       POM-567. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico relative to \n     market access concerning China; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       In agriculture, tariffs on U.S. priority products, such as \n     beef, dairy and citrus fruits, will drop from an average of \n     31% to 14% in January 2004. China will also expand access for \n     bulk agricultural products such as wheat, corn, cotton, \n     soybeans and others; allow for the first time private trade \n     in said products; and eliminate export subsidies. In \n     manufactures, Chinese industrial tariffs will fall from an \n     average of 25% in 1997 to 9.4% in 2005. In information \n     technology, tariffs on products such as computers, \n     semiconductors, and all Internet-related equipment will fall \n     to zero by 2005. In services, China will open markets for \n     distribution, telecommunications, insurance, express \n     delivery, banking, law, accounting, audiovisual, engineering, \n     construction, environmental services, and other industries.\n       At present, China severely restricts trading rights, i.e., \n     the right to import and export, as well as the ability to own \n     and operate distribution networks, which are essential in \n     order to move goods and compete effectively in any market. \n     Under the proposed agreement, China will phase in such \n     trading rights and distribution services over three (3) \n     years, and also open up sectors related to distribution \n     services, such as repair and maintenance, warehousing, \n     trucking and air courier services. This will allow American \n     businesses to export directly to China and to have their own \n     distribution network in China, rather than being forced to \n     set up factories in China to sell products through Chinese \n     partners, as has been frequently the case until now.\n       At the same time, the proposed agreement offers China no \n     increased access to American markets. The United States \n     agrees only to maintain the market access policies that \n     already apply to China, and have for over twenty (20) years, \n     by making China's current Normal Trade Relations status \n     permanent. WTO rules require that members accord each other \n     such status on an unconditional basis.\n       If Congress does not grant China ``Permanent Normal Trade \n     Relations'' status, our European, Asian, Canadian and Latin \n     American competitors will reap the benefits of China's WTO \n     accession, but China would not be required to accord these \n     benefits to the United States.\n       In addition to purely economic considerations, China's \n     accession to the WTO will promote reform, greater individual \n     freedom, and strengthen the rule of law in China, which is \n     why the commitments already made represent a remarkable \n     victory for Chinese economic reformers. Furthermore, WTO \n     accession will give the Chinese people greater access to \n     information, and weaken the ability of hardliners in the \n     Chinese government to isolate China's public from outside \n     ideas and influences. In view of these facts, it is not \n     surprising that many of China's and Hong Kong's activists for \n     democracy and human rights--including Martin Lee, the leader \n     of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, and Ren Wanding, a prominent \n     dissident who has spent many years of his life in prison--see \n     China's WTO accession as the most important step toward \n     reform in the past two decades.\n       Finally, WTO accession will increase the chance that in the \n     new century, China will be an integral part of the \n     international system, abiding by accepted rules of \n     international behavior, rather than remain outside the \n     system, denying or ignoring such rules. From the U.S. \n     perspective, PNTR advances the American people's larger \n     interest to bring China into international agreements and \n     institutions that can make it a more constructive player in \n     the current world, with a significant stake in preserving \n     peace and stability.\n       For all of the above considerations, the Senate of Puerto \n     Rico joins in urging the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to pass a Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n     (``PNTR'') agreement with China at the earliest possible \n     moment, which will provide American farmers, workers and \n     industries with substantially greater access to the Chinese \n     market, to the ultimate benefit of the U.S. economy in \n     general and the American people in particular. Be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To urge the President and the Congress of the \n     United States to approve a Permanent Normal Trade Relations \n     (``PNTR'') agreement with China at the earliest possible date \n     in order to promote security an prosperity for American \n     farmers, workers and industries by providing substantially \n     greater access to the Chinese market.\n       Section 2.--This Resolution will be officially notified to \n     the Honorable William Jefferson Clinton, President of the \n     United States, to the Honorable Albert Gore, Jr., Vice-\n     President of the United States, to the Honorable Trent Lott, \n     United States Senate Majority Leader, and to the Honorable J. \n     Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, as well as selected Members of the United \n     States Congress.\n       Section 3.--This Resolution will be publicized by making \n     copies thereof available to the local, state and national \n     media.\n       Section 4.--This Resolution will become effective \n     immediately upon its approval by the Senate of Puerto Rico.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-568.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the Trade Act of \n     1974; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 284\n\n       Whereas, the Trade Act of 1974 established a statutory \n     framework for providing transitional adjustment assistance to \n     employees displaced due to increased importation of \n     competitive products; and\n       Whereas, the adoption by Congress of the North American \n     Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) included the establishment of a \n     transitional adjustment assistance program in the event that \n     imports of competitive goods from Canada or Mexico are an \n     important contribution to workers' separation; and\n       Whereas, since the adoption of NAFTA, the number of imports \n     from Canada and Mexico of products directly competitive with \n     products manufactured in the United States has increased; and\n       Whereas, many manufacturing plants in the United States \n     have displaced workers or closed entirely due to increased \n     competition from imported products; and\n       Whereas, American workers have had difficultly finding \n     similar employment and need retraining services to be \n     qualified for other types of employment; and\n       Whereas, the current length of time for retraining benefits \n     under the Trade Act is inadequate for most Americans to \n     complete retraining programs; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to amend that \n     portion of the Trade Act of 1974 establishing the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement Transitional Adjustment \n     Assistance Program to extend the maximum time period for \n     receipt of benefits from 52 weeks to 78 weeks; and, be it\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\n       Resolved further, That the General Asssembly of Virginia \n     most fervently urge and encourage each state legislative body \n     of the United States of America to enact this resolution, or \n     one similar in context and form, as a show of solidarity in \n     petitioning the federal government for greater benefits to \n     workers displaced due to the adoption of NAFTA; and be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegation \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of the United States Department \n     of Labor, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, \n     each member of the Virginia Congressional Delegation, and to \n     the presiding officer of each house of each state legislative \n     body in the United States of America.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-570. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement transitional adjustment \n     assistance; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 283\n\n       Whereas, ratification of the NAFTA treaty was a \n     congressional policy decision which could benefit the \n     continent as a whole; and\n       Whereas, one of the effects of NAFTA has been to set the \n     United States and other countries on the road to economic \n     globalization; and\n       Whereas, professional economists continue to analyze and to \n     debate the efficacy of economic globalization; and\n       Whereas, however, professional economists and most policy \n     makers are not directly or dramatically affected by economic \n     globalization; and\n       Whereas, although the United States continues to experience \n     economic prosperity, pockets of the United States and \n     Virginia have not benefited from the financial boom; and\n       Whereas, when plants close because of out-sourcing of labor \n     costs to other countries, the people who lose their jobs are \n     not likely to feel sympathy for the benefits of a global \n     economy to the rest of the country or the Commonwealth; and\n       Whereas, these displaced workers are frequently entitled to \n     elect such benefits as the 18-month COBRA extension of health \n     care insurance coverage; and\n       Whereas, the costs of the COBRA extension are often beyond \n     the means of unemployed individuals with families; and\n       Whereas, those individuals who lose their jobs because of \n     the effects of NAFTA and globalization are tax-paying and \n     responsible citizens who, through no fault of their own, must \n     face an uncertain future in the new millennium that may \n     include retraining, the search for new employment, and \n     inadequate access to health care; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the United States be urged to enhance \n     the benefits for individuals eligible for North American Free \n     Trade Agreement (NAFTA) transitional adjustment assistance by \n     providing expanded and short-term eligibility for medical \n     assistance services to such individuals and their families; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President of the \n     United States Senate, and the members of the Virginia \n     Congressional Delegation in order that they may be apprised \n     of the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia in this \n     matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-571. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana relative to a multiyear \n     reauthorization of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, \n     Protections, and Restoration Act; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, the Coastal Wetlands Planning Protection and \n     Restoration Act (CWPPRA) has been the keystone of state and \n     federal efforts to restore Louisiana's disappearing coastal \n     lands; and\n       Whereas, it is essential to successfully build on and \n     improve the coastal stewardship campaign that holds and \n     secures the resources, communities, and economies dependent \n     upon the barrier shorelines, wetlands, fisheries, and \n     estuaries of our coastal zone; and\n       Whereas, it is vital to the interests of Louisiana and this \n     nation that CWPPRA and the efforts it has authorized and \n     funded be continued; and\n       Whereas, the United States Senate has already passed a \n     multiyear reauthorization of CWPPRA. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Legislature of Louisiana does hereby memorialize congress \n     that it is in the urgent best interests of the state of \n     Louisiana and of the United States of America to pass a \n     multiyear reauthorization of the Coastal Wetlands Planning, \n     Protection, and Restoration Act. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-572. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to Michigan's \n     Remedial Action Plans; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 133\n\n       Whereas, the United States-Canada Great Lakes Water Quality \n     Agreement of 1972, as amended, provided for the designation \n     of Areas of Concern in need of remedial actions to address \n     documented pollution problems; and\n       Whereas, Fourteen Areas of Concern have been designated in \n     Michigan, each with a Remedial Action Plan process that \n     coordinates and focuses the efforts of multiple levels of \n     government and other stakeholders; and\n       Whereas, Many of Michigan's Remedial Action Plans are \n     entering the implementation phase, when funding for technical \n     guidance and coordination by state agency staff is critically \n     important; and\n       Whereas, The United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     (EPA) has traditionally supported state Area of Concern \n     efforts. This is consistent with the EPA's responsibilities \n     under the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement; and\n       Whereas, Funding through the EPA is vital to leveraging \n     funding through the Clean Michigan Initiative environmental \n     bond program to implement measurable environmental \n     improvements in Michigan's fourteen Areas of Concern; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to reaffirm its support for and federal \n     role in the Areas of Concern program by allocating a minimum \n     of $7.5 million for the Great Lakes Areas of Concern in \n     Fiscal Year 2001; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge that no less than $1.0 million of \n     this total be allocated by the EPA for efforts within the \n     state of Michigan to develop and implement Remedial Action \n     Plans and associated activities under the Great Lakes Water \n     Quality Agreement; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge that these funds be allocated to \n     provide no less than $700,000 for Michigan Department of \n     Environmental Quality staff; $125,000 for Statewide Public \n     Advisory Council activities; and $175,000 for support to \n     individual Public Advisory Councils within the Areas of \n     Concern; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge that funding support for the EPA be \n     used to leverage substantial resources from the Clean \n     Michigan Initiative environmental bond program for \n     contaminated sediment remediation, nonpoint source pollution \n     control, brownfields redevelopment, and other critical \n     efforts; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the Administrator of the EPA, the EPA's Region 5 office, the \n     EPA's Great Lakes National Program Office, the International \n     Joint Commission, the President of the United States Senate, \n     the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, \n     and the members of the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-573.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of California relative to homelessness; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 39\n\n       Whereas, Homelessness has been steadily increasing for \n     several years and constitutes, especially for the mentally \n     ill, an archaic form of human misery that can no longer be \n     tolerated in this, the world's greatest and most responsive \n     democracy; and\n       Whereas, Homelessness creates a sizable drain on social and \n     economic resources and is a frustration to legitimate \n     commerce and an obstacle to community development; and\n       Whereas, Prevention of future homelessness will pay great \n     dividends to American society that will more than justify the \n     effort and costs of instituting a national plan for the \n     homeless; and\n       Whereas, Health and social services, as well as welfare \n     institutions, are now faced with the urgent necessity of \n     creating new avenues of cooperation, coordination, and mutual \n     support, and there is a nationwide need for new \n     concentrations of community outreach, and active, aggressive \n     provision of services, for the treatment and prevention of \n     homelessness and of mental illness among the homeless; and\n       Whereas, A number of recent studies, all reliable, broadly-\n     based, and conducted independently of one another, reveal \n     that American homeless persons number over two and one-half \n     million at any given time, and fall into one or more of the \n     following general categories:\n       (a) Women and their children;\n       (b) The mentally ill;\n       (c) Military veterans;\n       (d) Drug and/or alcohol addicts;\n       (e) Parolees or probationers;\n       (f) HIV/Aids victims;\n       (g) Functionally illiterate persons or others with \n     incomplete educations;\n       (h) Newly-evicted working poor; and\n       (i) Welfare recipients for whom aid has been reduced or \n     curtailed; and\n       Whereas, The causes of homelessness are numerous and \n     complex and therefore the cure cannot be simplistic and \n     cannot exclusively address any single issue or causative \n     factor; and\n       Whereas, Due to a lack of resources, many local \n     governments, particularly cities and counties throughout the \n     State of California and nationwide, have increasingly relied \n     upon law enforcement or the enactment or enforcement of \n     municipal codes and ordinances to address the behavioral \n     aspects of homelessness. This approach has resulted in public \n     policy that focuses on a person's status as homeless, instead \n     of focusing on the obstacles that need to be overcome to \n     solve the problem of homelessness; and\n       Whereas, It is absolutely necessary that any meaningful, \n     comprehensive plan for the eradication or significant \n     reduction of homelessness be instituted at the federal level \n     because successful local model projects will not achieve \n     permanence and uniform consistency unless they are integrated \n     into a national strategy; and\n       Whereas, The number of homeless men, women, and children \n     throughout the United States is increasing at an alarming \n     rate; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature calls for, \n     endorses, and supports a comprehensive national plan to end \n     homelessness, and urges the President of the United States, \n     Congress, and other relevant federal agencies to develop and \n     implement a comprehensive plan to end homelessness; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the President of the United States is \n     requested to convene a National Commission on Homelessness, \n     nonpartisan and broadly representative in composition, with \n     the specific mission of developing a comprehensive strategic \n     plan for addressing homelessness, its causes, and its \n     prevention nationwide; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives, and to each Senator and Representative from \n     California in the Congress of the United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-585. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of California relative to Ryan White CARE Act; to the \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                    Assembly Joint Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, In California, as of January 1, 1999, more than \n     110,000 individuals have been infected with the expanding \n     pandemic known as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS); \n     and\n       Whereas, The State of California created an Office of AIDS \n     within the State Department of Health Services to proactively \n     address issues relating to the human immunodeficiency virus \n     (HIV) and AIDS; and\n       Whereas, This office directly administers the expenditure \n     of federal and state funds to combat the disease; and\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\n       Whereas, Due to advancements in pharmaceutical therapies \n     and an increasing focus on early intervention and treatment, \n     the number of individuals living with HIV has grown \n     significantly; and\n       Whereas, For many, the progression from HIV to an AIDS \n     diagnosis has slowed considerably as a result of these \n     therapies; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated that more than 44,000 California \n     residents are currently living with AIDS, 15 percent of the \n     nationwide total of 288,000; and\n       Whereas, It is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention that there are 40,000 new HIV infections \n     annually in the United States and that California accounts \n     for one-fifth, or 8,000, of these infections; and\n       Whereas, Approximately one-third of Californians with HIV \n     disease are unaware of their diagnosis and tens of thousands \n     of individuals know they are HIV-positive but are not \n     receiving care regularly; and\n       Whereas, The number of annual AIDS deaths in California \n     dropped 51 percent between 1996 and 1997; however, between \n     1997 and 1998, deaths dropped by only 27 percent; and\n       Whereas, HIV/AIDS in California has a significant impact on \n     communities of color, gay and bisexual men, and women, as \n     well as low-income and other underserved communities; and\n       Whereas, As many as one-half of new HIV infections occur in \n     people under the age of 25 years; one in four are in young \n     people under age 22 years; and\n       Whereas, Increasingly, some individuals with HIV disease \n     have also been diagnosed with substance abuse or mental \n     illness; and\n       Whereas, Substance abuse is a factor in well over 50 \n     percent of new HIV infections in some cities; and\n       Whereas, California looks to the federal government to \n     assist the state in meeting the expanding health care and \n     social service needs of people living with HIV disease; and\n       Whereas, The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources \n     Emergency (CARE) Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 300ff et seq.) was first \n     adopted by the Congress in 1990; and\n       Whereas, The Ryan White CARE Act expires on September 30, \n     2000; and\n       Whereas, Since its inception, the Ryan White CARE Act has \n     ensured the delivery of medical care and treatment as well as \n     essential support services to tens of thousands of \n     Californians including medical examinations, laboratory \n     procedures and evaluations, drug therapy, dental care, case \n     management, home health and hospice care, transportation, \n     housing, legal assistance, benefits education and assistance, \n     treatment education and adherence, nutrition therapy, and \n     mental health and substance abuse counseling; and\n       Whereas, Under federal law, the Ryan White CARE Act is \n     designated as the provider of last resort; therefore, it is \n     recognized as a critical safety net program for low-income, \n     uninsured, or underinsured individuals; and\n       Whereas, The federal budget for the 2000 fiscal year \n     contains increased funding for the Ryan White CARE Act, a \n     significant portion of which is dedicated to California; and\n       Whereas, Title I of the Ryan White CARE Act currently \n     provides emergency assistance to the 51 United States \n     metropolitan areas most heavily impacted by the AIDS \n     epidemic, of which nine are in California, the most in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, The Ryan White CARE Act has enabled local \n     communities receiving Title I funding to tailor the delivery \n     of services that best meet the needs of their residents who \n     are affected by HIV/AIDS; and\n       Whereas, California receives funding under Title II of the \n     Ryan White CARE Act for care and treatment and social \n     services, a significant portion of which pays for life-\n     extending and life-saving pharmaceuticals under California's \n     AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP); and\n       Whereas, Title III of the Ryan White CARE Act provides \n     funding to public and private nonprofit entities for \n     outpatient early intervention and primary care services; and\n       Whereas, Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act has focused on \n     women, children, youth, and families, and has increased \n     access to medical care and support services for persons under \n     25 years of age living with HIV or AIDS; and\n       Whereas, The Ryan White CARE Act Dental Reimbursement \n     Program (Title VI) reimburses eligible dental schools and \n     postdoctoral dental education programs for the reported, \n     uncompensated costs of oral health care to people living with \n     HIV; and\n       Whereas, The goal of the Ryan White CARE Act Special \n     Projects of National Significance (SPNS) Program (Title VI) \n     is to advance knowledge about the care and treatment of \n     persons living with HIV/AIDS by providing time-limited grants \n     to assess models for delivering health and support services, \n     and SPNS projects have supported the development of \n     innovative service models for HIV care to provide health and \n     social services to communities of color and hard-to-reach \n     populations in California; and\n       Whereas, A network of 14 regional AIDS Education and \n     Training Centers (AETCs), along with local performance sites, \n     were funded under Title VI of the Ryan White CARE Act; and\n       Whereas, These AETCs train clinical health care providers, \n     provide consultation and technical assistance, and \n     disseminate ever-changing information to health care \n     professionals on the effective management of HIV infection; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Assembly and the Senate of the State of \n     California, jointly, That the Legislature affirms its support \n     of the Ryan White CARE Act, and urges the Congress and the \n     President of the United States to expeditiously reauthorize \n     the Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) \n     Act in order to ensure that the expanding medical care and \n     support service needs of individuals living with HIV disease \n     are met; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Assembly transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President and Vice President \n     of the United States, the Senate Majority and Minority \n     Leaders, the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the \n     House Minority Leader, the Chairpersons and ranking minority \n     members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n     Appropriations, and Budget Committees, to the Chairpersons \n     and ranking minority members of the House Commerce, \n     Appropriations, and Budget Committees, and to each Senator \n     and Representative from California in the Congress of the \n     United States.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-586. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to an autism working \n     group; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 74\n\n       Whereas, autism results in severe problems in \n     communication, social interaction, and impulse control \n     disorders, including repetitive and sometimes bizarre actions \n     and interests; and\n       Whereas, according to estimates from the National Institute \n     of Mental Health, autism affects as many as two in every one \n     thousand Americans; and\n       Whereas, families are often devastated by the effects of \n     dealing with children with autism; and\n       Whereas, according to information from the National \n     Institute of Mental Health, lack of a common diagnostic \n     scheme from autism, which is critical for comparing research \n     data, has posed a major challenge to science; and\n       Whereas, current research on autism is inconclusive as to \n     its causes and treatment, and there is no biological test to \n     confirm its diagnosis; and\n       Whereas, at the present time, there is no specific \n     biological marker for autism and no cure; and\n       Whereas, the cost of health and educational services to \n     those affected by autism exceeds three billion dollars per \n     year, according to estimates from the National Institute of \n     Mental Health; and\n       Whereas, the National Institutes of Health has as its \n     mission health research to promote the general welfare of the \n     citizens of the United States. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to take such \n     actions as are necessary to commission the National \n     Institutes of Health to assemble an autism working group to \n     update its 1997 research report on the causes, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of autism. Be it further\n       Resolved, That such working group shall be composed of \n     distinguished scientists for the purpose of assessing the \n     state of science in autism and related areas by assembling \n     the disciplines, expertise, and subject populations needed to \n     address scientific questions beyond the resources of a single \n     investigator or research team. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America, each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation, the directors of the National Institutes of \n     health, the National Institute of Child Health and Human \n     Development, the National Institute on Deafness and other \n     Communication Disorders, the National Institute of Mental \n     Health, and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders \n     and Stroke.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-587. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to high quality health \n     care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n     Pensions.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 81\n\n       Whereas, an immediate health care crisis exists in the \n     United States and in the state of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, citizens of our state and nation are sometimes \n     denied access to necessary health care services due to the \n     financial practices of health maintenance organizations and \n     other managed care entities, the utilization of managed care \n     by health insurers, and the lack of adequate medical \n     facilities in many communities nationwide; and\n       Whereas, the guiding principles of United States health \n     care policy, as provided in the Hill-Burton Act, 42 U.S.C. \n     291 et seq., have been steadily undermined by the concept of \n     managed health care; and\n       Whereas, a primary purpose of the Hill-Burton Act is to \n     assist states in ``furnishing adequate hospital, clinic, or \n     similar services to all their people'' by tying certain \n     federal funding to commitments by health care facilities ``to \n     make available a reasonable volume of services to persons \n     unable to pay therefor''; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana, as a result of its climate \n     and geographical location, is not only a crossroads for \n     international trade and commerce but also subject to a range \n     of threats to the public health, as indicated by\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\n     Louisiana being placed on the ``watch list'' for dengue \n     fever, which potentially compound the already existing public \n     health crisis; and\n       Whereas, the current health care delivery system in \n     Louisiana, including the Department of Health and Hospitals \n     and the state's charity hospital system, is currently unable \n     to fulfill the full health care needs of all of this state's \n     residents; and\n       Whereas, under the preamble to the Constitution of the \n     United States, the federal government is required to \n     ``promote the general welfare'', which thus necessitates \n     action by the federal government to address the current \n     health care crisis; and\n       Whereas, the United States is rightfully a signatory to \n     international declarations and covenants, including the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, \n     which establish the universal right to adequate health care \n     and require governments to take steps to assure access to \n     quality medical health care. Therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the United States Congress to take such actions \n     as are necessary to establish and affirm that every citizen \n     of this nation has the right to high quality health care. Be \n     if further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of the Senate and the house of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States of \n     America and to each member of the Louisiana congressional \n     delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-588.

A resolution adopted by the General Assembly of \n     the State of New Jersey relative to private long-term care \n     insurance programs; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                       Assembly Resolution No. 72\n\n       Whereas, A private long-term care insurance market has \n     begun to develop in New Jersey, although it is still very \n     limited, as it is nationwide, because of the high cost of \n     purchasing such coverage; and\n       Whereas, The issue of private long-term care insurance has \n     begun to receive increasing attention among both federal and \n     state policymakers, as reflected by the federal ``Health \n     Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,'' \n     Pub.L. 104-191, which extended the federal income tax \n     deduction allowed for the payment of standard health \n     insurance plan premiums and medical expenses to the payment \n     of premiums for federally qualified long-term care insurance \n     plans, and also required these plans to satisfy certain \n     consumer protection provisions endorsed by the National \n     Association of Insurance Commissioners with respect to \n     disclosure, nonforfeitability, guaranteed renewal and \n     noncancellability; and\n       Whereas, Widespread interest has been reported in the asset \n     protection feature of the New York State Partnership for \n     Long-Term Care, which is designed to assist residents of that \n     state in planning for the cost of long-term care and is \n     funded in part by a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson \n     Foundation; and\n       Whereas, The unique features of the New York State \n     Partnership program are that, if a person exhausts his \n     benefits under an approved long-term care insurance policy, \n     the person can apply for Medicaid without regard to the type \n     or amount of assets the person may have; and, unlike the \n     regular Medicaid program which imposes limits on the amount \n     of assets an eligible person may have in order to qualify for \n     benefits and seeks recovery from a person's estate for the \n     cost of benefits received, the Partnership program sets no \n     such limits and does not require the person's estate to repay \n     the Medicaid program benefits received for and;\n       Whereas, The New York State Partnership program and similar \n     partnerships in California and Connecticut were established \n     prior to the federal ``Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1993,'' Pub.L. 103-66, known as OBRA '93 which requires that \n     all states pursue liens and recoveries from the estates of \n     Medicaid recipients who received long-term care services; and\n       Whereas, The effect of OBRA '93 was to nullify the asset \n     protection feature of the partnerhip program for other states \n     such as New Jersey that might wish to replicate there \n     programs, since the programs established prior to OBRA '93 \n     were permitted to continue as developed but additional states \n     could not offer the asset protection incentive; and\n       Whereas; The establishment by additional states of private \n     long-term care insurance programs with asset protection \n     features similar to the New York State Partnership for Long-\n     Term Care could stimulate the development of an expanded \n     private long-term care insurance market which would relieve \n     the financial pressures on the Medicaid program associated \n     with funding long-term care, while also assisting many of \n     those elderly and disabled persons who deplete their life \n     savings paying for long-term care in order to qualify for \n     Medicaid coverage of their long-term care costs; and, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the General Assembly of the State of New \n     Jersey:\n       1. This House respectfully memorialized the Congress and \n     President of the United States to enact statutory provisions \n     which would permit additional states to establish private \n     long-term care insurance programs with asset protection \n     features similar to the New York State Partnership for Long-\n     Term Care, in order to stimulate the development of an \n     expanded private long-term care insurance market nationwide.\n       2.

Sec. 653(b)(4), provides that \n     ``Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or \n     in any manner affect any workmen's compensation law or to \n     enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common \n     law or statutory rights, duties or liabilities of employers \n     and employees under any law with respect to injuries, \n     diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the \n     course of, employment.''; and\n       Whereas, The Occupational Safety and Health Administration \n     (``OSHA''), notwithstanding this statutory restriction and \n     the constitutional, traditional and historical role of the \n     states in providing compensation for injuries in the \n     workplace, has nevertheless published a proposed rule that, \n     if adopted, would substantially displace the role of the \n     states in compensating workers for musculoskeletal injuries \n     in the workplace and would impose far-reaching requirements \n     for implementation of ergonomics programs; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule creates in effect a special \n     class of workers' compensation benefits for ergonomic \n     injuries, requiring payment of up to six months of wages at \n     ninety percent (90%) of take-home pay and one hundred percent \n     (100%) of benefits for absence from work; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would allow employees to bypass \n     the system of medical treatment provided by Tennessee law for \n     workers' compensation injuries and to seek diagnosis and \n     treatment from any licensed health care provider paid by the \n     employer; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would require employees to treat \n     ergonomic cases as both workers' compensation cases and OSHA \n     cases and to pay for medical treatment under both; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule could force all manufacturers to \n     alter workstations, redesign facilities or change tools and \n     equipment, all triggered by the report of a single injury; \n     and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would require all American \n     businesses to become full-time experts in ergonomics, a field \n     for which there is little if any credible evidence and as to \n     which there is an ongoing scientific debate; and\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\n       Whereas, The proposed rule would cause hardship on \n     businesses and manufacturers with costs of compliance as high \n     as eighteen billion dollars ($18,000,000,000) annually, \n     without guaranteeing the prevention of a single injury; and\n       Whereas, The proposed rule may force businesses to make \n     changes that would impair efficiency in distribution centers; \n     and\n       Whereas, This proposed rule is premature until the science \n     exists to understand the root cause of musculoskeletal \n     disorders, OSHA should not rush to make rules that are likely \n     to result in a loss of jobs without consensus in the \n     scientific and medical communities as to what causes \n     repetitive-stress injuries, and medical researchers must \n     answer fundamental questions surrounding ergonomics before \n     government regulators impose a one-size-sits-all solution; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred First General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the House of \n     Representatives Concurring, That this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to take all necessary \n     measures to prevent the proposed ergonomics rule from taking \n     effect. Be it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives; the President and the Secretary of \n     the United States Senate; and to each member of the Tennessee \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-591. A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Virginia relative to federal medical and \n     long-term care benefits; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 168\n\n       Whereas, throughout our nation's history, older generations \n     of Americans have contributed greatly to the prosperity of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, older Americans have always recognized the value \n     of the economic freedoms that our forefathers fought to \n     ensure; and\n       Whereas, older Americans have always been leaders in the \n     realms of business and industry, serving as mentors and \n     teachers to ensure that younger generations would have the \n     knowledge and skills to carry on; and\n       Whereas, throughout their toil and enduring commitment to \n     the principles of freedom, older Americans have laid the \n     foundation for the economic prosperity and financial security \n     of all Americans; and\n       Whereas, during the early years of the twentieth century, \n     the current generation of older Americans worked hard to \n     ensure that their families and communities could continue to \n     enjoy this financial security for generations to come; and\n       Whereas, they endured the struggle of the Great Depression, \n     undergoing countless hardships as they rebuilt this nation by \n     the sweat of their brows both economically and spiritually; \n     and\n       Whereas, they fought in wars to preserve the liberties that \n     have enabled our nation to earn its place as the economic \n     leader in the world; and\n       Whereas, throughout those hardships, the current generation \n     of older Americans learned to appreciate the importance of \n     preserving assets, including homes, land, durable goods, and \n     ``nest eggs,'' they had managed to hold onto despite the \n     economic challenges they had faced; and\n       Whereas, today these personal assets help them maintain the \n     dignity, independence, and health they so cherish as \n     Americans; and\n       Whereas, with nursing home care now costing an average of \n     $40,000 to $50,000 per year, long-term care expenses can have \n     a catastrophic effect on families, wiping out a lifetime of \n     savings; and\n       Whereas, steps need to be taken into inform the public \n     about the financial risks posed by rapidly increasing long-\n     term care costs and about the need of families to plan for \n     their long-term care; and\n       Whereas, the federal laws governing the rules of \n     qualification for federal medical and long-term care benefits \n     force many older Americans to liquidate their assets, \n     including their homes and life savings; and\n       Whereas, these confiscatory policies impose unjust and \n     inequitable burdens on older Americans, who have contributed \n     so much to our economic security; and\n       Whereas, widespread use of private long-term care insurance \n     has the potential to protect families from the catastrophic \n     costs of long-term care services while, at the same time, \n     easing the burden on the federal government to provide \n     medical and long-term care benefits; now, there, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That the Congress of the Unites States be urged to protect \n     senior assets from liquidation to meet the eligibility \n     requirements for federal medical and long-term care benefits; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Congress of the United States be \n     urged to ensure that persons who purchase long-term insurance \n     policies will be able to protect their assets equal in value \n     to the policy purchased; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation in order that they may be apprised of the sense of \n     the General Assembly of Virginia in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-592.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado relative to the Old Spanish Trail; \n     to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                      Senate Joint Memorial 00-002\n\n       Whereas, The Old Spanish Trail, which ran between Santa Fe, \n     New Mexico, and Los Angeles, California, was the first trail \n     into Utah and is still the least known; and\n       Whereas, Frontiersmen and traders en route from Santa Fe to \n     Los Angeles blazed a circuitous route to the north through \n     Utah; and\n       Whereas, Between 1839 and 1848, a major trade route was \n     established between Santa Fe and Los Angeles which stretched \n     approximately 1,121 miles; and\n       Whereas, The Old Spanish Trail and the northern branch of \n     the Old Spanish Trail proceeded through much of western \n     Colorado and followed part of the route traveled by the \n     Dominguez-Escalante Expedition of 1776; and\n       Whereas, In 1853, Captain John Williams Gunnison of the \n     U.S. Corps of Topographic Engineers was commissioned by the \n     war department to find a route for a railroad through the \n     Colorado Rockies along the 38th parallel; and\n       Whereas, During his expedition, Captain Gunnison came upon \n     the northern branch of the Old Spanish Trail in the San Luis \n     Valley, which he followed into eastern Utah; and\n       Whereas, The federal government's Salt Lake Wagon Road \n     followed portions of the Old Spanish Trail at the northern \n     branch to bring supplies to the Los Pinos Indian Agency in \n     the Uncompahgre Valley and the budding mining camp of Ouray, \n     Colorado, in the late 1870's; and\n       Whereas, The Old Spanish Trail and its northern branch was \n     instrumental in the creation and establishment of many of \n     western Colorado's towns and communities, including Alamosa, \n     Monte Vista, Saguache, Gunnison, Montrose, Olathe, Delta, \n     Whitewater, Grand Junction, Fruita, Loma, Pagosa Springs, \n     Durango, Mancos, Dolores, and Dove Creek; and\n       Whereas, Very little information is recorded about the \n     northern branch and much more can be learned about the Old \n     Spanish Trail; and\n       Whereas, Beginning with the northern branch of the Old \n     Spanish Trail in the 1830's and 1840's, followed by the \n     Gunnison Expedition of 1853 and the Salt Lake Wagon Road of \n     the late 1870's, the Grand Valley of western Colorado has \n     been the site of an historic route for travelers; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Sixty-second General Assembly \n     of the State of Colorado, the House of Representatives \n     concurring herein:\n       That the Congress of the United States is hereby \n     memorialized to adopt legislation that dedicates the Old \n     Spanish Trail and the northern branch of the Old Spanish \n     Trail as an historic trail. Be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this Joint Memorial be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and each member of the Colorado \n     congressional delegation.\n\n       POM-594.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana relative to the Outer Continental \n     Shelf; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 13\n\n       Whereas, the government of the United States receives \n     revenues from rent, royalties, net profit share payments, and \n     related late payment penalties from natural gas and oil \n     leases issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands \n     Act; and\n       Whereas, these leases are for tracts or portions of tracts \n     lying seaward of the zone defined and governed by Section \n     8(g) of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. \n     1337(g)), or lying within such zone but to which Section 8(g) \n     does not apply, the geographic center of which lies within a \n     distance of two hundred miles from any part of the coastline \n     of Louisiana as defined by Section 304(4) of the Coastal Zone \n     Management Act of 1972 (U.S.C. 1453(4)); and\n       Whereas, there are over four thousand five hundred offshore \n     oil and gas rigs and platforms off the coast of Louisiana and \n     on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), with such structures \n     representing over ninety-five percent of all offshore \n     structures in the world; and\n       Whereas, these offshore structures support and impact an \n     abundant commercial and recreational fishery along an \n     intricate coastline which is in excess of seven thousand \n     miles long; and\n       Whereas, the enforcement division of the Louisiana \n     Department of Wildlife and Fisheries is charged with the \n     responsibility for the enforcement and regulation of \n     Louisiana's marine fishing industry which, with recreational \n     fishing and commercial fishing activities combined, \n     constitutes an industry with a total economic impact on the \n     state of $3.6 billion annually through landings of over one \n     billion pounds and direct employment of over forty thousand \n     people; and\n       Whereas, a well-regulated, well-managed, and well-monitored \n     Outer Continental Shelf region and a well-regulated, well-\n     managed, and well-monitored coastline of Louisiana are of \n     benefit to the uninterrupted operation and maintenance of the \n     oil and gas industry in the Gulf of Mexico; and\n       Whereas, a continuing dependable source of funds for the \n     operation of the enforcement division of the Louisiana \n     Department of Wildlife and Fisheries would ensure the \n     continuation of efforts to secure the Outer Continental Shelf \n     region of the Gulf of Mexico and the coastline of Louisiana \n     for both the oil and gas industry and the fishing industry; \n     therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the U.S. Congress and the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation are hereby memorialized to provide \n     funding from revenues received from oil and gas activity on \n     the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to the Louisiana Department \n     of Wildlife and Fisheries for state enforcement of the \n     wildlife and fisheries laws; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be forwarded to \n     the presiding officers of the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House \n     of Representatives and each member of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-596. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the increase \n     in gasoline prices; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 189\n\n       Whereas, the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     and the United States Department of Energy report that there \n     are adequate gasoline supplies to keep prices in check. \n     Further, 87 percent of the service stations in Michigan \n     recently surveyed by the American Automobile Association \n     report that they expect to have adequate gasoline supplies \n     this summer; and\n       Whereas, Profits of the world's largest oil-producing \n     companies tripled in the first three months of the year. \n     Financial analysts predict that the companies will earn more \n     revenue this year than ever before; and\n       Whereas, In the biggest weekly jump since 1973, when such \n     statistics were first recorded, gasoline prices have soared \n     in June. As of June 13, 2000, the statewide average cost per \n     gallon was $2.01, a 27-cent per gallon increase since the \n     previous week. That was 87-cents per gallon higher than the \n     same time last year. In Metro Detroit, as of the same date, \n     the average cost per gallon was $2.04, which was 40-cents \n     higher than the previous week and 92-cents per gallon more \n     than the same time last year; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to investigate the rapid increase in \n     gasoline prices and to take immediate action; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-597. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to \n     investigating the factors responsible for reduced gasoline \n     supplies; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 191\n\n       Whereas, The recent surge in gasoline prices nationwide has \n     shocked consumers. The federal government has struggled to \n     find remedies for this new and unexpected burden. Matters \n     relating to the federal role in regulating commerce, new \n     foreign demand for oil as overseas economies recover from \n     economic crises, and the decision by oil producing nations to \n     reduce output have contributed to this situation. Even the \n     federal government will face limits on what it can do to \n     influence global circumstances; and\n       Whereas, Although the rise in gasoline prices is a national \n     problem, gasoline prices in Michigan are amongst the highest \n     in the nation. As families here and around the country plan \n     their vacations, the cost of gasoline may well harm \n     Michigan's tourism industry as people seek locales closer to \n     home. The state's automobile industry is bound to suffer if \n     unreasonably high gasoline prices persist as will the \n     agricultural sector. Michigan consumers have been \n     economically overwhelmed by the near-doubling of the retail \n     price of a gallon of gasoline within the last year. For those \n     living paycheck to paycheck, purchasing fuel just to make it \n     to work is difficult; and\n       Whereas, Despite the global factors that have contributed \n     to the tremendous increase in gasoline prices, a number of \n     measures at the national level may provide some relief until \n     global circumstances become more favorable. Identifying why \n     gasoline stockpiles were allowed to fall so low, examining \n     the impact of new regulations requiring cleaner-burning fuel, \n     and exploring ways of using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve \n     are issues that Congress should explore; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to investigate the factors responsible for \n     reduced gasoline supplies and the recent increases in retail \n     gasoline prices; and be if further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-598. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to initiating a \n     study to determine the cause of the recent gasoline price \n     surge; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 192\n\n       Whereas, Gasoline prices have doubled in recent months from \n     their levels of 1999. The prices in Michigan and other areas \n     of the Midwest surpass the national increases by wide \n     margins. Consumers have been shocked and their lives \n     disrupted by this tremendous increase. Motor vehicles are \n     part of the fabric of our culture and economy and any \n     disruptions in our ability to keep the wheels rolling are \n     cause for deep concern; and\n       Whereas, No single event has prompted our present \n     situation. Instead, separate events and decisions occurring \n     in our own backyard and around the globe have combined to \n     drive prices to levels that are unacceptable if we are to \n     maintain a strong and vibrant economy. The causes are murky, \n     and the measures needed to reduce prices and prevent rapid \n     price surges are not clear. We have repaired a pipeline and \n     restored the flow of gasoline in Michigan, but how do we \n     address the cause of a shortage of fuel for Michigan gas \n     stations?; and\n       Whereas, It is reported that major oil companies have an \n     abundant supply of gasoline while independent dealers are \n     being cut off from adequate supplies.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on piano plates; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              temporary suspension of duty on piano plates\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ntemporarily suspending duties on imports of certain piano plates. This \nlegislation is needed to address a difficult situation facing the \ndomestic piano industry.\n  A piano plate is an essential part of a piano. It is the iron casting \nover which the strings are stretched and tuned by pins inserted in the \nplate. Baldwin Piano & Organ Company, which employs more than 600 \nworkers in the production of pianos in Arkansas and Mississippi, is one \nof a diminishing number of piano producers in the United States. Piano \nplates are produced in the United States by a single company, a \ncompetitor of Baldwin, whose production is for the most part captively \nconsumed. As such, Baldwin lacks a domestic source for piano plates, \nother than the surplus production of one of its competitors. Due to its \nown demand for plates, Baldwin's competitor cannot meet Baldwin's \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President the history and recent contraction in the domestic \npiano industry points to the critical need for this legislation. \nIndeed, were the production of Baldwin or other domestic producers to \nbe curtailed due to the insufficient availability of domestically-\nproduced piano plates, it is likely that this would engender an \nincrease in foreign piano supply, rather than an increase in market \nshare of other domestic producers. This is evident from the fact that, \nin the early 1980s, there were 15 domestic piano producers supplying \napproximately 80 percent of U.S. consumption, whereas now only nine \ndomestic producers remain--servicing approximately half, if not less, \nof the U.S. market. The domestic piano industry is well aware that \nforeign production stands ready to fill any gap in domestic supply.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would temporarily suspend, \nthrough the year 2004, the rate of duty applicable to imports of piano \nplates provided for in subheading 9209.91.80 of the Harmonized Tariff \nSchedule of the United States. Currently, the applicable rate of duty \nis 4.2 percent ad valorem. If the legislation is approved, the \nreduction in duty collection is estimated to be between $300,000 and \n$400,000 per year through 2004.\n  Given the situation currently facing domestic piano producers, it is \nunlikely that there will be objection from other domestic manufacturers \nto the legislation proposed today. In view of the fact that Baldwin \nmust resort to imported plates regardless of the duty rate applicable \nto such imports, and that no appreciable domestic production of piano \nplates will be displaced by imports, suspension of the duty rate will \nhave no adverse affect upon the domestic industry. This legislation \nstands to ensure only that a U.S. piano producer will find a reliable \nsource of supply for a critical component and thus will be better \npositioned to stand with other domestic producers in providing a secure \nand stable supply of pianos for the domestic market.\n  I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2883\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nallocation of small ethanol producer credit to patrons of cooperative, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     small ethanol producer credit\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nallow farmer-owned cooperatives access to the small ethanol producer \ntax credit. Mr. President, current law provides for an income tax \ncredit of 10 cents per gallon for up to 15 million gallons of annual \nethanol production by a small ethanol producer. A small ethanol \nproducer is one defined as having a production capacity of less than 30 \nmillion gallons per year. The credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and championed by our former \ncolleague, Senator Bob Dole. Unfortunately, the credit was enacted at a \ntime when the growth and shape of the ethanol industry was still \ndifficult to predict.\n  This situation has led to an unfortunate situation in Minnesota, \nIowa, and in other areas where farmer-owned cooperatives have been \nunable to access the credit due to the way in which the original \nlegislation was drafted. The original legislation certainly envisioned \nthese small, farmer-owned cooperatives as being eligible for the tax \ncredit, but the intricacies of the tax code have made it impossible for \nthem to do so.\n  Mr. President, there are currently 22 cooperative ethanol plants in \nthe United States. Twelve of them are located in Minnesota. Eleven of \nthese Minnesota cooperatives involve over 5,000 farmers and their \nfamilies. Minnesota cooperatives are able to produce roughly 189 \nmillion gallons of ethanol per year.\n  My legislation would simply provide a technical correction to ensure \nfarmer-owned cooperatives are included in the definition of who can \nbenefit from the small ethanol producer tax credit. My bill also \nexpands the definition to include facilities with less than 60 million \ngallons in annual capacity.\n  I want to again stress that this proposal is consistent with the \noriginal intent of the 1990 law that created the small ethanol producer \ntax credit. Farmer-owned cooperatives were never intended to be \nexcluded from receiving the benefits of the tax credit if they produce \nless than 30 million gallons. It was just hard to envision the role and \ngrowth of cooperatives when we passed the 1990 law. Cooperatives are \nnot huge corporate ventures, but associations of small farmers.\n  Mr. President, the ethanol industry in Minnesota and across the \ncountry is one we should promote. Ethanol is a crucial product for \nrural America, for our nation as a whole, and especially for Minnesota. \nI'd like to point out just a few of ethanol's impressive benefits--\nenvironmentally and economically. According to the Minnesota Corn \nGrowers, ethanol production boosts nationwide employment by over \n195,000 jobs. Ethanol improves our trade balance by $2 billion and adds \n$450 million to state tax receipts. It reduces emissions from gasoline \nuse and therefore helps us clean up the environment.\n  According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, more than $3 billion \nhas been invested in 43 ethanol facilities in 20 states. Those \ninvestments have directly created 40,000 jobs and more than $12.6 \nbillion in increased income over the next five years.\n  Minnesota is now home to over a dozen operating ethanol plants with a \ncapacity of over 200 million gallons annually. These plants mean new \njobs with good wages and good benefits for people living in rural areas \nwhere these plants are built. According to a report by the Minnesota \nLegislative Auditor, those plants, and the resulting economic activity, \nare expected to create as many as 5,000 new, high-wage jobs--including \njobs in production, construction, and support industries.\n  In addition to its positive economic impact, ethanol production \nallows our nation to move away from our dependence on foreign energy \nsources. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that for \nevery gallon of ethanol produced domestically, we displace seven \ngallons of imported oil. Ethanol plays a role in increasing our \nnational energy security by providing a stable, homegrown, renewable \nenergy supply. Ethanol is estimated to reduce our demand for foreign \noil by 98,000 barrels per day.\n  Those are just some of the reasons why I urge my colleagues to join \nme in allowing small, farmer-owned cooperatives to enjoy the full \nbenefits of the small ethanol producer tax credit.\n  I want to thank Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa for working with me \non this important legislation. As everyone knows, Senator Grassley has \nbeen a steadfast leader of efforts to promote tax relief for farmers \nand rural Americans. I'm proud to be working with him on this \nlegislation.\n  I ask that the full text of my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2884\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Jamestown 400th Commemoration \nCommission, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n            the jamestown 400th commemoration commission act\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to establish \na federal commission to join the Commonwealth of Virginia in preparing \nfor the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown settlement, \nthe first permanent English settlement in the United States.\n  In a little more than six years, America will observe one of its most \nimportant anniversaries with the celebration of the Jamestown \nquadricentennial. On May 13, 1607, nearly five months after setting \nsail from London, a group of 104 English men and boys selected a site \non the banks of Virginia's James River as their new home. Settling \nJamestown was a momentous event in American history.\n  While the Spanish founded St. Augustine in Florida in the 1560's and \nthe English attempted to colonize Roanoke Island in North Carolina in \nthe 1580's, Jamestown was America's first successful, permanent \nEuropean settlement. Jamestown is the birthplace of our nation, and is \nwhere representative government in the Americas began. The founding of \nJamestown marks the beginning of what Alex de Toqueville described as \nthe United States' ``great experiment'' in democracy.\n  The establishment of Jamestown remains a cornerstone event in \nAmerican history because of the lasting traditions that the English \nbrought with them, including the legacy of language and common law that \nhave shaped our great republic for decades.\n  Celebrating the 400th Anniversary of Jamestown marks an important \nopportunity to remember and reflect on how our ancestors established \nVirginia: how they treated America's original inhabitants, the Indians, \nand how the slave trade was begun. While injustice is a major part of \nthis historical legacy, it is also the legacy that marked the beginning \nof our rich cultural heritage that defines the United States today.\n  With the 2007 celebration we have a chance to properly remember a \nstory--too often glossed over--of the ``darker side of the Jamestown \nlegacy'' as one scholar has noted, ``a legacy of slavery; of warfare \nand conquest; of the displacement and decimation of Native Americans; \nof damage to the natural environment.''\n  The history of Jamestown is rich, complex, tragic and inspirational. \nCertainly, an important part of Jamestown's history is the beginning of \nthe distinct American spirit of exploration and adventure. The \nJamestown adventure led directly to the formation of the great American \nprinciples of rule of law, religious and political freedom and the \nrights of man. The establishment of these pillars of American \ngovernment was, again, unique in the history of man and government. The \nUnited States stands today as the world's longest lived, continuous \ndemocratic republic in existence today.\n  The Jamestown story is also the story of the beginning of truly \nglobal commerce. Not only was the establishment of Jamestown a \ncommercial venture, it was a venture that coincided with an emerging \nworldwide capitalism. The landing was one of many efforts by primarily \nwestern European countries to go beyond a country's boundaries in \nsearch of commercially important natural resources.\n  The English came to Virginia looking for economic gain, but found \npersonal freedom. They quickly found that the British model of \ngovernment was not well-suited to the challenges of the New World.\n  Americans have joined in celebrating Jamestown's founding with major \nevents during the past two centuries, most recently in 1957. These \noccasions have been marked with parades to an eight-month international \nexposition.\n  The 2007 Jamestown celebration will allow us to learn from our past \nas we prepare for the future. It is a national event that deserves our \nnational attention and commemoration. The commission will bring the \nmany talents of noted historians and scholars together with the \nCommonwealth's plans to fully observe the Jamestown experiment and its \nlasting contributions to our society.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to join my senior colleague today in \nintroducing legislation that will establish a Federal commission to \ncommemorate the founding of the English colony at Jamestown nearly 400 \nyears ago. Jamestown, the first permanent English Colony in the new \nworld, holds enormous significance for us as a nation. We are an \nEnglish speaking nation and our laws are based on English law. The \nhistory of Jamestown is the earliest history of the United States, and \nour culture still reflects those beginnings.\n  Jamestown was the capitol of Virginia for 92 years and was the center \nof cultural activity for the new colony. The celebration of the 400th \nanniversary of the founding of Jamestown is important to Virginia, and \nthe Nation. In order to ensure that the celebration be conducted in a \nway that all Americans can appreciate and share in the history of \nJamestown, we propose to establish a federal commission that will \nassist in developing federal activities that will complement those \nprograms and activities undertaken by the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  Currently the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal government, \nthrough the Department of Interior, work together at Jamestown to tell \nthe story of the early colonial times. The commission will provide \nadditional assistance, and coordination and will provide support for \nthe scholarly research that is ongoing at the Jamestown site. The \ncommission can help ensure that the celebration of our earliest history \nis accessible to a broad range of Americans, and not just those in the \nimmediate vicinity of the original colony.\n  The authority for the Commission will terminate one year after the \nJamestown celebration in 2007 and after completing a report on its \nactivities. The report will not only tell the story of the Jamestown \ncelebration, but will provide guideposts and information for national \ncelebrations in the future. Having an end to the commission's work will \nensure that the organization will not outlive its usefulness. The \nplanning for this wonderful celebration has already begun, and so I ask \nfor quick consideration of this legislation so that we can move forward \ntogether.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Robb, Ms. Collins, and Mr. \n        Daschle):\n  S. 2887. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \nfrom gross income amounts received on account of claims based on \ncertain unlawful discrimination and to allow income averaging for \nbackpay and\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\nfrontpay awards received on account of such claims, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                 CIVIL RIGHTS TAX FAIRNESS ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Civil \nRights Tax Fairness Act of 2000. I am being joined by Senator Robb in \nthis effort. Civil rights legislation has been in force throughout this \ncountry for nearly thirty years; its purpose being to provide real \nremedies to victims of discrimination.\n  The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act restores certain remedies for \nvictims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional distress \nawards. This tax was incorporated into the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996, making the taxation of awards received in \ndiscrimination cases involving back wages or non-physical injuries ( \nincluding emotional distress) taxable. The result of the 1996 \nlegislation was to discriminate against people involved in civil rights \ncases. People who received damage awards because of a bar-room brawl or \nslip-and-fall incident, often caused by simple negligence, get tax free \nawards. While, for similar types of psychological injuries caused by \nintentional discrimination the damages are taxed. The result of this \ntaxation is that the attorneys and government make out better than the \nvictims who had their rights violated.\n  A second part of The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act changes the \ncurrent law, which requires people who receive back pay awards in \ndiscrimination cases to be bumped up into a higher tax bracket. When \nback pay awards are received by a person in a case the IRS considers it \ntaxable income to be taxed in the year it is received, even though the \naward received covers many years of lost wages. Currently no averaging \nof back pay awards is allowed, but The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act \nattempts to address this problem. The act provides for income averaging \nof back pay awards, making it possible for the award to be taxed over \nthe number of years it was meant to compensate.\n  The third area that The Civil Rights Fairness Act attempts to combat \nis the double taxation of attorneys' fees that takes place under \ncurrent law. Presently individuals who receive awards end up having to \ninclude in that award their attorneys' fee. This fee can end up being \nlarger than the actual award received by the plaintiff. The current tax \nimplications in the law require the plaintiff to pay taxes on their \naward and on the attorneys fees received by their lawyer.\n  One real life example recently brought to my attention involves an \nIowa citizen named Don Lyons. Mr. Lyons, a man attempting to do the \nhonorable thing by helping out a co-worker with filing a sex \ndiscrimination complaint against their employer, was unjustly \nretaliated against. After prevailing in court and receiving a $15,000 \nremitted judgment, Mr. Lyons then had to deal with the present tax \nlaws, which not only devoured his judgment, but required him to \nactually pay thousands of more dollars to the government in taxes.\n  First, Mr. Lyons had to pay taxes on the $15,000 he received as \npunitive damages from his employer. After he pays his taxes he is left \nwith $9,533. However, when Mr. Lyons takes into account the taxes that \nhe has to pay on the combination of his settlement and attorneys' fees, \nhe ends up owing $67,791 in taxes. When you subtract the $9,533 Mr. \nLyons had left from the initial judgment he ends up still owing the \ngovernment $58,236 in taxes. Mr. Lyons attorney, Ms. Victoria L. \nHerring, also has to pay taxes on the fee she received for taking Mr. \nLyons case. Mr. Lyons ends up paying taxes on money that he never even \nreceived, making him a good example of why it is important to pass The \nCivil Rights Tax Fairness Act and end double taxation. Everyone should \nagree that this is a extreme example of unfair taxation.\n  Mr. Lyons helped out a co-worker, was attacked by his employer, and \nreceived damages in a court of law. People count on the legal system to \nprotect them and when their civil rights are violated the system needs \nto function properly. It is disheartening to learn that, in actuality, \nMr. Lyons is going to be taken to the cleaners by the government tax \nsystem, and as a result, he ends up owing $58,236 to the government for \nthe ``privilege'' of having won his retaliation case.\n  It seems to me that there is something fundamentally wrong with the \nlaw when it hurts the people it is supposed to protect. This being \nsaid, it is time to change the mistakes made in the past by passing the \nCivil Rights Tax Fairness Act 2000. This bill will go a long way toward \nhelping out victims of discrimination by eliminating taxes on emotional \ndistress awards, ending lump-sum taxation, and ending double taxation. \nThe changing of the law will have positive effects on citizens like Mr. \nLyons, allowing similar victims to keep more of their awards. At the \nsame time, it will be beneficial for business, since they will be able \nto settle discrimination claims for lower settlements.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the record after my \nremarks the letter I received from Mr. Lyon's attorney, Victoria L. \nHerring. Ms. Herring does an outstanding job of quantifying and \npersonalizing the importance of the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                November 30, 1999.\n\n     Re Tax implications of civil rights litigation.\n\n     Senator Charles Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: I write you as an attorney of long-standing \n     in Des Moines and an Iowa citizen who represents other Iowans \n     in employment-related matters. I write to bring to your \n     attention a problem that you should know of (as legislation \n     is now pending to cure the problem, H.R. 1997), but perhaps \n     the effect of the present status of the law escaped you.\n       As you know, for some thirty years civil rights legislation \n     has been in force in this country; that includes Title VII, \n     the ADA, the ADEA, and other types of such statutes. As a \n     part of the legislative effort to provide remedies to victims \n     of discrimination, Congress also passed an attorney fees \n     provision that entitles a successful plaintiff to have his or \n     her attorney fees and expenses compensated by the losing \n     defendant, subject to the trial court's discretion. \n     Certainly, this legislation had a salutary effect in ending \n     some of the worst vestiges of discrimination and seeing that \n     the litigators were paid for their efforts as ``private \n     attorneys general''. The United States Supreme Court has \n     endorsed this concept in numerous cases.\n       What I now bring to your attention is the fact that all of \n     this legislation has been rendered meaningless and, indeed, \n     punitive against plaintiffs and their attorneys, by the \n     Congress's passage in 1996 of the Small Business Protection \n     Act and the various tax laws enacted by Congress over the \n     years. I have a real life example to bring to your attention, \n     in the hope that you will see how unfair and offensive is the \n     present state of the law. In fact, in light of the law as it \n     is today, it is entirely possible that no attorney in his or \n     her right mind would take any plaintiff's civil rights \n     case, and that no person in his or her right mind would \n     undertake to litigate civil rights discrimination no \n     matter how much they were harmed by such actions.\n       First, it is my understanding that the tax laws now require \n     the payment of taxes upon any and all sums obtained in \n     litigation or settlement that are not clearly related to \n     ``personal physical injury''. As most (if not all) civil \n     rights and discrimination cases brought under Title VII, the \n     ADA, etc., rarely involve ``personal physical injury'', most \n     (if not all) jury verdicts, judge awards and/or settlements \n     are entirely taxable to the victim of discrimination. Perhaps \n     that was truly the intent of Congress in its 1996 passage of \n     the amendment to Internal Revenue Code Section 104. If so, \n     then victims of discrimination certainly do owe taxes on \n     whatever they might receive by way of verdict, judgment or \n     settlement, and should pay those taxes. Of course, that \n     frequently prevents settlements from occurring or raises the \n     cost of the settlements, but that might also be within \n     Congress's intent in passing the legislation. (That less than \n     salutary effect of the 1996 amendment is one reason quite a \n     variety of groups have supported the proposed bill, H.R. \n     1997, among them the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, NELA, the \n     AARP, etc.) In any event, that is not the entire problem \n     facing victims and litigators.\n       The most pernicious problem and one which causes me to \n     write to you is the combined effect of the above legislation \n     coupled with other laws of Congress, court cases and IRS \n     regulations. The effect is to cause any and all lawyers who \n     might wish to advocate for plaintiffs who have been harmed by \n     discrimination to rethink whether, in fact, they wish to \n     continue to do that work. And it places lawyers who do \n     continue to advocate at loggerheads with their clients' \n     interests.\n       The law is now clear that victims of discrimination owe tax \n     payments on whatever settlement/judgment they might receive. \n     And it is clear that their attorneys owe tax payments on \n     whatever attorney fees and expenses they are awarded. \n     However, the law is also quite clear that the victims of \n     discrimination also owe taxes upon the amount of\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n     money their attorney is compensated for his/her efforts in \n     obtaining the settlement/verdict. While in some situations it \n     is possible to deduct those costs, given the Alternative \n     Minimum Tax provisions and recent Tax Court cases, it is \n     close to impossible to do so. Thus, victims of discrimination \n     may well add up with an additional tax burden in excess of \n     any sums of money actually obtained in the litigation to \n     compensate them for their injuries. This must be contrary to \n     the intent of Congress in passing civil rights legislation \n     over the past thirty years, and the views of the Supreme \n     Court in holding that attorney fees awards should be fully \n     but reasonably compensatory to the attorneys, in order to \n     facilitate attorneys in handling civil rights legislation.\n       I can provide you with a real-life example which impacts an \n     Iowa citizen who successfully fought discrimination and \n     retaliation and his attorney, the undersigned, who joined in \n     that effort. Based on what we know now, both of us are \n     quite sorry we ever entered into the effort to prevent \n     discrimination and retaliation from occurring.\n       Don Lyons assisted a co-worker in filing a sex \n     discrimination complaint against their employer. As a result, \n     he and the co-worker were retaliated against. We brought suit \n     on behalf of the co-worker for sex discrimination in \n     employment in the Southern District of Iowa and made a claim \n     for retaliation in violation of Title VII on behalf of both \n     Don and his co-worker. The case was litigated in the court \n     here, with the result that the sex discrimination case was \n     resolved prior to trial. However, because no settlement of \n     Don's claim was possible, his retaliation case went onto a \n     jury trial before eight jurors from the southern District of \n     Iowa.\n       We put on two days of evidence before the jury and Judge \n     Wolle, with the result that Don was awarded $1.00 in nominal \n     damages (a recognition of his right to bring the claim) and \n     $150,000 in punitive damages. On post-trial motions, Judge \n     Wolle upheld the jury's verdict on liability and held that \n     there was sufficient evidence that ``defendant had an evil \n     motive and had intentionally violated federal law in \n     retaliating against Lyons because he had assisted other \n     pilots in protecting their civil rights.'' However, Judge \n     Wolle remitted the punitive damage amount to $15,000.00, \n     because he thought that would be sufficient to punish the \n     defendant. Pursuant to the attorney fee provision of the \n     civil rights law, I have petitioned the court for \n     approximately $170,000 in fees and expenses; that is based on \n     my hourly rate of $180.00 an hour (a rate much less than that \n     of lawyers in other cities, and probably much less than the \n     two defense lawyers from Chicago who tried the case). The \n     fees and expenses amount may seem high, but is the result of \n     a fair amount of contentiousness and the need to take \n     depositions in Kansas and Arizona.\n       The problem for my client and for myself arises from the \n     clear tax implications of this situation. My client would \n     normally pay out of his $15,000 in punitive damages the sum \n     of $5,467.00, and that would be fine for him.\n       However, if the court awards me a ``fully compensatory'' \n     fee and expenses figure of $150,000 (I am using that as an \n     example, because we have run the figures on this sum), not \n     only will I pay my taxes on this figure (gladly so), but my \n     client will also and without the ability to deduct the sum \n     due to the pernicious effect of the alternative minimum tax!\n\n\n                                                                 Amount\nDon's taxes of $15,000........................................$5,467.00\nDon's taxes on $15,000 plus the attorney fee award of $150,00067,791.00\nDifference/Additional Taxes Owed by Don for the ``privilege'' of \n  having won his retaliation case.............................58,236.00\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n\n       In other words, because Don assisted someone to bring a \n     claim of sex discrimination through appropriate channels and \n     prevailed in his jury trial claim of retaliation, he will be \n     forced by present tax laws to pay an additional amount of \n     $58,236.00, which is over two-thirds of his annual salary. \n     And he will not have any additional money as a result of the \n     remittment of the judgment to pay that additional tax. And \n     because Don hired me to be his advocate and then prevailed \n     before a jury of eight citizens, he is penalized with a \n     severe tax penalty for having advocated civil rights. And I \n     need not tell you that this result has severely strained what \n     had been a cordial and positive working relationship between \n     attorney and client.\n       This is a clear injustice and one that we cannot find any \n     way of resolving, given the present state of the law. If we \n     could, we would. We are, therefore, bringing this to your \n     attention because it is a concern which only legislation can \n     rectify. We believe that H.R. 1997 is the only means possible \n     to rectify this problem and urge you to support it strongly \n     and vocally as soon as Congress returns.\n       If you have need of further information, please let me \n     know. Both Don and I would appreciate the opportunity to \n     visit with you or your staff to discuss this problem and to \n     shed light upon how this situation causes me to rethink my \n     chosen profession and Don to rethink his willingness to \n     assist people who are being discriminated against.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Victoria L. Herring,\n                                                  Attorney at Law.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Civil Rights \nTax Fairness Act of 2000 with Senators Grassley, Daschle and Collins. \nThis important legislation will correct several imperfections in our \nTax Code that unfairly tax the victims of civil rights violations at a \ntime when they are most vulnerable. I'm pleased that it accomplishes \nthis in a fashion that has bi-partisan Congressional support and has \nbeen endorsed by civil rights organizations as well as the business \ncommunity.\n  The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act contains several provisions. The \nfirst section excludes emotional distress awards received in \ndiscrimination cases from the gross income of the recipient. Due to a \nchange in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, damages \nreceived for emotional distress in civil rights cases are taxable, \nwhile those received in slip and fall accidents are not. There is no \ndefensible reason for this disparity and it must be changed.\n  The bill would also allow employees who receive lump sum awards for \nback wages for civil rights violations by their employers to take \nadvantage of income averaging. Currently, if an employee receives a \nlarge award it will generally push that person into a higher income \nbracket for that year due to the income spike from the damages. The \nresult is that the victim may be taxed at a higher rate than they would \nif they had received the income as wages in the normal course of \nbusiness. This is the wrong tax treatment and should be corrected.\n  Finally, this legislation ends the double taxation on attorney's fees \nthat are awarded to a victim in a discrimination case. Mr. President, \neven though the attorney ultimately gets the fees, not the victim, \npresent law not only taxes the attorney on the fees that they receive \nwhen they take them into income, but also requires that the victim \ninclude them in computing their gross income. Even though they are \nsupposed to be able to take a corresponding deduction, due to \nlimitations on miscellaneous deductions and the alternative minimum \ntax, in most cases the victims cannot get the entire amount. This is \nnot fair and cannot be the intended effect.\n  I look forward to working with the senior Senator from Iowa in \ngetting this bill signed into law. It is time to bring our Tax Code \ninto the 21st Century. We must implement tax policies that help to \neradicate discrimination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url":

Con. Res. 131\n\n       Whereas, in July and August of 1980, Polish workers went on \n     strike to protest communist oppression and demand greater \n     political freedom;\n       Whereas, in the shipyards of Gdansk and Szczecin, workers' \n     committees coordinated these strikes and ensured that the \n     strikes were peaceful and orderly and did not promote acts of \n     violence;\n       Whereas workers' protests against the communist authorities \n     in Poland were supported by the Polish people and the \n     international community of democracies;\n       Whereas, on August 30 and 31 of 1980, the communist \n     government of the People's Republic of Poland yielded to the \n     21 demands of the striking workers, including the release of \n     all political prisoners, including Jacek Kuron and Adam \n     Michnik, the broadcasting of religious services on television \n     and radio, and the right to establish independent trade \n     unions;\n       Whereas from these agreements emerged Solidarnosc, the \n     first independent trade union in the communist bloc, led by \n     Lech Walesa, an electrician from Gdansk;\n       Whereas Solidarnosc and its 10,000,000 members became a \n     great social movement in Poland that was committed to \n     promoting fundamental human rights, democracy, and Polish \n     independence;\n       Whereas, during its first congress in 1981, Solidarnosc \n     issued a proclamation urging workers in Soviet-bloc countries \n     to resist their communist governments and to struggle for \n     freedom and democracy;\n       Whereas the communist government of Poland introduced \n     martial law in December 1981 in an attempt to block the \n     growing political and social influence of the Solidarnosc \n     movement;\n       Whereas Solidarnosc remained a powerful and political force \n     that resisted the efforts of Poland's communist government to \n     suppress the desire of the Polish people for freedom, \n     democracy, and independence from the Soviet Union;\n       Whereas, in February 1999, the communist government of \n     Poland agreed to conduct roundtable talks with Solidarnosc \n     that led to elections to the National Assembly in June of \n     that year, in which nearly all open seats were won by \n     candidates supported by Solidarnosc;\n       Whereas, on August 19, 1999, Solidarity leader Tadeusz \n     Mazowiecki was asked to serve as Prime Minister of Poland and \n     on September 12, 1999, the Polish Sejm voted to approve Prime \n     Minister Mazowiecki and his cabinet, Poland's first \n     noncommunist government in 4 decades;\n       Whereas, on December 9, 1990, Lech Walesa was elected \n     President of Poland;\n       Whereas the Solidarnosc movement, by its courage and \n     example, initiated political transformations in other \n     countries in Central and Eastern Europe and thereby initiated \n     the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in 1989; and\n       Whereas, since the time Poland freed itself from communist \n     domination, Polish-American relations have transformed from \n     partnership to alliance, a transition marked by Poland's \n     historic accession to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     in March 1999: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the workers' \n     strikes in Poland that lead to the creation of the \n     independent trade union Solidarnosc; and\n       (2) honors the leaders of Poland who risked and lost their \n     lives in attempting to restore democracy in their country and \n     to return Poland to the democratic community of nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7166-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7166-S7167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 338--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE PAUL \n             COVERDELL, A SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Akaka, Mr. \nAllard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Biden, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Bond, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bryan, \nMr. Bunning, Mr. Burns, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Campbell, Mr. L.

I do want to say \nto Nancy Coverdell and the family that we extend our sympathy and our \nlove. Our hearts are breaking also.\n  Mr. President, I send a resolution to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration; further, that the resolution be read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the announcement the majority leader just \nmade that our friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell, passed away at 6:10 \np.m. today is a very sad statement. Paul Coverdell was an outstanding \nSenator from the State of Georgia. This is Georgia's loss, but it is \nalso a loss for all of our country.\n  I join with my colleagues in expressing our sympathy to Nancy \nCoverdell, to the Coverdell family, to all the friends and associates \nof Paul Coverdell, for he was truly an outstanding Senator. He served \nthis body with great distinction, with great humor and leadership. \nFrankly, he was a leader in everything he did, certainly in the Peace \nCorps and his service in the Senate. He will truly be missed, not just \nby Georgians but, frankly, by all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/18/senate-section/article/S7168-3", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7168-S7169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 2000\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
