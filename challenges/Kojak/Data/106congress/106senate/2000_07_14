No. 3837, to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified credit exemption \nand the qualified family-owned business interest deduction, to \nincrease, expand, and simplify the child and dependent care tax credit, \nto expand the adoption credit for special needs children, provide \nincentives for employer-provided child care, and for other purposes, I \nwould have voted aye.\n  On rollcall vote No. 192, Senator Harkin's amendment No. 3840, to \nprotect and provide resources for the Social Security System, to amend \ntitle II of the Social Security Act to eliminate the ``motherhood \npenalty,'' increase the widow's and widower's benefit and to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified credit exemption \nand the qualified family-owned business interest deduction, and for \nother purposes, I would have voted aye.\n  On rollcall vote No. 193, Senator Bayh's amendment No. 3843 to amend \nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the unified credit \nexemption and the qualified family-owned business interest deduction \nand provide a long-term care credit, and for other purposes, I would \nhave voted aye.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3838\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, while I am sympathetic to the goals of the \nSantorum amendment and I strongly support some of its provisions, I \nmust vote against it at this time.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator is 251 pages long and has 12 \ntitles. It includes new tax incentives and new authorization programs. \nSome of the incentives are new starters that have never been considered \nbefore. While the amendment is based on an agreement that has been \nannounced by the Speaker's Office and the White House, that specific \nagreement has not been finalized, introduced, or considered by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  A few weeks ago, Senator Santorum introduced a slightly smaller \nversion of\n\n[[Page S6771]]\n\nhis amendment as a bill. That bill, S. 2779, was referred to the \nFinance Committee. Our Committee has held no hearings on the bill and \nwe have not marked it up. The Joint Committee on Taxation has not had a \nchance to offer its comments on the full package or formally to tell us \nhow much it costs. The Administration has not provided us with its \nviews. Since the bill was introduced, my staff has been contacted by a \nvariety of groups asking for technical changes to make the tax \nincentives operate better.\n  My colleagues know that I am a strong supporter of some of the \nprovisions in the amendment. Increases in the low income housing credit \ncap and the private activity bond volume cap are long overdue. Tax \ncredits for individual development accounts are a new and promising \nconcept that I included in last year's tax bill. Nevertheless, I \nbelieve that the proper course is for the Finance Committee to take the \ntime to review and evaluate all the provisions of this amendment. \nAccordingly, I will vote against it at this time.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3838\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it contains \nlanguage that raises serious First Amendment questions regarding the \nseparation of church and state.\n  This amendment basically allows taxpayer dollars to flow to religious \ninstitutions, such as churches, mosques, and synagogues, to administer \nsocial services and public health benefits on behalf of our federal \ngovernment. I believe this provision is Constitutionally suspect and \nrequires more thoughtful Congressional scrutiny in the form of hearings \nand public discussion. Instead, this dubious language has been slipped \ninto a several-hundred page amendment that few, if any, of my Senate \ncolleagues have probably read.\n  Unlike the charitable choice provision in the 1996 welfare reform \nact, which applies to a very limited number of social service programs, \nthis language would expand the scope of ``charitable choice'' to every \ncurrent and future public health and social service program that \nreceives federal funds. This new charitable choice language also would \ngo further by allowing religious institutions receiving taxpayer \ndollars to discriminate in their hiring and firing decisions on the \nbasis of their particular religious beliefs and teachings, abrogating \nthe intent of our nation's civil rights laws.\n  Thus, under this particular provision, persons hired with federal \ntaxpayer money, notwithstanding their personal religious beliefs, could \nbe fired because they did not abide by particular religious standards, \nsuch as regular church attendance, tithing, or perhaps abstinence from \ncoffee, tea, alcohol, and tobacco. This new language could allow a \nfederally funded employee to be fired because she remarried without \nseeking an annulment of her first marriage. This seemingly innocuous \n``charitable choice'' language amounts to federally funded employment \ndiscrimination, and allows religious organizations supported by \ntaxpayer money to exclude people of different tenets, teachings and \nfaiths from government-funded employment.\n  I would also like to address a point made by Senator Santorum last \nevening regarding Vice President Gore's support of ``charitable \nchoice.'' Senator Santorum failed to mention that in a speech given in \nMay 1999 by the Vice President, he stated that any charitable choice \n``extension must be accompanied by clear and strict safeguards.'' He \nalso said that ``government must never promote a particular religious \nview, or try to force anyone to receive faith.'' This amendment fails \non both accounts.\n  There is a tradition in Rhode Island of religious tolerance and \nrespect for the boundaries between religion and government. Indeed, \nRoger Williams, who was banished from Massachusetts for his religious \nbeliefs, founded Providence in 1636. The colony served as a refuge \nwhere all could come to worship as their conscience dictated without \ninterference from the state. With that background, I believe that we \nshould be very careful to maintain the distinction between government \nand religion. They both have important roles to play, especially in \nhelping some of our country's neediest citizens. However, if a church \nor mosque is going to accept taxpayer dollars to perform contractual \ngovernment services, they should not be able to deny employment to \nqualified American citizens. Our nation's laws should not allow \ndiscrimination on the basis of religion.\n  I suspect that the drafters of the amendment understand the \nConstitutional infirmities of their language. They seek some protection \nby inserting a reference to the ``Establishment Clause in the First \nAmendment'' as a check on permissible programs. However, such an \napproach blithely ignores the succeeding words of the same sentence. \n``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, \nor prohibiting the free exercise thereof . . .'' (emphasis added).\n\n  Their use of the Establishment Clause is a transparent ploy to dress \nup dubious legislation in the trappings of the Constitution without \ngiving effect to the full meaning of the Constitution. The proposed \nlegislation raises serious questions about the ``free exercise'' of \nreligion. By imposing religious tests on federally funded employment \nand by condoning religious based treatment regimes paid for by public \nfunds which may conflict with the religious beliefs of beneficiaries, \nthis legislation severely impinges on the ``free exercise'' of \nconscience.\n  With specific regard to the religious beliefs of beneficiaries, the \ndrafters try to salvage this amendment from the Constitutional morass \nthat they have created. They purport to require governmental entities \nto provide access to an ``alternative'' service provider if an \nindividual objects to the religious character of the service provider. \nHaving abandoned the Constitution, the amendment now abandons reality. \nIn a country with insufficient resources to fully treat and serve all \nwho qualify for public services, where are these alternative service \nproviders? We are all familiar with the long waiting lists for \nsubstance abuse treatment, just to name one area of concern. We are \nequally familiar with situations in many areas, both rural and urban, \nwhere there is only one realistic provider. How available can any \nalternative provider be in practice? Moreover, why should a qualified \nbeneficiary have to advance a ``religious'' reason as a condition to \nreceiving public benefits?\n  Unfortunately, the enactment of the ``charitable choice'' language in \nthis amendment will result in expensive and time-consuming \nConstitutional litigation, bogging down the passage of its laudatory \ncommunity renewal provisions.\n  Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment \nand to vote against federally supported religious discrimination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks be included \nat the appropriate place in the Record.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3838\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I believe in the importance of the \nNew Markets initiative to promote growth and economic development in \nstruggling communities across our country. I have worked closely with \nSenator Robb on this effort, as well as the President and his \nAdministration. Given the commitment of President Clinton and Speaker \nHastert, I believe we may have a real chance to enact meaningful \nlegislation on New Markets.\n  But I do not believe the Santorum amendment is the right starting \npoint. I have serious questions about the provisions in the bill \nlabeled ``Charitable Choice.'' While I strongly support and admire the \ncommunity development and social service work performed by faith-based \norganizations, I am deeply troubled by the potential for discrimination \nin hiring on the basis of an applicant's faith with programs funded by \nfederal dollars. This is not good public policy.\n  Senator Robb has announced his intention to introduce another New \nMarkets bill, and I will continue to work closely with the \ndistinguished Senator from Virginia. We introduced the original New \nMarkets bill in August of 1999, and I am committed to working for \npassage of a final package. But such an important initiative deserves \nconsideration in the Finance Committee, and more than ten minutes of \nflood debate.\n  West Virginia has several Empowerment Zones/Enterprise Communities, \nincluding Huntington, McDowell County, the Central Appalachia Community \nand the Upper Kanawha Community. These communities are working hard\n\n[[Page S6772]]\n\nto deliver on the promise of the President's economic development \ninitiative, and I am proud of our progress. Together we can make a real \ndifference.\n  I hope that the Santorum amendment will not prevail, but that Members \nwill work together to build on the Clinton-Hastert initiative to \ndevelop vital legislation to promote New Markets. We should provide tax \nincentives to promote new investments. We should expand on the success \nof Empowerment Zones and create new Renewal Communities to help small \nbusinesses get started in struggling communities. We should invest in \naffordable housing by expanding the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit and \npromote home ownership by expanding Mortgage Revenue Bonds. We should \nmake these strategic investments, but not include language that might \nallow discrimination in hiring practices which would cause controversy \nand hinder the important investments of New Markets.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, during debate of H.R. 8, the question has \nbeen raised: Does the death tax really impact family-owned farms and \nbusinesses?\n  The answer is an emphatic ``Yes!''\n  According to the book, ``The Millionaire Next Door,'' self-employed \nindividuals are four times as likely to accumulate $1 million in assets \nover their lifetime than those people who work for someone else. \nMoreover, while self-employed individuals make up only 20 percent of \nthe workforce, they comprise two-thirds of those Americans whose \nestates are worth more than $1 million. As a tax on accumulated wealth, \nthe estate tax is a direct attack on these individuals.\n  Meanwhile, the Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy \nestimates that seven out of ten family-owned businesses fail to survive \nfrom one generation to the next. While this failure rate can be \nattributed to many factors, the federal estate tax is cited by family \nbusiness owners as a major obstacle blocking a successful transition. \nFor example, a report by the Family Enterprise Institute found that 60 \npercent of black business owners believe the estate tax makes the \nsurvival of their business significantly more difficult or impossible.\n  Finally, the estate tax hampers the ability of family-owned \nbusinesses to compete against larger corporations. In testimony before \nthe House Ways and Means Committee, a lumberyard owner from New Jersey \nspoke of incurring up to $1 million in costs associated with preserving \nthe family business pending the death of his grandmother. At the same \ntime the family was incurring these costs, the business was also \ncompeting against a new Home Depot store that had moved into the area. \nHome Depot is not subject to the estate tax.\n  Mr. President, death tax repeal is also pro-jobs. A survey of 365 \nbusinesses in upstate New York found an estimated 14 jobs per business \nwere lost in direct consequence of the costs associated with estate tax \nplanning and payment. That amounts to more than 5,000 jobs lost in a \nlimited geographical area. Nationally, the Wall Street Journal reported \nthat an estimated 200,000 jobs would be created or preserved if the \nestate tax were eliminated.\n  Mr. President, a false argument made by the opposition is that the \ntax code already protects family-owned businesses from the death tax. \nWhile the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act included provisions to protect \nfamily-owned businesses from the death tax, these provisions have \nproven so complicated and cumbersome that few family businesses choose \nto use them.\n  For example, in order to qualify for the Family Business Exclusion, \nan heir has to have worked in the family business for at least five of \nthe eight years leading up to the death of the owner. Following the \ndeath of the owner, the family must continue to participate in the \nbusiness for at least five out of eight years.\n  Both these restrictions create significant problems for family \nmembers. How does a son or daughter know when the eight-year ``clock'' \nstarts ticking. If their parents are elderly, do they sacrifice going \nto college in order to begin working in the business? Moreover, once \nthe business is transferred, the tax deferred by receiving the \nQualified Family Business designation hangs over the business for at \nleast eight years, affecting the ability of the business to attain \ncredit or attract investors.\n  Similar difficulties have been realized from other carve-outs. For \nexample, Section 2032A allows closely-held farms and businesses to \nreceive a valuation based upon the property's current use--say \nfarming--rather than its ``highest and best'' use--say commercial \ndevelopment.\n  In order to qualify for the lower valuation, however, the estate and \nheirs must meet qualifications similar to those required for the Family \nBusiness Exclusion. Despite the obvious benefits, only a small \nfraction--less than one percent in 1992--of taxable estates elect to \nuse it. The provision is simply too complicated for widespread use.\n  With regard to the death tax, it is proving very difficult to protect \none set of assets while taxing another. A good-faith attempt was made \nto protect family-owned businesses from the death tax three years ago, \nbut by most accounts that attempt has largely failed. The best way to \nprotect family farms and businesses from the death tax is to repeal it.\n  I have a paper by Bill Beach of the Heritage Foundation summarizing \njust a few of the real life stories of farms and businesses harmed by \nthe death tax. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered. (See \nexhibit 2.)\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, repealing the estate tax is one of the more \npopulist tax cuts considered by Congress this session. Not only do \nstudies show the estate tax has a dramatic impact on the ability of \nfamily-owned farms and businesses to survive and create job \nopportunities, survey after survey has revealed that 70 to 80 percent \nof Americans in general are critical of the tax and supportive of its \nrepeal. This broad-based support is evident in the number of states \nthat have acted to repeal their state-level estate taxes. Since 1980, \nmore than 20 states have elected to repeal their estate taxes.\n  Mr. President, there is no excuse for continuing a tax that \nconfiscates capital from our most productive citizens. It's anti-\ngrowth. It's anti-jobs. It's anti-American.\n  Mr. President, it's time to bury the death tax.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n    Death Tax Devastation: Horror Stories From Middle-Class America\n\n(By William W. Beach, Director, Center for Data Analysis, The Heritage \n                              Foundation)\n\n       The death tax is the nightmare of the American dream, as \n     these real-life experiences from middle-class America will \n     show.\n       Millions of Americans spend their adult lives working hard, \n     sacrificing and saving, obeying the law, and doing the \n     countless other things that official Washington has told them \n     are the ingredients of a successful life. They are encouraged \n     as federal laws are passed that should expand economic \n     opportunity and guarantee that civil rights will be as much \n     as part of the marketplace as they are a part of community \n     life and education. Thousands of political speeches reinforce \n     the impression they have that Washington believes the United \n     States really is a land of opportunity and a place where the \n     financial fruits of hard work can be used to endow the next \n     generation's economic struggle with greater potential.\n       However, for those whose economic success also resulted in \n     significant assets (like a farm, a small business, a factory, \n     or a trucking fleet), what official Washington says is \n     nothing less than a lie. At the end of life, the federal \n     death tax will sweep across the profits of family-owned \n     businesses and estates and leave in its wake millions of \n     devastated survivors, employees, and communities. Many people \n     whose assets will be depleted to pay the death tax \n     unfortunately learn about estate and gift taxes so late in \n     life that they spend their last days as frequently in the \n     company of their tax lawyers and accountants as they do with \n     their families.\n       The federal government taxes the transfer of wealth between \n     generations at rates as high as 55 percent. At $30 billion \n     dollars, the death tax burden in the United States is the \n     greatest in the world. Indeed, this country owns the dubious \n     distinction of holding the fruits of economic success in \n     lower regard than many of its ideological and economic \n     adversaries.\n       The full case for repealing federal death taxes will \n     involve more than testimony from its victims. However, \n     evidence of harm to the U.S. economy and public finances \n     pales in comparison to the stories of the men and women whose \n     economic virtues regrettably laid the basis for their own and \n     their offspring's financial devastation. The following \n     sampling of evidence from that anecdotal record has been \n     compiled from testimony before Congress, newspaper articles, \n     and statements of family members whose lives were changed by \n     federal death taxes.\n\n[[Page S6773]]\n\n              the death tax hurts family farms and ranches\n\n       The death tax destroys family businesses and farms, and \n     forces families to spend their hard-earned money on lawyers, \n     accountants, and life insurance policies to deal with it. The \n     Public Policy Institute of New York found a negative \n     relationship between anticipated death tax liability and \n     growth in employment, particularly for growing firms. \n     Business owners are afraid to hire new people and expand \n     their businesses when they face the death tax. The reason is \n     simple: Hiring new people is optional; paying taxes on the \n     family estate is not.\n\n                      Family Farm Horror Story #1\n\n       Tim Koopman's family has owned ranch property in California \n     for most of this century. His children would like to continue \n     to run the ranch, but the death tax may prevent this.\n       Since Tim's mother died four years ago, the Koopman's have \n     paid about $400,000 in death taxes. For three of those years, \n     however, Tim has been able only to pay the interest on the \n     death tax bill, and soon he will not be able to pay that \n     without selling some or all of his land. This is a decision \n     that he does not want to face. This land is an important part \n     of his life.\n       The Koopman's faced the death tax once before. In 1973, Tim \n     was forced to sell one of the family's ranches to pay the \n     $125,000 death tax bill that he owed when his father died. \n     Now the family faces the death tax again. Tim wants to pass \n     the ranch on to his children, but the hefty death tax may \n     leave little ranch for him to do so.\n\n                      Family Farm Horror Story #2\n\n       Lee Ann's family owns a ranch in Idaho. They have lived \n     there for three generations, providing jobs for the local \n     economy and helping to create a strong community. The family \n     did not acquire a lot of material wealth, so it came as a \n     great shock when the government hit them with a $3.3 million \n     death tax bill after their father's death.\n       Although the death of Lee Ann's father was devastating, the \n     death tax bill made it worse. The family had no debts and \n     owned their land outright; they thought they had nothing to \n     tax. However, their land had increased in value enough to \n     trigger the death tax. Lee Ann's mother, who has been under \n     tremendous strain since her husband's death, is haunted by \n     the realization that after she dies, her family may lose the \n     ranch because of this tax.\n       Another concern is who will buy the ranch if they are \n     forced to sell. Lee Ann worries that, as is the case with so \n     many other properties, the purchaser will not be another \n     family rancher, but rather a wealthy absentee owner who flies \n     in once or twice a year for a vacation. This has been \n     happening more frequently in Idaho, and the sense of \n     community that Lee Ann enjoyed for most of her life is \n     quickly being lost.\n\n                      Family Farm Horror Story #3\n\n       Robert Sakata is a 42-year-old vegetable farmer from \n     Brighton, Colorado. Back in 1944 his father paid $6,000 for \n     40 acres of land to begin a family farm. Six years later, he \n     purchased additional land for $700 an acre. Today, the elder \n     Sakata is 73 and owns 2,000 acres of farmland near the Denver \n     International Airport--a piece of land worth nearly $380 \n     million.\n       This might seem like a wonderful situation for the Sakata \n     family, yet the family owns no other investments; after the \n     elder Sakata and his wife pass away, Robert will face a tax \n     bill of over $200 million. Robert has admitted that he would \n     have to sell off half the farm and lay off many of his 350 \n     workers ``who are like family.'' ``We don't live like \n     millionaires,'' Robert has stated. ``We're just trying to \n     sustain a family business.''\n       They will have a difficult time. the death tax will force \n     them to lay off workers and sell land that has been part of \n     the family for more than five decades. This treatment of \n     hardworking successful citizens is hardly the story line for \n     an American dream.\n\n\n               THE DEATH TAX THREAT TO FAMILY BUSINESSES\n\n       The Center for the Study of Taxation found that three out \n     of four families faced with liquidating all or part of their \n     business to pay the death tax would have to cut their payroll \n     in the process. Moreover, studies by the Institute for Policy \n     Innovation (IPI) and Congress's own Joint Economic Committee \n     have found that the death tax costs communities more in lost \n     jobs and lower economic growth than it raises for the U.S. \n     Treasury.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #1\n\n       After her father's death from cancer, Terry Deeny, like \n     many Americans, could not reflect on her personal loss, spend \n     time with her family, and build family cohesion. Instead, \n     death taxes forced Terry to concern herself with her family's \n     survival. As Chairman and CEO of Deeny Construction Co., \n     Terry watched as payment of the death taxes drove her company \n     deeply into debt. She had no choice but to lay workers off, \n     sell much of the company machinery, and stop many business \n     transactions that had kept the business alive. ``We barely \n     survived. It was not an American dream; it was an American \n     nightmare.''\n       It is hard for people like Terry to find justification for \n     the federal government to force Americans to scrounge for \n     money in order to pay a tax that puts many into debt, \n     especially when the money otherwise could be used to help \n     create jobs and enable even more citizens to achieve the \n     American dream.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #2\n\n       Barry, an entrepreneur in Kentucky, likens the death tax to \n     the old saying about sheep: Slaughter your sheep and you will \n     get dinner for a night. Shear it and you will get a lifetime \n     of wool. By endangering the future of his family's business, \n     the death tax is threatening his employees' livelihoods as \n     well as costing the government future revenue.\n       For three generations, Barry's family ran their own \n     business in Kentucky. Today, they own 20 gas stations and \n     convenience stores and employ about 100 people. However, \n     Barry's father is growing older and would like to pass on the \n     business.\n       According to Barry, the family has spent a significant \n     amount of money on accountants and attorneys in preparation \n     for shifting ownership of the businesses from his father to \n     Barry's generation and the grandchildren. Family members have \n     purchased insurance and have gone through rewriting several \n     wills and trusts. ``It's something you continually update,'' \n     Barry says; ``every time a new grandchild is born, we have to \n     revise the will and trusts.''\n       The death tax also affects the ability of Barry's \n     businesses to grow. New opportunities take time to develop, \n     but between worrying about how to pay the death tax and meet \n     other federal regulations, Barry finds it is harder to pursue \n     new opportunities. In the end, the businesses and their \n     communities suffer.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #3\n\n       Clarence owns a farming and lumber business in North \n     Carolina. He provides jobs to 70 people in the community who \n     work on his three small farms, in his fertilizer and tobacco \n     warehouse, and at a small lumber mill. His family has worked \n     hard for four generations to build the business. However, all \n     this may be lost when Clarence dies and his family is faced \n     with enormous death tax bill.\n       Clarence has tried to reduce the burden of the death tax. \n     He has intentionally slowed the growth of his business, hired \n     lawyers, purchased life insurance, and established trusts--\n     all to create a plan that he hopes will enable his children \n     to keep the family business when he dies.\n       But all that work and planning may not be enough. Clarence \n     figures that his son will owe the federal government about \n     $1.5 million upon his death--a difficult sum for most people \n     to raise, but especially so for a man who makes $31,000 a \n     year. It will be impossible for his son to pay that much, so \n     he may have to sell all or part of the business. It would be \n     the fourth time that Clarence's family will have had to pay \n     the death tax. The federal government, in the end, will have \n     destroyed the work of four generations.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #4\n\n       Everett has been in the newspaper business for 30 years. \n     His company publishes six weekly papers in northern \n     California and the telephone directory for two counties. He \n     employs 97 people. From his first small weekly paper, Everett \n     has built his company into a $3 million business.\n       Nevertheless, all the hard work may be for naught. \n     Everett's wife died two years ago, and he placed her share of \n     the corporate stock in a trust for their daughter. His \n     daughter and her husband, who is the publisher for all the \n     business's publications, will still face a hefty death tax \n     that may cause them to lose the business when Everett dies.\n       For years, the number of small, family-owned weeklies has \n     been declining in northern California. The people who work \n     for the weeklies and the small towns that depend on these \n     newspapers for information and entertainment will suffer when \n     these businesses shut down. Abolishing the death tax would \n     help preserve the legacy of hard work and dedication that \n     thousands of families like Everett's have given to their \n     communities.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #4\n\n       Wayne Williams' family has owned a telecommunications and \n     video communications business in Washington since 1982. The \n     family's philosophy is that it is important to reinvest \n     profits in employees, new products, and expanding \n     opportunities. The company has maintained a commitment to \n     improving the local community and tied most of its financial \n     worth up in the business. That means Wayne does not have the \n     cash on hand to pay the death tax when his parents die.\n       So Wayne has had to take other measures to save his family \n     from the devastation of the death tax, including scheduling \n     gifts, buying life insurance, and slowing reinvestment in the \n     firm. This last action does not mesh well with the family's \n     philosophy of reinvesting profits, but the death tax makes it \n     necessary.\n       The fact that thousands of family businesses are in the \n     same fix explains why eliminating the death tax is the number \n     one priority of so many owners of small businesses. It also \n     could explain why a majority of Americans agree that the \n     death tax is simply unfair and should be eliminated.\n\n                    Family Business Horror Story #5\n\n       David Pankonin, whose story first appeared in the Wall \n     Street Journal, is the fourth-generation owner of Pankonin's \n     Inc., in Nebraska. David's great-grandfather established this \n     retail farm equipment company in 1883 in Louisville, \n     Nebraska. The business has been handed down there times \n     through the family, and David hopes that some day he will be \n     able to hand it down to his own son. He worries because the \n     odds--and the estate tax laws--are against him.\n\n[[Page S6774]]\n\n       Only 30 percent of businesses survive a first \n     intergenerational transfer. Only 4 percent survive to the \n     next generation. A third transfer--the transfer that put \n     Pankonin's in David's hands--usually has survival odds of \n     less than 1 percent. Now David wonders if the business can \n     survive another transfer. In his words, ``Will I be able to \n     pass the company inherited from my father along to my son or, \n     in spite of what my will might say, am I just working hard to \n     pay an heir called Uncle Sam?''\n\n\n                THE DEATH TAX THREAT TO THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n       When people think about the death tax, they tend to focus \n     on its devastating effect on family businesses and farms. \n     However, the death tax also hurts the environment. Many \n     landowners, especially those in rural areas, are ``land rich, \n     but cash poor.'' If the owner of a family business dies, the \n     heirs often will have to sell their assets because they do \n     not have enough money to pay the death tax. Since land is \n     valued at its ``highest and best use,'' they must sell to \n     developers in order to raise the necessary cash.\n\n                   Impact on the Environment Case #1\n\n       The Hilliard family is a good example of how the death tax \n     hurts the environment. The family was forced to sell 17,000 \n     acres of land in southern Florida to developers to pay its \n     death tax bills. So far, 12,000 acres have been developed; \n     the rest will soon follow. The family did not intend to sell \n     the land before the death tax bill and had not made plans to \n     develop it.\n       The Hilliard's land is in the heart of Florida panther \n     habitat. The panther, an endangered species, requires a large \n     amount of land to survive. The death tax indirectly threatens \n     the panther's habitat every time it forces local Florida's \n     landowners to sell their land to real estate developers.\n       Today, over 75 percent of species listed under the \n     Endangered Species Act rely on privately owned land for some \n     or all of their habitat. The death tax creates a huge burden \n     for those that wish to keep their land undeveloped.\n\n\n                             TAX AVOIDANCE\n\n       Historically, the death tax brings in only about 1 percent \n     of total federal revenues. Yet, the costs to administer and \n     collect the death tax, including litigation, as well as the \n     costs of its economic effects can add up to 65 cents on every \n     dollar collected. That means net revenue collected from this \n     onerous tax is just nearly one-third of the total tax \n     collected.\n       According to the Institute for Policy Innovation, the death \n     tax costs the economy almost as much as it raises for the \n     federal government. This is because the death tax harms the \n     most potent engine of growth in the economy--America's small \n     businesses and their employees. The IPI study found that if \n     Congress repealed the death tax today, the increase in \n     economic growth that resulted from this reform would replace \n     any loss to the U.S. Treasury by the year 2010.\n       A 1996 Heritage Foundation analysis of death taxes using \n     the WEFA Group U.S. Macroeconomic Model and the Washington \n     University Macro Model found that, if the estate tax had been \n     repealed in 1996, then over the next nine years: The U.S. \n     economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in \n     extra output; an average of 145,000 additional job could be \n     created each year; personal income could rise by an average \n     of $8 billion per year above the current projections; and the \n     extra revenue generated by the additional growth in the \n     economy would more than compensate for the meager revenue \n     losses stemming from the death tax's repeal.\n\n                        Wasted Resources Case #1\n\n       Robert, an entrepreneur, began investing in Northern \n     California real estate early in life, making large profits \n     from the resale of his land. He used the profits to invest in \n     a vineyard in Napa Valley that now has a fair market value of \n     $20 million.\n       Robert planned on leaving the vineyard to his children. Two \n     of his three children work on the vineyard already and they \n     would like to continue to do so. However, Robert is afraid \n     that when he dies he is going to have to leave all that he \n     has worked hard to build to the federal government, rather \n     than to his children. To make sure his legacy lives on, \n     Robert has spent approximately $50,000 on legal, accounting, \n     and appraisal bills.\n       He is also making annual $10,000 gifts to his children and \n     has given away 45 percent of his winery to his children. He \n     has changed his company from a sole proprietorship to a \n     limited liability company, and has formed a family limited \n     partnership for the vineyards.\n\n                        Wasted Resources Case #2\n\n       Richard Forrestel, Jr., of Akron, New York, has spent a \n     substantial amount of time and effort to avoid the \n     devastation wrought by the death tax. Forrestel's father \n     founded Cold Spring Construction Company. Forrestel stated \n     that, ``My family's construction company has already wasted \n     over $4 million 1980 in insurance purchases and stock \n     redemptions solely in order to be able to pay the death \n     tax.'' ``I wish death tax proponents would tell the truth--\n     they simply want to redistribute wealth,'' continues \n     Forrestel. ``The American dream of my father should not be \n     broken up and sent to Washington when he dies.''\n       Each day, hundreds of Americans spend more and more money \n     in an attempt to shelter as much of their estate as possible \n     from taxation after they pass away, so that their offspring \n     can benefit from their years of hard work. This money could \n     have been reinvested into the company, creating more jobs and \n     helping more Americans in their daily lives, but the death \n     tax makes this almost impossible.\n\n                        Wasted Resources Case #3\n\n       Ronald works at a steel manufacturing plant his father \n     started in Philadelphia in 1952. Its stainless steel plate \n     products are sold to other manufacturers for various uses. \n     Ronald and his brother have been working with their father to \n     develop an estate plan to smooth the transition of ownership \n     from the second generation to the third.\n       However, this task has been difficult. Ronald does not have \n     55 percent of his business assets in cash so, that he can pay \n     off the death tax bill when his father dies. So, he has to \n     spend his precious time and money on lawyers and insurance \n     agents. He has to stop the growth of his plant to ensure he \n     can pay the tax bill. The death tax means that Ronald cannot \n     buy a new price of equipment or hire a new employee because \n     he must spend his extra money on lawyer's fees.\n\n                        Wasted Resources Case #4\n\n       Helen and her husband dreamed of owning a community \n     newspaper. After years of planning, they finally realized \n     their dream in 1965 and bought a small, struggling weekly \n     paper in northern Georgia. They invested all their savings \n     and have turned that small paper into a $2 million business \n     that publishes three other weeklies as well.\n       Helen is worried that all of their hard work will go to \n     waste when she and her husband die. She would like to pass \n     the business on to her sons, but she may not be able to if \n     the government hands her a 55 percent death tax bill. Her \n     family has spent thousands of dollars already in legal fees \n     to ensure she can pass her business on as she and her husband \n     hope, but this still may not happen. The 55 percent death tax \n     will be levied on the family estate despite all the corporate \n     and personal taxes they have paid through the years.\n\n                        Wasted Resources Case #5\n\n       The family business of Michael Coyne has lasted through \n     three generations across 67 years. What started as a small \n     New Jersey lumber company in 1932 has grown into three home \n     improvement stores and a separate kitchen and bath store. \n     However, the same business that made it through the ravages \n     of the Great Depression and the shortages of World War II may \n     not survive the death tax.\n       Michael's experience with death taxes began 10 years ago \n     when his grandfather passed away. The majority of the estate \n     was left to his grandmother; though they obtained appropriate \n     legal representation and death tax planning, it became clear \n     that the business would not survive after his grandmother's \n     death.\n       Michael and his family have contributed more than just \n     stability to their community for generations. They employ 70 \n     people, and they have paid all their taxes. Yet for the past \n     10 years, they have been forced to spend over $1 million on \n     life insurance policies, lawyers, accountants, and other \n     efforts to protect the business from the death tax. Despite \n     these efforts, the family faces a death tax bill in the \n     millions of dollars. The business might not survive.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       Even though many countries such as Australia and Canada do \n     not have a death tax, the United States continues to reserve \n     its highest marginal tax rate of 55 percent for estates that \n     involve family farms and businesses. The lowest rate imposed \n     by Washington (37 percent) is nearly twice the average death \n     tax rate of 21.6 percent in 24 other countries that do impose \n     death taxes. And while most countries impose a top rate on \n     estates of $4 million or more, the top death tax rate in this \n     country is imposed on estates valued $3 million or more. This \n     policy is wrong in a country that built its future on the \n     idea that with enough hard work and determination anyone \n     could move up the economic ladder.\n       By eliminating the death tax, Congress could put more money \n     in the pockets of Americans who in turn, would give more to \n     their favorite charities and to their communities during \n     their life times as well as after death. While the death tax \n     was supposed to be a tax on the rich, American families who \n     work hard to build a family business or farm and their \n     employees of are the ones most often left paying the bill. \n     The mathematics are simple: The tax rate on a worker who \n     loses his other job as a result of the death tax is 100 \n     percent. Clearly, with estimates of the federal budget \n     surplus now exceeding $1.87 trillion over the next ten years, \n     it's time to do away with this faulty tax policy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in Vermont, small businesses and family \nfarms form the backbone of our economy. I have always been a strong \nsupporter of targeted estate tax relief for these family-owned farms \nand small businesses. Targeted relief would help families in Vermont \nkeep their property intact and in the family.\n  What we have are two very different approaches to estate tax relief.\n  Under the Republican proposal, H.R. 8, relief from the estate tax \nwould be phased in gradually over ten years and the initial benefits \nwould be directed towards the wealthiest estates, those valued at over \n$20 million. Under this proposal, not a single small business or family \nfarm would be removed from\n\n[[Page S6775]]\n\nthe tax next year or even 9 years from now. That is because H.R. 8 does \nnot actually repeal the estate tax until the next decade. This proposal \nwould cost American taxpayers $105 billion in the first ten years and \n$50 billion in each year after that.\n  Under the second proposal, the Democratic Alternative put forth by \nSenator Moynihan, thousands of additional farms and small businesses \nwould be exempt from the estate tax in the very first year after its \nenactment. Under the Democratic Alternative, business owners and \nfarmers would be able to leave $2 million per individual and $4 million \nper couple without paying estate tax in 2001. By 2010, business owner's \nand farmer's assets totaling $8 million would be exempt. This proposal \nwould cost approximately $64 billion over 10 years.\n  We now have a choice between a proposal that would provide immediate \nrelief to small business owners and farmers at a cost we can afford and \na fiscally irresponsible measure that would provide a windfall to the \nwealthiest estates at a high cost to Vermonters and the American \npublic. I choose the affordable, immediate, targeted relief that we \nhave with the Democratic proposal--a proposal that I believe is a \nbetter deal for Vermonters.\n  The Republicans have stated that H.R. 8 is designed primarily to help \nsmall businesses and family farms. But who would benefit the most from \nthis proposal? I think an article on the front page of the Business \nSection of today's New York Times sums it up well, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. The New York Times article said that had the estate tax \nbeen repealed in 1997, as the Republicans now propose, more than half \nof the tax savings would have gone to the slightly more than 400 \nindividuals who died that year leaving estates valued at $20 million or \nmore. Only about 400 estates in the entire nation, Mr. President.\n  In other words, under the Republican proposal, once again, only the \nwealthiest individuals would reap the majority of the benefits. Only \ngradually would any benefits trickle down to the small business owners \nand farmers who Republicans are professing to help. Under the \nRepublican proposal hard working Vermonters would bear the burden of a \nwindfall to the wealthy.\n  In Vermont, in 1998, 227 estates were subject to the estate tax. If \nthe Republican proposal were adopted in 1997, not a single one of those \nestates would have been removed from the rolls in the following year. \nUnder the Democratic Alternative, small business owners and farmers \nwould have received immediate relief. When all is said and done, with \nthe Democratic Alternative, approximately two-thirds of all estates \nwould not be subject to the estate tax.\n  Do we want relief for our farmers and small business owners now, at a \ncost we can afford? Or do we want an unworkable partisan solution that \nwill lead inevitably to a presidential veto, endless debate, and empty \ncampaign slogans? I think that Vermonters deserve the immediate relief \nthat is available under the Democratic proposal, relief that would keep \nsmall businesses and family owned farms intact, relief that is balanced \nand affordable.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 13, 2000]\n\n               Democrats' Estate Tax Plan Is Little Known\n\n                        (By David Cay Johnston)\n\n       Small business owners and farmers whose Washington \n     lobbyists are ardent backers of a Republican-backed plan to \n     repeal the estate tax seem largely unaware that President \n     Clinton--who has vowed to veto the Republican proposal--has \n     said he would sign legislation that would exempt nearly all \n     of them from the tax staring next year.\n       Business owners and farmers would be allowed to leave $2 \n     million--$4 million for a couple--to their heirs without \n     paying estate taxes under the plan favored by the President \n     and the Democratic leadership in Congress. The Republican \n     proposal, which passed the House last month with some \n     Democrats' support and is being debated in the Senate this \n     week, would be phased in slowly, with the tax eliminated in \n     2009.\n       Supporters of the Republican plan say the tax is so \n     complicated that eliminating it is the only effective reform; \n     they argue that the nation's growing wealth means more \n     estates will steadily fall under the tax if it remains law on \n     the Democratic proposal's terms.\n       Still, had the Democratic plan been law in 1997, the last \n     year for which estate tax return data is available from the \n     Internal Revenue Service, the estates of fewer than 1,300 \n     owners of closely held businesses and 300 farmers would have \n     owed the tax.\n       According to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 \n     farmers who paid estate tax that year would have been \n     exempted under terms of the Democrats' plan, as would 88 \n     percent of the roughly 10,000 small-business owners who paid \n     the tax.\n       Had the estate tax been repealed in 1997, as the \n     Republicans now propose, more than half of the tax savings \n     would have gone to the slightly more than 400 individuals who \n     died that year leaving individual estates worth more than $20 \n     million each.\n       Two prominent experts on estate taxes said yesterday that \n     the Democrats were offering a much better deal to small-\n     business owners and farmers, because the relief under their \n     bill would be immediate and the estate tax would be \n     eliminated for nearly all of them.\n       ``The fact is that the Democrats are making the better \n     offer--and I'm a Republican saying that,'' said Sanford J. \n     Schlesinger of the law firm of Kaye, Scholer, Fierman, Hays & \n     Handler in New York. With routine estate planning, he said, \n     the $4 million exemption could effectively be raised to as \n     much as $10 million in wealth that could be passed untaxed to \n     heirs. Only 1,221 of the 2.3 million people who died in 1997 \n     left a taxable estate of $10 million or more, I.R.S. data \n     shows.\n       Neil Harl, an Iowa State University economist who is a \n     leading estate tax adviser to Midwest farmers, said that only \n     a handful of working family farms had a net worth of $4 \n     million. ``Above that, with a very few exceptions, you are \n     talking about the Ted Turners who own huge ranches and are \n     not working farmers,'' he said.\n       Mr. Harl said he was surprised that farmers were not \n     calling lawmakers to demand that they take the president up \n     on his promise to sign the Democratic bill.\n       One reason for that may be that in leading the call for \n     repeal of the tax, two organizations representing merchants \n     and farmers--the National Federation of Independent Business \n     and the American Farm Bureau Federation--have done little to \n     tell members about the Democratic plan. Interviews this week \n     with half a dozen people whom the two organizations offered \n     as spokesmen on the estate tax showed that only one of them \n     had any awareness of the Democratic proposal.\n       Officials of the business federation and the farm bureau \n     said that in the event full repeal failed, they might push \n     for approval of the Democratic plan. But both groups say \n     outright repeal makes more sense.\n       ``My concern is not over the Bill Gateses of the world,'' \n     said Jim Hirni, a Senate lobbyist for the business \n     federation. ``But we have to eliminate this tax, because it \n     is too complicated to comply with the rules. Instead of \n     further complicating the system, the best way is to eliminate \n     the tax, period.''\n       A farm bureau spokesman, Christopher Noun, said that the \n     Democrats' plan appeared to grant benefits that would erode \n     over time. ``Farmers are not cash wealthy, they are asset \n     wealthy,'' he said. ``And those assets are only going to \n     continue to gain value over the years. So while some farmers \n     may not be taxed now under the other plan--10 or 15 years out \n     they will.''\n       Whether the proposal to repeal the tax dies in the Senate \n     or is passed and then vetoed by the President, it will become \n     a powerful tool for both parties in the fall elections. The \n     Republicans will be able to paint themselves as tax \n     cutters who would carry out their plans if they could just \n     win the White House and more seats in Congress. The \n     Democrats could try to paint the Republicans as the party \n     that abandoned Main Street merchants and family to serve \n     the interests of billionaires.\n       A vote in the Senate could come as early as this evening.\n       At the grass roots, however, those who would benefit from \n     any reduction in the scope of the estate tax take a much more \n     pragmatic view of the matter.\n       ``The whole reason I took up this cause is I do not want to \n     see another small family business get into the situation we \n     are in,'' said Mark Sincavage, a land developer in the Pocono \n     Mountains of Pennsylvania whose family expects to sell some \n     raw land soon to pay a $600,000 estate tax bill to the \n     federal and state governments.\n       The independent business federation cited Mr. Sincavage's \n     situation as an especially good example of problems the \n     estate tax causes its members who are asset rich but short on \n     cash. Facing similar circumstances is John H. Kearney, a Ford \n     and Lincoln dealer in Ravena, N.Y., who said he ``got slammed \n     pretty hard'' when his father died last year. Most of his \n     father's $1.6 million estate was in land and the car \n     dealership, said Mr. Kearney, who added that he dipped into \n     savings intended for his children's education to pay the \n     estate tax bill.\n       Neither Mr. Sincavage nor Mr, Kearney said he was aware of \n     the Democrats' plan to roll back the tax.\n       But Mr. Kearney said his interest was in reasonable tax \n     relief so that merchants and farmers could continue to \n     nurture their businesses, not in helping billionaires.\n       ``No part of me has any sympathy for people with more than \n     $5 million,'' he said. ``Would I feel terrible if all they \n     did was raise the exemption to $4 million or $5 million? I \n     would say from my selfish standpoint\n\n[[Page S6776]]\n\n     that we have covered the small family farm and small business \n     and thus we achieved what we wanted to achieve.\n       ``But I would still be asking: Is it really a moral tax to \n     begin with? And that's a point you can argue a hundred \n     different ways.''\n       Carl Loop, 72, who owns a wholesale decorative-plant \n     nursery in Jacksonville, Fla., said he favored repeal, partly \n     because estate tax planning was fraught with uncertainty.\n       ``The complexity of it keeps a lot of people from doing \n     estate planning because they don't understand it,'' Mr. Loop \n     said. ``And they don't like the fact that they have to give \n     up ownership of property whole they are alive.''\n       Professor Harl, the Iowa State University estate tax \n     expert, said that he had heard many horror stories about \n     people having to sell farms to pay estate taxes. But in 35 \n     years of conducting estate tax seminars for farmers, he \n     added, ``I have pushed and hunted and probed and I have not \n     been able to find a single case where estate taxes caused the \n     sale of a family farm; it's a myth.''\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Death Tax \nElimination Act of 2000. The time has come to stop death from being a \ntaxable event.\n  The repeal of the Federal death tax is one of the top priorities for \ntax reform in my home State of Wyoming. The reason is simple--Wyoming \nis made up almost exclusively of small businesses, and the Federal \ndeath tax hits small business owners the hardest of any group in \nsociety. Many of the small businesses in Wyoming are in the \nagricultural sector--ranching and farming businesses that have been \nbuilt up by families working together to help feed Wyoming and America. \nThese farms and ranches not only provide a great service to our State \nand the country as a whole by helping provide food that we eat every \nday, but they are an integral part of the western way of the life. All \ntoo often, I have heard the painful stories of families who were forced \nto sell their ranches or farms just to pay the taxes when their parents \npass away. The death tax chips away at our very way of life in the West \nand elsewhere and should be abolished.\n  The death tax discourages thrift and pierces the very heart of the \nAmerican economy--small businesses. We should never forget that small \nbusinesses are the backbone of the American economy. The simple fact is \nthat most businesses in this country are small businesses. Out of the \nnearly 5.5 million employers in this country, 99 percent are businesses \nwith fewer than 500 employees. Almost 90 percent of those businesses \nemploy fewer than twenty employees. Since the early 1970s, small \nbusinesses have created two out of every three net new jobs in this \ncountry. This remarkable job growth continued even during periods of \nslow national growth and downturns when most large corporations were \ndownsizing and laying off workers. Small businesses employ more than \nhalf of the private sector workforce and are responsible for producing \nroughly half of our nation's gross domestic product. By punishing small \nbusinesses, the Federal death tax stifles our economy, discourages \ningenuity, and threatens the economic security of many of our families.\n  The Federal death tax also tears at the bonds that unite parents and \nchildren and families and communities. The family business has \nhistorically been one of the primary means for children to learn skills \nand virtues that help them throughout their entire lives. I know many \nof the hard-working men and women in Wyoming who run our State's family \nranches and farms. The whole family pitches in to harvest the crops, \nfeed the livestock, mend the fences, fix the irrigation ditches, plow \nthe roads, herd the sheep and cattle, and plan for next year's crops or \nherds. Children learn that hard work and responsible planning are \nnecessary ingredients for success in work as in life. They learn \nrespect for the land that is their livelihood. They learn to appreciate \nthe labor of their parents and grandparents and they realize their own \nlabor is an investment in their future and the future of their \nchildren.\n  Unfortunately, we live at a time in America when there are all too \nmany forces in our society telling our children that everything goes \nand that instant gratification is the only goal in life. It we as \npolicymakers want to curb this trend, if we want to teach our children \nthe importance of personal responsibility, hard work, and investment in \ntheir future, we should encourage family-owned businesses which are one \nof the domestic classrooms for teaching our children these time-honored \nvirtues.\n  I have a little experience in operating a small business myself. My \nfamily and I ran a couple of small family-owned shoe stores in \nGillette, WY. We didn't have separate division for merchandising and \nmarketing. We didn't have an accounting department to sort out the \ncomplicated tax code. We all wore many hats. We had to sell the shoes, \nbalance the books, keep track of our inventory, and straighten out the \nshelves. We had to sweep the sidewalks when we opened in the morning \nand at the end of a long day, we had to clean the floors and organize \nthe store room. Let me tell you that we all learned to pitch in to get \nthe job done. We learned to work together and we learned to appreciate \nthe hard work and sacrifices each of us made to keep the store running \nsmoothly.\n  We also learned firsthand the importance of living by the golden \nrule. If you don't treat your customers well in the retail business \nthey don't forget. This is especially true of folks in small towns \nwhere there are always a few people who remember what you did as a kid \nand who can even tell you stories about your parents and grandparents. \nThe joy is, they also remember you when you treat them well. The \nfamily-owned business is an important means we have in America of \npassing on our heritage from one generation to the next.\n  Our tax code represents our tax policy and we should be ashamed at a \ncode which punishes families and stifles our economy. Every year our \ntax code forces thousands of families to sell their businesses just to \npay the repressive Federal death tax. It is time we correct this \ninjustice by eliminating the death tax. I commend Chairman Roth for his \ndiligent work bringing this bill to the floor. I also commend Senator \nKyl, who has been a tireless advocate for the repeal of this tax ever \nsince he came to the United States Senate and who made an important \ncontribution to the legislation before us today. I urge my colleagues \nto join me in standing up for America's small businesses by putting the \ndeath tax permanently to rest.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, since the beginning of the fiscal year, \nthe national debt has increased, not decreased. Since we have been \nrunning a deficit and there is no surplus, any tax cut or loss of \nrevenues only increases the debt rather than paying down the debt. \nAccordingly, I oppose the telephone tax cut, and I oppose this estate \ntax cut. As John Mitchell used to say, ``Watch what we do, not what we \nsay.'' We say pay down the debt but we increase it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I oppose the Republican proposal to repeal \nthe Federal estate tax and support the Democratic alternative proposal \nto provide relief from the estate tax to those who need it most--small \nbusinesses and family farms.\n  The current estate tax was first enacted by Congress in 1916, partly \nat the behest of President Theodore Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt was \nright. It's appropriate to tax a little more those who have prospered \ngreatly from the American political and economic systems in order to \nprovide some assistance to those who have also worked hard but have \nfallen behind. That's the basic tenet of our progressive system of \ntaxation. Roosevelt was also correct that the tax should not discourage \npeople from seeing to it that their children are well-off, but rather \nbe aimed at immense fortunes. That is why I support the Democratic \nproposal to reform the estate tax to provide prompt relief to small \nbusiness owners and farmers, rather than the Republican proposal to \nrepeal it gradually over the next ten years, but totally for even the \ngreatest fortunes while making small businesses and farmers wait for \nrelief.\n  The Democratic proposal targets tax relief to persons with more \nmodest estates and to small businesses and family farms and it does so \nat a more reasonable cost. By increasing the exemption for Qualified \nFamily-Owned Business Interests from its current level of $2.6 million \nper couple to $4 million per couple in 2001, the Democratic alternative \nprovides immediate relief by removing altogether more than 90 percent \nof family farms and more than 60 percent of small businesses from the \nestate tax rolls. In stark contrast, the Republican plan removes no one \nfrom the estate tax burden for another 10 years.\n\n[[Page S6777]]\n\n  In addition to providing relief immediately, the Democratic proposal \ndoes so at a more reasonable cost--$64 billion over 10 years, compared \nto $105 billion for the Republican repeal. This $40 billion difference \ncan and should go to other important national priorities--such as a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare, making a college education more \naffordable, extending Medicare's solvency, or reducing the national \ndebt. But the Republican repeal will cost much more than that. In its \nsecond 10 years, 2011-2020, the same decade in which the baby boomers \nbegin to retire and place enormous strains on the Medicare system and \non Social Security, the Republican repeal is estimated to cost up to \n$750 billion. To give such a huge tax cut to a few thousand of the \nwealthiest among us at the expense of important national priorities for \nour children, grandchildren, and senior citizens is simply wrong.\n  I believe that taxes should be distributed fairly among all \nAmericans. I also believe that we have a responsibility to protect \nMedicare and Social Security, to pay down the national debt, and to \nmake the investments in health-care, education and other key areas that \nwill keep America strong in the future. The Democratic estate tax \nreform plan is consistent with these goals. The Republican plan puts \nthem at risk.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate has \ntaken four days now to debate the estate tax before making any real \nprogress on education, health, or debt reduction. Democrats agree that \nowners of small businesses and farms need relief from this tax, and if \nthe Republicans had worked with us, this problem could have been solved \nlong ago. Instead, our Republican colleagues are holding small business \nowners and farmers hostage as their excuse to provide an enormous \nwindfall to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers--people who have an \naverage income of over $800,000 a year. The repeal of the estate tax \nthat they seek, costing over $50 billion a year, is the ultimate tax \nbreak for the wealthy, and any repeal bill will eminently deserve the \nveto that President Clinton has promised if it reaches his desk.\n  The Senate has much higher priorities that we should have addressed \nthis week. Tens of millions of senior citizens face a crisis because \nthey can't afford the prescription drugs they need. The extraordinary \npromise of fuller and healthier lives brought by new prescription drugs \nis beyond their reach. They need help to afford these life-saving, \nlife-changing miracle drugs. But instead of doing the work that is \nneeded to enable all seniors to access the prescription drugs they \nneed, the Senate spends day after day doing the bidding of a few \nthousand of America's wealthiest citizens.\n  We send tens of millions of young children to dilapidated, crumbling, \nover-crowded schools with underpaid teachers each day--yet we stand \nhere debating a bill to repeal the tax on multi-million dollar estates.\n  Millions of working men and women and their families struggle to \nsurvive on the minimum wage at its current unfair level of $5.15 an \nhour. The Republican Senate has no time to meet their needs--yet the \ntime of the Senate is instantly available to those who make thousands \nof dollars each hour.\n  Congress has not found time to resolve any of the daily problems \nfacing the vast majority of the nation's working families, its senior \ncitizens, and its school children. In this ``do-nothing Congress,'' the \nlist of priority matters on which nothing is done goes on and on--gun \nsafety, the patients' bill of rights, protecting children from tobacco, \nprotecting the environment. There is no time for any of these issues--\nbut there is always time to help millionaires and even billionaires \nreduce their taxes. It is obvious where the priorities of our \nRepublican friends lie.\n  All Americans should take a clear look at what the Republicans really \nwant when they propose a full repeal of the estate tax. Current law now \ntaxes only the largest 2 percent of all estates. No one else pays any \nestate tax. Today anyone can bequeath unlimited resources to a spouse \ncompletely free of the estate tax, and $675,000 to anyone else--again \ncompletely without tax. Present law already exempts up to $1.3 million \nfor family-owned businesses and farms.\n  We Democrats seek to substantially raise these exemptions so that \nnext year, no one pays the tax on the first two million dollars in \nvalue of any estate, and by 2010, no one pays the tax on the first four \nmillion dollars in value of any estate. The Democratic plan affords \nowners of small businesses and family farms double these exemptions, so \nthat couples who own a small business or family farm worth up to $8 \nmillion would pay no estate tax at all. If a business or farm is worth \nover $8 million, only the portion over $8 million in an estate is taxed \nunder the Democratic plan. The Democratic plan will eliminate all \nestate taxes for more than half of those who currently pay them. I \nstand with my Democratic colleagues in fully supporting this common \nsense approach to estate tax reform.\n\n  Estate tax repeal, however, is simply a boon for the three thousand \nlargest estates each year, valued not in millions, but in the tens of \nmillions of dollars. These huge estates are the only ones significantly \naffected by the estate tax.\n  Currently, over half of all estate taxes are paid by the top one \ntenth of the wealthiest one percent--estates worth more than $5 \nmillion. There are fewer than three thousand of these estates out of \nthe 2.3 million Americans who die each year. According to an analysis \nby the Citizens for Tax Justice, 91 percent of the tax benefits from \nrepeal of the estate tax would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers--\nwho have an average annual income of $837,000. As Treasury Secretary \nLawrence Summers has said, repealing the estate tax would qualify as \nthe most regressive and back-loaded tax legislation ever.\n  Republicans don't want to talk about who will really benefit from \nthis enormous tax cut. Instead, they talk about the plight of small \nfamily owned farms and businesses. What they don't tell you is that \nthese family owned small businesses and farms account for less than ten \npercent of estate taxes today.\n  We could act now--and we should--to help families keep their farms \nand businesses when the owner dies. This concern is legitimate--but it \ndoes not justify eliminating the entire estate tax. The estate tax \nproblem for small businesses and family farms could be solved at a \nfraction of the cost of the Republican bill. Our Democratic proposal \nprovides full relief to these families.\n  If helping owners of small farms and businesses were the Republicans' \nreal goal, they would join us to pass the Democratic estate tax reform \noverwhelmingly. After all, the Democratic plan exempts almost all \nowners of small businesses and farms immediately, while the Republican \nplan takes ten years before exempting anyone. Republicans obviously \nknow that giving immediate relief to family farms and small firms will \ntake away any pretext at all for the enormous windfall that they want \nto give the richest taxpayers. They know they can never explain the \nreal purpose of their estate tax repeal to the voters--so they are \nholding relief for small business owners and small farmers hostage to \ntheir unacceptable larger scheme for helping the super-rich.\n  The people whom the Republican leadership is really working for--but \nwhom they don't want to mention--are those few people who inherit the \n3,000 estates each year that are worth more than $5 million. These \nestates are one in every thousand estates--yet they pay over half of \nthe current estate tax. When pressed to explain why these estates need \nto have taxes eliminated entirely, Republicans respond vaguely in terms \nof ``fairness.'' They never explain why it is fairer to tax the earned \nincome of working families than the unearned inheritance of the \nwealthiest families in America. That is a fairness issue they never \nwant to talk about. There is nothing compassionately conservative about \nrepealing the estate tax.\n  Republican President Theodore Roosevelt thought the estate tax was \nfair when he proposed it a century ago. He believed then and we believe \ntoday that those who have the largest financial resources have an \nobligation to help provide for the basic needs of the less fortunate \nmembers of this community. Obviously, today's Republicans don't share \nTeddy Roosevelt's values.\n  The supporters of the Republican estate tax repeal have also \ncarefully designed it to conceal its real long-run cost. Under their \nscheme, full repeal\n\n[[Page S6778]]\n\nwould not occur until the year 2010. When fully phased in, the repeal \nwill cost over $50 billion a year. The cost of repealing the estate tax \nwill be nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars in the second ten \nyears. This nation cannot afford to devote three quarters of a trillion \ndollars to repealing the estate tax. The 98 percent of Americans who \nwould receive no tax relief from repeal of the estate tax know it is \nunfair to spend this vast amount on the wealthiest taxpayers.\n  Let's consider what $50 billion a year can accomplish for the \nAmerican people--if we don't repeal the estate tax. It is more than the \nentire budget for the Department of Education. We could double the \nfederal investment in schools--provide smaller classes with better \nteachers, state of the art computer technology for every classroom, and \nmodern school facilities across the nation. We could double the \nfinancial assistance for college students.\n  Consider what $50 billion a year could do for senior citizens. It is \n$10 billion more than is needed to fully fund prescription drug \ncoverage for all elderly Americans under Medicare.\n  We have a bipartisan congressional goal to double the funding for \nmedical research through the National Institutes of Health and improve \nthe health of our entire nation. Fifty billion dollars a year would \nallow us to virtually triple the NIH budget.\n  These are the most pressing needs of the American people--not repeal \nof the estate tax.\n  Astonishing as it may seem, I have heard my Republican colleagues \nstand on this floor and claim that the projected budget surplus enables \nus to easily afford their estate tax repeal. But by the time their law \nis fully effective in 2010, it will cost the Treasury over $50 billion \neach year, rising to $750 billion over ten years.\n  Repeal of the estate tax would also cost the country billions in \ncharitable contributions. A Treasury Department analysis estimates that \nit would cause charitable contributions to be reduced by $6 billion per \nyear. Colleges that rely on donations to build buildings and provide \nscholarships would be hurt. Medical schools that rely on donations to \nconduct medical research would be halted. Public Hospitals that rely on \ndonations to buy equipment and buildings would have to cut back on \ntheir ability to provide health care. Shelters that rely on donations \nto keep people warm and fed would have to turn more people away. Six \nbillion dollars is precious to the non-profit sector of this Nation.\n  The entire Department of Education will have budgeted $48 billion in \nfiscal year 2005. You don't hear Republicans saying we can easily \nafford to double education spending. Instead, during the recent debate \non the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, we repeatedly heard our \nRepublican colleagues say that they had to compromise among competing \nmeritorious priorities to fit within their limited budget. They have \nample money for the super-rich--but nothing for students in crumbling \nschools.\n  The same is true for prescription drugs. President Clinton's proposal \nwould cost about $40 billion in 2010, the year before Republicans want \nto begin giving over $50 billion each year in tax breaks to the \nwealthiest of all Americans.\n  I vote for prescription drugs over estate tax repeal. I vote for \neducation over estate tax repeal. I vote for medical research over \nestate tax repeal. This issue should not even be a close question for \n98 percent of Americans.\n  The Republican Party is living up to its reputation as the ``Let Them \nEat Cake'' Party.\n  What do they propose for senior citizens who desperately need \nprescription drugs? Republicans say, ``Let them eat cake.''\n  What do they propose for schools and students? Republicans say ``Let \nthem eat cake.''\n  What do they propose for workers struggling to survive on the minimum \nwage? Republicans say, ``Let them eat cake.''\n  What do they propose for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers? A $50 \nbillion annual windfall at the expense of America's hard-working \nfamilies.\n  I say, ``Let them eat cake'' will work no better for the Republican \nParty than it did for Marie Antoinette.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few brief follow-up \nremarks about the repeal of the unfair and unjust death tax. As I said \nbefore, it is the family farms and small business owners that the death \ntaxes particularly harm, not the rich, as our colleagues from the other \nside of aisle claim.\n  Mr. President, the death tax hurts average American workers as well. \nLet me give you another example of how this tax penalizes those \nworkers:\n  Hy-Vee, Inc., headquartered in Iowa, with operations in my state of \nMinnesota and 7 other Midwestern states, is one of the largest \nemployee-owned companies in the nation. Over the past half a century, \nthe employees and the management of Hy-Vee have built a very successful \nbusiness. It is ranked one of the top 15 supermarket chains in this \ncountry, and top 5 supermarket chains based on cleanliness, and other \nservices.\n  Through the company's profit-sharing mechanism, workers in Hy-Vee are \nrewarded for their hard work. Over 171 workers of the Hy-Vee company \nhave accumulated assets of over $650,000. These employees are not \nwealthy individuals by any means but average workers who work at the \ncheckout lines or at mid-level management.\n  However, a large portion of the earnings from their hard work can be \ntaken away by the government if we don't eliminate the death tax.\n  Ron Pearson, CEO of Hy-Vee, says: ``We believe that in many ways, \nemployee ownership represents the truest expression of the American \ndream. It is simply unfortunate that the dream also contains a \nnightmare--the estate tax.''\n  Mr. President, I believe Mr. Pearson is right. We must repeal the \ndeath tax to preserve the American dream for working Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article telling Hy-\nVee's story be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objections, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              Hy-Vee, Inc.\n\n                            (By Ron Pearson)\n\n       A strong case could be made that Hy-Vee, Inc., Iowa's \n     largest employer, represents the essence of American \n     capitalism.\n       Hy-Vee, headquartered in West Des Moines, is one of the \n     nation's largest employee-owned companies, ranking 32nd in \n     Forbes Magazine's list of the top private firms. With the \n     slogan, ``A Helpful Smile in Every Aisle,'' Hy-Vee, Inc. \n     operates more than 200 stores in seven Midwestern states, and \n     generates annual sales in excess of $3.5 billion--making it \n     one of the top 15 supermarket chains in the nation. In \n     addition to 184 Hy-Vee Food Stores, the Company operates 27 \n     Drug Town drug stores. Hy-Vee also has developed or acquired \n     several subsidiary companies to provide goods and services in \n     dairy, perishables, floral, grocery products, banking, \n     construction and advertising.\n       Hy-Vee was founded in 1930 by Charles Hyde and David \n     Vredenburg, who opened a small general store in Beaconsfield, \n     Iowa. Eight years later, the two men incorporated as Hyde & \n     Vredenburg, Inc., with 15 stores and 16 stockholders. The \n     name Hy-Vee is a contraction of the two founders' names.\n       From its very beginning, Hy-Vee has been employee-owned. \n     Profits are shared with employees through the Company's \n     Profit-Sharing Trust Fund, and a combination of bonus, \n     commission, and incentive systems. Every Hy-Vee employee, \n     from CEO Ron Pearson to produce clerks and truck drivers, is \n     included in the plan. The result is an incredibly loyal and \n     long-serving employee group renowned throughout the Midwest \n     for unflagging dedication to customer service, efficient \n     operation, and community involvement. Within the grocery \n     industry, Hy-Vee enjoys a sterling reputation as a retailing \n     innovator as well as a Company with a strong commitment to \n     high ethical standards and business integrity. Hy-Vee's food \n     safety training program, for example, has become a national \n     model of workplace procedures designed to insure freshness \n     and quality. Ron Pearson has served as co-chairman of a \n     national task force on diversity in the supermarket industry, \n     reflective of his Company's involvement in expanding \n     management opportunities for female and minority employees. \n     In 1997, Hy-Vee was ranked by Consumer Reports magazine as \n     one of the nation's top 5 supermarket chains on the basis of \n     cleanliness, courtesy, speed of checkout and price/value.\n       All in all, Hy-Vee represents the pinnacle of success not \n     only within the supermarket industry, but also as an \n     organization in which the individual employees are held to \n     the highest standards--and rewarded for their work. Some 171 \n     active employees of the Company have accumulated balances of \n     $650,000 or more in their retirement holdings and Hy-Vee \n     stock. These are store employees, mid-level managers and the \n     like, people who hardly fit the negative stereotype that most \n     Americans have of the wealthy. Yet it is these individuals--\n     and their families--whose life holdings are at risk because \n     of the federal estate tax.\n\n[[Page S6779]]\n\n       The estate tax was implemented early in the 20th Century as \n     a way to break up the incredible wealth that had concentrated \n     among a relatively small group of families. The tax has long \n     outlived its usefulness; in fact, the amount of estate taxes \n     collected each year doesn't even cover the cost of \n     collection. But it lives on, penalizing people like the \n     estate tax employees who have earned a secure future for \n     their families over a lifetime of hard work.\n       ``As an employee-owned company, we've had great success in \n     building a reputation for customer service, efficient \n     operations, and community involvement, in large part because \n     we're the owners,'' Pearson says. ``The federal estate tax \n     ends up penalizing employees who've built a retirement nest \n     egg through hard work and dedication.''\n       The estate tax places the philosophy underlying employee \n     ownership at risk. Hard work, after all, should have its own \n     rewards.\n       Still, Hy-Vee has no doubt that its formula works best--for \n     all concerned: its employees, certainly, but also its \n     customers and the communities it serves. ``We believe that in \n     many ways, employee ownership represents the truest \n     expression of the American dream,'' Pearson says. ``It is \n     simply unfortunate that the dream also contains a nightmare--\n     the estate tax.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about the \nestate tax repeal bill before the Senate.\n  Along with eight of my Democratic colleagues, I am a cosponsor of S. \n1128, the Kyl-Kerrey repeal bill. Barring the attachment of any \negregious amendments, I intend to vote for final passage of H.R. 8.\n  But while I am a cosponsor of S. 1128, I want to take a moment to \nvoice my concern about the debate we have had so far.\n  I believe there are two policy challenges before us.\n  First, Congress needs to ensure the vast majority of Americans--\nincluding those who do not own family business and farm assets--do not \nneed to worry about paying estate taxes or going through burdensome \nestate tax planning. Current law does a fairly good job in this area. \nIn fact, only two percent of estates actually pay an estate tax each \nyear.\n  The estate tax reform provisions we passed as part of the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997 helped take us further in the right direction. But \nthe prosperity we've had in the last seven years has threatened to push \nmore people in the direction of costly estate tax planning. In the \nspirit of a fairer tax code, Congress needs to take additional action.\n  The second policy challenge we face is more complex. That challenge \nis to ensure the tax code does not prevent the efficient transfer of \nfamily businesses and farms to the next generation. Unfortunately, in \nits current form, the estate tax can be a major hurdle to the efficient \ntransfer of family business and farm assets.\n  One of the arguments made for the estate tax is it deconcentrates \nwealth. The problem is family businesses--sometimes as the result of \nplanning for the estate tax or paying the estate tax--have been swept \nup by large corporations with no ties to the community. We need to \nrecognize changes in the economy have also changed the debate we should \nbe having on the estate tax.\n  I am a cosponsor of S. 1128 because I believe it is the only \nreasonable vehicle before us that addresses how we transfer family \nbusinesses and farms to the next generation. Unfortunately, estate tax \nrepeal is extremely expensive. And at the end of the day, I am still \nhopeful we can find another solution to the two policy challenges I \nhave outlined.\n  While I will vote to pass H.R. 8, I must express some disappointment \nwith the estate tax debate we've had in Congress. It's as if both sides \nhave dug in so deep with the same arguments for so long that we can't \nhave a thoughtful debate on the merits of the issue. The black and \nwhite choice is either to repeal the ``death'' tax or to oppose a tax \nbreak that will only benefit America's wealthiest citizens.\n  My friends in the majority could be proposing estate tax reform or \nrepeal in the context of a responsible, long-term fiscal plan. \nUnfortunately, they have chosen not to do so. It seems the extent of \nthe fiscal planning our majority colleagues have done is to note there \nwere 279 votes in the House for H.R. 8--enough to override an expected \nveto. I believe the American people deserve more thoughtful \ndeliberation.\n  Meanwhile, many Democrats and the Administration have been slower to \nreact to real and heartfelt concerns people have about the estate tax. \nH.R. 8 has been criticized by some of my colleagues as a bill that \nwould simply benefit the wealthiest estates. I can tell you that I have \nnot been contacted by the wealthiest individuals in my state. Rather, \nfor the last seven years, I have heard from family business and farm \nowners who are desperate to get a tax code that effectively allows them \nto transfer their operations to the children and grandchildren. They \nwant their Washington state businesses to remain Washington state \nbusinesses for many years to come.\n  Since I first began working on estate tax reform in 1995, my \ncommitment has been to provide estate tax relief to small family \nbusinesses and farmers. I believe the public interest on this issue is \nto continue to work--as I have done the last five years--to push \nforward with estate tax reform. Therefore, I supported the Democratic \nalternative and I will support H.R. 8. It is my sincere hope we can \nwork on a bipartisan basis to craft a compromise that President Clinton \nwill sign before the end of the year. And I hope the compromise will \ninclude estate tax relief for small businesses and farms in the next \nten years, which H.R. 8 does not do.\n  It is clear H.R. 8 will be vetoed, and likely Congress will sustain \nthe veto. But I'm glad we had the debate. Earlier this week, when we \nappeared deadlocked on the estate tax bill, I initiated a letter signed \nby all nine of the Democratic cosponsors of S. 1128. The letter urged \nthe majority leader to allow a reasonable number of Democratic \namendments on the estate tax bill.\n  Following my letter, I was pleased we were able to move forward with \na unanimous consent agreement to consider the estate tax bill. After \nthis debate, I hope we can move forward to consider the other pressing \nbusiness before us, including passage of permanent normal trade \nrelations for China.\n\n\n                       Carryover Basis Provisions\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Senator from California inquired of \nme about the intent of the amendment with regard to the carryover \nbasis. Let me assure the Senator from California that it is the intent \nof the sponsors that for estates over $100 million in size the \ncarryover basis provisions would not apply. Those estates would be able \nto benefit from the stepped-up basis provisions of current law. To the \nextent that my amendment is unclear on this matter, I would fight for \nchanges in Conference that would make that entirely clear.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for \nhis clarification. The point he makes is essential to me. If I had not \nhad the understanding with regard to the carryover basis that he has \njust indicated, I would not have supported the amendment.\n Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, we have worked hard over the last \n7 years to restore strength to our Nation's economy. We have turned \nrecord deficits into record surpluses. Today, we are about to make a \ndecision none of us could have imagined making in 1993. The question \nfacing us is: How should we spend the first significant portion of the \nsurplus?\n  Our Republican colleagues believe we should use the first major \nportion of the surplus to eliminate a tax that is paid by only the \nwealthiest 2 percent of Americans. They say the first, best use of the \nsurplus is to give people with estates worth more than $20 million a \n$10.5 million tax break.\n  The cost of their plan is $105 billion for the first 10 years. In the \nsecond 10 years, the cost balloons to $750 billion. Three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars in the second 10 years alone--to eliminate a tax paid \nonly by the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. The full cost of the \nRepublican estate tax cut would hit at the worst possible time: just as \nthe baby boomers are starting to retire. That is our Republican \ncolleagues' highest priority for the surplus: to help those who are \nalready benefitting most from this economy.\n  Democrats disagree. We support cutting the estate tax. We voted in \n1997 to do just that.\n  Today we are offering a plan to cut estate taxes even further. But \nour plan is different--in three very important ways--from the \nRepublican plan.\n  First, our plan helps family farmers and ranchers, and small-business \nowners, immediately.\n  The Republican plan does not remove one family-owned farm or ranch or\n\n[[Page S6780]]\n\nsmall business during the first 10 years. Not one.\n  Just as an aside, I must say I have been surprised, during this \ndebate, to hear so many of our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle expressing concern for family farmers and ranchers. In South \nDakota and all across this country, family farmers and ranchers are \nworking practically around the clock to scratch out a living. They are \nworking 12 hours a day, 7 days a week--not even making back their \nproduction costs, earning less than their parents and grandparents \nearned in the Depression.\n  Too many of them are being forced to sell farms and ranches that have \nbeen in their families for generations--not because they cannot pay \nestate taxes; their farms and ranches are not worth enough to owe any \nestate taxes. They are being forced out by the disastrous Federal \nagriculture policies put in place by a Republican Congress. I am \nrelieved to hear our colleagues acknowledge, finally, that family \nfarmers and ranchers need help from this Government. I hope they will \ncontinue to believe that when we move on to the agriculture \nappropriations bill next week.\n  That is the first difference between our plan to cut estate taxes and \nthe Republican plan: Our plan cuts estate taxes for family farmers and \nranchers immediately. Their plan does nothing for family farmers and \nranchers for the first 10 years.\n  The second major difference is, our plan costs less: $65 versus $105 \nbillion over the first 10 years. Our plan does not cost in the second \ndecade, as their plan does.\n  Our plan is simple and effective. For couples with assets of up to $4 \nmillion, we eliminate the estate tax entirely. We also eliminate the \nestate tax on all family farms, ranches, and businesses worth up to $8 \nmillion. Under our plan, only the wealthiest seven-tenths of 1 percent \nof estates and the wealthiest one-half of one percent of family-owned \nbusinesses would pay any estate taxes.\n  Let me say that again: Only the wealthiest seven-tenths of one \npercent of couples and the wealthiest one-half of one percent of \nbusinesses would pay any estate taxes under our proposal.\n  The third major difference between our plan and the Republican plan \nis: Our plan also helps the other 98 percent of Americans who do not \npay estate taxes. Because we target our estate tax relief, we are able \nto provide additional tax breaks to families, to help them with real, \npressing needs--like child care, paying for college, and caring for \nsick and aging relatives. Because we target our estate tax relief, we \nare able to provide a real Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Under our plan, someone who inherits an estate worth $20 million \nwould receive a tax cut of roughly $1 million. Our Republican \ncolleagues say that is not enough. They want to spend hundreds of \nbillions of dollars more than is in our plan, on far bigger tax cuts \nfor multimillionaires. That is their priority for the surplus: bigger \ntax cuts for the very wealthiest Americans--at the expense of everyone \nelse.\n  I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: before you cast \nthis vote, imagine sitting down at the kitchen table with parents who \nare wondering how they are going to pay for their children's college \neducation. Imagine sitting around a kitchen table with a middle-aged \nwoman who is wondering what will happen when her parents need long-term \ncare--where the money will come from. Imagine talking with a retired \ncouple who have cut back on necessities in order to pay for their \nprescriptions each month. How would you explain your vote to them? How \nwould you explain to them that eliminating a tax that affects only the \nwealthiest 2 percent of Americans is more important than helping them \ncare for their children, or their aging parents--or helping them with \nthe cost of their prescriptions?\n  What could you possibly say to convince them to sign onto a $750 \nbillion tax bill that won't help them one nickel, and will come due \njust as the baby boomers start to retire? For the life of me, I can't \nimagine.\n  A Nation's budget is full of moral implications. It tells what a \nsociety cares about and what it doesn't care about. It tells what our \nvalues are. There are better ways to spend the first major portion of \nthe surplus than by repealing a tax that affects only the wealthiest 2 \npercent of Americans. America's families have needs that are far more \nurgent. Those are the needs that should come first.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I supported final passage of the Death Tax \nElimination Act. I'm a cosponsor of similar legislation, and I've long \nbelieved that simply dying shouldn't be a taxable event. Death and \ntaxes may be inevitable, but they don't have to be simultaneous.\n  Because we've been willing to make some tough decisions over the last \nseven years, we now have the first budget surplus we've seen in this \nnation in a generation. We need to continue making those tough \ndecisions. We need to keep the prosperity going by investing in our \nschools and roads and paying down the debt. We need to strengthen \nSocial Security and modernize Medicare by adding a prescription drug \nbenefit. We need to bolster our nation's defenses, which includes \nimproving the quality of life for those who now serve in our military \nand honoring our commitment to provide health care for life for those \nwho've already served. And we need to provide targeted tax relief.\n  To address these many needs, we in Congress ought to establish our \npriorities first. I continue to believe that before we enact massive \nuntargeted tax cuts, we should make sure that Social Security is strong \nand that Medicare contains a prescription drug benefit. I voted today \nto phase out the estate tax because I'm committed to making sure that \nno one loses their farm or their small business because of the way we \ntax gifts and estates. We know this legislation we passed today will be \nvetoed. Once the bill is vetoed, I hope we can come to the table in a \nbipartisan way to address a few of our more pressing national \npriorities and construct a fair way to protect family farms and small \nbusinesses from having to be broken up or sold just to pay estate \ntaxes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. 8, the \nDeath Tax Elimination Act of 2000. The death tax, which is also known \nas the estate and gift or the transfer tax, is an unfair and \ncounterproductive burden on our economy, and it is past time Congress \nrepealed it.\n  Many of my colleagues who agree with me that this tax ought to be \nrepealed have made many persuasive arguments as to why. Rather than \nrepeat all of these excellent arguments, I would like to focus on just \none vital reason the death tax should be repealed: by hurting millions \nof closely-held businesses and farms, the death tax harms the economy \nand every American.\n  Mr. President, our colleagues from across the aisle have been quick \nto assert that only two percent of all estates are affected by the \nestate tax and that fewer than five percent of these estates are made \nup of farms and small businesses. These statistics are highly \nmisleading and conceal a very important point. Estates that actually \npay the estate tax represent only the tip of the iceberg of the total \nnumber of estates that are harmed by the tax. Let me explain.\n  Millions of individuals and the owners of millions of family-owned \nfarms, ranches, and closely-held businesses are potentially subject to \nthe estate tax, but the majority of them are able, with great effort \nand expense, to avoid the tax by complex tax planning or by selling the \nbusiness or farm. What are left are the two percent of death tax-paying \nestates my colleagues keep mentioning.\n  Every year, billions of dollars are spent in legal and tax planning \nfees and other costs so that estates may effectively avoid the death \ntax. A survey conducted by the National Association of Manufacturers \nlast month found that, over the past five years, more than 40 percent \nof respondents spent more than $100,000 on attorney and consultant \nfees, life insurance premiums, and other estate planning techniques. \nMore than half had spent over $25,000 in the past year. Despite this \nplanning, nearly one-third of the respondents believed the business \nwould have to be sold to pay the death tax if the owner died tomorrow.\n  Furthermore, thousands of businesses are prematurely sold each year \nin order to escape the death tax. Business owners are forced into \nselling their business when they have tangible\n\n[[Page S6781]]\n\nassets of significant value, such as land or business machinery, and \nyet have few liquid assets to pay an estate tax bill. Clearly, a great \nmany more taxpayers are affected by the estate tax than opponents of \nrepeal would have us believe.\n\n  Let me give you an example, Mr. President. Until late last year, Ken \nMacey was the chairman of his second-generation family-owned grocery \nbusiness based in Sandy, Utah. Ken's father had founded the business in \n1946, opening a tiny store called ``Sava Nickel'' in a renovated house \nin North Salt Lake. Relying on old-fashioned hard work and thrift and \nthe principle of treating customers and employees as they would want to \nbe treated, the Macey family built their business into an eight-store \nchain, with $200 million per year in revenues and 1,800 employees.\n  Mr. Macey tells me he would have liked to keep the business in the \nfamily. However, the long shadow of the death tax loomed. Even though \nMr. Macey had spent many thousands of dollars in professional fees for \nestate tax planning, he still believed his estate was vulnerable for \ntax rates of up to 60 percent. Rather than risk the trauma of a forced \nsale upon his death that could have been devastating to his children \nand the 1,800 employees and their families that depended on Macey's for \ntheir livelihood, Mr. Macey decided to sell his business to a larger \nfood store chain.\n  Although this story could have been much worse if some or all of \nMacey's employees has lost their jobs, it is a tragedy that a business \nfounded by this Utahn's father was forced to be sold outside the \nfamily. Macey's Inc. is another example of the millions of American \nfamily businesses that do not survive to the next generation.\n  Some of the same senators and congressmen--and our President--who \nhave decried the loss of family farms and family-owned small businesses \nand who have wondered aloud why large corporations seem to be taking \nover Main Street have totally ignored the estate tax as one major \nreason. Yet, many of these colleagues continue to argue that repealing \nthe death tax benefits only the wealthiest two percent.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses, only \nabout 30 percent of family farms and businesses survive to the second \ngeneration, and only about 4 percent survive a second-to-third \ngeneration transfer. No one can tell Mr. Macey or his children or \ngrandchildren that they are not the victims of an unfair death tax.\n  The point is that a huge amount of money, effort, and talent is \nwasted by millions of individuals and owners of family farms and \nbusinesses on activities designed to avoid the death tax. Most of these \nefforts are successful in the sense that the majority of these estates \navoid paying the tax. However, the cost to the economy in terms of lost \nproductivity, business disruption, and lost jobs is enormous.\n  A December 1998 study by the Joint Economic Committee concluded that \nthe death tax has reduced the stock of capital in the economy by almost \na half trillion dollars. By putting these resources to better use, as \nmany as 240,000 jobs could be created over a seven year period, \nresulting in an additional $24.4 billion in disposable personal income.\n  A study released last year by the Institute for Policy Innovation \n(IPI) estimated that the repeal of the estate tax would, over 10 years:\n  Increase annual gross domestic product by $137 billion.\n  Boost the nation's capital stock by $1.7 trillion.\n  Create 275,000 more jobs than would otherwise be created.\n  The IPI study also estimated that over the first decade following \nrepeal of the death tax, added growth from capital formation would \ngenerate offsetting federal revenues of 78 percent of the static \nrevenue loss. By 2010, these gains would totally offset the loss in \nrevenues.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues who oppose the repeal of the estate and \ngift tax would have the American people believe that this repeal would \nbenefit only a very few rich families in America. What a distortion of \nthe facts! All of us are hurt by a tax that drives millions of people \nto spend billions of dollars in largely effective, but economically \ndestructive, activities to avoid paying the death tax. When these \nefforts fail, jobs are often lost and dreams often die. All of us will \nbenefit by repealing the tax, through increased economic activity, more \njobs, more disposable income, and a fairer tax system.\n  Again, I commend Senator Roth and other supporters of this bill for \npointing out the many reasons it should be passed and passed \nexpeditiously.\n  I would like my friends and colleagues on the other side of this \nissue to remember that the estate and gift tax--the ``death tax''--is \nnot a tax on income. Income was already taxed. This is a tax on the \nAmerican dream. This is a tax on a way of life for many American \nfamilies and the accumulation of their hard work. This is a tax on \ntheir hope for the future, which often includes leaving something for \ntheir children and grandchildren.\n  We must repeal it, and the time is now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4810, which the clerk will report \nby title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4810) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to section 103(a)(1) of the concurrent resolution on the \n     budget for fiscal year 2001.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All after the enacting clause is stricken, and \nthe language of the Senate bill is inserted in lieu thereof.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we are now on the reconciliation bill \nauthorized by the budget resolution we adopted in the spring.\n  I would like to clarify for all Senators that nothing in the consent \nagreement covering the consideration\n\n[[Page S6782]]\n\nof this bill precludes Budget Act points of order being raised against \nany amendment offered. Those points of order could be raised at the \ntime of the votes on Monday night. I ask the Presiding Officer, is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, we will start with opening statements by \nmyself and the Democratic manager. Subsequent to that, we will open it \nup to amendments.\n  Mr. President, a little more than 3 months ago, I stood in this \nchamber to introduce the Marriage Tax Relief Act of 2000. At that time, \nI described that bill ``as the centerpiece of our efforts to reduce the \ntax overpayment by America's families.'' That is as it should be \nbecause families are the centerpiece of American society.\n  Three months ago, I urged my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax \nRelief Act because it ``delivered savings to virtually every married \ncouple in America--and it did so within the context of fiscal \ndiscipline and preserving the Social Security surplus.'' And that too, \nis as it should be, because if we act irresponsibly we are not giving \nrelief to America's families, but grief to America's children.\n  In the three months since I last spoke on this topic, we have \ndiscovered that American families' tax overpayment is even larger and \nour relief even more appropriate than we had imagined then.\n  Despite the enormous benefits that the Marriage Tax Relief Act of \n2000 would have brought to American families, we could never get the \nother side to agree to a procedure that would limit debate to relevant \namendments. The Majority Leader's offer to limit debate to marriage tax \nissues was rejected and cloture votes failed. The Senate moved on to \nother business.\n  But even as the Senate took up other important issues, we remained \ncommitted to delivering tax relief to America's families. We knew that \nthe American people would not be satisfied with us shrugging our \nshoulders and saying that we tried. We knew that the American people \nwould not be satisfied with us telling them that they'll have to wait \nfor comprehensive marriage tax relief because the other side blocked \nour first attempt.\n  And so we are back today. We have returned with ``The Marriage Tax \nRelief Reconciliation Act of 2000.'' Substantively, this bill is the \nsame as the one that we sought to pass a few months ago. But there is \none crucial difference between now and then. Today, we are proceeding \nunder the Budget Act's reconciliation procedure. And that means that no \none is going to delay us from passing this bill. We will have an up or \ndown vote. We will see who supports the marriage tax relief in our \nbill. And we will see who thinks that American families are not \nentitled to this relief.\n  Before I describe the specifics of our bill, I want to talk about how \nwe got here. Our tax system has chosen to use the family as the unit \nfor taxation. Unlike some other countries--where all individuals are \ntaxed separately--here in the United States, we look to the household. \nIn doing so, our tax system has tried to balance three disparate \ngoals--progressivity, equal treatment of married couples, and marriage \nneutrality. And, I will remind my colleagues, it is impossible to \nachieve all three principles at the same time.\n  The principle of progressivity holds that taxpayers with higher \nincomes should pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes. The \nprinciple of equal treatment holds that two married couples with the \nsame amount of income should pay the same level of tax. And \nthe principle of marriage neutrality holds that a couple's income tax \nbill should not depend on their marital status. The tax code should \nneither provide an incentive nor a disincentive for two people to get \nmarried.\n\n  Our policy response differs depending on how we balance these \ndifferent principles. For instance, if we want to ensure that when two \nsingles get married their total tax bill will not rise--but we do not \nmind if two married couples with the same overall income level are \ntreated differently, then we arrive at one result. However, if we want \nto make sure that two singles who marry do not face increased taxes--\nand we want to make sure that two married couples with the same income \nlevel are treated evenly--then we arrive at a different result.\n  Last year, the Senate position in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999 \nonly embraced the first policy result. We focused on what people refer \nto as the marriage tax penalty--in other words, the difference between \nwhat two spouses would pay in taxes if they were single versus what \nthey would pay in taxes if they were married. In developing the \nspecific provision, we took aim only at one particular definition of a \nmarriage tax relief penalty. We developed a system whereby a married \ncouple would have an option. The couple could continue to file a joint \nreturn using the existing schedule of married filing jointly. Or the \ncouple could choose to file a joint return using the separate schedules \nfor single taxpayers. It was straightforward, and it was universal--we \ndid not try to impose arbitrary income limits to cut off the relief.\n  As I said last year, the separate filing option had a lot of good \nthings about it. Most importantly, I liked the way that the plan \nbasically eliminated the marriage penalty for all taxpayers who \nsuffered from it.\n  It delivered relief to those in the lowest brackets as well as to \nthose in the highest brackets.\n  However we should also remember that last year's approach was part of \na larger package of tax relief. We should all remember this point: \nAmerica's families were going to receive relief from other provisions \nin that bill. Last year's marriage penalty provision was part of a \ncomprehensive tax bill directed towards American families. Other pieces \nof the bill--the cuts in the 15 percent rate bracket, the expansion of \nthe child care credit--provided additional benefits to American \nfamilies. So, the separate filing option should not be viewed in a \nvacuum; instead, it must be seen as part of a comprehensive tax relief \npackage. In any event, as we all know, none of the pieces of last \nyear's tax cut package--neither the marriage penalty relief nor \nanything else--made it into law. Because President Clinton vetoed that \nbill, America's families have been denied the tax relief that they \ndeserve.\n  This year I felt that we should take a different approach to marriage \ntax relief. As the Chairman of the Finance Committee, I am responsible \nfor developing tax policy in a fair and rational manner. I am also \nresponsible for working with members of my committee and of the full \nSenate.\n  After listening to my colleagues' views on marriage tax relief, I \ncame to the conclusion that the best approach this time is to build on \nthe foundation that Congress has already approved. Last year, in the \nconference report of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1999, Congress adopted \nthree components of marriage penalty relief. These included an \nexpansion of the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly; \na widening of the tax brackets; and an increase in the income phase-\nouts for the earned income credit. A different part of that bill \naddressed the minimum tax issue. Earlier this year, the House passed a \nmarriage penalty tax bill that included the first three components.\n\n  And so the Finance Committee bill, the Marriage Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2000, uses these same building blocks. This is \nimportant--not just for purposes of building and maintaining \nconsensus--but for policy reasons as well.\n  You see, if we target relief only at the families that suffer a \nmarriage penalty, we begin to violate another of the three principles \nthat I described earlier. Since 1948, our tax system has adhered to the \nprinciple of treating all married couples with the same amount of \nincome equally. In other words, each household that earns $80,000--\nregardless of the breakdown of that income--would pay the same amount \nof tax. It does not matter whether one spouse earns all $80,000 while \nthe other spouse works at home taking care of the children; and it does \nnot matter whether both spouses work outside the home and earn $40,000 \neach. Each household with the same amount of income is treated the same \nfor tax purposes.\n  As we studied how best to solve the marriage penalty--to ensure that \nthe tax code does not provide a disincentive to get married--we \nrealized that it was extremely important to stick to this principle of \nequal treatment. In solving one penalty, we don't want to\n\n[[Page S6783]]\n\nbe creating a new penalty--a new disincentive for America's families. \nWe did not think that the tax code should deliver a new, so-called \n``homemaker penalty''--where a family with only one wage earner is \ntreated worse than a family where both spouses work. This is what would \nhappen if we used a separate filing option. Many people have argued \nthat tax policy should not discourage one parent from staying at home \nand raising the family. It is a laudable goal and one that I strongly \nsupport.\n  Retention of the equal treatment principle is especially important in \na tax bill such as the one we have before us. Unlike last year's tax \nbill, this one does not include rate cuts or enhanced family tax \ncredits. All America's taxpaying families have contributed to the tax \noverpayment in Washington today. All these families, therefore, deserve \nto receive some of the benefits that we are seeking to return to the \nAmerican people. We should not pick out some married couples over \nothers.\n  We should not be picking winners and losers from America's families \nin some Washington game of musical chairs. And that is what we would do \nif we left out those families where one spouse works maintaining a home \nand a family. Under the proposal offered by Democrats in the Finance \nCommittee, over 17 million homemaker families would be left out of tax \nrelief. In my state of Delaware, over 30,000 homemaker families would \nbe left standing at the altar by the Democrats proposal.\n  Now let me take a few minutes and describe the provisions of our \nbill. First, we enlarge the standard deduction for married couples. \nUnder current law, for the year 2000, the standard deduction for a \nsingle taxpayer is $4,400. The standard deduction for a married couple \nfiling a joint return is $7,350. That means that for couples who use a \nstandard deduction--and those are generally low and middle income \ncouples--they are losing $1,450 in extra deductions each year. At a 28-\npercent tax rate, that lost deduction translates into an extra tax \nliability of $406 each and every year.\n  The Finance Committee bill increases the standard deduction for \nmarried couples so that it is twice the size of the standard deduction \nfor singles, and we do that immediately, in 2001. When fully effective, \nthis provision provides tax relief to approximately 25 million couples \nfiling joint returns, including more than 6 million returns filed by \nsenior citizens.\n  Increasing the standard deduction also has the added benefit of \nsimplifying the Tax Code. Approximately 3 million couples who currently \nitemize their deductions will realize the simplification benefits of \nusing the standard deduction.\n  Second, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 addresses \nthe cause of the greatest dollar amount of the marriage tax penalty--\nthe structure of the rate brackets. Under current law, the 15-percent \nrate bracket for single filers ends at taxable income of $26,250. The \n15-percent rate bracket for married couples filing jointly ends with \ntaxable income of $43,850, which one can see is less than twice the \nsingle rate bracket. In practical terms, that means that when two \nindividuals who each earn taxable income of $30,000 get married and \nfile a joint tax return, $8,650 of their income is taxed at the 28-\npercent rate rather than at the 15-percent rate that the income would \nhave been subject to if they had remained single. The extra tax \nliability for that couple each year comes out to $1,125.\n  The Finance Committee bill remedies that fundamental unfairness. The \nbill adjusts the end point of the 15-percent rate bracket for married \ncouples so that it is twice the sum of the end point of the bracket for \nsingle filers. Recognizing that the rate structure hurts all married \ncouples, the bill also adjusts the end points of the 28-percent rate \nbracket as well.\n  When fully effective, this provision will provide tax relief to \napproximately 21 million couples filing joint returns, including more \nthan 4 million returns filed by senior citizens.\n  Third, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 addresses \nthe biggest source of the marriage tax penalty for low income, working \nfamilies--the earned income credit. This complicated credit is \ndetermined by using a schedule for the number of qualifying children, \nand then multiplying the credit rate by the taxpayer's earned income up \nto a certain amount. The credit is phased out above certain income \nlevels. What that means is that two people who are each receiving the \nearned income credit as singles may lose all or some of their credit \nwhen they get married.\n  In order to address that problem, the Finance Committee bill \nincreases the beginning and ending points of the income levels of the \nphaseout of the credit for married couples filing a joint return. For a \ncouple with two or more qualifying children, this could mean as much as \n$526 in extra credit. This provision would also expand the number of \nmarried couples who would be eligible for the credit. It will help \nalmost 4 million families.\n\n  Fourth, the Marriage Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2000 tries to \nmake sure that families can continue to receive the family tax credits \nthat Congress has enacted over the past several years. Each year, an \nincreasing number of American families are finding that their family \ntax credits--such as the child credit and the Hope Scholarship \neducation credit--are being cut back or eliminated because of the \nalternative minimum tax. Last year, Congress made a small downpayment \non this problem, temporarily carving out these family tax credits from \nthe minimum tax calculations. This year, we are building on that \nbipartisan approach, by permanently extending the preservation of the \nfamily tax credits.\n  Because of this provision, millions of taxpayers will no longer face \nthe burden of making minimum tax calculations for the purpose of \ndetermining the family tax credits they need.\n  Finally, the committee included a provision to ensure that we \ncomplied with the Budget Act. Because we were not allowed to decrease \nrevenues outside of the period covered by the budget resolution--which \nis 5 years--the bill sunsets all of the provisions in the bill after \n2004. It goes without saying that I do not think it is good policy to \nsunset these tax benefits. They should be permanent and I expect that \nthey will be permanent when this bill is signed into law. Accordingly, \nI will propose an amendment to strike the sunset. I expect all of my \ncolleagues to join with me in supporting that amendment.\n  How much does this marriage tax penalty relief help? It helps a lot. \nOver 45 million families will get marriage tax relief under this \nlegislation. In my State of Delaware, over 100,000 families will \nbenefit. Every family earning over $10,000 per year will see their tax \nbill fall at least 1 percent--except those at high income levels. The \nkey to this legislation is that it helps the middle class. Sixty \npercent of this bill's tax relief goes to those families making \n$100,000 or less.\n  Who are these people? They are two married civil engineers, or a \npharmacist who is married to a school teacher. They are the policeman \nand his wife who runs a small gift shop in Dover. They are the \nfirefighter who is married to a social worker, or a librarian who is \nmarried to an accountant. These are the families who will benefit.\n  They will benefit even more, as you examine the impact this tax \nrelief will have over time. Consider the effect if these tax savings \nwere put away for their children's education and retirement. If a \ncouple with two children making just $30,000 took their tax savings \nfrom this bill and put it into an education savings account like the \none recently passed by the Senate, they would have $40,000 for those \nchildren's college education.\n  Based on the stock market's historical rate of return, that is \n$40,000 if they did not set aside another penny. If the family was that \nof two elementary school teachers with two children and earning average \nsalaries of $70,000 combined, they would have $65,000 after 18 years.\n  If those two married school teachers then started to put their tax \nsavings from this bill into a Roth IRA after 18 years, this same couple \nwould have $224,100 when they retired 27 years later.\n  By transforming these tax savings into personal savings, we see that \nthese real tax savings translate into real opportunities for these \nfamilies.\n  And consider the effect on the economy. According to an analysis by \nthe Heritage Foundation, in 2004 this marriage tax penalty relief \nlegislation will\n\n[[Page S6784]]\n\nresult in additional jobs. It will increase the personal savings rate \nby three-tenths of 1 percent, which in turn will lower interest rates. \nAccording to estimates done by the economists at the Heritage \nFoundation, the favorable economic impact of the tax relief would \nincrease overall disposable income by $45 billion in 2004. That means \nthat the average family of four would see an additional $670 in \nincome--just from the positive economic impact. So not only do married \nfamilies gain, not only do their children gain, but the entire country \ngains. They gain more jobs, better jobs, and higher wages because of \nthis marriage tax relief legislation.\n  The marriage tax relief legislation I bring to the floor today \namounts to just 3 percent of the total budget surplus over the next 5 \nyears. It amounts to just 10 percent of the non-Social Security surplus \nover the next 5 years. It amounts to just 42 percent of the new \nspending provided for in this year's budget over the next 5 years. \nFinally, it amounts to just one third of the tax cut that has been \nallotted to the Finance Committee for tax cuts over the next 5 years in \nthis year's budget. By any comparison or estimation, this marriage tax \npenalty relief is fiscally responsible.\n  This bill does all these things for America's working families while \npreserving every cent of Social Security's surplus. These tax cuts do \nnot have to pit America's families against America's seniors, nor does \nit extend a tax cut in a fiscally irresponsible manner. These tax cuts \nfit in this year's budget, along with the other Republican priorities \nthat we have already passed for education, health care, and small \nbusinesses. Our priorities add up to what's good for America, and our \nnumbers add up to what is fiscally responsible.\n  It is time we stopped playing the politics of division. We do not \nhave to pit one type of family against another type of family or \nfamilies against seniors to do what is right. It is time we divorce the \nmarriage penalty from the Tax Code once and for all. For too long \nWashington has been an unclaimed dependent in millions of America's \nfamilies. I urge all my colleagues to support the Marriage Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act of 2000.\n  Mr. President, the earned income credit, or EIC, is an important \nantipoverty tool. It gives an incentive for families to help \nthemselves. It provides low-income workers with a tax credit, thereby \nincreasing their real wages. It gives poor and middle-class families an \nextra incentive to help themselves. While the program is by no means \nperfect, it has been one of the more effective Government programs in \npushing families above the poverty line.\n  The structure of the EIC is the largest source of the marriage \npenalty for low-income families. Our bill addresses this inequity by \nincreasing the beginning and ending income phaseout levels of the \ncredit for married couples by $2,500. Our proposal goes to families, \njust as the original EIC program was intended to do.\n  Mr. President, I move to raise a point of order against section 4, \nfrom page 5, line 12, through page 7, line 3, of the bill, that it \nviolates section 313 of the Budget Act.\n  Mr. President, I furthermore move to waive all points of order under \nthe budget process arising from the earned-income credit component in \nthe Senate bill, the Moynihan substitute, the House companion bill, and \nany conference report thereon.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Democratic manager, Senator Moynihan, \nhas agreed to give his opening statement at a subsequent time. If it is \nagreeable to the Senator from Delaware, we have some people who are \nanxious to catch planes and do other things. They have very brief \nspeaking assignments, and they would like to offer some amendments at \nthis time.\n  Mr. ROTH. I think the Senator from Texas has been seeking the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished minority whip, \nare you proposing to go to amendments right away? The only issue is, I \nwant to make a statement on the bill of which I am a major cosponsor.\n  Mr. REID. We recognize the work you have done on this. Senator \nMoynihan has agreed to give his statement at a later time. I am told \nSenator Harkin wants to speak for 3 or 4 minutes, Senator Feingold for \n3 minutes, and Senator Kennedy for 5 minutes. They would like to leave \nafter that.\n  It is my understanding the Senator has a relatively long statement. \nIf they could offer their amendments, then we would be happy to have \nyou speak.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is satisfactory.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion \nto waive the Budget Act be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk and ask that \nit be stated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] moves to commit \n     the bill to the Committee on Finance with instructions that \n     the Committee report it back along with legislation that \n     would substantially extend the solvency of Social Security \n     and Medicare.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this debate, like the debate on the \nestate tax that it follows, allows the Senate to talk about priorities. \nYes, some sensible reforms are in order to eliminate the marriage \npenalty for middle-income Americans. But before we enact a major tax \nbill like this, we should consider whether the first and highest \npriority for using our surplus should not be extending the life of \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n  Yesterday, the Senate considered the Harkin-Feingold amendment that \nwould have extended the life of Social Security. Some did not like the \nway that Senator Harkin and I proposed to extend the life of Social \nSecurity. But few will deny that we should do something to keep Social \nSecurity and Medicare solvent.\n  As I noted yesterday, starting in 2015, the cost of Social Security \nbenefits is projected to exceed payroll tax revenues. Under current \nprojections, this annual cash deficit will grow so that by 2036, Social \nSecurity will pay out a trillion dollars more in benefits than it takes \nin in payroll taxes. By 2037, the Trust Fund will have consumed all of \nits assets.\n  Similarly, this year, the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is \ntaking in $21 billion more in income than it pays out in Medicare \nbenefits, and its Trustees project that it will continue to do so for \n17 years. But by 2025, they project that the Medicare Trust Fund will \nhave consumed all of its assets.\n  We as a Nation have made a promise to workers that Social Security \nand Medicare will be there for them when they retire. We should start \nplanning for that future.\n  The Social Security Trustees' actuarial report shows a Social \nSecurity trust fund shortfall of 1.89 percent of payroll. That is, to \nmaintain solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund for 75 years, we \nneed to take actions equivalent to raising payroll tax receipts by 1.89 \npercent of payroll or making equivalent cuts in benefits.\n  Thus, we can fix the Social Security program so that it will remain \nsolvent for 75 years if we make changes now in either taxes or benefits \nequivalent to less than 2 percent of our payroll taxes. But if we wait \nuntil 2037, we would need the equivalent of an increase in the payroll \ntax rate of 5.4 percentage points, to set the program right. The choice \nis clear: Small changes now or big changes later. That is why Social \nSecurity reform is important, and why it is important now.\n  And that's why President Clinton was right when in his 1998 State of \nthe Union Address, he said, ``What should we do with this projected \nsurplus? I have a simple four-word answer: Save Social Security \nfirst.''\n  Beginning in 1999, the government began to run surpluses in the non-\nSocial Security budget. If we continue current law and don't dissipate \nthese surpluses, they will continue into the\n\n[[Page S6785]]\n\n2020s or beyond, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. \nBut starting in 2015, Social Security will start redeeming the bonds \nthat it holds, and the non-Social Security budget will have to start \npaying for those bonds from non-Social Security surpluses. The bottom \nline is that starting in 2015, the government will have to show \nrestraint in the non-Social Security budget so that we can pay the \nSocial Security benefits that people have earned.\n  That is why it doesn't make sense to enact either tax cuts or \nspending measures that would spend the non-Social Security surplus \nbefore we've addressed Social Security and Medicare for the long run. \nBefore we enter into new obligations, we need to make sure that we have \nthe resources to meet the commitments we already have.\n\n  Indeed, not spending the surplus has a positive benefit for \naddressing Social Security and Medicare. The government is spending \n$224 billion this year just to pay the interest on the Federal debt. \nThat is 11.5 cents out of every tax dollar the government collects. If \nwe don't use the surplus for tax cuts or spending, but instead pay down \nthe debt, we reduce that annual interest cost. The President's latest \nbudget proposal calls for paying down the entire publicly-held debt by \n2012. Doing so would give us $224 billion a year more in resources than \nwe have now with which to address our Social Security and Medicare \nobligations.\n  The government is like a family with a mortgage on the house and \nyoung kids who will go to college in a few years. One way to prepare to \nbe able to afford those college costs is to pay down the mortgage now.\n  There are a variety of options for extending Social Security's \nsolvency. A broad choice of options exist for how we might get where we \nneed to go. Yesterday, we rejected one option. My motion simply says we \nshould choose some option to extend the life of Social Security and \nMedicare.\n  The marriage tax bill before us today would head in the opposite \ndirection. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the \ncommittee-reported bill would cost $56 billion over the first 5 years. \nAnd it would cost about $250 billion, if the sunset provision in this \nbill is not maintained.\n  This bill is just one in a long series of tax bills. It's no secret. \nThe majority leader has essentially said as much. The majority intends \nto pass--in one bill after another--a massive tax cut plan reminiscent \nof the early 1980s.\n  Both the Senate and House have already passed a number of costly tax \ncut bills this year. According to one estimate by the Republican staff \nof the Senate Budget Committee made in mid-June, the Senate or the \nHouse have already passed tax cuts costing about $440 billion over the \nnext 10 years. Slicing last year's vetoed tax bill into a series of \nsalami slices does not change their irresponsibility.\n  As well, it doesn't make sense to proceed on one expensive part of a \nlegislative agenda before knowing what the others are. Democrats \nsupport targeted marriage penalty relief.\n  It would be irresponsible to enact a tax cut of this size before \ndoing anything about Social Security and Medicare. Before the Senate \npasses major tax cuts like the one pending today, the Finance Committee \nshould consider the options for extending Social Security and Medicare. \nThe Senate should do first things first. And that's all that this \nmotion to recommit requires. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my motion be temporarily \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3845\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3845.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the adjustment to the rate brackets and to further \n                     adjust the standard deduction)\n\n       Beginning on page 2, line 5, strike all through page 5, \n     line 11, and insert:\n\n     SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF MARRIAGE PENALTY IN STANDARD \n                   DEDUCTION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 63(c) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to standard \n     deduction) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$5,000'' in subparagraph (A) and \n     inserting ``200 percent of the dollar amount in effect under \n     subparagraph (C) for the taxable year'';\n       (2) by striking ``$4,400'' in subparagraph (B) and \n     inserting ``$7,500'';\n       (3) by adding ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (B);\n       (4) by striking ``$3,000 in the case of'' and all that \n     follows in subparagraph (C) and inserting ``$4,750 in any \n     other case.''; and\n       (5) by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (b) Technical Amendments.--\n       (1) Section 63(c)(4) of such Code is amended by adding at \n     the end the following flush sentence:\n\n     ``The preceding sentence shall not apply to the amount \n     referred to in paragraph (2)(A).''.\n       (2) Section 63(c)(4)(B) of such Code is amended--\n       (A) by redesignating clause (ii) as clause (iii); and\n       (B) by striking clause (i) and inserting:\n       ``(i) `calendar year 2000' in the case of the dollar \n     amounts contained in paragraph (2),\n       ``(ii) `calendar year 1987' in the case of the dollar \n     amounts contained in paragraph (5)(A) or subsection (f), \n     and''.\n       (3) Subparagraph (B) of section 1(f )(6) of such Code is \n     amended by striking ``(other than with'' and all that follows \n     through ``shall be applied'' and inserting ``(other than with \n     respect to sections 63(c)(4) and 151(d)(4)(A)) shall be \n     applied''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2000.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the bill before us is a major tax bill. \nBecause the bill sunsets in 2004 to comply with the Senate's Byrd Rule, \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation's official estimate is that the bill \nwould cost $55.5 billion. And in the likely circumstance that Congress \nfails to sunset the bill, it would cost nearly $250 billion over 10 \nyears and $40 billion a year, or $400 billion a decade, when fully \nphased in.\n  In a matter of this importance, it is appropriate to consider where \nthe money goes. It is appropriate to consider whether we could make \nother, similar changes to the tax law that would benefit more \nAmericans.\n  This Senator believes that it is a priority to simplify taxes and \nfree people from paying income taxes altogether. My amendment would \naccomplish both of these goals by expanding the standard deduction.\n  The amendment would increase the standard deduction for individuals \nby $250, from $4,500 to $4,750. It would increase the standard \ndeduction for heads of households, as well, from $6,650 to $7,500. And \nit would maintain the underlying bill's policy of increasing the \nstandard deduction for married couples to twice that of an individual.\n  Seven in 10 taxpayers take the standard deduction instead of \nitemizing. My amendment would benefit all of those 7 out of 10 \ntaxpayers. It would reduce their taxable incomes by hundreds of dollars \nand thus make it so that many middle-income working Americans would not \nowe any income taxes at all.\n  Expanding the standard deduction would also make it worthwhile for \neven more Americans to use that easier method of calculating their tax \nand avoid the difficult and cumbersome itemization forms. It would thus \ntake one of the most concrete steps that we can take to simplify the \nunnecessarily complex income tax.\n  My amendment is paid for, so that the total cost of the bill would be \nexactly the same over 5 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the Chief \nof Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation certifying that fact be \nprinted in the Record at the close of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (see exhibit 1.)\n  The offset for my amendment is to strike the provision of the \nRepublican marriage penalty bill that benefits only taxpayers in the \ntop quarter of the income distribution. The tradeoff is clear: strike \nbenefits for the best-off quarter to fund tax-simplifying benefits for \n7 out of 10 taxpayers--overwhelmingly middle and lower-income \ntaxpayers.\n  Let me take a moment to explain how the Republican marriage penalty \nbill works and how it comes to have a provision that benefits only the \nbest off.\n\n[[Page S6786]]\n\n  The bill has three marriage penalty provisions. One would fix the \nmarriage penalty for lower- and middle-income working families getting \nthe EITC. The second would make the standard deduction for married \ncouples equal to two times the standard deduction for single taxpayers. \nBoth of these provisions benefit working families who have the hardest \ntime finding the money to pay taxes.\n  But a third provision in the Republican marriage penalty bill would \nreduce the rates at which income is taxed for some married couples. \nThis provision would, for married couples, increase the income level at \nwhich the 15 percent tax bracket ends and the 28 percent bracket \nbegins, and also increase the income level at which the 28 percent \nbracket ends and the 31 percent bracket begins.\n\n  Once fully in effect, the provision to expand the 15 percent and 28 \npercent tax brackets would cost more than $20 billion a year. It would \nthus account for most of the package's overall cost when fully phased \nin.\n  Here's how this costly provision would work. Right now, there are \nfive tax brackets. Married couples who make taxable incomes up to \n$43,850 pay tax at a rate of 15 percent of their taxable income. \nCouples who make between $43,850 and $105,950 pay 15 percent on their \nfirst $43,850 plus 28 percent on the amount over $43,850. A 31 percent \nbracket applies to income between $105,950 and $161,450. A 36 percent \nbracket applies to income between $161,450 and $288,350. And a 39.6 \npercent bracket applies to income above $288,350.\n  To address the marriage penalty, the Republican bill raises the cut-\noff points for the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets. But the \nRepublican bill would not raise the brackets for the 31, 36, and 39.6 \npercent brackets, leaving some marriage penalty to exist for those very \nwell-off groups. The Republican bill thus already acknowledges the \nprinciple in my amendment that there is some point at which tax cuts \nfor the best-off among us are not appropriate.\n  The way the Republican bill would work, the bracket expanding \nprovision would have absolutely no benefit for taxpayers with taxable \nincomes of up to $43,850. And it would benefit every married couple \nfiling jointly with incomes above $43,850. The portion of this \nprovision that would expand the 28 percent tax bracket would have \nabsolutely no benefit for taxpayers with taxable incomes of up to \n$105,950. And it would benefit every married couple filing jointly with \nincomes above $105,950.\n  As only the top quarter of taxpayers have incomes high enough to put \nthem in brackets higher than the 15 percent bracket, only those in the \ntop quarter of the income distribution would benefit from the \nprovision. By striking this provision, my amendment would thus make the \nmarriage penalty relief more targeted to those who need it most.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that for 2005, more \nthan 70 percent of the fully-implemented Republican bill's benefits \nwould go to tax filers with incomes above $75,000, and only 15 percent \nof the benefits would go to tax filers with incomes below $50,000.\n  Citizens for Tax Justice estimates that among married couples, those \nwith incomes above $75,000 would receive 68 percent of the benefits of \nthe Republican bill when it is fully phased in. They estimate that more \nthan 40 percent of the benefits would go to couples with incomes above \n$100,000. Only 15 percent of its benefits would go to the 45 percent of \nmarried couples with incomes below $50,000.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an analysis of the Republican bill by the \nCenter of Budget and Policy Priorities be printed at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  My amendment would better target the marriage-penalty relief in the \nRepublican bill. It would use the savings from doing so to simplify \ntaxes and to free middle- and lower-income Americans from paying income \ntaxes altogether. This amendment presents a clear choice, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 12, 2000.\n     Hon.

All provisions \n     would sunset after December 31, 2004.\n       You asked that we determine the maximum possible increase \n     in the single and head of household standard deductions \n     within the constraint of the revenue effect of the bill as \n     reported. Under this constraint, the standard deduction would \n     increase for singles from 4,500 to 4,750 and for heads of \n     household from 6,650 to 7,500 for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2000, and indexed thereafter.\n       The bill as amended would have the following effect on \n     Federal fiscal year budget receipts:\n\nFiscal years:                                                  Billions\n    2001..........................................................-$7.4\n    2002..........................................................-12.6\n    2003..........................................................-13.8\n    2004..........................................................-14.8\n    2005...........................................................-7.1\n    2006.........................................................(13's)\n    2007.........................................................(13's)\n    2008.........................................................(13's)\n    2009.........................................................(13's)\n    2010.........................................................(13's)\n    2001-10.......................................................-55.6\n\nNote: Details do not add to totals due to rounding.\n\n       I hope this information is helpful to you.

The \n     official cost assigned to the bill is considerably less--\n     $55.6 billion--because the legislation will be considered in \n     a form that provides the tax relief only through 2004, to \n     satisfy Senate rules. history shows, however, that \n     legislation of this type rarely is allowed to expire. As a \n     result, the full, permanent cost of the bill should be \n     considered the relevant benchmark.\n       Although two of the proposal's marriage penalty provisions \n     are focused on middle- or low-income families, the proposal \n     as a whole is poorly targeted and largely benefits couples \n     with higher incomes. The proposal's costliest provision, \n     which accounts for more than half of the package's overall \n     cost when all provisions are in full effect, benefits only \n     taxpayers in the top quarter of the income distribution. In \n     addition, the proposal would provide nearly two-fifths of its \n     benefits to families that already receive marrige bonuses.\n       Citizens for Tax Justice finds that only 15 percent of the \n     benefits of the Roth proposal would go to low- and middle-\n     income married couples with incomes below $50,000. This group \n     accounts for 45 percent of all married couples. By contrast, \n     the fewer than one-third of married couples that have incomes \n     exceeding $75,000 would receive more than two-thirds of the \n     bill's tax-cut benefits.\n       The Roth plan contains three principal provisions related \n     to marriage penalties. The most costly of these would reduce \n     the rates at which income is taxed for some married couples. \n     This provision would increase for married couples the income \n     level at which the 15 percent tax bracket ends and the 28 \n     percent bracket begins, and also increase the income level at \n     which the 28 percent bracket ends and the 31 percent bracket \n     begins. The second provision would raise the standard \n     deduction for married couples, setting it at twice the \n     standard deduction for single taxpayers. A third, much \n     smaller provision would increase the earned income tax credit \n     for certain low- and moderate-income married couples with \n     children.\n       A fourth provision relates to the alternative minimum tax \n     (AMT) and affects both married and single taxpayers' it is \n     not specifically designed to relieve marriage penalties. This \n     provision would permanently extend taxpayers' ability to use \n     personal tax credits, such as the child tax credit and \n     education credits, to offset tax liability under the \n     alternative minimum tax.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the Roth \n     proposal, without the sunset, would cost $248 billion over 10 \n     years. And the proposals long-term cost is substantially \n     higher than this. The bill's costly provision that would \n     extend the 15 percent and 28 percent tax brackets would not \n     take full\n\n[[Page S6787]]\n\n     effect until 2008; this slow phase-in markedly reduces the \n     bill's cost in the first 10 years. The Joint Tax Committee \n     estimate shows that when all of the plan's provisions are \n     fully in effect in 2008 through 2010, the bill would cost $40 \n     billion a year.\n       Once in full effect, the proposal to expand the 15 percent \n     and 28 percent tax bracket itself would cost more than $20 \n     billion a year. This provision would exclusively benefit \n     taxpayers in brackets higher than the current 15 percent \n     bracket; no other taxpayers would be touched by it. Since \n     only the top quarter of taxpayers are in brackets higher than \n     the 15 percent bracket, only those in the top quarter of the \n     income distribution would benefit from the provision.\n       The bill's tax reductions are not focused on married \n     families that face marriage penalties. Nearly as many \n     families receive marriage bonuses today as receive marriage \n     penalties, and the bill would reduce their taxes as well. The \n     proposal would confer tens of billions of dollars of \n     ``marriage penalty tax relief'' on millions of married \n     families that already receive marriage bonuses. In fact, only \n     about 40 percent of the $248 billion in tax cut benefits the \n     bill would provide over the next ten years would go for \n     reductions in marriage penalties. A similar proporition of \n     the tax cuts, about 38 percent would reduce the taxes of \n     families already receiving marriage bonuses. The remainder of \n     the benefits, including portions of the AMT change that would \n     go to taxpayers other than married couples, would neither \n     reduce penalties nor increase bonuses.\n\n\n             Senate Democratic and Administration Proposals\n\n       A marriage penalty relief plan that is more targeted on \n     middle-income families and modestly less expensive than the \n     Roth proposal is expected to be offered by Democrats on the \n     Senate floor. This Democratic alternative is identical to an \n     amendment offered by the Finance Committee Democrats during \n     the June 28th mark up of the Roth proposal. This plan would \n     allow married taxpayers with incomes below $150,000 to choose \n     whether to file jointly as a couple or to file a combined \n     return with each spouse taxed as a single filer. The long-\n     term cost of the Democratic alternative appears to be about \n     four-fifths of the long-term cost of the Roth plan. (This \n     provision ignores the cost of the AMT provision of the Roth \n     plan.)\n       The marriage penalty relief proposals contained in the \n     Administration fiscal year 2001 budget are significantly less \n     costly than either the Roth proposal or the Senate Democratic \n     alternative. These proposals, which are targeted on low- and \n     middle-income married filers who face marriage tax penalties, \n     would provide substantial marriage penalty relief at about \n     one-fourth the cost of the Roth plan. (This comparison, as \n     well, excludes the cost of the AMT provisions of the Roth \n     plan.) The marriage penalty proposals in the Administration \n     budget would cost a little more than $50 billion over 10 \n     years.\n\n\n                          budgetary realities\n\n       The budget surplus projections that the Administration \n     issued on June 26 show a projected non-Social Security \n     surplus under current law of nearly $1.9 trillion over 10 \n     years. While this may make it seem as though the proposed \n     marriage penalty relief could be afforded easily, caution \n     needs to be exercised. The surpluses actually available for \n     tax cuts and programs expansions are considerably smaller \n     than is commonly understood. Furthermore, there is a wide \n     range of priorities competing for the surplus dollars that \n     are available.\n       The projected surpluses include about $400 billion in \n     Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) trust fund surpluses that \n     the President, the House of Representatives, and the Senate \n     have agreed should not be used to fund tax cuts or program \n     increase. Excluding these Medicare HI surplues, the surpluses \n     available to fund tax cuts or program increases amount to \n     less than $1.5 trillion.\n       That baseline projection, however, does not reflect the \n     full costs of maintaining current policies. For instance, the \n     Administration's baseline projections of the cost of \n     discretionary, or annually appropriated, programs assume that \n     funding for these programs will be maintained at current \n     levels, adjusted only for inflation. The projections do not \n     include an adjustment for growth in the U.S. population, so \n     the projections assume that funding in discretionary programs \n     will fall in purchasing power on a per person basis. \n     Maintaining current service levels for discretionary programs \n     would entail that such spending be maintaining in purchasing \n     power on a per capita basis.\n       Certain legislation that is needed simply to maintain \n     current tax and entitlement policies and that is virtually \n     certain to be enacted also is not reflected in the surplus \n     projections, including legislation to extend an array of \n     expiring tax credits that Congress always extends, \n     legislation to prevent the Alternative Minimum Tax from \n     hitting millions of middle-class taxpayers and raising their \n     taxes, as will occur if the tax laws are not modified, and \n     legislation to provide farm price support payments to farmers \n     beyond those the Freedom to Farm Act provides, as Congress \n     has done each of the past two years. Assuming that \n     legislation in these areas will be enacted (as it is \n     virtually certain to be) and that the purchasing power of \n     discretionary programs will be maintained at current levels \n     on a per person basis reduces the available non-Social \n     Security, non-Medicare HI surpluses by approximately $600 \n     billion, to less than $900 billion over 10 years.\n       At least half of this $900 billion is likely to be needed \n     to facilitate reform of Social Security and Medicare that \n     will ensure the long-term solvency of those programs. Since \n     neither party is willing to close the long-term financing \n     gaps in these programs entirely or largely through slicing \n     benefits costs or increasing payroll taxes, a large infusion \n     of revenue from the non-Social Security part of the budget \n     will be necessary. Indeed, nearly all of the major Social \n     Security proposals offered by lawmakers of either party \n     entail the transfer of substantial sums from the non-Social \n     Security budget to the retirement system. Taking this reality \n     into account leaves about $400 billion over 10 years to pay \n     for tax cuts or other program initiatives.\n       Competing for those funds are other tax cuts, various \n     domestic priorities such as providing a Medicare prescription \n     drug benefit, reducing the number of uninsured Americans, \n     increasing investments in education and research, and \n     reducing child poverty, as well as proposals to raise defense \n     spending. The Senate Finance Committee marriage penalty \n     proposals would eat up more than three-fifths of this $400 \n     billion in a single bill.\n\n\n                roth plan favors higher-income taxpayers\n\n       The most expensive provision in the Roth bill would change \n     the tax brackets for married couples. It would raise for \n     couples both the income level at which the 15 percent bracket \n     ends and the 28 percent bracket begins, and the income level \n     at which the 28 percent bracket ends and the 31 percent \n     bracket begins. Joint Tax Committee estimates, show this \n     provision would cost nearly $123 billion over the next 10 \n     years even though it does not fully phase in until fiscal \n     year 2008. In the years between 2008 and 2010 it would \n     account for 54 percent of this plan.\n       Because this provision would raise the income level at \n     which the 15 percent and 28 percent brackets end for married \n     couples, it would benefit only those couples whose incomes \n     exceed the level at which the 15 percent bracket now ends. A \n     couple with two children would need to have income surpassing \n     $62,400 (in 2000 dollars) to benefit. Only one of every four \n     taxpayers, and one of every three married taxpayers, have \n     incomes that place the taxpayers above the point at which the \n     15 percent bracket currently ends.\n       Thus, when the provisions of the Roth plan are phased in \n     fully, more than half of its tax cuts would come from a \n     provision that exclusively benefits taxpayers in the top \n     quarter of the income distribution and married couples in the \n     top third of the distribution.\n       A second provision in the Roth bill would increase the \n     standard deduction for married couples. This approach focuses \n     its tax benefits on middle-income families. Most higher-\n     income families have sufficient expenses to itemize their \n     deduction and do not use the standard deduction. Most low-\n     income working families have no income tax liability and \n     would not benefit. If this provision were effective in 2000, \n     the standard deduction would increase by $1,450, which would \n     generate a $218 tax cut for most couples in the 15 percent \n     tax bracket. This provision would account for a little more \n     than one quarter (27 percent) of the plan's costs over the \n     first 10 years and one-fifth of the plan's annual costs when \n     all provisions of the plan are phased in fully.\n       The third provision of the Roth plan is an increase in the \n     amount of the earned income tax credit that certain married \n     couples with low earnings can receive. This is the one \n     provision of help to low-income married families. When all of \n     the provisions of the plan are phased in fully, the EITC \n     provision would represent four percent of the plan's \n     annual costs. (This provision would account for six \n     percent of the plan's costs over the first 10 years.)\n       Low-income married families can face marriage penalties \n     that arise from the structure of the Earned Income Tax \n     Credit. EITC marriage penalties occur when two people with \n     earnings marry and their combined higher income makes them \n     ineligible for the EITC or places them at a point in the EITC \n     ``phase-out range'' where they receive a smaller EITC than \n     one or both of them would get if they were still single.\n       The Roth proposal would reduce EITC marriage penalties by \n     increasing by $2,500 the income level at which the EITC for \n     married families begins to phase down, as well as the income \n     level at which married families cease to qualify for any EITC \n     benefits. For a husband and wife that each work full time at \n     the minimum wage, the Roth proposal would alleviate about 44 \n     percent of their marriage tax penalty.\n       The plan also contains a fourth provision that is not \n     directly targeted at relieving marriage penalties. This \n     measure would address some of the problems that will result \n     in significant numbers of middle-income families becoming \n     subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax in future years--a \n     situation never intended when the AMT was enacted--by \n     permanently allowing both non-refundable and refundable \n     personal tax credits to offset AMT tax liability. This \n     provision would account for one-quarter of the legislation's \n     total cost when all of the bill's provisions are fully \n     implemented.\n\n\n         roth plan targets benefits on higher-income taxpayers\n\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated the \n     distribution impact of this proposal on taxpayers in the \n     years 2001 through 2005. For 2005, the JCT found that more \n     than\n\n[[Page S6788]]\n\n     70 percent of the benefits of this tax proposal would go to \n     tax filers with incomes exceeding $75,000, while only 15 \n     percent of the benefits would go to tax filers with incomes \n     below $50,000. Moreover, these figures understate the extent \n     to which higher-income taxpayers would benefit, because the \n     costly bracket increases that benefit only the top quarter of \n     taxpayers would not be fully in effect until fiscal year \n     2008. The final year covered by the JCT estimate is 2005.\n       Some observers note that married taxpayers tend to have \n     higher incomes than other taxpayers, in part because there \n     often is more than one earner in the family. They point out \n     that looking at the distribution of benefits among all \n     taxpayers makes the distribution appear more skewed than it \n     is seen to be if just the effect on married taxpayers is \n     considered. This is not the case, however, with respect to \n     the Roth proposal.\n       An analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice shows that even \n     within the universe of married couples, the Roth plan \n     disproportionately benefits those married couples who are at \n     the upper end of the income spectrum. The Citizens for Tax \n     Justice analysis finds that among married couples, those with \n     incomes in excess of $75,000 would garner 68 percent of the \n     benefits of the Roth proposal when the plan is phased in \n     fully. Some 41 percent of the benefits would go to married \n     couples with incomes in excess of $100,000. Only 15 percent \n     of the benefits would go to those with incomes below $50,000. \n     (See Table 1.)\n\n TABLE 1.--EFFECTS OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF BILL\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                        Married couples\n                                   Number    Percent -------------------\n      Income group ($-000)        of joint  of joint             Percent\n                                   returns   returns   Average  of total\n                                    (000)              tax cut   tax cut\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6812-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     amendment no. 3858, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4391, which is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4391) to amend title 4 of the United States \n     Code to establish sourcing requirements for State and local \n     taxation of mobile telecommunication services.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am delighted to hail today the \npassage of the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act. This legislation \nis the product of more than three year's worth of negotiations between \nthe governors, cities, State tax and local tax authorities, and the \nwireless industry.\n  The legislation represents an historic agreement between State and \nlocal governments and the wireless industry to bring sanity to the \nmanner in which wireless telecommunications services are taxed.\n  For as long as we have had wireless telecommunications in this \ncountry, we have had a taxation system that is incredibly complex for \ncarriers and costly for consumers. Today, there are several different \nmethodologies that determine whether a taxing jurisdiction may tax a \nwireless call.\n\n[[Page S6813]]\n\n  If a call originates at a cell site located in a jurisdiction, it may \nimpose a tax. If a call originates at a switch in the jurisdiction, a \ntax may be imposed. If the billing address is in the jurisdiction, a \ntax can be imposed.\n  As a result, many different taxing authorities can tax the same \nwireless call. The farther you travel during a call, the greater the \nnumber of taxes that can be imposed upon it.\n  This system is simply not sustainable as wireless calls represent an \nincreasingly portion of the total number of calls made throughout the \nUnited States. To reduce the cost of making wireless calls, Senator \nDorgan and I introduced S. 1755, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing \nAct. The bill we pass today that we received from the House is \nsubstantively identical to our bill. While the current bill amends \ntitle 4 rather than title 47 and represents the drafting style of the \nHouse rather than the Senate, the legislation uses our language to \naccomplish our mutual goal.\n  The legislation would create a nationwide, uniform system for the \ntaxation of wireless calls. The only jurisdictions that would have the \nauthority to tax mobile calls would be the taxing authorities of the \ncustomer's place of primary use, which would essentially be the \ncustomer's home or office.\n  By creating this uniform system, Congress would be greatly \nsimplifying the taxation and billing of wireless calls. The wireless \nindustry would not have to keep track of multiple taxing laws for each \nwireless transaction. State and local taxing authorities would be \nrelieved of burdensome audit and oversight responsibilities without \nlosing the authority to tax wireless calls. And, most importantly, \nconsumers would see reduced wireless rates and fewer billing headaches.\n  The Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act is a win-win-win. It's a \nwin for industry, a win for government, and a win for consumers. I \nthank Senator Dorgan for working with me in crafting our bill. And I \nwould like to commend the House for sending the Senate the bill before \nus. And, most of all, I thank the groups outside of Congress for coming \ntogether and reaching agreement on this important issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous, consent that Senator Dorgan and I be \npermitted to enter into a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to ask the Senator from Kansas about the bill \ncurrently before the Senate, H.R. 4391, the Mobile Telecommunications \nSourcing Act, which passed the House unanimously on Tuesday. Is this \nbill similar to S. 1755, the Mobile Telecommunications Sourcing Act, \nlegislation that the Senator and I introduced last year that is \ncurrently on the Senate calendar?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The Senator from North Dakota is correct. H.R. 4391 is \nsubstantively identical to S. 1755, which the Senator and I introduced \nlast year, which is co-sponsored by every member of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, which was reported unanimously by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee to the Senate, and for which the Senate Commerce Committee \nfiled Senate Report No. 106-326.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How does H.R. 4391 differ from S. 1755?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. H.R. 4391 amends title 4 of the U.S. Code, whereas S. \n1755 amends title 47. H.R. 4391 reflects the drafting style of the \nHouse, whereas S. 1755 reflects the drafting style of the Senate. H.R. \n4391 deleted the findings incorporated in section 2 of S. 1755. H.R. \n4391 also changed the order in which the definitions appear in S. 1755. \nThere are no substantive differences between S. 1755 and H.R. 4391. \nTherefore, H.R. 4391 and S. 1755 are substantively identical.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4391) was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6813-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JULY 17, 2000\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, if I could alert the Senator from Delaware, \nwe just received a phone call that perhaps--we do not know yet--Senator \nKennedy may want to second degree an amendment offered by Senator \nAbraham. We would have the same agreement we had this morning. If the \nmajority decides they want to file their second degree, they would have \nthat right to do so, also.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is satisfactory.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when I entered the Chamber a few moments \nago, one of our colleagues was speaking, and he, as I best understood \nit, came out in favor of love, in favor of marriage, and in opposition \nto taxing death. And I thought to myself, that is an interesting bit of \ndebate.\n  But one has to look at the public policies being espoused by those \nwho are describing those positions to understand exactly how much they \nfavor love and marriage and exactly how much they want to do with \nrespect to our public laws and our Tax Code dealing with the taxing of \ndeath.\n  So I thought maybe I could just, for a couple minutes, comment on \nthat. And then I want to talk about the various tax penalties and about \nan amendment that I am going to offer today.\n  In the Wall Street Journal of today, there is an op-ed piece written \nby Mr. George Soros, one of the more noted American financiers. He is \nchairman of the Soros Fund Management. I have no idea what Mr. Soros is \nworth, but suffice it to say that Mr. Soros is one of the more \nsuccessful American entrepreneurs and financial gurus. He has made a \nsubstantial amount of money, and has been known as a very successful \nbusinessman. Here is what he writes in the Wall Street Journal of \ntoday. Mr. George Soros writes:\n\n       Supporters of repealing the estate tax say the legislation \n     would save family farms and businesses and lift a terrible \n     and unfair burden. I happen to be fortunate enough to be \n     eligible for the tax benefits of this legislation, and so I \n     wish I could convince myself to believe the proponents' \n     rhetoric. Unfortunately, it just isn't so. The truth is that \n     repealing the estate tax would give a huge tax windfall to \n     the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. It would provide an \n     average tax cut of\n\n[[Page S6814]]\n\n     more than $7 million to taxpayers who inherit estates worth \n     more than $10 million.\n\n  His last paragraph, in an op-ed piece I would commend to those who \nmight want to get the Wall Street Journal today:\n\n       So I say to the Republican leaders of Congress, thanks for \n     thinking of me--but no thanks. Please keep the estate tax in \n     place, and use the proceeds where it will really count: to \n     better the lives not of people who have already realized the \n     American dream but of people still seeking to achieve it.\n\n  That is from George Soros.\n  As you know, there was not a disagreement about whether to repeal the \nestate tax in a way that would protect the passage of family farms and \nsmall businesses from parents to children. There was no debate about \nthat.\n  We proposed a piece of legislation that would have provided up to $8 \nmillion of value in a family farm or a small business--neither of \nwhich, incidentally, would be very small if they reached that $8 \nmillion mark--but they could be passed without one penny of estate tax \nfrom parents to children.\n  We proposed repealing the estate tax on the transfer of almost all \nsmall businesses and family farms in this country. That is what we \nproposed. The other side said: No, that is not enough. What we want you \nto do is repeal the estate tax for the largest estates in America, \nthose worth hundreds of millions of dollars, those worth billions of \ndollars.\n  They said: No, we want to provide the 400 wealthiest families in \nAmerica, according to Forbes magazine, up to $250 billion in tax cuts, \nby removing the estate tax on the wealthiest estates in America.\n  Now comes one of America's preeminent financiers, who has made a fair \namount of that money, saying: Thanks, but no thanks. That would not be \na fair way to do it.\n  I think it is important, not only as we talk about the repeal of the \nestate tax, which we just had a significant debate on, and now talking \nabout the marriage tax penalty and trying to provide some relief there, \nto talk about who is going to benefit from these proposals. Who will \nbenefit?\n  Repealing the estate tax on the largest estates in this country--a \ncountry in which our economy has done so well and so many Americans \nhave done so well; a country in which one-half of the world's \nbillionaires live--repealing the estate tax burden on the largest \nestates worth hundreds of millions and billions of dollars, is \nobviously a tax break for the very wealthiest Americans.\n  Instead of using the money for that kind of tax relief, what about \nsome tax relief for the people who go to work every day and pay a \npayroll tax on minimum income? What about the folks who could use a \nmiddle-income tax cut by perhaps having a tax credit for the tuition \nthey are paying to send their kids to college? Or perhaps what about \nusing that money to reduce the Federal debt?\n  What about using that money to put a prescription drug benefit in the \nMedicare program?\n  There are a whole series of alternatives one might consider in \nevaluating how we might want to use this money. I come down in favor of \nusing some of it to reduce the Federal debt. What greater gift to \nAmerica's children than to reduce our Federal debt during good times. \nIf, during tough times, we run up the Federal debt because we must, \nthen during good times let's pay down the Federal debt. That should be \na priority use of funds that are available.\n  We had a debate this week about the estate tax. The majority party \nsaid: We demand that the estate tax be repealed in its entirety.\n  We said: No, what we think we should do is repeal the estate tax for \na modest amount of income, accumulation of income over the lifetime of \na family, and we proposed up to $4 million. That is more than modest \nand more than most families will ever see. We proposed an $8 million \nexemption for the passage of a small business and a family farm.\n  The majority party said: That is not enough. We insist on more \nrelief. We insist on relief for the biggest estates in America.\n  That is where we disagreed. That is why at the end of this we have a \nbill that passed the Senate that will certainly be vetoed by the \nPresident, and the veto will certainly be sustained by the Senate.\n  Now the question is the marriage tax penalty. There is no \ndisagreement in this Chamber about the marriage tax penalty. We should \neliminate it. Let me give an example of what is done with the marriage \ntax penalty. This is very simple, but it illustrates the problem.\n  A husband and wife making $35,000 each have a combined income of \n$70,000. In the present circumstance, if they filed as single taxpayers \nand they were unmarried, they would pay about $8,407 combined in income \ntaxes. But because they are married and file a joint return, they pay \n$9,532. Therefore, because they are married, these two individuals pay \nabout $1,125 more in taxes. That is called the marriage penalty. We \nshould eliminate that, of course. Let's do that.\n  The majority party has offered a piece of legislation that in this \ncircumstance would give $443 worth of relief. The couple had a $1,125 \npenalty, and they only give $443 in relief. We have offered a proposal \nthat says let's eliminate the marriage tax penalty simply, effectively, \nand completely.\n  How would we do that? We would say to these people: File your income \nreturn as you choose, as married filing jointly or as individuals. You \nchoose. You can file separately or jointly.\n  It will eliminate all of the marriage tax penalty. That is what we \npropose.\n  If I might use one additional chart that shows the difference, we \nallow all married couples to file separately or jointly. They make the \ndecision. They can make the decision that would abolish any marriage \ntax penalty that exists in their circumstance. That is not true of the \nplan offered by the majority. If we eliminate all marriage penalty \ntaxes for taxpayers earning $100,000 or less, if we reduce all \npenalties from $100,000 to $150,000; why don't we do it all the way up \nto people who are making $10 million or $20 million?\n  The reason is this distribution chart. As is the case with the estate \ntax repeal and now with the marriage tax penalty, most of the benefit \nof this proposal will go to a very small percent of the taxpayers. \nNearly 80 percent of the benefit of the majority party's proposal to \nreduce the marriage tax penalty will accrue to the top 20 percent of \ntaxpayers, and the bottom 80 percent of the taxpayers will get less \nthan one-fourth of the benefit. That is the problem, once again.\n  I think there is substantial agreement in this Chamber about goals. \nIf our goal is to eliminate the estate tax for the passage of small \nbusinesses and family farms, let's do that. We can do that together. We \nhave proposed that. Join us. Don't continue to insist that we eliminate \nthe estates tax for the largest estates in the country. There is a \nbetter use for those revenues.\n  If the proposition is, let's eliminate the marriage tax penalty, we \nsay fine. Join us. Do it the simple way. Allow people to file either as \nindividuals, separately, or as married couples filing jointly. Their \nchoice. That will eliminate all of the marriage tax penalty.\n  The majority plan only eliminates about three categories of marriage \ntax penalty when, in fact, there are more than 60. We say, on these \nissues, while we philosophically agree on part of them, let's join \ntogether and do this.\n  Of course, what we have discovered is there are some who would much \nprefer to have a political issue than to have legislation passed. The \nresult is, they want to send it to the White House and have the \nPresident veto it.\n  We could have had at the end of this week a very substantial \nexemption of the estate tax so that almost no small business or family \nfarm would ever have been ensnared in the web of the estate tax. Why \naren't we doing that? Because the majority party insisted on passing a \ncomplete repeal of the estate tax which was going to cost a substantial \namount of money in a manner that would give the largest estates the \nbiggest tax benefit. That is not fair and not the right thing to do.\n  I hope as we finish this reconciliation bill and move to other \nappropriations bills and also deal now in July, and especially \nSeptember and October, with a range of these issues, that we find a way \nto pass legislation that represents the best of what both political \nparties have to offer. Instead of getting the best of both, we often \nget the worst of each because there is so much energy fighting each \nother's proposals that we\n\n[[Page S6815]]\n\nforget that there is philosophical agreement.\n  Yes, there is a marriage tax penalty. Yes, we ought to take action to \nremove it and eliminate it. There is no reason at all that we couldn't \ndo it together. There is more common interest here than most people \nthink. I hope in the coming weeks we can find ways that we can bridge \nthe gap across the political aisle in the Senate and send the President \nsome good legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3877\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I will explain what this amendment is.\n  If on the floor of the Senate we are discussing a reconciliation bill \nthat carries reductions in taxation, especially, in this circumstance, \nthe elimination of the marriage tax penalty, I want to have considered \nseveral other pieces of tax law that I think are long overdue for \nconsideration. This particular amendment combines four ideas.\n  One, we have a current problem with virtually all farmers in this \ncountry who are receiving income from their conservation reserve \nprogram acres. The Internal Revenue Service has now decided that income \nis from self-employment and therefore subject to self-employment tax. \nThat is one of the goofiest interpretations of tax law I have ever \nheard, but nonetheless that is the IRS's position. They have the \nopportunity to make it stick unless we tell them that is not what we \nintended; that is not the way the law ought to be read. That is not the \nway Congress intended it, so we will legislate to tell the IRS how they \nought to view this issue.\n  It is clear that the conservation reserve program, for which the \nFederal Government gives payments to farmers for the retirement of \ncertain acreage into conservation, is not self-employment income and \ntherefore subject to self-employment taxes. Yet that is exactly the way \nthe IRS has ruled. All farmers across this country are going to get \ncaught in this web. We must fix it. That is one provision.\n  The second is a provision that applies to expensing opportunities for \nsmall business. Under current law, small businesses can generally \nexpense or immediately deduct up to $20,000 of the cost of equipment \nand other items. This maximum amount will increase to $25,000 over the \nnext several years. I propose that we allow, under those expensing \nprovisions, opportunities for small businesses to fix up their \nstorefronts on Main Streets. Many of our small towns desperately need \nreinvestment in the storefronts on Main Street. They are 50, 60, 70 \nyears old. Yet when they do that these days, small businesses find they \nmust depreciate the costs of those investments over 39 years for tax \npurposes. They ought to be able to expense that under the expensing \nprovisions. My proposal would allow that to happen.\n  The third proposal in this amendment fixes a problem with the issue \nof capital gains exclusions. If you are in a town someplace and you \nsell a home, you know there is an exclusion of up to $500,000 on all \ncapital gains on the sale of that home. If you go out of town 15 miles \nand run a family farm someplace, your house has zero value except that \nvalue to which it inures to the farm you are farming. So if you sell \nthat house, you sell it for almost nothing. The only value that home \nhas is the ability for somebody to live in that home and operate farm \nequipment around that farmstead.\n  The fact is, when farmers sell their home and their home quarter, \nthey are not able to take advantage of the capital gains exclusion that \nthe folks in town are taking advantage of when they sell their home. I \nwould fix that in this legislation, as well, to give farmers that \nopportunity.\n\n  Fourth, my amendment provides for the full deductibility immediately \nof\n\n[[Page S6816]]\n\nhealth insurance costs for the self-employed. There is no excuse in \nthis country to have a business on one side of Main Street be able to \ndeduct only a fraction of their health insurance costs as a business \nexpense and a corporation across the street that can deduct 100 percent \nof that as a business expense. That is not fair. Both parties have been \nworking to try to bridge that gap. All of us have talked about that--\nRepublicans and Democrats--for some long while. We are making progress \nin closing the gap. Well, let's not just make progress, let's just \nclose it and say self-employed will be treated exactly the same as \nlarge corporations. If you have health insurance costs for your \nemployees in a business, it is a business expense and it ought to be \nfully deductible, and it ought to be fully deductible right now.\n  Those are the four provisions I have offered to this reconciliation \nbill, and I hope for its consideration next week.\n  As I conclude, we are not talking about tax issues. We have, \naccording to economists, some good years ahead of us. The best \neconomists in this country can't see beyond a few months. God bless \nthem, and I don't mean to speak ill of them when I talk about \neconomists this way. As I have said, I actually taught economics for a \ncouple of years in college, but I was able to overcome that experience \nand go on to other things.\n  Economists can't see very far into the future. They just can't. Adam \nSmith, one of the great economists, of course, in modern history, they \nsay, used to get lost walking home; he could not find his home. God \nbless his memory as well. We are told now by economists today--the best \nin the country--that the next 10 years is likely to bring unprecedented \neconomic growth, with 10 years of surpluses. I don't have any idea \nwhether that will be the case. I hope it is. It would be terrific. But \nI don't know, nor do economists.\n  The year before the last recession in this country, 35 of the 40 \nleading economists predicted the next year would be a year of continued \neconomic growth. So 35 of the 40 leading economists had no idea what \nwould happen in the next year. The same is true with respect to the \nfuture that we now discuss. We don't know what is going to happen. If \nwe are fortunate enough to have continued, recurring budget surpluses, \nthen we ought to begin this discussion about tax reductions. Yes, I \nthink there is room for some tax cuts, but the question is, What kind \nand who benefits from them?\n  We ought to begin the discussion about tax cuts relative to other \nissues: Reducing the Federal debt, providing a prescription drug \nprogram under Medicare, and a range of other needs in this country, \nincluding our investment in education, which represents our real \nfuture. We can do all of these things this month and in September and \nin the first half of October, before this Congress finishes its work.\n  I think, in many ways, there are more common interests among Members \nof the Senate than most people realize. We can accomplish a lot of \nthings together, and we ought to do more of that in the coming months. \nI hope to work on this range of issues. We are talking about the estate \ntax and the marriage tax penalty which, combined in the second 10 \nyears, cost about $1 trillion in lost revenue. We have to evaluate this \nrelative to other needs and interests--the needs, especially, of \nworking families. It is true that we have had a wonderful economy and a \nrobust bit of economic growth. But it is also true that some people \nhave not benefited so much in this economy. We need to worry about them \nas well.\n  Having said all of that, I look forward to the coming several months. \nI know this is an election year, a political year. But this country has \nmuch to be thankful for, and there is much to be gained by having an \naggressive, robust debate about the future, the projected surplus, \nabout our tax system, the needs in the Medicare program, prescription \ndrug prices, and a whole range of issues that are important to most \nfamilies.\n\n  When they sit around their supper tables in this country, families \nare asking these basic questions: What kind of a job do I have? What \nkind of income do I get paid? Do I have security in my job? What kind \nof health care do I have for my kids? Do my parents get adequate health \ncare? Do we live in a safe neighborhood? What about the issue of crime? \nAll of those issues are important. Do we send our kids to a good \nschool? When our kids walk through the door of the school, are we proud \nof the classroom and the teachers? Are we committing enough resources \nto make sure the kids are getting the best education they can get?\n  Those are the issues that people are concerned about and that ought \nto be the center of our discussion in the coming 3 and a half or 4 \nmonths, before America makes political choices once again in this \nelection.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will soon send two amendments to the desk \non behalf of Senator Wellstone.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments this \nafternoon to explain why I opposed the Republican proposal to repeal \nthe Federal estate tax and why I supported the alternative Democratic \nproposal to provide relief in the estate tax for those who, in any \njudgment, need it the most, that is, small businesses, family farms, \nand those who are more modestly situated than those who would receive \nthe most of the relief under the Republican proposal.\n  The current estate tax was first enacted by Congress in 1916, partly \nat the behest of President Teddy Roosevelt. Teddy Roosevelt was right; \nit is appropriate for there to be an estate tax on those who prosper so \ngreatly in the American economic system in order to provide some \nassistance to those who have worked hard but have fallen behind and in \norder also to do some things we must do in order to improve our society \nand our communities. That is the basic tenet of a progressive system of \ntaxation.\n  I think President Teddy Roosevelt was also correct that the tax \nshould not be designed in such a way as to discourage people from \nseeing to it that their children are more secure but, rather, it should \nbe aimed at immense fortunes which have been created.\n  That is why I supported the Democratic proposal to reform the estate \ntax to provide prompt relief to small business owners and farmers \nrather than voting for the Republican proposal which would have \nrepealed it more slowly over the next 10 years but then would have \ntotally repealed it for even the greatest portion.\n\n  The Democratic proposal targets tax relief to persons with estates, \nsmall businesses, and family farms of up to $8 million. By increasing \nthe exemption for qualified family-owned business interests from its \ncurrent level of $2.6 million per couple to $4 million per couple in \n2001 and $8 million per couple in 2009, the Democratic alternative \nprovides significant immediate relief and then removes altogether the \ntax for the vast majority of the 2 percent of family farms and small \nbusinesses that are currently subject to the tax.\n  In contrast, the Republican plan removes no one from the estate tax \nburden totally for another 10 years but then removes even the largest \nestate completely at huge costs to the Treasury.\n  In addition to providing relief immediately, the Democratic proposal \ndoes so at a more reasonable cost--$64 billion over 10 years--compared \nto $105 billion for the Republican repeal. This $40 billion difference \ncan and should go to other important national priorities, such as a \nprescription drug benefit for Medicare, making a college education more \naffordable, extending Medicare solvency, or reducing the national debt.\n  The Republican repeal would cost much more than that because in the \nsecond 10 years--from 2011 to 2020, the same decade in which the baby \nboomers begin to retire and place strains on the Medicare system and on \nSocial Security--the repeal is estimated to cost up to $750 billion.\n  That is what these two charts show. There is a significant revenue \nloss from the Republican repeal, starting in 2010 at the rate of about \n$23 billion a year, going up to $53 billion a year in 2015, and then \n$66 billion a year in 2020, $82 billion in 2025, and so forth.\n  That kind of severe strain on the Treasury begins in about the year \n2010--that is, at the same time when there is a great demand on the \nTreasury to make payments to Social Security. Until about 2012, Social \nSecurity is in surplus. But then in about 2012, Social Security takes \nin less than it is paying out, and the Treasury from the general fund \nmust begin to pay back to Social Security a part of the debt which has \nbeen built up for Social Security. Those payments significantly \nincrease, starting in the near 2015 from $12 billion a year, to $183 \nbillion in 2020, to $416 billion a year in 2025, and so forth.\n  That is one of the major problems with the estate tax proposal the \nRepublican majority offered--that the drain it is going to place on the \nTreasury, the loss to the Treasury, begins to hit severely at precisely \nthe same time, or at least approximately the same time, as there is a \nsignificant shortfall for Social Security and when payments must be \npaid from the Treasury to Social Security if we are going to keep our \npromise to those who retire in those years.\n  I believe taxes should be distributed fairly among all Americans. To \ngive a huge tax cut to the wealthiest among us at the expense of \nimportant national priorities for the rest of us, at the risk of not \nbeing able to pay what is required to Social Security recipients, what \nis committed to be paid to them, and what was promised to be paid to \nthe recipients of Social Security starting in the years 2012 and \nbeyond, is a serious mistake. It is simply wrong.\n  I believe the Democratic estate tax reform plan is consistent with \nnational priorities and is consistent with keeping our commitments to \nSocial Security. The alternative Republican plan puts those commitments \nat risk and puts those priorities at risk. That is why I thought the \nDemocratic plan was fairer to our taxpayers and fairer to this Nation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to share a few thoughts on \nthe marriage penalty tax and why I believe it is long past time to \nremove that tax from our body politic.\n  I would also like to share a few thoughts on my excitement and thrill \nabout seeing the vote earlier today in\n\n[[Page S6818]]\n\nwhich we joined the overwhelming vote of the House of Representatives \nin eliminating the death tax. I believe it is a tax that causes an \nextraordinary burden on the American economy. It disrupts the small, \nclosely-held businesses in America. It actually impedes smaller, \ngrowing, profitable businesses that are reaching the levels to compete \nwith a Wal-Mart, or a Home Depot, or a Car Quest store--the companies \nthat are doing so well locally. Then 10, 15, or 20 years down the road, \nbam, the leading stockholder dies and the corporation owes $6 million, \n$8 million, $10 million, $12 million, or $30 million in estate taxes. \nThey either have to sell off their corporation, go into debt, or do \nwhatever to pay it. People do not understand it.\n  If you start an auto parts store chain, and I know of an example of \nthis, and build up to 27 stores, and the senior man who owns the \nbusiness dies, they evaluate every single store, every part on every \ncounter in those stores as if it is for sale. Say it is worth $50 \nmillion and the family has been investing, every day, all of the \nprofits, basically in expanding the business, and the tax they owe, 55 \npercent, is on the entire value of the corporation? So where do they \nget the money?\n  What I know happened in a company as I am describing, the family \nfaced a major decision. What did they decide to do? They sold out to \nCar Quest, a national corporation. There is nothing wrong with it, it \nis a fine company, but instead of being a competitor to Car Quest and \nAuto Zone and the other big dealers, they were out of business. The \ncustomers lost. The hometown distribution center in Alabama, where that \ncompany was, closed down and they had the Car Quest distribution center \nin another part of the State.\n  We are chopping off the heads of growing, vibrant corporations, just \nas they get to the point to compete with the big multinational and \nnational corporations worth billions of dollars. We ought not to be \ndoing that. It is not good public policy. It brings in very little \nmoney. I don't think we ought to be afraid about projections of how \nmuch it would cost. It is certainly not going to cost much in the next \n10 years. At the rate of growth of this economy, we will be more than \nable to pay for it, and these numbers do not include the strength and \naid the elimination of this tax will give to the American economy.\n  But the power to tax is a major power of our National Government. \nWhen you take money from individual American citizens, you take their \nwealth from them, as we do in the Government every day when we collect \ntaxes. We take their autonomy, their freedom, their independence, and \ntheir power over the things they have earned. It is a diminishment of \nthe strength and independence and autonomy of a citizen, when you \nincrease taxes. It is an increase in the power, the strength, the \ndomination of the Government who takes that tax.\n  When we have a time in this Nation that we are growing and vibrant \nand we have some extra money coming in, we have a choice. Are we going \nto keep taking that money or are we going to allow it to go back to the \nAmerican people? I have seen the studies from the Office of Management \nand Budget that show, as a percentage of the total gross domestic \nproduct, the Government is taking more money today than at any time \nsince the height of World War II. In 1992, when President Clinton took \noffice, the percentage of the gross domestic product, the total of all \ngoods and services produced in our Nation going to the Federal \nGovernment, was 17.6 percent. It is now hitting about 20.9 percent, the \nlargest in history since the peak of World War II when we had a life-\nand-death struggle going on in the world.\n  I am, first of all, a supporter of tax cuts because I believe they \nrestore and move us in the direction we ought to head, and that is our \nheritage as Americans. I spent some time recently in Europe. We were \nstunned to find the Europeans are paying, on average, 67 percent of \ntheir income to the government. Their economies are not nearly what \nours is. We have much lower unemployment. The highest growth rate in \ngross domestic product in the world last year, among industrial \nnations, was the United States.\n  I remember reading an article in USA Today, and they interviewed \nthree businessmen--one each from Germany, Japan, and England. They \nasked them why our economy was better than theirs. They said \nunanimously it is because the United States had less taxes, less \nregulation, and a greater commitment to the free market.\n\n  I asked Chairman Alan Greenspan, the architect, many say, of this \ngrowth economy we are in, did he agree with that. He immediately looked \nup at me and he said: I absolutely agree with that.\n  So my concern, my drive, is not to try to see if I can get votes by \npromising people we are going to reduce their taxes. What I want to see \nis our Nation establish its heritage of private sector development and \ngrowth that is allowing us to lead the world, without doubt, \neconomically, industrially, environmentally, and scientifically. When \nyou talk to people in Europe, they take it as a given that our economy \nis stronger than theirs. They do not even discuss the subject. They try \nto say why they chose a different path, but they acknowledge the \nstrength of our American economy.\n  I have one more prefatory statement. A tax is a penalty. A gift of \nmoney is a subsidy. Things you penalize, you get less of. Things you \nsubsidize, you get more of. I think that is a fundamental law of human \nnature and of the economy, little to be disputed at this point.\n  So the next tax we need to be talking about is a tax on marriage. In \nthis Nation, we impose a tax on the institution of marriage. As we all \nknow, marriage is the cornerstone of strength in any society. We have \nseen study after study, ever since Dan Quayle raised the issue and \nAtlantic Monthly wrote an article that Dan Quayle was right, that the \nmarriage breakup is damaging to our country. We have created a tax \npolicy in this country that penalizes the institution of marriage and \nsubsidizes singleness.\n  I had a staff person make a statement to me a couple of years ago \nthat stunned me. She said: Jeff, you know we were divorced in January. \nWe got a $1,600 improvement on our taxes by being divorced. If we had \nbeen smart enough to have divorced in December, we would have saved \n$1,600 both years.\n  We are in the business now in this country of paying people a tax \nbonus for divorce. We are causing them to suffer a tax penalty, on \naverage of $1,400, if they get married. That is not good public policy. \nIt is wrong. It is unfair. It should not continue. The President has \nindicated in his State of the Union Address it ought to be eliminated. \nI do not know who would be against that. It is time to end it now, and \nthis Senate is going to do so. We are going to do it. I expect the \nPresident will sign it. I certainly hope so.\n  We have a surplus now of record proportions, of $1 trillion outside \nSocial Security. I hear a number of my fellow Members of the Senate on \nthe other side of the aisle who express concern if we have a few tax \ncuts that represent only a small part of the $1 trillion in the non-\nSocial Security surplus we are going to have in the next 10 years, over \n$1 trillion in non-Social Security surplus applying every dime of the \nSocial Security surplus to the Social Security fund, that somehow we \nare going to be disrupting and spending all that surplus. The tax cuts \nproposed are not going to use all of the surplus.\n  Not only will we pay down the debt with the Social Security surplus, \nwe will be paying down debt with the other surplus we have, unless we \ngo into a spending frenzy--which I reject.\n  We will also have money to expand spending programs. Our spending is \nup this year. But every time we get an estimate of the surplus we are \nlooking at over the next decade, those estimates are higher than \nbefore. Our economy continues to be strong, and allowing people to keep \ntheir money will help keep the economy vibrant and strong.\n  I am excited about this vote we will be undertaking soon to eliminate \nthe penalty on a very important institution in this country, and that \nis marriage. We did make progress 2\\1/2\\ years ago, when we passed a \nchild tax credit. A family of three would be able to receive $1,500, if \ntheir income is not too high, in tax rebates for those three children; \nover $100 a month that they can use for shoes, or to fix the muffler on \nthe car, to buy a set of tires, let the child go to camp for the \nsummer, or maybe take a vacation together. It is real money for real \nfamilies.\n  Some think Government is not working if we allow families to spend \nthe\n\n[[Page S6819]]\n\nmoney as they see fit; that we are somehow unconcerned about children; \nwe are somehow unconcerned about families if we do not take the money \nfrom them and give it back to them and tell them how to spend it. That \nproves we are concerned?\n  I say baloney. If you respect American families and you respect \nAmerican people, free and independent citizens that we are, you let \nthem keep as much of the money you can, to spend as they wish, and they \nwill use it wisely.\n  I am excited about this vote and this debate. I welcome it. The \nAmerican people are going to understand the absolute insanity of a tax \non the institution of marriage and reject it. We will allow the \nAmerican people to keep some money that they can spend as they choose \non the things that are important to them.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the bill Senator \nKennedy and others have worked on which is formally called the \nMedicaid/CHIP Family Improvement Act, but I will simply refer to it as \nthe Family Care Act.\n  Most of the people in this country who are uninsured work. A lot of \nAmericans assume that if somebody does not have health insurance, there \nis lack of merit or effort on their part. Most of the people who do not \nhave health insurance are, in fact, working every single day. They are \nworking, and many happen to be the working poor.\n  The whole philosophy of the earned-income tax credit, which President \nReagan started and a lot of people continued, is that if people are \npoor and are working, we say: Good, you have taken a job; as a result \nof taking a job, you have given up your Medicaid health care benefits, \nand in America we respect that you are taking a risk by going out into \nthe marketplace. You are probably not getting health insurance because \nof the low wages you are being paid but, nevertheless, you value work \nand you are going ahead with it.\n  This is the same spirit we are talking about in the Family Care Act. \nWe value people who work. We value people who work for low wages, and \nwe want to help them and their families.\n  Essentially through the Family Care Act, not only do we have the CHIP \nprogram, with which we are all familiar, which was started in 1996, \nwhich has been moderately successful for 2 million out of the 11 \nmillion children in this country, but we expand that. We say: Let your \nparents be included in this, too, because you are all part of the same \nfamily.\n  The Senator from Alabama was just talking about the importance of \nprotecting the family. This is an example of how to do that. The parent \nof the child receiving the Children's Health Insurance Program is \nprobably without health insurance, so why not expand that to include \nthat parent, which brings the family together on health insurance. It \nis sensible.\n  We also provide some money because it is very hard in places such as \nWest Virginia and, I suspect, Alabama, both of which are essentially \nrural States, and most States in this country have very rural aspects \nto them--it is very hard to reach out and find the children. We go \nthrough the School Lunch Program, but not everybody wants to admit they \nare on Medicaid or they are available for the CHIP program. It is hard \nto reach out, so we provide more money to the States to do that in ways \nthe States believe are appropriate.\n  We also provide States some money for other ways they might think of \nto do innovative planning to include parents and expand those who are \nuninsured.\n  It is interesting to me because we are talking a lot about health \ncare but not doing very much about it. I remember when President \nClinton was elected. Although his health care bill did not succeed, \nthere was a lot of energy around here. The energy did not start out to \nbe partisan. It started out that he was elected to do universal health \ncare, and there was a lot of talk.\n  At that time, the only industrialized countries in the world that did \nnot have universal health insurance were the United States and South \nAfrica. South Africa now has universal health insurance, and the United \nStates is still the only country which does not.\n  Of course, we are in a massively successful economic situation with a \nlot of people working and a lot of opportunities to make these changes. \nWhat I worry about and why I care about the Family Care Act is that we \nhave tended more away from the fundamentals of health care towards what \nI call political posturing. I do not want to get into who is doing it \nand to what extent, but I think most people will agree there is a lot \nof political posturing occurring.\n  I am hopeful we will pass a prescription drug benefit. I am not sure \nwe will. I am hopeful we will pass Medicare reform. I do not think we \nwill. I spent a year with the Medicare Reform Commission. It was quite \nan exercise in futility. There were a lot of negative feelings going \nback and forth. It was not the kind of commission or work with which \none really wanted to be associated in terms of expanding health care.\n  This bill is not about posturing; it is about trying to eliminate the \nnumber of uninsured as much as we possibly can.\n  I still very much have on my mind the concept of universal health \ncare. I understand that is not the top subject of the moment. We are at \nan incremental stage. If I can do things incrementally, then I will do \nthat. If I have to wait some years for universal health care, then I \nwill have to do that. I will always be pushing for universal health \ncare, but I will take steps as we can take them, and this Family Care \nAct is a splendid way to do that.\n  One of the problems is that since President Clinton's health care \nbill did not pass--and I will not comment on that--there were 36 or 37 \nmillion people uninsured in the country, and there was disagreement as \nto the number. That is a lot of people. Now there are about 43 million \nto 44 million uninsured. One can extrapolate from that that we have \nbeen talking but not doing much about it. There have been a couple of \ninstances where there has been bipartisan legislation which has passed \nand has helped, but nothing really substantial, and it has been very \nsporadic.\n  We are looking at a situation where, over the next 3 years, \napproximately 30 percent of the population, or about 81 million \nAmericans, can expect to have no health insurance for at least 1 month \nout of a year. Who is to say when a problem might occur, when a leg \nmight be broken, when a cancer may be discovered or when some other \nproblem might arise? Basically, that to me is uninsurance.\n  Business people like to have predictability, and individuals like to \nhave a sense of predictability: I have it; I am safe. That is why it is \ncalled the Health Security Act. Security is very important in health \ncare.\n  Others would say let the market do that. The market has worked \nwonderfully in many ways in our country. It has had a lot to do with \nthe success of our economy. It probably has had more to do with the \nsuccess of our economy than the very Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nthe Senator from Alabama was talking about a few moments ago. We are an \nentrepreneurial country, but we carry entrepreneurship to those places \nwhere we are quite certain it is going to work.\n  There are those who take risks, but basically Americans, when it \ncomes to something such as health care, are rather risk averse, and \ntherefore the whole concept of predictability and security once again \nbecomes particularly important.\n  I am very unhappy when I think of 81 million Americans having at \nleast 1 month out of the year without health insurance. I do not \nsuspect the market is going to turn that around because it declined to. \nThe Health Insurance Association of America, which is not a \nparticularly aggressive group on health care, would agree with that \nstatement. They do not want to get into that business of doing that \nkind of insurance.\n  The Family Care Act is a sensible Government approach in which we \nsimply take the CHIP program, which is beginning to work now at a \nrapidly increasing rate as States grow more comfortable with it, and \nsay let's extend that to the parents. That is called incrementalism. It \nis sensible. It fits within a pattern. It is logical, and it\n\n[[Page S6820]]\n\nalso helps those who tend to be from the working poor. I think we \nshould do all we can to help people who are poor and who work and who \nchoose not to go on welfare.\n\n  I think it is time to act. The family care amendment is not in any \nway political. It is not even large scale. But it does help. It is \nsomething that we will be voting on next week. With a strong degree of \nintensity, I encourage my colleagues to vote for it.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6820-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6820-S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2000--Continued\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I will talk just a little bit about the \nmarriage penalty bill that we have before us.\n  I rise in strong support of this legislation to repeal the marriage \npenalty.\n  I am going to vote for this bill because it restores fairness and \nequity to married Americans under the Tax Code. It is the right and \nhonorable thing to do.\n  By now I think all of my colleagues know the sad facts about the \nmarriage penalty, and how it cruelly punishes married couples by \nforcing them to pay higher taxes on their income than if they were \nsingle.\n  For example, a married couple where both spouses earned $30,000 in \n1999 would pay $7,655 in federal income taxes. Two individuals earning \n$30,000 each but filing single returns would pay only $6,892 combined. \nThe $763 difference in tax liability is the marriage penalty.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that overall \nalmost half of all married couples--22 million--suffered under the \nmarriage penalty last year. The average penalty paid by these couples \nwas $1,400. Cumulatively, the marriage penalty increases taxes on \naffected couples by $32 billion per year.\n  That is 44 million Americans who are paying a total of $32 billion in \nhigher taxes each year simply because they took the walk down the \naisle.\n  In my home State of Kentucky alone, there are over 800,000 married \ncouples, many of whom are punished by the marriage penalty.\n  I can't think of one good reason why they should have to send more of \ntheir money to the Federal Government for the simple reason that they \ndecided to get married. It is about the most unfair and unjust thing I \nhave ever heard of.\n  This bill provides real relief by making four simple changes to the \ncode.\n  It increases the standard deduction for married couples to twice the \nstandard reduction for single taxpayers.\n  It expands 15-percent and 28-percent income tax brackets for married \ncouples filing a joint return to twice the size of the corresponding \nbrackets for individuals.\n  It updates the rule to eliminate the marriage penalty for low-income \ncouples who qualify for the earned income credit.\n  And it corrects a glaring oversight in the Code whereby couples who \nhave to pay the alternative minimum tax are denied the ability to fully \nclaim family tax credits, such as the $500 per child tax credit, hope \nand lifetime learning credits, and the dependent care credit.\n  The marriage penalty is an outdated relic from the days when families \nprimarily relied on one breadwinner.\n  The penalty principally occurs because the Tax Code provides a higher \ncombined standard deduction for two workers filing as singles than for \nmarried couples, and the income tax bracket thresholds for married \ncouples are less than twice that for single taxpayers.\n  As recently as several decades ago when most mothers stayed home and \nfathers trudged off to work at the factory each day, this might have \nmade sense.\n  Back then it did not matter nearly as much if the Tax Code's standard \ndeduction for a married couple wasn't twice as much as for an \nindividual, or if the income brackets for couples weren't double that \nfor individuals.\n\n  Few families had to account for a second income, and had never heard \nof the marriage penalty.\n  But times change, and now in many families both parents do work. And \nI can guarantee you that they know their money is being wrongly taken \nfrom them by our immoral tax laws.\n  Congress and the Tax Code haven't kept pace with the American family. \nIt is time to change that and to make sure that our code meets the \nneeds of the modern family in the 21st century in America.\n  Even worse, the marriage penalty is a cancer that has spread \nthroughout the Tax Code, and which goes beyond simply affecting \nstandard deductions and income brackets.\n  There are at least 65 more provisions in our tax laws where married \ncouples are unjustly penalized. Frankly, I think the bill before us \ntoday should be just the first step toward completely rooting the \nmarriage penalty out of our Tax Code.\n  The adoption tax credit, the student loan interest deduction, \nretirement savings incentives, and dozens of other parts of the Code \nhave all been afflicted by the marriage penalty, and are less available \nto married couples than if they were single earners trying to take \nadvantage of this tax relief.\n  This means that the marriage penalty not only punishes Americans who \nhave to foot the bill, it further undermines the good public policy \ngoals that Congress has tried to implement when it passed these changes \nto the Tax Code.\n  This isn't the first time Congress has tried to fix the insidious \nmarriage penalty. In 1995, Congress tried to increase the standard \ndeduction for married couples to offset some of the marriage penalty. \nPresident Clinton vetoed that bill.\n  Again in 1999, Congress passed marriage penalty relief. Again the \nPresident vetoed it.\n  Both times the President said he liked the idea of marriage penalty \nrelief, but didn't like other provisions in the legislation. So this \nyear the House passed what I call a ``clean'' marriage penalty bill to \ntry to answer his concerns. But, of course, he issued a strong \nstatement in opposition to that bill.\n  However, that did not stop him from recently proposing a little horse \ntrading, and telling Congress that he would reconsider and sign \nmarriage penalty relief legislation if we would also pass his Medicare \nprescription drug plan.\n  If all that does is confuse you, I know it confuses me. But I think \nit means the President can't decide what he thinks about ending the \nmarriage penalty.\n  So I believe that Congress should help clarify his thinking and send \nhim a bill soon so he can make up his mind and decide if he really \nwants to help provide tax relief to the 44 million Americans who are \nunfairly punished by the marriage penalty.\n  It is time for the Senate to act and to send marriage penalty relief \nto the President. Until we do we are not going to be able to escape the \nfact that the marriage penalty causes a vicious cycle.\n  It imposes higher taxes on millions of families, and it unfairly \ntakes away billions of dollars of income from married couples. That \nmoney is then sent to Washington and used to help pay for child care \nand other programs that families might not have needed in the first \nplace if they had been able to keep the money that was stolen from them \nby the marriage penalty.\n  Mr. President, the marriage penalty is an evil that is eating away at \nour families. The American people want a divorce from the marriage \npenalty, and we can give it to them by passing this bill today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of my colleague, I \nwill speak on the marriage penalty for a few minutes and then go into \nthe wrap-up.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues, several of whom have \nworked very hard to make sure we eliminate the marriage penalty. Kay \nBailey Hutchison of Texas, Sam Brownback, Senator Ashcroft, and Senator \nSantorum have been pushing and pushing to eliminate one of the most \nunfair\n\n[[Page S6821]]\n\npenalties in the Tax Code, the marriage penalty. Now we have a chance \nto do that. We are going to vote on that on Monday. We are going to \npass it--at least I hope we do--and I hope the President will sign it.\n  The President said in his State of the Union Address that we need to \neliminate the marriage penalty. He didn't propose it. He had a little \nsomething in his budget but very little. We have taken that and we are \nnow considering a bill to basically eliminate the marriage penalty. A \nlot of people don't know what that is. It says that if people file a \njoint return, they pay more than they would have paid as single \nindividuals. Some people say: Wait a minute. The Republican proposal, \nor the proposal we passed out of the Finance Committee, does more than \nthat; it has a marriage bonus.\n  We say that we should basically double the income tax brackets for \nindividuals and for couples. So if they are married and file jointly, \nthey end up getting twice the income tax bracket before you step into \nthe next bracket as individuals. That is really pretty simple. But it \nis as fair as it can get. It is the right thing to do.\n\n  To give an example, we have several brackets in our Tax Code: 0, 15, \n28, 31, 36, and 39.6. Actually, the maximum rate was 31 percent before \nPresident Clinton came into office. In 1993, he and Vice President Gore \npassed a tax increase to move the maximum rate up to 39.6. They also \neliminated deductions and also took off the cap on the Medicare tax, \nwhich is another 2.9 percent. So they basically raised the maximum rate \nup to 43, 44 percent.\n  As you jump into higher tax brackets, each income level, you are \npenalized under the marriage penalty. As an individual, you pay 15 \npercent up to $26,000. You would think a couple would go into the next \nbracket until it is double that amount. That would be $52,000. An \nindividual pays 15 percent up to $26,000. So for a couple, when they go \ninto the next higher bracket at 28 percent, that should be at $52,000. \nThat is not the case.\n  If you look at the Tax Code, a married couple filing a joint return \ngoes into 28 percent not at $52,000 or $50,000 but at $43,000. So what \nthat means is that the married couple is paying an additional rate of \n28 percent on all income between $43,000 and $52,000. That is the \nmarriage penalty. We would eliminate that. Whether there is one wage \nearner or two wage earners in the married couple, we eliminate that \npenalty. Another way of saying it is, we take the $26,000, on which you \nare paying 15 percent, and we double it. So if it is $26,000 for an \nindividual, it is $52,000 for a couple. We do the same thing on the 28 \npercent bracket. So we eliminate this penalty.\n  Another way of looking at it would be, if you have a principal wage \nearner and, say, he or she makes $40,000, and a spouse makes $20,000, \nunder present law, the spouse that makes $20,000 pays the same income \ntax rate as the principal wage earner. That is not right. They should \nnot be paying a tax rate of 28 percent. They should be paying at the \n15-percent rate. So we are doubling the tax. The present Tax Code \nalmost charges double for the wage earner that is making $20,000 just \nbecause they happen to be married to a spouse who makes $40,000. That \nis wrong. It needs to be eliminated, and we do eliminate that in this \nproposal.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues say they are going to offer a \nDemocrat substitute and change that Democrat proposal.\n  I compliment my friend and colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan. \nI have the greatest respect for him. He says the way to solve it is to \nmake individuals file as if they have individual returns. What does \nthat mean?\n  If you have an income of $40,000 or $20,000, there would be some tax \nrelief. But what if you have a situation where somebody earns $60,000? \nThere is no tax relief. Or if you have an income that is $50,000, there \nis no tax relief. You are paying a 28-percent bracket on any income \nbetween $43,000 and $52,000. So they get penalized. They doesn't solve \nthat problem.\n  I hope I am not being too confusing. Maybe it is kind of wonkish, but \nwe are penalizing couples in the U.S. today for being married to the \ntune of an average $1,200 to $1,400. That is wrong. We have a chance to \nfix it. We should. I believe we will fix it on Monday.\n  I am pleased. This week was a good week. We passed a bill to \neliminate the death tax. That is good news for small business. It is \ngood news for farmers and ranchers or anybody who is trying to build a \nbusiness. They would like to know they can build the business and not \nlose half of it when they die.\n  The tax rates right now on the death tax range from 37 percent once \nyou get past the deductible to 55 percent and in some cases 60 percent. \nIf you have a taxable estate of $10 million, you have a marginal rate \nof 60 percent. That is too high. A lot of people do not know that. Some \npress people said to me: I think you misstated it.\n  The facts are, if you have a taxable estate of $10 million to $17 \nmillion, you pay a rate of 60 percent. That is way too high. We have \ntaken care of that today. The only thing that will stop that from \nbecoming law is President Clinton. He can sign it and we can eliminate \nthe death tax and replace it with a capital gains tax. That is fair and \nequitable across the board. It is something we ought to do. It is the \nfair and right thing to do.\n  Next Monday we can eliminate the marriage penalty. People shouldn't \nhave to pay more taxes because they happen to be married. People \nshouldn't be bumped into higher categories because they happen to be \nmarried. We shouldn't be charging couples for marriage. They shouldn't \nbe penalized for being married.\n  We basically double the tax schedule for couples. To me, it is the \nfairest thing to do. You don't penalize somebody because they are \nworking or not working. We don't penalize married couples. We have a \nchance to eliminate this gross inequity.\n  We have taken care of one today on the floor of the Senate by \neliminating the death penalty. On Monday, we can eliminate the marriage \npenalty.\n  I compliment my colleagues, and especially several of our Democrat \ncolleagues who were with us. Nine Democrats voted with us on final \npassage. We passed a bipartisan bill. It was bipartisan in the House \nwith an overwhelming vote of a 2-to-1 margin. There was a good margin \ntoday in the Senate--59-39. Frankly, I hope that number will grow. We \nhad several Members absent today, several of whom maybe would join us.\n  Again, I compliment Senator Lott, and also Senator Roth, for bringing \nthe bill forward this week. Next week, we have the opportunity to \nprovide real tax relief for businesses, for families, and for married \ncouples. I think that is some of the most positive news for taxpayers \nin a long, long time.\n  I am going to proceed to several unanimous consent requests to help \nexpedite consideration of these matters before the Senate next week.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3881\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk to the \npending bill on behalf of the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Nickles), for Mr. Lott, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3881.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I urge all of my colleagues to join us to \nreduce the marriage penalties in the tax code. This bill will provide \nmarried couples the relief that President Clinton denied them last year \nwith his veto of the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. President \nClinton's action last year increased taxes by close to $800 billion and \nimposed a marriage penalty on middle class American families.\n  There is no place in the Tax Code for marriage penalties. Marriage \npenalties are caused by tax laws that treat joint filers relatively \nworse than single filers with half the income. It has of late become \ncommon practice to use the Tax Code for purposes of social engineering, \ndiscouraging some actions with the stick of tax penalties and \nencouraging others with the carrot of tax preferences. But there is no \nlegitimate policy reason for punishing taxpayers with higher taxes just \nbecause they happen to be married. The marriage penalties in the Tax \nCode undermine the family, the institution that is the foundation of \nour society.\n  I view this bill as just a start. Our Tax Code will not truly be \nfamily-friendly until every single marriage penalty is rooted out and \neliminated, so that married couples with twice the income of single \nindividuals are taxed at the same rates, and are eligible for the same \ntax preferences--including deductions, exemptions, use of IRAs and \nother savings vehicles--as those single filers. This bill is an \nimportant step toward that ultimate goal.\n  The Democrat criticisms of our bill are misplaced. They argue that \nour bill contains complicated phase-ins, in contrast to their simple \napproach. But anyone who reads the bill and their alternative would see \nthat this is false. The Finance Committee bill contains percentages in \nit, sure enough. And it phases in the relief, that is true. But the \npercentages and the phase-ins are instructions to the Treasury and the \nIRS, to make adjustments to the tax brackets. The only people who have \nto make any new calculations under the Finance Committee bill are the \nbureaucrats who make up the tax tables, not the taxpayer.\n\n[[Page S6826]]\n\n  By contrast, the Democrat alternative, in phasing in its relief, \nrequires taxpayers to calculate their taxes as joint filers, then \ncalculate their taxes as if they were single--a complicated process \nthat requires the allocation of various deductions and credits. Next, \nthe taxpayer would have to determine the difference between these two \ncalculations and then reduce this by a certain percentage. That is \nsupposed to be simple? The Democrat substitute adds to the headaches of \ntax filing and the demand for tax preparers and tax preparation \nsoftware.\n  The Democrats also complain that the Finance Committee bill does more \nthan address their narrow definition of the marriage penalty. They \ninvoke the so-called ``marriage bonus.'' But the ``marriage bonus'' is \na red herring. What they call a ``marriage bonus'' results from \nadjusting tax brackets for joint filers to reflect the fact that two \nadults are sharing the household income. Under the Democrat approach, \nsingle taxpayers who marry a non-working or low-earning spouse should \npay the same amount of taxes as when they were single, even though this \nincome must be spread over the needs of two adults.\n  This approach is fundamentally flawed. The Democrat approach would \nenshrine in the law a new ``homemaker penalty.'' The Democrats would \nmake families with one earner and one stay-at-home spouse pay higher \ntaxes than families with the same household income and two earners.\n  But why discriminate against one-earner families? Why would we want a \ntax code that penalized families just because one of the spouses \nchooses the hard work of the household over the role of breadwinner? \nThe Democrat alternative discourages parents from staying home with \ntheir infant children, and penalizes a person who works longer hours so \nthat a spouse can care for elderly parents. That is just plain wrong.\n  The Finance Committee bill reduces the marriage penalty in a \nrational, sensible way, by making the standard deduction for joint \nfilers twice what it is for single filers, and by making the ranges at \nwhich income is taxed at the 15 percent and 28 percent rates twice for \njoint filers what they are for single filers. This recognizes that \nmarriage is a partnership in which two adults share the household \nincome. Our approach cuts taxes for all American families. The \nDemocrats call this a ``bonus.'' We call it common sense.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nthe first tax reconciliation bill, which would correct the injustice of \nthe marriage penalty. As a long-time advocate of repealing the marriage \npenalty, I rise to strongly support this legislation and support \nelimination of the marriage penalty entirely.\n  First, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our leaders for \nbringing up this important legislation. I'd particularly like to \ncommend Chairman Roth for his leadership on tax relief. He has \nconsistently championed critically needed tax relief that will restore \nfairness for millions of American families.\n  This marriage penalty tax relief legislation would increase the \nstandard deduction so that married couples filing jointly get the same \ndeduction as single taxpayers. It expands the 15 percent and 28 percent \ntax brackets to ensure that 21 million American couples--including 3 \nmillion American seniors--pay the same tax rate as unmarried taxpayers. \nThe bill makes Alternative Minimum Tax exemption for family-related tax \ncredits permanent, so families won't be pushed into higher tax \nbrackets.\n  This bill also takes care of low-income married couples by increasing \nthe threshold of the Earned Income Credit to allow them to enjoy this \ntax relief. Mr. President, in my view, this is fair, well-balanced \nlegislation by any standard.\n  There are compelling reasons to eliminate the marriage penalty tax \nand provide immediate tax relief for millions of married couples:\n  As I have said many times before in this Chamber, the family has been \nand will continue to be the bedrock of American society. Strong \nfamilies make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong \nAmerica. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married \ncouples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees the marriage penalty is \nunfair.\n  But our tax policy reflects just the opposite. It discourages \nmarriage, punishes married couples, and damages the family--the basic \ninstitution of our society.\n  The Congressional Budget Office reports that 22 million American \ncouples suffered from the marriage penalty in 1999. The average penalty \npaid by these couples was $1,500.\n  This wasn't always the case. For over half a century--from 1913, when \nWashington first imposed the federal income tax, to 1969--the federal \nincome tax treated married couples as well as, or better than, single \nindividuals. Since 1996, however, many married couples every year have \nhad to pay a penalty just for saying ``I do.'' At the time they \nexchanged their vows, I'll bet most of those couples didn't realize \nthey were also saying ``I do'' to Uncle Sam.\n  The tax hike of 1993 further aggravated the problem because it added \nnew, higher tax rates. In addition, now that a greater number of \nhouseholds are dual income, that means that more couples are subject to \nthis penalty.\n  Mr. President, the consequence of this unjust penalty is devastating. \nIt has put an additional financial burden on already overtaxed American \nfamilies. Here is an example of how this penalty hits the average \nAmerican:\n  Alicia Jones from my state of Minnesota and her husband graduated \nfrom college and had just begun working full-time two years ago, in \nprofessional careers. They had no children and were renting an \napartment, saving to buy a house. They had to pay at least an \nadditional $1,500 for simply being married. As a result, on top of the \nover $10,000 tax they already paid, they had to take an additional $700 \nfrom their limited savings account to pay for federal taxes--taxes that \nthey wouldn't have had to pay if they weren't married.\n\n  She wrote, ``I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--\nhow do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from our \nsavings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will remember my \nconcern.''\n  Millions of married couples similarly suffer because of this penalty. \nThis is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of Congress when \nit created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax \nschedules for married and unmarried people. This unjust marriage \npenalty also has an adverse social impact, as more and more people \ndelay their wedding just for tax purposes. I have an example of that in \nmy own office. Research also shows that the marriage penalty has \ndiscouraged couples from getting married. It has also encouraged some \nmarried couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to live \ntogether, but save on their taxes.\n  Clearly, this tax policy has interrupted and distorted the normal \nlives of many Americans. It should not be allowed to continue.\n  Repealing the marriage penalty will provide immediate, meaningful tax \nrelief to American families and allow them to keep $1,500 or more each \nyear of their own money to pay for health insurance, groceries, child \ncare, or other family necessities.\n  In my state of Minnesota alone, over 550,000 couples will benefit \nfrom this tax relief and will no longer suffer from this unfair tax.\n  However, the biggest beneficiaries of the elimination of the marriage \npenalty tax are working women and low-income families.\n  Federal tax policy penalizes working women by taxing their income at \nthe highest rate imposed on their husbands' income. Our legislation \naddresses this injustice by allowing married working women to keep \nsignificantly more of their hard-earned money for family needs.\n   The elimination of the marriage penalty will primarily benefit \nminority, and low and middle income families. Government data suggest \nthe marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower-income working \nfamilies hardest. Couples at the bottom end of the income scale who \nincur penalties paid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes, \nwhich represented 8 percent of their income. Eight percent, Mr. \nPresident. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income families will \nimmediately have an 8 percent increase in their income, larger than for \nall other income levels.\n\n[[Page S6827]]\n\n  Despite these facts, some of our colleagues from the other side of \naisle still call this a ``tax cut for the rich.'' They seem to have \ngotten into the habit, whenever they hear the phrase ``tax relief,'' of \njumping up and shouting ``tax cut for the rich!'' That's not fair to \nworking Americans who are hit hard by these taxes.\n  Mr. President, some also argue that marriage penalty tax relief will \ngo to those families who already receive marriage bonuses. The argument \ndoes not fold true either. While about 51 percent, or 25 million \ncouples, receive marriage bonuses, this doesn't justify the federal \ngovernment penalizing another 22 million couples just for being married \nor for choosing to work.\n  In addition, most of those who receive marriage bonuses are likely to \nreceive this due to family-related tax credits, such as the $500 per-\nchild credit I passed into law to help a family afford raising \nchildren. It is contradictory to allow married couples to receive these \ncredits and then turn around and require them to pay more income taxes \nfor receiving the tax credits. We should give more bonuses to all \nAmerican families whether both spouses or only one of them are working.\n  More importantly, the trends show that more couples under age 55 are \nworking, and the earnings between husbands and wives are more evenly \ndivided since 1969. This means more and more couples have received, and \nwill continue to receive, marriage penalties and fewer couples will \nhave bonuses.\n  Another conventional argument of our Democratic colleagues against \ntax relief is that the tax relief costs too much. This is a typical \nWashington way of thinking. They forget the fact that it is the \ntaxpayer's, not Washington's, money in the first place.\n  Mr. President, it is hard to justify under any circumstances \ncontinued punishment of married couples in this country regardless of \nthe costs. Moreover, in this era of record budget surpluses, the so \ncalled ``costs'' associated with the repeal of the marriage penalty are \njust a fraction of the tax overpayments made by working Americans. Over \nthe next 10 years, the federal government will collect over $1.9 \ntrillion in tax overpayments from taxpayers, while the total tax relief \nin the reconciliation instruction adopted under the FY 2001 budget \nresolution is merely $150 billion. This is less than 8 cents of every \ndollar of non-Social Security surpluses collected by the government.\n  We have also heard some argue that Washington needs tax overpayments \nto save Social Security and Medicare with an addition of prescription \ndrug benefits. President Clinton has also said that he will support the \nmarriage penalty repeal if prescription drug benefits are added.\n  Mr. President, I support saving and strengthening Social Security and \nMedicare, and I support prescription drug benefits for seniors. I have \nmy own plan to do that. I support repealing the marriage penalty tax, \nthe death tax, and the tax on seniors' retirement benefits. But I \nbelieve they all should be passed and signed into law on their own \nmerits, and shouldn't be traded against each other.\n  As a matter of fact, the Administration has never come up with a \nviable plan to save Social Security. It has blocked bipartisan efforts \nto strengthen Medicare, including prescription drug benefits. Now it \nuses this as a cover to deny working Americans the moderate tax refund \nthey deserve.\n  Mr. President, this is not acceptable.\n  I have repeatedly argued that American families today are overtaxed, \nand the surplus comes directly from taxes paid by the American people. \nIt is only fair to return it to the taxpayers. With a huge budget \nsurplus, we can reduce working Americans' tax burden, pay down the \nnational debt, save Social Security, and provide prescription drug \nbenefits for seniors--if the Administration and the Congress have the \npolitical will to do so.\n  In closing, Mr. President, the marriage penalty is simply bad tax \npolicy and we must end it once and for all to restore equity and \nfairness for working Americans.\n  Mr. ASCHCROFT. Mr. President, the current tax code is at war with our \nvalues--the tax code penalizes the basic social institution: marriage. \nThe American people know that this is unfair--they know it is not right \nthat the code penalizes marriage. Now the Senate is prepared to end \nthis long-standing problem.\n  25 million American couples pay an average of approximately $1,400 in \nmarriage penalty annually as a result of the marriage penalty. Ending \nthis penalty gives couples the freedom to make their own choices with \ntheir money. Couples could use the $1,400 for: retirement, education, \nhome, children's needs.\n  This bill will also provide needed tax relief to American families--\n39 million American married couples, 830,000 in Missouri. Couples like \nBruce and Kay Morton, from Camdenton, MO, who suffer from this unfair \npenalty. Mr. Morton wrote me a note so simple that even a Senator could \nunderstand it: ``Please vote yes for the Marriage Tax relief of 2000.''\n  Another Missourian, Travis Harms, of Independence, Missouri, wrote to \ntell me that the marriage penalty hits him and his wife, Laura. Mr. \nHarms graciously offered me his services in ending the marriage \npenalty. ``I would like to thank you for your support and effort \ntowards the elimination of the unfair `marriage tax.' If there is any \nway I can support or encourage others to help this dream become a \nreality, I would be honored to help.''\n  I am grateful to Travis Harms and Bruce Morton for their support. And \nI want to repay them by making sure we end this unfair penalty on \nmarriage.\n  The marriage penalty places an undue burden on American families. \nAccording to the Tax Foundation, an American family spends more of \ntheir family budget on taxes than on health care, food, clothing, and \nshelter combined. The tax bill should not be the biggest bill families \nlike the Morton's and Harms' face.\n  And families certainly should not be taxed extra because they are \nmarried. Couples choosing marriage are making the right choice for \nsociety. It is in our interest to encourage them to make this choice.\n  Unfortunately, the marriage penalty discourages this choice. The \nmarriage penalty may actually contribute to one of society's most \nserious and enduring problems. There are now twice as many single \nparent households in America than there were when this penalty was \nfirst enacted.\n  In its policies, the government should uphold the basic values that \ngive strength and vitality to our culture. Marriage and family are a \ncornerstone of civilization, but are heavily penalized by the federal \ntax system.\n  The marriage penalty is so patently unfair no one will defend it. \nThose on the other side of the aisle are making a stab at addressing \nthe marriage penalty, even though they are not willing to provide \nrelief to all couples who face this unfair penalty. Their bill \nimplements a choose or lose system for some couples who are subject to \nthe marriage penalty. Their bill phases out marriage penalty relief, \nand does not cover all of the couples who face this unfair penalty.\n  This issue, however, is not about income, it's about fairness. It us \nunfair to tax married couples more than single people, no matter what \ntheir income. The Finance Committee bill provides tax relief to all \nmarried couples.\n  In addition, the Finance Committee bill makes sure that couples do \nnot face the risk of differential treatment. Under the minority bill, \none family with a husband earning $50,000 and a mother staying home \nwith her children will pay more in taxes than a family with a combined \nincome of $50,000, with the wife and husband each earning $25,000. This \nsystem creates a disincentive for parents to stay at home with their \nchildren. The Republican plan will treat all couples equally.\n  While the minority bill is flawed, I am encouraged that they are \nfinally acknowledging that the marriage penalty is a problem. I am also \nencouraged that President Clinton has also acknowledged the unfair \nnature of the marriage penalty. But unfortunately, Treasury Secretary \nLarry Summers has announced that he would advise the President to veto \nmarriage penalty relief.\n  I say to the President and to my colleagues on the other side: being \nagainst the marriage penalty means that you have to be willing to \neliminate it. You cannot just say you oppose the penalty, and then \nfight to keep the penalty in law, or to keep part of the penalty in law \nfor some people. Join us to\n\n[[Page S6828]]\n\nvote for the elimination of the penalty, and let us bring this \nimportant tax relief bill to the American people together.\n  The marriage penalty has endured for too long and harmed too many \ncouples. It is time to abolish the prejudice that charges higher taxes \nfor being married. It is time to take the tax out of saying ``I do.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6828-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6828]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the troubled \ntransition from communism to democracy of the largest of the new states \nin Central Asia, Kazakhstan. That transition is in serious jeopardy \nbecause of the authoritarian behavior of Kazakhstan's President, \nhighlighted by the recent capricious arrest of the leader of the \npolitical opposition.\n  There are high-stakes, competing forces at work in Kazakhstan: the \npromise of huge sums of money to be made from exploiting the country's \nvast natural resources, and the pull of old dictatorial ways against \nthe nascent democratic movement.\n  Last month, I met with a man who could help lead Kazakhstan toward \ntrue democracy--a former Prime Minister and outspoken critic of the \ncurrent regime, Akezhan Kazhegeldin.\n  Unfortunately, the Government of Kazakhstan is doing everything \nwithin its power to see that Mr. Kazhegeldin not get this opportunity.\n  Two days ago, he was detained in Rome on an INTERPOL warrant \ninstigated by the Kazakh Government. The charges, which range from \nterrorism to money laundering, are regarded by our State Department as \ntrumped up and political in nature.\n  This morning word came from Rome that the Italian authorities have \nshared our Government's assessment of the case and that they have \nreleased Mr. Kazhegeldin.\n  But, although I am gratified at this development, the very fact of \nMr. Kazhegeldin's arrest is a cause for deep concern for every American \nwho hopes that democracy can take root in every country where Soviet \ndespotism once reigned.\n  This latest arrest is doubly troubling, because it suggests that \nauthoritarian rulers are having at least temporary success in \nmanipulating international organizations, in this case INTERPOL.\n  The International League for Human Rights considers Mr. Kazhegeldin's \narrest to be a ``particularly serious violation of article 2 of the \nINTERPOL Constitution'' because the founders of that organization \n``were careful to provide that the INTERPOL network could not be used \nby authoritarian governments to harass their domestic political \nopponents.''\n  The real reason for the arrest was the latest in a series of attempts \nby the President of Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, to suppress his \npolitical opposition, which is led by Mr. Kazhegeldin.\n  The timing is probably not coincidental. Mr. Kazhegeldin had recently \noffered to testify before U.S. authorities about corruption at the \nhighest levels in Kazakhstan.\n  This is the second time that President Nazarbayev has had Mr. \nKazhegeldin detained by national authorities--there was a similar \noccurrence in Moscow last fall. In both cases, President Nazarbayev's \ngovernment filed bogus charges through INTERPOL to have Mr. Kazhegeldin \ndetained.\n  I understand that our own Department of Justice has routinely ignored \nsuch INTERPOL notices concerning Mr. Kazhegeldin.\n  In an even more sinister vein, the harassment against Mr. \nKazhegeldin's associates has turned to physical violence--his press \naide was stabbed in Moscow recently.\n  Mr. President, the stakes in Kazakhstan are extraordinarily high. The \ncountry is four times the size of Texas and is blessed with energy \nresources that even the Lone Star State would envy.\n  For example, it has proven oil reserves of some 15\\1/2\\ billion \nbarrels; areas under the Caspian Sea may yield up to another 30 billion \nbarrels.\n  Estimates of natural gas reserves range from 3 to 6 trillion cubic \nmeters. In addition, there are rich deposits of minerals such as \ncopper, zinc, chromium, and uranium.\n  The Tengiz oil field is currently being worked by U.S., Russian, \nKazakh, and other companies. Construction is underway on a pipeline to \nthe Russian port city of Novorossiisk, and Central Asian leaders have \nsigned agreements with Turkey for a Baku-Ceyhan route.\n  But this energy wealth is prospective for now. The big fields have \nnot yet begun to yield, and the country remains poor.\n  Kazakhstan's political landscape remains as undeveloped as its oil \nfields. Elections have been marked by irregularities to the point where \ninternational monitors agree that they have not met democratic \nstandards. In fact--and this speaks volumes about the arrest in Rome--\nPresident Nazarbayev was re-elected in 1999 by banning his only real \nopponent, none other than Akezhan Kazhegeldin.\n\n  Human rights abuses have been reliably documented and include \nextrajudicial killings, harsh prison conditions, and torture of \ndetainees.\n  The press in Kazakhstan has been constrained by President \nNazarbayev's desire to curb those who would ``harm the country's image \nin the world.'' In addition, the government owns and controls \nsignificant printing and distribution facilities and subsidizes \npublications. Restraints on the press are severe enough that self-\ncensorship is now practiced.\n  The right of free assembly is restricted by law and by the \ngovernment. Organizations must apply 10 days in advance to hold a \ngathering, and local authorities are widely reported to deny such \npermits. In some instances, demonstrators have been fined or \nimprisoned.\n  There is, however, one piece of good news, in the area of weapons \nnonproliferation. Kazakhstan, which was one of four nuclear states \nformed out of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, has been a vigorous \npartner with the United States in the elimination of weapons of mass \ndestruction. In 1995, President Nazarbayev announced that his country \nwas no longer a nuclear power, after the last of its nuclear warheads \nhad been removed to Russia.\n  On the negative side, however, government officials of Kazakhstan \nillegally sold 40 Soviet-built MiG 21 fighter jets to North Korea. The \nofficials implicated in the sales have received only minor punishment.\n\n[[Page S6829]]\n\n  The United States has worked with Kazakhstan and the other Central \nAsian states to promote democracy, economic reform, development of the \nenergy sector, and other goals. In Kazakhstan alone, we provided $600 \nmillion in assistance from 1992 to 1999.\n  It is important to note that the Silk Road Strategy Act, passed by \nthis Congress, specifically calls for increased aid to support conflict \nresolution in the region, humanitarian relief, economic and democratic \nreform, and institution-building.\n  Finally, the United States has pursued a policy of vigorous \nengagement with the Government of Kazakhstan, including visits to that \ncountry by Secretary of State Albright and First Lady Hillary Clinton. \nWe have also received many of their leaders in Washington, including \nPresident Nazarbayev.\n  Kazakhstan, for all of its failings, is important to global \nsecurity--because of its location, because of its wealth of energy \nresources, and because of its commitment to remain a nuclear weapons-\nfree state.\n  But no matter how important Kazakhstan is, the United States must \nforcefully remind President Nazarbayev that acts of harassment such as \nthe arrest of Mr. Kazhegeldin endanger the good relations between our \ntwo countries. He must be made to see the benefits of democracy and a \nfree market economy, and the blind alley of authoritarian cronyism.\n  Therefore, I call upon President Nazarbayev to stop his harassment of \nMr. Kazhegeldin and the rest of the legitimate political opposition in \nKazakhstan. It is these attacks--not the legitimate activities of the \npolitical opposition--that are serving to tarnish the reputation of \nKazakhstan. This political repression makes the developed nations--\nwhose support and investment Kazakhstan desperately needs--wary of \neconomic involvement there.\n  The United States can work in partnership to build a better life for \nthe people of Kazakhstan, but only if President Nazarbayev understands \nthat political democracy must go hand-in-hand with economic \ndevelopment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6829-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6829-S6830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNMANNED COMBAT VEHICLE INITIATIVE\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, since January, I have been working on an \ninitiative that deals with introducing new cutting-edge technology into \nthe combat arms of our Armed Services. The initiative is to have one-\nthird of our airborne deep strike aircraft remotely operated within 10 \nyears, and one-third of our ground combat vehicles remotely operated \nwithin 15 years.\n  I asked one of our ``Captains of Industry,'' Mr. Kent Kresa, the \nChief Executive Officer of Northrop Grumman, for his assessment of the \ntechnical feasibility for such an undertaking. He expressed his \nunqualified support for the initiative, saying that it was certainly \nfeasible from a technical viewpoint. His thoughts have been published \nin the July 2000, issue of National Defense, the magazine of the \nNational Defense Industrial Association. I ask unanimous consent this \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From National Defense, July, 2000.]\n\n                For Unmanned Systems, the Time Has Come\n\n                            (By Kent Kresa)\n\n       Today's technology gives us the ability to do things in \n     different ways. All we really need is determination. In \n     preparing for future conflicts, the area of unmanned systems \n     is one where institutional determination has not matched \n     technological reach. But that may be about to change.\n       Sen. John Warner, R-Va, chairman of the Armed Services \n     Committee, recently announced that he supports efforts to \n     make one-third of the U.S. operational deep strike aircraft \n     unmanned by 2010, and one-third of ground vehicles unmanned \n     by 2015.\n       Such a significant change in how the United States conducts \n     military operations would have a profound impact on future \n     national security efforts. Having spent many years of my \n     career in the defense industry working on unmanned systems, I \n     believe Warner's goals are reasonable aspirations. In my \n     view, such an acceleration reflects both a technological \n     possibility and an operational necessity. Certainly, there \n     are technological challenges to be overcome, but the greatest \n     obstacle may be our past experiences and concepts.\n       A senior defense official commented last year that, by the \n     year 2050, there will be no manned aircraft in the military \n     inventory. A growing number of senior officers see this \n     transition as inevitable. However, most do not see it as \n     imminent. The 50-year period suggested in that observation \n     approximates the chronological distance separating Kitty Hawk \n     from Sputnik.\n       Although there are certainly issues to be resolved, \n     particularly regarding command and control, we know \n     considerably more today about building and controlling \n     unmanned vehicles than the Wright Brothers did about \n     rocketry.\n       Certainly, there are those who harbor reservations about \n     unmanned systems. But I have been surprised at the growing \n     acceptance of these technologies across the Defense \n     Department. Field commanders, in particular, increasingly are \n     confident and comfortable about conducting unmanned strikes. \n     During Operation Desert Fox--the fourth-day campaign against \n     Iraq in December 1998--72 percent of the strikes were \n     conducted by unmanned cruise missiles. By comparison, during \n     the first four days of Operation Desert Storm in 1991, only 6 \n     percent of the strikes were conducted with cruise missiles.\n       Although the scales of these two operations were \n     significantly different, this dramatic shift to unmanned \n     strike systems reflects a fundamental operational change.\n       As Gen. Michael Ryan, Air Force chief of staff, has \n     commented on several occasions, cruise missiles and other \n     standoff munitions are merely unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) \n     on a ``one-way trip.'' Transitioning to UAVs that are re-\n     usable and capable of making numerous trips dropping less \n     costly precision munitions is within our near-term \n     technological ability.\n       Calculations suggest that in fewer than 10 missions, \n     unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAVs) dropping ordnance \n     similar to Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) become \n     considerably more cost-effective than cruise missiles. \n     Furthermore, these calculations do not consider additional \n     cost savings resulting from lower manning and routine \n     operational costs.\n       In the intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) \n     mission area, UAVs already are well accepted. The recent \n     testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee by Gens. \n     Wesley Clark and Anthony Zinni, commanders-in-chief of two of \n     our more important regional commands, reflects this trend. \n     Both articulated the need for a larger number of UAVs for ISR \n     missions that ``are 24-hour-a-day capable and are adverse-\n     weather capable.''\n       In my view, this is a near-term possibility. Assets such as \n     the Global Hawk system provide such a capability. When teamed \n     with other key ISR assets, such as the joint surveillance \n     target attack radar system (JSTARS) and the airborne warning \n     and control system (AWACS), U.S. commanders will have a \n     formidable capability for seeing their operational area in \n     real-time, in all weather. Other assets--such as the Predator \n     UAV, the Army's new tactical UAV, and the Navy's vertical \n     take-off UAV--will offer high-fidelity battlefield \n     surveillance to tactical commanders.\n\n\n                         organizational issues\n\n       There are numerous tactics, techniques, and procedures, as \n     well as organizational and operational issues to be resolved \n     on how all of these systems work together, and how they are-\n     controlled and integrated to form a common operational \n     picture. But the work currently under way by the Joint Forces \n     Command's experimentation program will highlight the major \n     issues and suggest reasonable solutions.\n       A study on unmanned systems conducted by the Government \n     Electronics and Information Technology Association (GEIA) \n     last fall concluded that in all areas--air, land and sea--\n     both institutional and technological barriers to the expanded \n     use of unmanned systems were dropping rapidly. The report \n     concluded that a heavy reliance on UAVs in both the ISR and \n     attack roles would happen sooner, rather than later. This \n     suggest that others in industry, as well as the government, \n     share this perspective.\n       Unmanned systems address two pressing problems. First, not \n     only will they be less expensive to build, but their \n     ownership costs will be lower. Since the aircraft fly \n     themselves, their ``mission managers'' can be trained on \n     simulators. The aircraft can be kept in storage until needed, \n     thus lowering operations and maintenance costs that currently \n     consume a high percentage of the defense budget.\n       Second, unmanned systems empower our troops, while lowering \n     the risks that they assume. In an age where manpower is \n     becoming more expensive, and sensitivity to casualties more \n     prominent, performing ``dirty and dangerous'' missions with \n     unmanned systems is likely to become an imperative. Moreover, \n     by removing the real constraints associated with having \n     humans on board, unmanned systems can provide greater range, \n     greater mission endurance, and great agility. Such systems \n     expand the options available to national and operational \n     leaders.\n       The issue of greater use of UAVs is less ``can we do it?'' \n     than ``do we want to do it?'' In my view, the first question \n     is already answered: We can do it. The second question is a \n     function of institutional commitment and funding. Warner's \n     bold vision is certain to stimulate discussion that will \n     inevitably lead others to the conclusion that several \n     factors--strategic, operational, and fiscal--\n\n[[Page S6830]]\n\n     indicate that we must make this transformation. When that \n     question is resolved, those of us in the defense industry are \n     confident that we are prepared to do our part in making that \n     vision a reality.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6830-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6830-S6832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SEMINAR ON THE GEORGIA REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, in May 2000, a delegation from Georgia \nattended a five-day seminar in western Sicily to help further a culture \nof lawfulness in Georgia. The delegation consisted of government \nofficials as well as senior educators, representatives from the \nOrthodox Church, and the media. The program was organized by two non-\ngovernmental organizations--the National Strategy Information Center in \nWashington, D.C. and the Sicilian Renaissance Institute in Palermo, \nSicily--with financial assistance from the City of Palermo and the U.S. \nDepartment of State. The seminar featured presentations on key aspects \nof the Sicilian Renaissance as well as one-on-one meetings between \nGeorgians and their Sicilian counterparts to discuss specific programs \nthat could be implemented in Georgia. The focus was on how in recent \ndecades cultural change in Palermo and other parts of Sicily helped \nreduce crime and corruption, the lessons from the Sicilian experience \nthat may have applicability to Georgia, and how the Sicilian experience \ncan be modified or replicated in Georgia. The consensus of the Georgian \ndelegation was that the achievements of the Sicilians were remarkable \nand that many of the practices that have been effective in Sicily are \napplicable to the prevention of crime and corruption in Georgia. The \ndelegation is now developing culture of lawfulness programs with \nspecific products, and methods of evaluation. Additional sectors of \nsociety such as the police, social workers, NGO's will become involved \nas progress is made.\n  Mr. President, this program is one that attempts to go to the root of \none of the major problems left over from decades of communist rule: \ncorruption. The National Strategy Information Center should be \ncommended and encouraged in these types of programs. This is exactly \nthe kind of program we should be encouraging not just in Georgia but in \nthe other Silk Road countries as well.\n  I request unanimous consent that the following article from the \nGiornale di Sicilia (Palermo) be printed in the Record with my remarks. \nIt is an interview with Vakhtang Sartania, Rector of the Pedagogical \nUniversity of Tblisi, Georgia, and head of the delegation visiting \nSicily, about the visit to Sicily.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        [From the Giornale di Sicilia (Palermo), June 5, 2000.]\n\n             Tbilisi.

There are \n     lots of similarities between this country and Georgia: here, \n     too, people are straightforward, well-disposed towards others \n     and proud of their culture; even nature is very similar.'' \n     Vakhtang Sartania is about to leave Palermo and, together \n     with some souvenirs, he is bringing back in this suitcase the \n     image of a city that he found different from the usual \n     cliche. And he tells it with great enthusiasm. Sartania is \n     the Rector of the Pedagogical University of Tbilisi, the \n     capital (twinned with Palermo) of the former Soviet State of \n     Georgia; he led a delegation, invited by the Sicilian \n     Renaissance Institute and the City of Palermo, that had \n     meetings at all levels for five days in order to understand \n     what ``Palermo's spring'' is about, what the ``culture of \n     lawfulness'' of which Leoluca Orlando speaks so much consists \n     of, and how it happened that in the city of the mafioso \n     terror there are today only a few murders. It was not be \n     change that the Georgian delegation included mostly \n     educators, plus an orthodox priest from the Academy of \n     Clergy, and only one specialist in national security.\n       ``Perhaps,'' Sartania says ``the image which most impressed \n     me was that of a schoolboy, Umberto, who during our visit \n     came up to Mayor Orlando and patted him on the arm, showing \n     how happy he was to meet him.''\n       It can be read as a sign of a new relationship between \n     citizens and institutions * * *\n       ``It surely can. You see, I come from a country that has \n     experienced war and has only recently regained freedom. But, \n     just like Sicily, Georgia too has given a remarkable \n     contribution to the world culture. That's why I was very \n     pleased to see Palermo so lively from the civil point of \n     view, and I think that credit for this must be given to the \n     Church and Mayor Orlando, who can be considered the symbol of \n     such transformation.''\n       Did Palermo appear to you different from what you expected?\n       ``Movies and books often give us a different image of this \n     country, and I must admit that I expected to find here a \n     gloomier atmosphere. Perhaps many, even in my country, think \n     it to be still so; the truth is that you have nice people and \n     nice cities here. Anyway, I was expecting a city different \n     from the way it is usually described.''\n       What did this feeling originate from?\n       ``From past contacts between Sicilians and Georgians. For \n     instance, in 1968 some earthquake refugees from the Belice \n     Valley were given hospitality in my country for some time. \n     And since Sicilians don't like to feel in debt, six years ago \n     some Sicilian families began to give hospitality to children \n     coming from Abchasia, A Georgian region with many \n     difficulties''.\n       You came here to understand what's behind local successes \n     in the fight against the Mafia. Is your country too menaced \n     by organized crime?\n       ``Georgia has a very important geo-political position \n     because it connects Asia with Europe. Commercial links have \n     just started being developed, such as those in the oil sector \n     or the so-called ``silk route''. There's the risk that \n     organized crime may infiltrate into or exploit such links for \n     illicit traffic. We must be ready to avoid it. Above all, we \n     must work on prevention''.\n       Is this the reason why your delegation consists mostly of \n     educators?\n       ``Your experience in combating the Mafia is very \n     interesting, and we look at the promotion of a ``culture of \n     lawfulness'' with special attention. We must transmit \n     positive values, such as patriotism and tolerance, and must \n     invest resources in that direction. In our current phase, so \n     delicate for our country, we must explain that welfare is \n     good, but it has to be legal; that family has a great value; \n     that family, school and society are the foundations of an \n     educational system. But I wish also to add that our \n     relationship must be based on a two-way exchange. We've got a \n     lot to learn, but others too can learn from us.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n   [From the Press-Office of the President of Georgia, July 11, 2000]\n\n         Statement of the President of Georgia, E. Shevardnadze\n\n       My fellow compatriots, I would like to draw your attention \n     to one of the urgent problems facing Georgia.\n       Yesterday I signed the Decree on the ``National \n     Anticorruption Program'', according to which a special \n     authorized group of the highest level was established, headed \n     by Mr. Lado Chauturia, Chairman of the Supreme Court of \n     Georgia.\n       This group shall elaborate several stages of the \n     anticorruption program, oriented on various trends, which \n     will be the ground for very radical actions and corresponding \n     policy.\n       There is no time left, the situation is unbearable, our \n     society expects the urgent measures from us.\n       I would say, that I made this very hard decision after \n     beginning of the process of economical improvement in the \n     country. It is\n\n[[Page S6831]]\n\n     enough to say, that in the first part of the current year the \n     Gross Domestic Product has increased by 5 percent, and the \n     industrial output by--11 percent in comparison with the same \n     period of the last year. The export volume is increasing, and \n     it is important, that since 1998 the change in the tax \n     incomes' gross has taken place for the first time.\n       All I said indicates that the country will definitely \n     overcome the both--the budgetary and the financial crisis; \n     the significant economic growth will occur, the problems \n     related to unpaid salaries, pensions and other kinds of \n     payments will be solved as well as those of social \n     assistance.\n       But the success will be temporary only; the country will \n     fail to recover entirely, if we do not have the clear, exact \n     and active anticorruption program as a firm basis for it.\n       Let me label this social disease as ``malignant tumor'', \n     that is removable with pain, but necessary measures should be \n     taken urgently.\n       I should be fair and remind you--much was done during the \n     last 4 years in order to set some limits to ``corruption \n     space'' and for creation of the anticorruption basis in \n     Georgia.\n       Proper legislative system was created and that is very \n     important. Criminal, Civil and Administrative Codes \n     reflecting contemporary realities and national specific \n     nature were worked out and approved. The common courts and \n     Supreme Court have the new legislative basis.\n       Many laws have been approved, intended against the \n     corruption processes in the society. The law ``On Licenses'', \n     ``On State Purchase'', ``On Monopoly Activities and \n     Competition'' and many others are among them.\n       The law ``On Conflict of Interests at Public Service and \n     Corruption'' is worth to mention on the ground of which \n     Information Bureau for Ownership and Financial State of \n     Higher Officials has done a large-scale work.\n       The judicial reform has been carried out--the penitentiary \n     system was subordinated to the Ministry of Justice.\n       Two thousand persons were arrested within last three years \n     for committing crimes like abuse of one's position and \n     misappropriation of State property. The six hundred of them \n     have been already imprisoned.\n       These facts seem to prove the intensity of our struggle, \n     but our efforts are not still enough. At the same time, one \n     must consider the unfit system of the law enforcement bodies \n     extremely hard material and financial conditions of the \n     employees, poor technical basis.\n       Yet, I believe, that law enforcement bodies and reforms \n     therein are of great importance and they will intensify \n     combat of corruption.\n       They should not wait final preparation of the program but \n     intensify the activities for establishment of the \n     corresponding fund.\n       The interested bodies have suggested the several versions \n     of the anticorruption program.\n       Most of them are interesting and I would emphasize the \n     suggestions of the local administrations, local self-\n     governing bodies, and of course, the corresponding \n     Parliamentary Committees.\n       As for my yesterday's special Decree about the \n     anticorruption program, I have already said, it has a very \n     important function and liabilities.\n       Well, I think I must share several opinions.\n       The first conceptual thesis is that the corruption has \n     reached the crucial level with its scale and nature, that \n     makes dubious almost every State initiative and \n     implementation of some Governmental programs.\n       Unfortunately, the high level of the corruption has damaged \n     authority not of the Government only, but of the Georgian \n     independent state.\n       The fulfillment of both interior and foreign priorities is \n     immediately connected with the necessity of suppressing \n     corruption.\n       I am not departing from my responsibility and am fully \n     responsible for this situation.\n       But nobody should forget that President of the State is \n     able to do only what the society and the whole country are \n     capable of performing.\n       Since the end of the civil war and bloody conflicts, and \n     until now, I had to compromise on some issues, in order to \n     rescue the other more important and more priority values for \n     the moment.\n       Last 8 years of my governing have been devoted to turning \n     of almost ill independent Georgian State into a healthy one, \n     and to create it in fact.\n       That's why I had to make a hard choice concerning, problems \n     to be solved on the first stage and proper use of our poor \n     resources more effectively.\n       Once more, I declare with all responsibility: nowadays \n     nothing can be of more important issue for Georgia's society \n     and State development, than combating corruption.\n       All other issues must be subordinated to the settlement of \n     this strategic issue.\n       The second: the long-term and detailed analysis of the \n     corruption as a phenomenon in the country allows me to \n     conclude the following: In spite of some proper programs, the \n     anticorruption activities up to now produced no desirable \n     results. The local programs failed to create proper State \n     mechanisms, able to solve the problems.\n       In other words, the solving of the State-scale problems \n     appeared impossible within the framework of the separate \n     actions. Even the judicial reform, quite effective \n     anticorruption action by itself was not enough evidently.\n       It goes without doubt, that in order to solve large-scale \n     State problems, it is necessary to elaborate a multistage \n     statewide program.\n       Meanwhile, the program must be supported by the consequent \n     actions systems, finances, and social-political factors and \n     by the active support in the society.\n       The third: My long-term experience of being at the wheel of \n     the country, has assured me that unprepared actions hear only \n     a campaign, surface character and can yield only temporary \n     results.\n       In some cases, the populist impulsiveness may only \n     aggravate the problem. So, instead of recovery from the grave \n     disease we are likely to get the opposite result.\n       That is why I acted so carefully.\n       That's why, I consider it both necessary and possible to \n     undertake the radical measures after common State program for \n     complex anticorruption policy was prepared. I would say, the \n     national program and the corresponding executive mechanism \n     will be created.\n       As we established the anticorruption service and some \n     corrupted officials have been arrested, I could have earned \n     more ``grades'' in the pre-electoral period, but I am sure, \n     that we would not be able to combat corruption, and that \n     would only worsen the situation by populist actions.\n       The fourth: working out of the anticorruption program will \n     be the ultimate step for the fulfillment of my main purpose--\n     to combat corruption in Georgia for good.\n       I am sure, that after recovery from the disease, the \n     Georgian State will be healthy and sound, and Georgian people \n     will have own everlasting prospects of the national \n     development.\n       I declare that the statement of the anticorruption program \n     that will be submitted to me by the group, working on it \n     presently will be a cornerstone of my policy during the \n     second term of my Presidency, as it is economic growth at \n     present stage.\n       The same statement and recommendations define the purposes \n     and rights of the special anticorruption service or the \n     anticorruption committee.\n       The necessity of creation of such a body is the topic of a \n     large-scale discussion in the society, which must be \n     continued.\n       The fifth: the members of the group, working at the \n     program, (it is remarkable, that the number of the group's \n     members may be enlarged, if necessary), as well as the \n     invited guests (I mean the well-known foreign experts), must \n     gain the trust and create the necessary authority in the \n     society, important for implementation of the program.\n       This group will depart from narrow political interests. It \n     will realize a super-party, nationwide mission and shall \n     cooperate with those political forces, for which corruption \n     is national insult, humiliation of national dignity, source \n     of national and social jeopardy and not the life style.\n       The sixth: I completely understand the great national \n     importance of these tasks. I have made this strong decision. \n     My political will is firm. I address to my adherents, \n     companions, the members of government, parliamentarians; I \n     categorically demand from them to accept president's will \n     with complete responsibility and understanding.\n       The first victims of anti-corruption policy should be those \n     unkind officials and statesmen, who are determined to reach \n     their aims and goals by using their positions, enjoying \n     partisan or relationship links with me for their own \n     prosperity and not for strengthening the national buildup.\n       The seventh, I strongly believe that anti-corruption \n     activities will receive complete support from the citizens of \n     Georgia and from the whole Georgian society. At the same \n     time, all of us need to acknowledge our civil and national \n     responsibilities.\n       In this complicated and non-compromising combat, we, the \n     society and government, must defend the superiority of \n     justice and law, we must categorically exclude the efforts of \n     mutual punishment, blackmailing and civil counteract.\n       I gave a special importance to the support and principal \n     attitude of the press, primarily television and mass media at \n     large.\n       The Georgian media is our democracy's important \n     achievement. For several times, it showed veritable national, \n     patriotic attitude toward the national affair and devotion \n     toward any national interest.\n       Even more patriotism and intense sense of responsibility \n     are necessary today.\n       In the process of being of vital importance, the unity of \n     words and actions must turn into principal measure and basis \n     of patriotism for every citizen and government official.\n       More than this, during the program elaboration, and while \n     its implementation, no single agency shall avoid the \n     responsibility that it invested in it by the law and all \n     agencies shall be obligated to fight against corruption.\n       I want to add that to combat corruption with some \n     repressive methods implies a certain preventive system, an \n     active application of economic lever and mechanism, the \n     restriction and suppression of criminals in the economic \n     sphere.\n       I don't suspect that in the present circumstances, when the \n     society has realized the importance of such a destructive \n     vice, with joint will and endeavor Georgia can overcome this \n     problem and recover from such a shameful disease as \n     corruption represents itself.\n       In response, our generation will regain the right and honor \n     to look into the face of the next generation proudly and \n     create healthy, honest and democratic order in Georgia.\n       It is my firm decision and I will use all my strength, \n     experience and facility to realize it.\n\n[[Page S6832]]\n\n       And now, let me announce the Decree.\n       ``On Elaboration of National Anti-corruption Program''\n       ``Taking into consideration the scale and the complexity of \n     the corruption and to increase the effectiveness of \n     activities for its suppression a national group shall be set \n     up to the office of President of Georgia.

I want to make sure \nthe Record reflects that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6832-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6832-S6834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2001\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2549, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for FY2001. Included in the bill \nthat passed today are several amendments that will significantly \nimprove the lives of active duty members, reservists, military \nretirees, veterans, and their families.\n  These amendments greatly improved the version of the bill that came \nout of the Armed Services Committee. I had voted against reporting the \nbill out of the Committee because it did not include important measures \nfor military personnel and neglected the issue of defense reform.\n  The critical amendments that were included in the legislation that \npassed today will: remove servicemembers from food stamps; increase pay \nfor mid-grade Petty Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers; assist \ndisabled veterans in claims processing; restore retirement pay for \ndisabled military retirees; provide survivor benefit plan enhancements; \nauthorize a low-cost life insurance plan for spouses and their \nchildren; enhance benefits and retirement pay for Reservists and \nNational Guardsmen; authorize back-pay for certain WWII Navy and Marine \nCorps Prisoners of War; and provide for significant acquisition reform \nby eliminating domestic source restrictions on the procurement of \nshipyard cranes.\n  One of the areas of greatest concern among military retirees and \ntheir families is the ``broken promise'' of lifetime medical care, \nespecially for those over age 65. While the Committee had included some \nkey health care provisions, it failed to meet the most important \nrequirement, the restoration of this broken promise.\n  With severe recruitment and retention problems still looming, we must \nbetter compensate our mid-grade enlisted servicemembers who are \ncritical to leading the junior enlisted force. We have significantly \nunderpaid enlisted servicemembers since the beginning of the All-\nVolunteer Force. The value of the mid-grade NCO pay, compared to that \nof the most junior enlisted, has dropped 50% since the All-Volunteer \nForce was enacted by Congress in 1973. This pay provision for the mid-\ngrade enlisted ranks, up to $700 per year, plus the food stamp pay \nprovision of an additional $180 per month for junior enlisted \nservicemembers, provides a significant increase in pay for enlisted \nservicemembers.\n  The National Guard and Reserves have become a larger percentage of \nthe Total Force and are essential partners in a wide range of military \noperations. Due to the higher deployment rates of the active duty \nforces, the Reserve Components are being called upon more frequently \nand for longer periods of time than ever before. We must stop treating \nthem like a ``second-class'' force.\n  I would like to emphasize the importance of enacting meaningful \nimprovements for our servicemembers, their families and their \nsurvivors. They risk their lives to protect our freedom and preserve \ndemocracy. We should compensate them adequately, improve the benefits \nto their families and survivors, and enhance the quality of life for \nthe Reserves and National Guard in a similar manner as the active \nforces.\n  Each year the number of disabled veterans appealing their health care \ncases continues to increase. It is Congress' duty to ensure that the \ndisability claims process is less complex, less burdensome, and more \nefficient. Likewise, we should restore retirement pay for disabled \nmilitary retirees.\n  I would also like to point out that this year's defense authorization \nbill contained over $1.9 billion in pork-- unrequested add-ons to the \ndefense\n\n[[Page S6833]]\n\nbudget that robs our military of vital funding on priority issues. \nWhile this year's total is less than previous years' it is still $1.9 \nbillion too much. We need to, and can do better. I ask that the \ndetailed list of pork on this bill be included in the Congressional \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCAIN. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize the importance \nof enacting meaningful improvements for active duty and Reserve \nmembers. They risked their lives to defend our shores and preserve \ndemocracy and we can not thank them enough for their service. But we \ncan pay them more, improve the benefits for their families, and support \nthe Reserve Components in a similar manner as the active forces.\n  We must ensure that the critical amendments that I have outlined \nsurvive the Conference process and are enacted into law. Our \nservicemembers past, present, and future need these improvements, and \nthe bill that we passed today is just one step on the road to reform.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n

Mr. President, I rise today to express my serious \ndisappointment with the Fiscal Year 2001 Department of Defense \nAuthorization bill, which passed the Senate earlier this week. I \nopposed a number of provisions in the bill, including language to \nrestructure and rename the School of Americas. It is this issue which I \nwould like to address today.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Department of Defense recognizes \nthere are serious problems with the School of the Americas, otherwise \nthey would not have gone to the trouble of proposing to repackage it. \nBut make no mistake, that is all that has happened. While the name may \nnot remain the same, the School of the Americas still exists.\n  Mr. President, I think a little history is in order here. The School \nof the Americas was founded in 1946, originally in the U.S.-controlled \nPanama Canal Zone. At that time, it was known as the Latin American \nCenter-Ground Division. In 1963, the facility was renamed the School of \nthe Americas, and in 1984, in compliance with the Panama Canal Treaty, \nthe school was moved to Fort Benning, Georgia as part of the U.S. Army \nTraining and Doctrine Command.\n  SOA was charged with the mission of developing and conducting \ninstruction for the armed forces of Latin America. Unfortunately, what \nSOA has produced are some of the most notorious dictators and human \nrights abusers from Latin America including El Salvador death squad \nleader Roberto D'Abuisson, Panamanian dictator and drug dealer Manuel \nNoriega, Argentinian dictators Leopold Galtieri and Roberto Viola, and \nPeruvian dictator Juan Velasco Alvarado.\n  Mr. President, the list continues. SOA alumni include 48 of the 69 \nSalvadoran military members cited in the U.N. Truth Commission's report \non El Salvador for involvement in human rights violations, including 19 \nof 27 military members implicated in the 1989 murder of six Jesuit \npriests.\n  SOA alumni reportedly also include more than 100 Colombian military \nofficers alleged to be responsible for human rights violations, and \nseveral Peruvian military officers linked to the July 1992 killings of \nnine students and a professor from Peru's La Cantutu University.\n  SOA alumni include several Honduran officers linked to a clandestine \nmilitary force known as Battalion 316 responsible for disappearances in \nthe early 1980s.\n  And, SOA graduates have led military coups and are responsible for \nmassacres of hundreds of people, including the Uraba massacre in \nColombia, the El Mozote massacre of 900 civilians in El Salvador, the \nassassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, the torture and murder of a \nUN worker, and hundreds of other human rights abuses.\n  Mr. President, it is not merely coincidence that SOA has such an \negregious list of alumni. In September, 1996, the Department of Defense \nmade available excerpts from seven Spanish-language training manuals \nused at SOA and it was revealed that those manuals included instruction \nin extortion, execution, and torture techniques that the Pentagon \nconceded were ``clearly objectionable and possibly illegal.''\n  Even today, the SOA legacy lives on. Just this past January, another \nSOA graduate, Guatemala Col. Byron Disrael Lima Estrada, was arrested \nfor his involvement in the death of Guatemalan Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi \nin 1998. As CRS noted, Bishop Gerardi was murdered in April of 1998 \njust two days after he released a report accusing the Guatemalan \nmilitary for most of the human rights abuses committed during the \ncountry's conflict.\n  Mr. President, as I mentioned earlier, while the Department of \nDefense will ostensibly close the School of the Americas, it is \nproducing a clone in its place. The Department of Defense Authorization \nbill establishes the Western Hemisphere Institute for Professional \nEducation and Training--an institution that appears in every way to be \nnothing more than a repackaged School of the Americas.\n  To my knowledge, nothing has been done to ensure that a thorough \nevaluation of SOA is conducted before this new entity is operational. \nAs SOA Watch has noted, there appears to be no critical assessment of \nthe training, procedures, performance or consequences of the SOA \ntraining program this new entity copies.\n  I regret the Pentagon has not taken more meaningful steps to address \nthe horrifying legacy of SOA. I support closing SOA permanently, not \nmerely changing its name.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced by the \nsenior Senator from Illinois (Mr. Durbin) that would terminate this \nprogram.\n  But, Mr. President, even if there were any justification for \ncontinuing some portion of the School of the Americas, it should come \nonly after a truly serious and independent review is made of the \npurpose, mission, curricula, administrative structure, and student \nselection of the new entity.\n  Given the bloody heritage of SOA, the very least we owe the people of \nLatin America and the innocent who have been killed is such a review. \nUnfortunately, that is not what will happen.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I am \ncommitted to promoting human rights throughout the world. While it may \nbe appropriate for the United States military to train its colleagues \nfrom other nations, it is inexcusable that this training should take \nplace at an institution with a reputation far beyond salvage. In my \nview, our government cannot continue to support the existence of a \nschool or a simple repackaging of that school which has so many \nmurderers among its alumni.\n  Mr. President, I will be watching this new institution very closely, \nand so, I have no doubt, will many of my constituents. My concerns \nabout accountability and transparency have not been sufficiently \naddressed, and I will continue to raise this issue until I am satisfied \nthat the U.S. Government has finally and firmly brought an end to the \nshameful legacy of the School of Americas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6834-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6834-S6836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CHINA AND NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, 3 years ago I came to the Senate floor to \ntalk about China and how the United States can best achieve its \nnational interests in the Far East.\n  I spoke then on the eve on two summits which went a long way toward \nputting the U.S.-China relationship on a firmer foundation. I called \nfor a patient, principled engagement strategy designed to win greater \nChinese compliance with international norms in the areas of human \nrights, nonproliferation, and trade.\n  Three years later, there has been some progress, but also some \nsetbacks.\n  U.S.-China relations remain dogged by uncertainties--each side \nharbors doubts about the other's intentions, doubts reinforced by \nallegations of Chinese espionage and the tragic mistaken U.S. bombing \nof the Chinese embassy in Belgrade. China's fear of how we might \nexploit our position as the world's only superpower is matched by our \nconcerns over China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \nits intimidation tactics against Taiwan. China's leaders decry U.S. \n``hegemony'' and ``interference in their internal affairs.'' We worry \nabout whether the Dragon will breathe fire at its neighbors, or just \nblow smoke.\n  So today I rise at what I believe may be a pivotal moment which will \ndetermine our Nation's future in Asia not just for this year, or next \nyear, but for 10 years, 20 years, and into the world my grandchildren \nwill inherit.\n  Three decisions--on national missile defense, on invoking sweeping \nnew unilateral sanctions on China, and on extending permanent normal \ntrade relations to China--will help shape U.S. strategic doctrine and \nirrevocably alter the security landscape in East Asia for decades to \ncome. They are decisions which must be made in the context of \nrevolutionary changes underway on the\n\n[[Page S6835]]\n\nKorean Peninsula and an awakening China which wants to play in major \nleagues, but is not sure it wants to abide by all the rules of the \ngame.\n  Today I wish to address the first of these three major decisions--\nnational missile defense--as it relates to China and recent \ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula.\n  Mr. President, I rise with optimism--my mother calls me a \n``congenital optimist.'' Not the optimism of a Phillies fan--a blind, \nfervent optimism born each spring, matured each summer, and dashed \nagainst the rocks by fall. No, I speak with the confidence which flows \nfrom the enormous capacity and good will of the American people. I am \noptimistic because we now enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to shape \nthe future in ways which will enhance our national security and \npreserve our prosperity.\n  I reject the path of unrelieved pessimism and lack of common sense \nwhich, to me, underlies much of the thinking of those who believe China \nmust be an enemy of the United States, and that North Korea can neither \nbe deterred nor persuaded to abandon its pursuit of a nuclear missile \ncapability.\n  I reject the pessimism which says that American idealism and the \ndynamism of American markets are somehow incapable of handling the \nopportunities which will be ours as China joins the World Trade \nOrganization and opens its markets to the world.\n  But my optimism is informed by realism.\n  Let me put it bluntly: China does not believe that National Missile \nDefense is oriented against North Korea. According to those who justify \na limited national missile defense on the basis of the North Korean \nthreat, North Korea is ruled by a nutcase who by 2005 will be in \nposition to launch an ICBM with weapons of mass destruction against the \nUnited States, and will do so without giving one thought to the \nconsequences.\n  Who can blame China for questioning this rationale for a national \nmissile defense? I question it myself.\n  The notion that North Korea's leader Kim Jong-il is going to wake up \none morning and decide to attack the United States with long-range \nmissiles armed with weapons of mass destruction is absurd!\n  The notion that 5 or 10 long-range missiles would deter us from \ndefending South Korea is equally bogus. Did the Soviet Union's ability \nto devastate the United States prevent us from defending Europe for a \ngeneration and West Berlin in 1961, even in the face of superior Warsaw \nPact strength on the ground? No.\n  Did it stop us from forcing the removal of missiles from Cuba in \n1963, or from supplying Afghan mujaheddin in their successful struggle \nagainst Soviet forces? No.\n  Has China's ability to deliver a nuclear strike against a dozen or \nmore U.S. cities prevented us from defending Taiwan? No, again.\n  Moreover, in the wake of the first North-South Summit meeting ever, \nthe prospects for peaceful reconciliation between North and South Korea \nare better today than they have been in my lifetime. I'm not saying \nthat peace on the Korean Peninsula is a ``done deal.'' Far from it. \nNorth Korea has not withdrawn its heavy artillery. North Korea has not \nabandoned its missile program. North Korea has not halted all of its \nsupport for international terrorist organizations. There is a \ntremendous amount of hard work to be done.\n  But look at the facts that relate to our decision on national missile \ndefense.\n  The last time North Korea launched a missile, I remind my colleagues, \nwas on August 31, 1998. On that day, a three stage Taepo-Dong missile \nflew over Japan. The third stage of the missile apparently failed to \nperform as the North Koreans had hoped, but the mere existence of the \nthird stage surprised many of our experts and caused them to reassess \nthe North's capabilities and to advance the date by which North Korea \nmight develop an ICBM to 2005.\n  But since August 1998, North Korea has not launched a long-range \nmissile. It recently extended indefinitely the test-launch moratorium \nit implemented 15 months ago. Negotiations are underway right now with \nthe objective of curtailing North Korea's development and export of \nlong-range missiles.\n  Now the pessimists say that North Korea will never agree to forego \ndevelopment, deployment, or export of long-range ballistic missiles.\n  But then, the pessimists also said that the North Koreans would never \nopen their nuclear facilities to round-the-clock monitoring by the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, would never stop construction on \nits heavy water nuclear reactors, would never permit World Food Program \nmonitoring of food deliveries throughout North Korea, would never hold \na summit meeting with South Korea, would never undertake economic \nreforms, and so on. Guess what? They have been wrong on all counts.\n  And what does Kim Dae-jung, the President of South Korea, have to say \nabout the temperament of Kim Jong-il? All evidence points to a North \nKorean leader who is intelligent, rational, and coldly calculating. Not \nthe type of guy who gets up on the wrong side of bed in the morning and \ndecides to ensure the complete annihilation of his country by launching \na few nuclear missiles at the United States.\n\n  How does all this relate to China? The fact is, North Korea is in a \nworld of hurt since the collapse of the Soviet Union. China is the \nNorth's major trading partner and aid donor, and it has successfully \nurged North Korea to engage with South Korea and curtail its missile \ntesting.\n  Why? Is it because China wants to be helpful to us? Perhaps. But I \ndoubt it.\n  No. China is acting in its own self interest. China knows that if \nNorth Korea presses ahead with its missile program, the United States \nis almost certain to deploy a national missile defense against that \nthreat. And if we do, even a limited system will seriously undermine \nChina's tiny nuclear deterrent.\n  China has only a handful of old, silo-based, liquid-fueled missiles \ncapable of delivering a nuclear payload to the United States. Beijing \ncalculates that any U.S. system sufficient to deal with 10-12 North \nKorean missiles could also handle 10-20 Chinese ICBMs. And guess what? \nNotwithstanding our repeated protests to the contrary, they are \nprobably right.\n  So how can we expect China to respond if we foolishly rush ahead with \ndeployment of this unproven, expensive, national missile defense, for \nwhich the rationale is evaporating as I speak?\n  Well, for starters, China will have no further incentive to use its \ninfluence with North Korea to rein in the North's nuclear missile \nambitions. And North Korea, with no reason to trust the United States, \nmay opt to end its missile launch moratorium and proceed full speed \nwith the testing, deployment, and export of long-range ballistic \nmissiles.\n  Second, if we rush to deploy limited NMD, China itself will surely \ntake steps to ensure the survivability of its nuclear arsenal. They \nhave made that painfully clear. We already know that they are planning \nto move from silo-based liquid-fueled rockets to mobile, solid-fueled \nrockets which will be much harder for us to locate and destroy. They \nare probably going to do that no matter what we do.\n  But they have not decided how many missiles to manufacture, or \nwhether to MIRV them. Our actions will have a huge impact on their \nthinking. We already sent one unfortunate signal when the Senate \nrejected the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty. If we want to guarantee \nthat China will go from fewer than two dozen ICBM's to 200 or 2,000, \nthen by all means, let's just forge ahead with a national missile \ndefense without any consideration for how that decision will affect \nChina's nuclear posture and doctrine.\n  And if China responds as I fear they might, how will India respond? \nPakistan? Japan? And if in 5 or 10 years Japan feels compelled to go \nnuclear, how will South Korea respond?\n  Mr. President, there is a reason why our allies in East Asia are \nurging caution with respect to the deployment of a national missile \ndefense. They understand that bad U.S.-China relations are bad for \nregional stability. Listen to what a leading strategist in South Korea, \nDr. Lho Kyong-soo of Seoul National University, recently wrote about \nmissile defenses, China, and implications for the U.S.-South Korea \nalliance:\n\n       Needless to say, minus a clear-cut image of North Korea as \n     the `enemy,' the security rationale underpinning the alliance \n     is seriously weakened . . .\n\n[[Page S6836]]\n\n       Much will depend on how the relationship between the United \n     States and China evolves in the years ahead. If the \n     relationship becomes antagonistic, Seoul will find itself in \n     an extremely delicate position vis-a-vis Beijing, a situation \n     that it would clearly like to avoid at all costs.\n       There appears to be little awareness in Washington, \n     however, how its China policy, should it be mishandled, could \n     have possibly adverse consequences in terms of alliance \n     relations with Seoul, and, in all likelihood, with Tokyo as \n     well. The cautious stance taken by Seoul with respect to the \n     acquisition of even a lower-tier Theater Missile Defense \n     capability is but one example of Seoul's desire not to \n     unnecessarily create friction with Beijing.\n\n  So, Mr. President, this is a serious business.\n  I believe this body has not yet taken the time to consider the \nimplications of deploying a limited national missile defense for our \nbroader strategic interests in East Asia. I intend to raise these \nissues and others in the days ahead. If we are not to squander our \nmaterial wealth and our world leadership, we must consider carefully \nwhether a missile defense will maximize our overall national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6836-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6836-S6837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CHILDREN'S PUBLIC HEALTH ACT\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr President, I rise to join my colleagues Senators Frist, \nKennedy, Jeffords and others in support of our bill the ``Children's \nPublic Health Act of 2000''. This critical legislation seeks to improve \nthe lives of children in this nation by enhancing access to certain \nhealth care services and providing additional resources for pediatric \nhealth research. Children are our most precious resource, and we must \ndo all we can to enable our children to reach their full potential both \nphysically and intellectually. The Children's Public Health Act takes \nan important step toward achieving this goal by creating an environment \nwhere children are able to grow and develop unhindered by the burden of \ndisease.\n  Overall, tremendous improvements have been made in the quality of \nchildren's health over the past century. For instance, deadly and \ndebilitating diseases that were once prevalent during childhood have \nbeen largely eradicated thanks to advancements in vaccines.\n  Yet, even with these remarkable advancements, new problems have \narisen. In particular, over the past decade, we have seen dramatic \nincreases in the number of preventable childhood injuries, as well as a \nrise in diagnoses of asthma, autism, and diseases often attributed to \nobesity, such as diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension in young \nchildren. This legislation sets forth creative approaches for dealing \nwith these increasingly prevalent pediatric conditions.\n  Generally, the programs and initiatives authorized under the \nChildren's Public Health Act can be broken down into four specific \ncategories: (1) injury prevention; (2) maternal and infant health; (3) \npediatric health promotion and; (4) pediatric research. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to highlight a couple of the provisions included \nunder the pediatric health promotion section of the bill dealing with \nlead poisoning prevention and childhood obesity.\n  First, the Children's Public Health Act contains a section based on \nlegislation I introduced last year along with Senator Torricelli, \nentitled the Child Lead SAFE Act. This comprehensive bill seeks to \naddress an entirely preventable problem that continues to plague far \ntoo many children in this nation--lead poisoning. While tremendous \nstrides have been made over the last 20 years in reducing lead exposure \namong the population, it is estimated that nearly one million \npreschoolers nationwide still have excessive levels of lead in their \nblood--making lead poisoning the leading childhood environmental \ndisease. Childhood lead poisoning has a profound health and educational \nimpact on children.\n  Children with high blood lead levels can suffer from brain damage, \nbehavior and learning problems, slowed growth, and hearing problems, \namong other maladies. Moreover, children with a history of lead \npoisoning frequently require special education to compensate for \nintellectual deficits and behavioral problems that are caused by their \nexposure to lead. Research shows that children with elevated blood-lead \nlevels are seven times more likely to drop out of high school and six \ntimes more likely to have reading disabilities. By failing to eradicate \nlead poisoning, we are preventing our children from achieving their \nfullest potential and are also imposing significant health and special \neducation costs on taxpayers.\n\n  Timely childhood lead screening and appropriate follow-up care for \nchildren most at-risk of lead exposure is critical to mitigating the \nlong-term health and developmental effects of lead. Regrettably, our \ncurrent system is not adequately protecting our children from this \nhazard. Despite longstanding federal requirements for lead screening \nfor children enrolled in Medicaid and other federally funded health \ncare program, a January 1999 GAO report found that two-thirds of these \nchildren have never been screened and, consequently, remain untreated, \neventhough low-income children are at particular risk for lead \nexposure. As a result, there may be thousands of children with lead \npoisoning who continue to go undiagnosed.\n  The Children's Public Health Act will begin to address this problem \nby enhancing the existing lead grant program through the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention and authorizing new grant programs to \nconduct outreach and education for families at risk of lead poisoning, \nimplement community-based interventions to mitigate lead hazards, \nestablish uniform guidelines for reporting and tracking of blood lead \nscreening from laboratories and local health departments and ensure \ncontinuous quality measurement and improvement plans for communities \ndedicated to lead poisoning prevention. The legislation also provides \nresources for health care provider education and training on current \nlead screening practices and would require the Health Resources and \nServices Administration to submit an annual report to Congress on the \npercentage of children in the health centers programs who are screened \nfor lead poisoning.\n  A second element of this bill that I believe will have a major impact \non improving and preserving the health of children in this nation is a \nprovision related to childhood obesity. Over the past fifteen years, \nchildhood obesity rates have doubled. It is estimated that almost five \nmillion, or 11% of youth 6-19 years of age are seriously overweight. \nContributing to this trend has been the rise in fast food consumption, \ncoupled with an increasingly sedentary lifestyle where time engaged in \nphysical activity has been replaced by hours playing computer games and \nwatching television. Another reason for the lack of physical activity \nin children is the reduction of in daily participation in high school \nphysical education classes, which has declined from 42 percent in 1991 \nto 27 percent in 1997. Children simply do not have the time or \nopportunity to engage in healthy physical activities.\n  As a result, younger and younger Americans are showing the signs of \nobesity-related diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. Research \nshows that 60 percent of overweight 5-10 year old children already have \nat least one risk factor for heart disease, such as hypertension. If \nour society continues on this trend, obesity will soon rival smoking as \na leading cause of preventable death. Clearly, action needs to be taken \nto curb this potentially deadly epidemic.\n  The Children's Public Health Act acknowledges and attempts to reverse \nthis trend through a multi-pronged approach. First, the bill would \nprovide states and local communities with the resources they need to \ndevelop and implement creative approaches to promoting good nutrition \nhabits and enhancing the levels of physical activity among children. \nThe bill authorizes a new competitive grant program through the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, whereby states would develop \ncomprehensive, inter-agency, school- and community-based approaches to \nbetter physical and nutritional health in children and adolescents. \nThese programs would be evaluated and information about effective \nintervention models and obesity prevention strategies would be broadly \ndisseminated.\n  The legislation also calls for greater applied research in order to \nimprove our understanding of the many factors that contribute to \nobesity. Research will also focus on the study of the prevalence and \ncosts of childhood obesity and its effects into adulthood. Another\n\n[[Page S6837]]\n\naspect of the bill is the development of a nationwide public education \ncampaign informing families of the health risks associated with chronic \nobesity that provides information on incorporating good eating and \nregular physical activity into daily living. Lastly, the bill provides \nresources for health care provider education and training on evaluation \nand treatment practices for obese children or children at risk of \nbecoming obese.\n  Overall, this bill has many substantial provisions that will go a \nlong way in improving the health and well-being of our children. This \nlegislation not only expands the base of pediatric medical research \ncurrently ongoing, it also includes important enhancements in maternal \nand prenatal health as well as several other initiatives that will \ngreatly enhance access to services to children with chronic and \ndebilitating diseases.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues today on introducing this \nimportant legislation, and I look forward to working to pass the bill \nthrough the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the \nfull Senate this year.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6837-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6837]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PAYCHECK FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 74, The \nPaycheck Fairness Act. Over 30 years ago, President John Kennedy signed \nthe Equal Pay Act into law. At that time women were making only 61 \ncents for every dollar that was earned by a man. Since that time, we \nhave made significant strides to ensure equality in the workplace, \nhowever, the disparity in wages between men and women still exists.\n  Today, as a nation, women earn 74 cents for every dollar that a man \nearns. In Montana, the difference is even more significant, women are \nearning only 69 cents for every dollar that is earned by a man. This \ntranslates into more than $5,000 a year. This is unacceptable. We must \nhave pay equity.\n  In our state, and the country as a whole, women work a variety of \njobs, from minimum wage jobs, to women who run their own businesses. \nThe work that women do is not adequately reflected in the wages that \nthey earn.\n  In Montana we are faced with a unique situation--we are ranked almost \nlast in per capita income. The economic boom that has created \ntremendous wealth on Wall Street hasn't echoed on Main Street, Montana. \nIt is necessary to invest our resources to maintain our quality of life \nwhile creating good jobs and boosting our working families standard of \nliving. If women were paid equitably, Montana families would greatly \nbenefit. Family incomes would rise and, poverty rates would fall.\n  Mr. President, pay equity is not the entire solution to the economic \ndevelopment challenge. It is part of a package, we must also invest in \nand protect our small businesses. After all, small business is the \nbackbone of our economy. In order to improve jobs and wages in Montana \nand in the nation, we must maintain our educational systems. When we \nmake additional investments in education and job training, we can \nattract new businesses to our state, increase our wages, and prepare \nour children for the jobs of tomorrow.\n  If we are willing to do these things, economic growth will improve \nthe quality of life for all men and women of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6837-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6837-S6838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              CONSERVATION\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, on September 3, 1964, President Lyndon \nJohnson signed the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act. The Land and \nWater Conservation Fund, or LWCF, was created by Congress to use \nrevenues from Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas development--a non-\nrenewable resource--to invest in America's renewable resources by \ncreating parks and open spaces, protecting wilderness, wetlands and \nrefuges, preserving habitat, and enhancing recreational opportunities.\n  The LWCF has been a remarkable conservation success story. In its 35-\nyear history, LWCF has supported the acquisition of nearly 7 million \nacres of parkland and the development of more than 37,000 park and \nrecreation projects. In my state of Rhode Island alone, LWCF has \ninvested over $32 million in nearly 400 state and local parks projects, \nincluding $1.7 million for development of Roger Williams Park in \nProvidence, $1.1 million for Scarborough State Beach in Narragansett, \nand $536,000 for rehabilitation of the famous Cliff Walk in Newport. \nBecause State and local governments provide at least half of initial \nproject costs and assume all operation and maintenance costs in \nperpetuity, each Federal dollar leverages several dollars in non-\nFederal contributions.\n  But despite the LWCF's success, funding for the program has fallen \nwell below its authorized level of $900 million per year, and the \nstateside grant program was completely zeroed out in 1995, even as \noffshore oil and gas revenues increased and the need for parks and open \nspace continued to rise dramatically.\n  Last year, President Clinton proposed an historic Lands Legacy budget \ninitiative to fully fund the LWCF at its authorized level. Although \nappropriators did not fully fund the Lands Legacy budget request, \nMembers of Congress are clearly getting the message Americans are \nsending to Washington about the need for major conservation legislation \nto promote open space and recreation.\n  On May 11, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 701, the \nConservation and Reinvestment Act of 2000, by a vote of 315-102. The \n``CARA'' bill, which would automatically set aside revenues from \noffshore oil and gas leases to fully fund the Federal and State LWCF \ngrant programs for the first time in decades, was the product of an \nextraordinary bipartisan compromise between the House Resources \nCommittee chairman, Don Young, and the ranking member, George Miller. \nThe CARA bill would provide nearly $3 billion annually until 2015 to \nsupport conservation efforts across the country.\n  All eyes are now on the Senate, Mr. President. Across the country, \nAmericans in cities, suburbs, and rural areas have joined State \nGovernors, city and town planners, wildlife program managers, hunters \nand fishermen, and environmental organizations to call on the Senate to \nact on this historic legislation.\n  Several bills have been introduced in the Senate:\n  S. 2123, introduced by Senators Landrieu and Murkowski, is identical \nto H.R. 701 as reported by the House Resources Committee;\n  S. 2567, introduced by Senator Boxer, is identical to H.R. 701 as \npassed by the full House;\n  S. 2181, introduced by Senator Bingaman, would support many of the \nsame programs as the House bill but would distribute a greater \npercentage of LWCF stateside funds evenly among the states, benefitting \nstates with small populations, such as Rhode Island. In addition, it \nwould support a number of marine research and conservation programs;\n  And there are several more bills, all of which seek to fully fund the \nLWCF and preserve our natural heritage for future generations.\n  Mr. President, none of these bills is perfect; there is always room \nfor improvement. Members of the Senate may disagree, for example, on \nhow much funding should go to coastal assistance, or federal land \nacquisition in western states, or endangered species protection. I, for \none, believe it is critically important that we provide $125 million or \nmore each year for the Urban Parks and Recreation Recovery, UPARR, \nprogram, as well as full annual funding of $150 million for the \nHistoric Preservation Fund. We should also avoid creating incentives \nfor new offshore oil and gas drilling.\n  Whatever our differences over the details of this legislation, Mr. \nPresident, the important thing is that we pass a bill this year. Any \none of these conservation bills would represent an unprecedented and \ndesperately needed investment in our natural resources and our cultural \nand historic heritage.\n  But we have to act soon. There are, at best, 33 legislative days left \nin the 106th Congress. Many members of this body, myself included, are \ndisappointed that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has \npostponed several markups of the CARA bill. But we understand that \nChairman Murkowski and ranking member Bingaman are working to satisfy a \nwide array of regional interests on the Committee, and we continue to \nhope that an agreement can be reached in time for the Committee to \napprove the bill next week. We would urge the Majority\n\n[[Page S6838]]\n\nleadership to move the bill expeditiously to the floor following the \nCommittee's action.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to send to the President \na bill that will respond to our constituents' overwhelming calls for \nCongress to make a substantial and reliable investment in the \nconservation of our Nation's wildlife, coastal resources, and open \nspaces. The momentum is with us, and we should not miss this rare \nopportunity to create a conservation legacy for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6838-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6838]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

I am very pleased \nthat one of Washington State's own was tapped as the 1999-2000 \npresident of this prestigious national organization.\n  The AANA is the professional association that represents over 27,000 \npracticing Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). Founded in \n1931, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists is the \nprofessional association representing CRNAs nationwide. As you may \nknow, CRNAs administer more than 65 percent of the anesthetics given to \npatients each year in the United States. CRNAs provide anesthesia for \nall types of surgical cases and are the sole anesthesia provider in \nover 65 percent of rural hospitals, affording these medical facilities \nobstetrical, surgical and trauma stabilization capabilities. They work \nin every setting in which anesthesia is delivered, including hospital \nsurgical suites and obstetrical delivery rooms, ambulatory surgical \ncenters, and the offices of dentists, podiatrists, and plastic \nsurgeons.\n  Jan has been a nurse anesthetist since 1982.

BECKHAM, JR. MEMORIAL TRIBUTE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to pay tribute to the life of \none of Michigan's great civic leaders, William J. Beckham, Jr. After \nliving a remarkably accomplished life, sadly, Bill passed away April \n27th while on vacation with his beloved wife, Mattie Maynard Beckham. \nThis week, Bill's friends and colleagues and members of the Senate and \nthe House will come together in our Nation's capital to celebrate his \nmemory and his legacy.\n  Bill loved life and all the important things in it--his family, his \nfriends, school kids, and his African American heritage. Bill loved the \ndifference that he was making in Michigan through his work on school \nreform--enhancing and expanding the quality of education for all \nstudents in the Detroit public school system. Behind Bill's dignified, \ngentle yet deliberate manner was a fierce determination to help improve \nthe everyday lives of families. Multitudes were beneficiaries of his \nvisionary efforts. He showed that character and the principles of hard \nwork, integrity and perseverance can transform one's dreams into \nreality. He has left a mark of great achievement in civil rights, \neducation, economic and political reform.\n  Bill had a distinguished career of public service in Michigan, which \nincluded positions as Vice Chair of the School Board for the Detroit \nPublic Schools, Chairman of the Schools of the 21st Century \nCorporation, President and Trustee of The Skillman Foundation, the \nfirst Deputy Mayor of Detroit, and President of New Detroit, Inc. His \nsuccessful career in the private sector included key leadership \npositions at Burroughs/Unisys Corporation, Envirotest Systems \nCorporation in Phoenix and the Ford Motor Company.\n  Bill also enjoyed a long and noteworthy career in federal service \nfrom 1967 through the early 1980s. Over a period of eight years, he \nserved Senator Phil Hart in several capacities including Policy Adviser \nin his Washington office for 4 years, Chief of Staff of the Senator's \noffice in Detroit for three years, and Campaign Assistant for one year. \nBill subsequently served as Staff Director to the House Education and \nLabor Subcommittee on Equal Opportunity, chaired by Representative Gus \nHawkins. Sought out by President Jimmy Carter, Bill was nominated and \nconfirmed first as Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Department of the \nTreasury and later as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation.\n  During his tenure on Capitol Hill, Bill joined with several of his \nstaff colleagues to establish the first minority congressional staff \ngroup to study and act on the political and legislative demands of \nminority communities nationwide. The group's pioneering efforts in \nQuitman and Cohoma Counties in Mississippi, along with civil rights \nleader John Lewis and, my brother, Sander Levin (both of whom now serve \nin the House) helped to mark a new and powerful political and \nparticipatory direction for the people of the Mississippi Delta. Wise \nand loyal colleagues--Gordon Alexander, Jackie Parker, Judy Jackson, \nWilla Rawls Dumas, Alan Boyd, Dora Jean Malachi, Mattie Barrow and Bob \nParker--declared Bill their leader. The group moved ahead and soon \ndesigned the legendary mission to the Mississippi Delta; and, under the \ndirection of Julian Bond of the then-Southern Elections Fund, pursued \nother worthy political initiatives.\n  Mr. President, I would like to include in the Record the names of the \nmembers of the William J. Beckham, Jr. Memorial Committee, all of whom \nwere former staff colleagues of Bill's during his tenure of Federal \nservice, including my current Deputy Legislative Director, Jackie \nParker. These devoted friends and former colleagues organized this \nweek's great tribute to Bill and will be attesting, along with others, \nto the truly incredible life that Bill led and the impact he had on \ntheir lives. I ask their names be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n              William J.

Together we \nwill celebrate his life and cherish his memory.\n  In closing, I would like to share with my colleagues an article which \nappeared in the Detroit Free Press the day after Bill's funeral. The \narticle includes the very moving sentiments expressed by Monica Beckham \nabout her father as well as expressions of others who were touched by \nBill's generous spirit. I ask that the article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Detroit Free Press, May 4, 2000]\n\nMourners Praise Beckham's Vision--2,000 at Funeral for Revered Detroit \n                              Civic Leader\n\n                            (By Ben Schmitt)\n\n       William Beckham Jr. had a strategy to get home at a \n     reasonable hour, as he juggled highranking jobs and late \n     speaking engagements. He'd arrived early to evening meetings, \n     empower the audience, gradually make his way toward the back \n     door and vanish.\n       ``How prophetic,'' said Willie Scott, a board member of \n     Schools of the 21st Century, the Detroit school district's \n     grant-funded educational partner. ``It is exactly how he \n     lived and left us. He worked us as the audience and slipped \n     out the back door.''\n       Beckham's funeral, a 2\\1/2\\-hour affair Wednesday at \n     Greater Grace Temple in Detroit that drew more than 2,000 \n     people, was full of memories, praise and grieving for the \n     Detroit school reformer, president of the Skillman \n     Foundation, Detroit's first deputy mayor and past president \n     of New Detroit Inc. But it was an unscheduled speech by \n     Beckham's 21-year-old daughter, Monica Beckham, that brought \n     the tissues out in full force.\n       ``One of the main things I will always remember about you \n     was your ability to see the innate goodness in everybody,'' \n     she said, while crying, ``It was so beautiful about you. You \n     were the epitome of a father, a husband and a man,''\n       Beckham, who also worked for the Carter administration as \n     an assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Treasury and \n     deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, \n     died April 27 of a pulmonary embolism in Bloomington, Ill., \n     during a drive back from a family vacation. He was 59.\n       Although his funeral attracted a mix of family, friends and \n     high-ranking city and state officials, no special measures \n     were taken for accommodations. Beckham would have wanted it \n     that way, his brother said.\n       ``Bill, as you know, thought everyone was a dignitary,'' \n     said his younger brother, Charles Beckham. ``So if anyone's \n     feelings were hurt, we certainly didn't intend that. It was \n     in the vein of Bill saying that everybody's a dignitary; \n     everybody's important.''\n       Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, Detroit Public Schools interim \n     CEO David Adamany, retired MBD Bank President Tom Jeffs, \n     retired General Motors Corp. Vice President William Brooks \n     and DaimlerChrysler Vice President W. Frank Fountain were \n     among those in attendance.\n       Fountain wondered aloud, as he addressed the crowd, how the \n     city will move forward without Beckham.\n       ``It's an unfair question because no answer seems like the \n     right answer,'' he said, ``We move forward the same way that \n     Bill did during his lifetime: with hard work, humility and \n     humor.''\n       Maureen Taylor, chair of Michigan Welfare Rights \n     Organization, said she never knew what the J in William J. \n     Beckham stood for.\n       ``It probably stands for `Just in time,' '' she said to \n     applause. ``He came in here with his sleeves rolled up. He \n     came just in time to work with a multitude of jigsaw puzzle \n     activities: children, grandchildren and schools boards.\n       ``So we, too, are jolted by this premature departure. I \n     guess it was premature to me and premature to you and for him \n     it was just in time.''\n       Adamany said it's too early to say whether school reform \n     will succeed.\n       ``In Detroit, that success will be much more difficult \n     because of Bill Beckham's untimely passing. But we can say \n     with certainty that Bill's vision about the need for school \n     reform was true. His vision began not with the school system, \n     not with the people of power, but rather with the students.''\n       Charles Beckham, standing several steps above the flower-\n     surrounded casket, described the church scene in a \n     conversation with his older brother.\n       ``This room is filled with everybody, all hues, colors and \n     racial ethnicities,'' he said. ``There's a large crowd, and I \n     know that wouldn't make you comfortable. But I swear I don't \n     have anything to do with that. It's your fault because these \n     people have been touched by you and love you.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6839-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JUDGE HATFIELD\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nJudge Paul Hatfield. Last week, Montana lost not only a great man, but \na dedicated and passionate public servant who spent most of his life \ncommitted to working for the people of our state and our nation.\n  A native Montanan, Paul Hatfield was born and raised in Great Falls, \nwhere he graduated from the local high school in 1947 and pursued pre-\nlaw studies at the College of Great Falls. His education was \ninterrupted by two years of service in the U.S. Army, including \noverseas duty with the Signal Corps during the Korean conflict.\n  In 1953, Paul returned home and entered the University of Montana Law \nschool, After several years in private practice, he was appointed Chief \nDeputy Attorney for Cascade County, serving until his election as 8th \nJudicial District judge in 1960. He held this post with honor and \ndistinction for the next sixteen years. Heeding the call for public \nservice, he was elected Chief Justice of the Montana Supreme Court, \nmoving to Helena to assume his new duties in January 1977.\n  When Senator Lee Metcalf passed away on January 12, 1978, Judge \nHatfield was the Governor's choice to complete the remaining year of \nthat term. During his tenure in the Senate, Hatfield served on the \nArmed Services and Judiciary Committees. In 1978, Judge Hatfield and I \nboth ran for the Democratic nomination for the opportunity to represent \nMontana in the United States Senate. Paul campaigned as a man of \nintegrity. He was always gracious and principled. Following the \nelection, we remained friends and I have nothing but the utmost respect \nand admiration for him.\n  While already having a distinguished career, Judge Hatfield was not \nyet done with public service. In 1979, he was appointed to serve on the \nFederal District bench by President Carter. Although Hatfield took \nsenior status in 1995, he continued to serve actively in the courtroom \nuntil the time of his death.\n  Mr. President, as I have said, Paul Hatfield was an incredibly \ngracious man. His dedication was apparent through his long career as a \npublic servant and his commitment to his faith. He was full of charisma \nas everyone who came into contact with him would attest to. Paul \nHatfield was a treasure to our state and to this nation and he will be \ngreatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6839-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6839]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILLS PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on today, July 14, 2000, he \nhad presented to the President of the United States the following \nenrolled bills:\n\n       S. 986.

A bill to improve the cause of action for misrepresentation \nof Indian arts and crafts; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n             indian arts and crafts enforcement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Bingaman and Kyl in introducing legislation that makes much-\nneeded amendment to the Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 (the Act).\n  In 1989 and 1990 I had the pleasure of working on legislation that \nbecame the 1990 Act which was enacted with two goals in mind: (1) to \npromote the market for Indian arts and crafts; and (2) to enforce the \nprovisions of the Act to protect the integrity of authentic Indian \ngoods and Indian artisans.\n  Today's market for Indian-made goods is roughly $1 billion, but by \nsome estimates half of that demand, or nearly $500 million, is \nsatisfied by counterfeit goods, much of which is produced off-shore and \nimported illegally into the United States.\n  The growing influx of inauthentic Indian arts and crafts has not only \nweakened the market and consumer confidence in Indian goods, but has \nalso endangered traditional Indian customs and practices.\n  Native communities are plagued by rampant unemployment and a stagnant \neconomy, and the growing influx of inauthentic Indian arts and crafts \ncontinues to decimate one of the few forms of entrepreneurship and \neconomic development on Indian reservations.\n  In addition, this influx also erodes the propagation and practice of \ntraditional beliefs and customs by Native people and must be stopped \nfor that reason alone.\n  Under the existing Act, the Indian Arts and Crafts Board (``IACB'') \nis charged with not only promoting Indian arts and crafts, but also has \na key role in the enforcement of the Act's civil and criminal \nprovisions. In this role the IACB is required by law to work with the \nDepartment of justice to bring complaints against potential violators \nof the Act.\n  As of July, 2000, neither the IACB nor the Department of Justice have \nproduced the kind of enforcement results Congress intended when it \nenacted the 1990 Act. In fact, there has yet to be a single criminal or \ncivil prosecution of the Act, with Indian tribes themselves being \nforced to take up the slack.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, would improve enforcement of \nthe Act by (1) enhancing the ability of the plaintiff to assess and \ncalculate damages; (2) authorizing Indian arts and crafts organizations \nand individual Indians to bring suit for alleged violations of the Act; \n(3) authorizing a portion of the damages collected to reimburse the \nIACB for the costs of its role in investigating and bringing about the \nsuccessful prosecution of the suit; and (4) requiring more precise \ndefinitions through the regulations process.\n  This bill will provide the tools needed to stem the flow of these \ngoods, protect legitimate Indian artisans, and eliminate the economic \nincentive to steal from Native people that which is theirs.\n  I am hopeful that this legislation will signal a new day in the \nenforcement of the Act and encourage both the economic and cultural \nbenefits of authentic Indian arts and crafts.\n  I ask that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record. I thank the \nChair and yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2872\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for all right, title, and interest in and \nto certain property in Washington County, Utah, to be vested in the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n   legislation regarding certain property in washington county, utah\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nwill bring to a close the Federal acquisition of an important piece of \nprivate property in Washington County, Utah.\n  As some of my colleagues are aware, in March of 1991, the desert \ntortoise was listed as an endangered species under the Endangered \nSpecies Act. Government and environmental researchers determined that \nthe land immediately north of St. George, Utah, was prime desert \ntortoise habitat. Consequently, in February 1996, nearly five years \nafter the listing, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service [USFWS] \nissued Washington County a section 10 permit under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and a habitat conservation plan [HCP] and an \nimplementation agreement were adopted. Under the plan and agreement, \nthe Bureau of Land Management [BLM] assumed an obligation to acquire \nprivate lands in the designated habitat area to form the Red Cliffs \nReserve for the protection of the desert tortoise.\n  One of the private land owners within the reserve is Environmental \nLand Technology, Limited [ELT], which had earlier acquired \napproximately 2,440 acres from the State of Utah for purposes of \nresidential and recreational development. In the years preceding the \nadoption of the habitat conservation plan, ELT completed appraisals, \ncost estimates, engineering studies, site plans, surveys, utility \nlayouts, right-of-way negotiations, staked out golf courses, and \nobtained water rights for the development of this land. Prior to the \nadoption of the HCP, it was not clear which lands the Federal and local \ngovernments would decide to set aside for the desert tortoise, although \nit was assumed that there was sufficient surrounding Federal lands to \nprovide adequate habitat. However, in 1996, with the creation of the \nRed Cliffs Reserve, which included land belonging to ELT, all \ndevelopment efforts were halted.\n  With assurances from the Federal Government that the acquisition of \nthe ELT development lands was a high priority, the owner negotiated \nwith, and entered into, an assembled land exchange agreement with the \nBLM in anticipation of intrastate land exchanges. The private land \nowner then began a costly process of identifying comparable Federal \nlands within the State that would be suitable for an exchange for its \nlands in Washington County. Over the last four years, BLM and the \nprivate land owners, including ELT have completed several exchanges, \nand the Federal Government has acquired, through those exchanges or \ndirect purchases, nearly all of the Private property located within the \nreserve, except for approximately 1,516 acres of the ELT development \nland. However, with the creation of the Grand Staircase National \nMonument in September 1996,\n\n[[Page S6843]]\n\nand the subsequent land exchanges between the State of Utah and the \nFederal Government for the consolidation of Federal lands within the \nmonument, there are no longer sufficient comparable Federal lands \nwithin Utah to complete the originally contemplated intrastate \nexchanges for the remainder of the ELT development land within the \nreserve.\n  Faced with this problem, and in light of the high priority the \nDepartment of the Interior has placed on acquiring these lands, BLM \nofficials recommended that the ELT lands be acquired by direct \npurchase. During the FY 2000 budget process, BLM proposed that $30 \nmillion be set aside to begin acquiring the remaining lands in \nWashington County. Unfortunately, because this project involves \nendangered species habitat and the USFWS is responsible for \nadministering activities under the Endangered Species Act, the Office \nof Management and Budget shifted the $30 million from the BLM budget \nrequest to the USFWS's Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund \nbudget request. Ultimately, however, none of those funds were made \navailable for BLM acquisitions within the Federal section of the \nreserve. Instead, the funds in that account were made available on a \nmatching basis for the use of individual States to acquire wildlife \nhabitat. The result of this bureaucratic fumbling has resulted in \nextreme financial hardship for ELT.\n  The development lands within the Red Cliffs Reserve are ELT's main \nasset. The establishment of the Washington County HCP has effectively \ntaken this property from this private land owner and has prevented ELT \nfrom developing or otherwise disposing of the property. ELT has had to \nexpend virtually all of its resources to hold the property while \nawaiting the compensation to which it is legally entitled. ELT has had \nto sell its remaining assets, and the private land owner has also had \nto sell assets, including his home, to simply hold the property. It is \nnow impossible for him to hold the property any longer. This situation \nis made more egregious by the failure of the Department of the Interior \nto request any acquisition funding for FY 2001, even though this \nacquisition has been designated a high priority. Over the past several \nyears, ELT has pursued all possible avenues to complete the acquisition \nof these lands. The private land owner has spent millions of dollars \npursuing both intrastate and interstate land exchanges and has worked \ncooperatively with the Department of the Interior. Unfortunately, all \nof these efforts have been fruitless thus far. Absent the enactment of \nthis legislation, the land owner faces financial ruin. The failure of \nthe government to timely discharge an acknowledged obligation has \nforced this private land owner to liquidate his business and personal \nassets and effectively carry the burden of a large portion of the Red \nCliffs Reserve on his back. This is clearly not how the government \nshould treat its citizens.\n  The legislative taking bill that I am introducing today will finally \nbring this acquisition to a close. In my view, a legislative taking \nshould be an action of last resort. But, if ever a case warranted \nlegislative condemnation, this is it. This bill will transfer all \nright, title, and interest in the ELT development property within the \nRed Cliffs Reserve, including an additional 34 acres of landlocked real \nproperty owned by ELT which is adjacent to the land within the reserve, \nto the Federal Government. It provides an initial payment to ELT to pay \noff existing debts accrued in holding the property, and provides 90 \ndays during which ELT and the Department of the Interior can attempt to \nreach a negotiated settlement on the remaining value of the property. \nIn the absence of a negotiated amount, the Secretary of the Interior \nwill be required to bring an action in the Federal District Court for \nthe District of Utah to determine a value for the land. Payment for the \nland, whether negotiated or determined by the court, will be made from \nthe permanent judgment appropriation or any other appropriate account, \nor, at the option of the land owner, the Secretary of the Interior will \ncredit a surplus property account, established and maintained by the \nGeneral Services Administration, which the land owner can then use to \nbid on surplus government property.\n  This legislation is consistent with the high priority the Department \nof the Interior has repeatedly placed on this land acquisition, and is \na necessary final step towards an equitable resolution for this private \nland owner. The time for pursuing other options has long since expired. \nI encourage my colleagues to support the timely enactment of this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MOYNIHAN (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Robb, Mr. Mack, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 2874. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe provision taxing policyholder dividends of mutual life insurance \ncompanies and to repeal the policyholders surplus account provisions; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             life insurance tax simplification act of 2000\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nsimplify the taxation of life insurance companies under the Internal \nRevenue Code. This bill repeals two sections of the Code that no longer \nserve valid tax policy goals, section 809 and section 815.\n  Section 809, which was enacted in 1984 as part of an overhaul of the \ntaxation of life insurance companies, disallows a deduction for some of \nthe dividends that mutual life insurance companies pay to their \npolicyholders. It was enacted at a time when mutual life insurance \ncompanies were thought to be the dominant segment of the industry and \nwas intended to ensure that stock life insurance companies were not \ncompetitively disadvantaged. Since that time, however, the number of \nmutual life insurance companies has dwindled while the number of stock \nlife insurance companies has grown and the industry estimates that \nmutual life insurance companies will constitute less than ten percent \nof the industry within a few years. The section 809 tax has not been a \nsignificant component of the taxes paid by life insurance companies but \nit has been burdensome because of its unpredictable nature and \ncomplexity. Moreover, the original reason for its enactment no longer \nexists. Therefore, the bill would repeal section 809.\n  Section 815 was enacted in 1959 along with other changes to the \ntaxation of life insurance companies. The 1959 changes permitted life \ninsurance companies to defer tax on one-half of their underwriting \nincome so long as such income was not distributed to their \nshareholders. The tax deferred income was accounted for through \n``policyholder surplus accounts.'' In 1984, Congress revised the \ntaxation of mutual and stock life insurance companies and as part of \nthese revisions, stock life insurance companies were no longer \npermitted to defer tax on one half of their underwriting income or add \nto their policyholder surplus accounts. At the same time, Congress did \nnot eliminate the existing policyholder surplus accounts or trigger tax \non the accrued amounts but instead left them in place. Thus, the \namounts in those accounts remain subject to tax only when a triggering \nevent occurs (for example, direct or indirect distributions to \nshareholders). Since 1984, little revenue has been collected under this \nprovision as companies avoid triggering events. The Administration \nrecently has proposed taxing the amounts in the accounts, creating \nuncertainty for companies with these accounts. Finally, only life \ninsurance companies that were in existence in 1984 even have these \naccounts. The bill would repeal this provision.\n  Elimination of these complicated and outmoded provisions will provide \ngreater certainty to the taxation of these companies and allow them to \nrestructure their businesses to compete in the developing global \nfinancial services marketplace. While this bill is only a modest \nattempt to simplify the taxation of one sector of our economy, it \nrepresents a first step towards overall simplification of our Internal \nRevenue Code.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6844]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles 18 and 28, United States Code, with \nrespect to United States magistrate judges; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                magistrate judge improvement act of 2000\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenators Hatch, Leahy, Thurmond, Torricelli, and Grassley, to introduce \nthe Magistrate Judge Improvement Act of 2000. We are introducing this \nlegislation because we believe that the modest reforms it seeks to make \nwill greatly enhance the efficiencies and effectiveness of the Federal \ncourt system. In fact, the changes proposed by this legislation are \nbased on recommendations made by the Judicial Conference and the \nMagistrate Judges Association, and this legislation has the strong \nsupport of both organizations. I do not believe that this legislation \nis controversial, and I encourage my colleagues to join in support of \nthis initiative.\n  Over the years, Congress has repeatedly recognized the important role \nthat magistrate judges have in helping to ensure the smooth and \nefficient functioning of the federal judicial system. For example, \nCongress has deemed it appropriate to allow magistrate judges to have \nfinal disposition authority, with the consent of the parties, in civil \nand misdemeanor cases pending before a district court. This was done, \nin part, to help federal district courts better manage their dockets by \nproviding litigants with a viable alternative that they could utilize \nin the resolution of their claims. Despite the fact that magistrate \njudges have been asked to play a greater role in adjudicating cases \nthat had traditionally been tried before district courts, magistrates \nhave not been granted the same powers that district courts enjoy to \nenforce their oral and written orders or even to maintain order in \ntheir courtrooms. The Magistrate Judge Improvement Act of 2000 seeks to \ncorrect this imbalance, while also making additional reforms that will \ngreatly enhance the efficiencies provided by magistrate courts. In \nparticular, this legislation will make three important, and common-\nsense reforms.\n  First: The bill will grant magistrate judges limited contempt \nauthority in criminal and civil cases. Under current law, magistrate \njudges do not have any contempt authority at all, and are required to \ncertify any instances of improper behavior to a district court judge \nfor resolution. This lack of authority undermines the magistrate judges \nability to ensure compliance with their orders, and to control \ndisorderly behavior in their courtroom. By giving magistrate judges \ncontempt authority, Congress will greatly enhance their ability to \nassist district courts in the application of federal law.\n  Second: The bill will improve district court efficiency by empowering \nmagistrate judges to handle all petty offense cases without the consent \nof the defendant. Current law already allows magistrate judges to try \nClass B misdemeanors charging a motor vehicle offense and all Class C \nmisdemeanors and infractions without the consent of the defendant. By \nexpanding this authority to encompass all Class B misdemeanors, instead \nof just those involving motor vehicle offenses, we will help reduce the \ndockets of the district courts as they will no longer be the primary \nforum for resolving a wide variety of relatively minor offenses.\n  Third: The bill will grant magistrate judges the ability to enter \nsentences of incarceration in juvenile misdemeanor cases. Under current \nlaw, magistrate judges are empowered to try and sentence juvenile \ndefendants accused of Class B and Class C misdemeanor offenses; \nhowever, they are precluded from entering sentences of imprisonment. \nThis is an unusual lack of authority because magistrates are empowered \nunder current law to order the pretrial detention of juvenile \ndefendants who have committed felonies. This legislation remedies this \nsituation by granting magistrate judges the ability to enter minimal \nsentences of incarceration in the misdemeanor cases they adjudicate. In \naddition, the legislation extends the scope of magistrate judge \nauthority to ensure that they are empowered to preside over all classes \nof misdemeanor offenses, including Class A misdemeanors.\n  As you can see, these are all sensible and reasonable reforms and \ntheir enactment into law will go a long way towards strengthening an \nimportant component of our Federal Judiciary. I urge my colleagues to \njoin in support of this legislation, and I look forward to working with \nthem in the hopes of getting this bill passed before Congress adjourns \nfor the year. I ask that a copy of this bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to enhance privacy \nprotections for individuals, to prevent fraudulent misuse of the social \nsecurity account number, and to provide additional safeguards for \nSocial Security and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries with \nrepresentative payees, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n              PRIVACY AND IDENTITY PROTECTION ACT OF 2000\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat is designed to protect the privacy of all Americans from identity \ntheft caused by theft or abuse of an individual's Social Security \nnumber (SSN).\n  Mr. President, identity theft is the fastest growing financial crime \nin the nation, affecting an estimated 500,000 to 700,000 people \nannually. Allegations of fraudulent Social Security number use for \nidentity theft increased from 26,531 cases in 1998 to 62,000 in 1999--\nthis is a 233 percent increase in just one year!\n  In May of this year, the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse released a \nreport that found of the more than 75% of identity theft crimes that \ntook place last year, ``true name'' fraud was involved. What is ``true \nname'' fraud?\n  It is when someone uses your Social Security number to open new \naccounts in the victim's name. That means a common criminal can apply \nfor credit cards, buy a car, obtain personal, business, auto or real \nestate loans, do just about anything in your name and you may not even \nknow about it for months or even years. Across the country there are \npeople who can tell you about losing their life savings or having their \ncredit history damaged, simply because someone had obtained their \nSocial Security number and fraudulently assumed their identity.\n  My bill prohibits the sale of Social Security numbers by the private \nsector, Federal, State and local government agencies. My bill \nstrengthens existing criminal penalties for enforcement of Social \nSecurity number violations to include those by government employees. It \namends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to include the Social Security \nnumber as part of the information protected under the law, enhances law \nenforcement authority of the Office of Inspector General, and allows \nFederal courts to order defendants to make restitution to the Social \nSecurity Trust Funds.\n  Mr. President, I think that it is high time that we get back to the \noriginal purpose of the Social Security number. Social Security numbers \nwere designed to be used to track workers and their earnings so that \ntheir benefits could be accurately calculated when a worker retires--\nnothing else.\n  My bill would also prohibit the display of Social Security numbers on \ndrivers licenses, motor vehicle registration and other related \nidentification records, like the official Senate ID Card.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Smith of Oregon):\n  S. 2877. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na feasibility study on water optimization in the Burnt River basin, \nMalheur River basin, Owyhee River basin, and Powder River basin, \nOregon; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              IMPROVED WATER MANAGEMENT IN EASTERN OREGON\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am introducing today legislation \nthat will allow the Bureau of Reclamation to conduct a feasibility \nstudy on ways to improve water management in the Malheur, Owyhee, \nPowder and Burnt River basins in northeastern Oregon. An earlier study \nby the Bureau identified a number of problems on these four Snake River \ntributaries, including high water temperatures and degraded fish \nhabitat.\n  These types of problems are not unique to these rivers; in fact, many \nrivers in the Pacific Northwest are in a similar condition. However, \nOregon has a unique approach to solving these problems through the work \nof Watershed Councils. In these Councils, local farmers, ranchers and \nother stakeholders sit down together with the resource agencies to \ndevelop action plans to solve local problems.\n  The Council members have the local knowledge of the land and waters, \nbut they don't have technical expertise. The Bureau of Reclamation has \nthe expertise to collect the kinds of water flow and water quality data \nthat are needed to understand how the watershed works and how effective \ndifferent solutions might be.\n  One class of possible solutions includes small-scale construction \nprojects, such as upgrading of irrigation systems and creation of \nwetlands to act as pollutant filters. This legislation would allow the \nBureau of Reclamation to partner with the Watershed Councils in \ndetermining how such small-scale construction projects might benefit \nboth the environment and the local economy.\n  This bill authorizes a study; it does not authorize actual \nconstruction. It simply enables the Bureau to help find the most \nlogical solution to resource management issues.\n\n[[Page S6846]]\n\n  I look forward to a hearing on this bill in the Energy and Natural \nResources Subcommittee on Water and Power. I welcome my colleague, Mr. \nSmith, as an original co-sponsor of this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2877\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Paycheck Fairness Act''.\n\n     SEC. ____02. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Women have entered the workforce in record numbers.\n       (2) Even in the 1990's, women earn significantly lower pay \n     than men for work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, \n     and responsibility and that are performed under similar \n     working conditions. These pay disparities exist in both the \n     private and governmental sectors. In many instances, the pay \n     disparities can only be due to continued intentional \n     discrimination or the lingering effects of past \n     discrimination.\n       (3) The existence of such pay disparities--\n       (A) depresses the wages of working families who rely on the \n     wages of all members of the family to make ends meet;\n       (B) prevents the optimum utilization of available labor \n     resources;\n       (C) has been spread and perpetuated, through commerce and \n     the channels and instrumentalities of commerce, among the \n     workers of the several States;\n       (D) burdens commerce and the free flow of goods in \n     commerce;\n       (E) constitutes an unfair method of competition in \n     commerce;\n       (F) leads to labor disputes burdening and obstructing \n     commerce and the free flow of goods in commerce;\n       (G) interferes with the orderly and fair marketing of goods \n     in commerce; and\n       (H) in many instances, may deprive workers of equal \n     protection on the basis of sex in violation of the 5th and \n     14th amendments.\n       (4)(A) Artificial barriers to the elimination of \n     discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex \n     continue to exist more than 3 decades after the enactment of \n     the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.) \n     and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000a et seq.).\n       (B) Elimination of such barriers would have positive \n     effects, including--\n       (i) providing a solution to problems in the economy created \n     by unfair pay disparities;\n       (ii) substantially reducing the number of working women \n     earning unfairly low wages, thereby reducing the dependence \n     on public assistance; and\n       (iii) promoting stable families by enabling all family \n     members to earn a fair rate of pay;\n       (iv) remedying the effects of past discrimination on the \n     basis of sex and ensuring that in the future workers are \n     afforded equal protection on the basis of sex; and\n       (v) ensuring equal protection pursuant to Congress' power \n     to enforce the 5th and 14th amendments.\n\n[[Page S6850]]\n\n       (5) With increased information about the provisions added \n     by the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and wage data, along with more \n     effective remedies, women will be better able to recognize \n     and enforce their rights to equal pay for work on jobs that \n     require equal skill, effort, and responsibility and that are \n     performed under similar working conditions.\n       (6) Certain employers have already made great strides in \n     eradicating unfair pay disparities in the workplace and their \n     achievements should be recognized.\n\n     SEC. ____03. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EQUAL PAY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Required Demonstration for Affirmative Defense.--\n     Section 6(d)(1) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 \n     U.S.C. 206(d)(1)) is amended by striking ``(iv) a \n     differential'' and all that follows through the period and \n     inserting the following: ``(iv) a differential based on a \n     bona fide factor other than sex, such as education, training \n     or experience, except that this clause shall apply only if--\n       ``(I) the employer demonstrates that--\n\n       ``(aa) such factor--\n\n       ``(AA) is job-related with respect to the position in \n     question;

Indianapolis (CA-\n     35) was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese submarine I-58 in \n     what became the worst sea disaster in the history of the \n     United States Navy.\n       (2) Although approximately 900 of the ship's crew of 1,196 \n     survived the actual sinking, only 316 of those courageous \n     sailors survived when rescued after four and a half days \n     adrift in the open sea.\n       (3) Nearly 600 of the approximately 900 men who survived \n     the sinking perished from battle wounds, drowning, predatory \n     shark attacks, exposure to the elements, and lack of food and \n     potable water.\n       (4) Rescue came for the remaining 316 sailors when they \n     were spotted by chance by Navy Lieutenant Wilbur C. Gwinn \n     while flying a routine naval air patrol mission.\n       (5) After the end of World War II, the commanding officer \n     of the U.S.S. Indianapolis, Captain Charles Butler McVay, who \n     was rescued with the other survivors, was court-martialed for \n     ``suffering a vessel to be hazarded through negligence'' by \n     failing to zigzag (a naval tactic employed to help evade \n     submarine attacks), and was convicted even though--\n       (A) the choice to zigzag was left to Captain McVay's \n     discretion in his orders; and\n       (B) Motchisura Hashimoto, the commander of the Japanese \n     submarine that sank the U.S.S. Indianapolis, and Glynn R. \n     Donaho, a United States Navy submarine commander highly \n     decorated for his service during World War II, both testified \n     at Captain McVay's court-martial trial that the Japanese \n     submarine could have sunk the U.S.S. Indianapolis whether or \n     not it had been zigzagging, an assertion that the Japanese \n     submarine commander has since reaffirmed in a letter to the \n     Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate.\n       (6) Although not argued by Captain McVay's defense counsel \n     in the court-martial trial, poor visibility on the night of \n     the sinking (as attested in surviving crew members' \n     handwritten accounts recently discovered at the National \n     Archives) justified Captain McVay's choice not to zigzag as \n     that choice was consistent with the applicable Navy \n     directives in force in 1945, which stated that, ``During \n     thick weather and at night, except on very clear nights or \n     during bright moonlight, vessels normally cease zig-\n     zagging.''.\n       (7) Naval officials failed to provide Captain McVay with \n     available support that was critical to the safety of the \n     U.S.S. Indianapolis and its crew on what became its final \n     mission by--\n       (A) disapproving a request made by Captain McVay for a \n     destroyer escort for the U.S.S. Indianapolis across the \n     Philippine Sea as being ``not necessary'';\n       (B) not informing Captain McVay that naval intelligence \n     sources, through signal intelligence (the Japanese code \n     having been broken earlier in World War II), had become aware \n     that the Japanese submarine I-58 was operating in the area of \n     the U.S.S. Indianapolis' course (as disclosed in evidence \n     presented in a hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of \n     the Senate); and\n       (C) not informing Captain McVay of the sinking of the \n     destroyer escort U.S.S. Underhill by a Japanese submarine \n     within range of the course of the U.S.S. Indianapolis four \n     days before the U.S.S. Indianapolis departed Guam on its \n     fatal voyage.\n       (8) Captain McVay's court-martial initially was opposed by \n     his immediate command superiors, Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz \n     (CINCPAC) and Vice Admiral Raymond Spruance of the 5th fleet, \n     for which the U.S.S. Indianapolis served as flagship, but, \n     despite their recommendations, Secretary of the Navy James \n     Forrestal ordered the court-martial, largely on the basis of \n     the recommendation of Admiral King, Chief of Naval \n     Operations.\n       (9) There is no explanation on the public record for \n     Secretary Forestal's overruling of the recommendations made \n     by Admirals Nimitz and Spruance.\n       (10) Captain McVay was the only commander of a United \n     States Navy vessel lost in combat to enemy action during \n     World War II who was subjected to a court-martial trial for \n     such a loss, even though several hundred United States Navy \n     ships were lost in combat to enemy action during World War \n     II.\n       (11) The survivors of the U.S.S. Indianapolis \n     overwhelmingly conclude that McVay was not at fault and have \n     dedicated their lives to vindicating their Captain, Charles \n     McVay, but time is running out for the 130 remaining members \n     of the crew in their united and steadfast quest to clear \n     their Captain's name.\n       (12) Although Captain McVay was promoted to Rear Admiral \n     upon retirement from the Navy, he never recovered from the \n     stigma of his post-\n\n[[Page S6899]]\n\n     war court-martial and in 1968, tragically, took his own life.\n       (13) Captain McVay was a graduate of the United States \n     Naval Academy, was an exemplary career naval officer with an \n     outstanding record (including participation in the amphibious \n     invasions of North Africa, the assault on Iwo Jima, and the \n     assault on Okinawa where he survived a fierce kamikaze \n     attack), was a recipient of the Silver Star earned for \n     courage under fire during the Solomon Islands campaign, and, \n     with his crew, had so thoroughly demonstrated proficiency in \n     naval warfare that the Navy entrusted Captain McVay and the \n     crew with transporting, on their fatal cruise, the components \n     necessary for assembling the atomic bombs that were exploded \n     over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to end the war with Japan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) It is the sense of Congress, on \n     the basis of the facts presented in a public hearing \n     conducted by the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on \n     September 14, 1999, including evidence not available at the \n     time of Captain Charles Butler McVay's court-martial, and on \n     the basis of extensive interviews and questioning of \n     witnesses and knowledgeable officials and a review of the \n     record of the court-martial for and in that hearing, that--\n       (A) recognizing that the Secretary of the Navy remitted the \n     sentence of the court-martial and that Admiral Nimitz, as \n     Chief of Naval Operations, restored Captain McVay to active \n     duty, the American people should now recognize Captain \n     McVay's lack of culpability for the tragic loss of the U.S.S. \n     Indianapolis and the lives of the men who died as a result of \n     her sinking; and\n       (B) knowing that vital information was not available to the \n     court-martial board and that, as a result, Captain McVay was \n     convicted, Captain McVay's military record should now reflect \n     that he is exonerated for the loss of the ship and its crew.\n       (2) It is, further, the sense of Congress that Congress \n     strongly encourages the Secretary of the Navy to award a Navy \n     Unit Commendation to the U.S.S. Indianapolis and its final \n     crew.\n\n     SEC. 576. SENIOR OFFICERS IN COMMAND IN HAWAII ON DECEMBER 7, \n                   1941.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, formerly the Commander \n     in Chief of the United States Fleet and the Commander in \n     Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, had an excellent and \n     unassailable record throughout his career in the United \n     States Navy prior to the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl \n     Harbor.\n       (2) Major General Walter C. Short, formerly the Commander \n     of the United States Army Hawaiian Department, had an \n     excellent and unassailable record throughout his career in \n     the United States Army prior to the December 7, 1941, attack \n     on Pearl Harbor.\n       (3) Numerous investigations following the attack on Pearl \n     Harbor have documented that Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were not provided necessary and critical \n     intelligence that was available, that foretold of war with \n     Japan, that warned of imminent attack, and that would have \n     alerted them to prepare for the attack, including such \n     essential communiques as the Japanese Pearl Harbor Bomb Plot \n     message of September 24, 1941, and the message sent from the \n     Imperial Japanese Foreign Ministry to the Japanese Ambassador \n     in the United States from December 6 to 7, 1941, known as the \n     Fourteen-Part Message.\n       (4) On December 16, 1941, Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short were relieved of their commands and returned to \n     their permanent ranks of rear admiral and major general.\n       (5) Admiral William Harrison Standley, who served as a \n     member of the investigating commission known as the Roberts \n     Commission that accused Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General \n     Short of ``dereliction of duty'' only six weeks after the \n     attack on Pearl Harbor, later disavowed the report \n     maintaining that ``these two officers were martyred'' and \n     ``if they had been brought to trial, both would have been \n     cleared of the charge''.\n       (6) On October 19, 1944, a Naval Court of Inquiry \n     exonerated Admiral Kimmel on the grounds that his military \n     decisions and the disposition of his forces at the time of \n     the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor were proper ``by \n     virtue of the information that Admiral Kimmel had at hand \n     which indicated neither the probability nor the imminence of \n     an air attack on Pearl Harbor''; criticized the higher \n     command for not sharing with Admiral Kimmel ``during the very \n     critical period of November 26 to December 7, 1941, important \n     information . . . regarding the Japanese situation''; and, \n     concluded that the Japanese attack and its outcome was \n     attributable to no serious fault on the part of anyone in the \n     naval service.\n       (7) On June 15, 1944, an investigation conducted by Admiral \n     T. C. Hart at the direction of the Secretary of the Navy \n     produced evidence, subsequently confirmed, that essential \n     intelligence concerning Japanese intentions and war plans was \n     available in Washington but was not shared with Admiral \n     Kimmel.\n       (8) On October 20, 1944, the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation determined that Lieutenant General Short had \n     not been kept ``fully advised of the growing tenseness of the \n     Japanese situation which indicated an increasing necessity \n     for better preparation for war''; detailed information and \n     intelligence about Japanese intentions and war plans were \n     available in ``abundance'' but were not shared with the \n     General Short's Hawaii command; and General Short was not \n     provided ``on the evening of December 6th and the early \n     morning of December 7th, the critical information indicating \n     an almost immediate break with Japan, though there was ample \n     time to have accomplished this''.\n       (9) The reports by both the Naval Court of Inquiry and the \n     Army Pearl Harbor Board of Investigation were kept secret, \n     and Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short were denied \n     their requests to defend themselves through trial by court-\n     martial.\n       (10) The joint committee of Congress that was established \n     to investigate the conduct of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant \n     General Short completed, on May 31, 1946, a 1,075-page report \n     which included the conclusions of the committee that the two \n     officers had not been guilty of dereliction of duty.\n       (11) The then Chief of Naval Personnel, Admiral J. L. \n     Holloway, Jr., on April 27, 1954, recommended that Admiral \n     Kimmel be advanced in rank in accordance with the provisions \n     of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (12) On November 13, 1991, a majority of the members of the \n     Board for the Correction of Military Records of the \n     Department of the Army found that Lieutenant General Short \n     ``was unjustly held responsible for the Pearl Harbor \n     disaster'' and that ``it would be equitable and just'' to \n     advance him to the rank of lieutenant general on the retired \n     list.\n       (13) In October 1994, the then Chief of Naval Operations, \n     Admiral Carlisle Trost, withdrew his 1988 recommendation \n     against the advancement of Admiral Kimmel and recommended \n     that the case of Admiral Kimmel be reopened.\n       (14) Although the Dorn Report, a report on the results of a \n     Department of Defense study that was issued on December 15, \n     1995, did not provide support for an advancement of Rear \n     Admiral Kimmel or Major General Short in grade, it did set \n     forth as a conclusion of the study that ``responsibility for \n     the Pearl Harbor disaster should not fall solely on the \n     shoulders of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short, it \n     should be broadly shared''.\n       (15) The Dorn Report found that ``Army and Navy officials \n     in Washington were privy to intercepted Japanese diplomatic \n     communications . . . which provided crucial confirmation of \n     the imminence of war''; that ``the evidence of the handling \n     of these messages in Washington reveals some ineptitude, some \n     unwarranted assumptions and misestimations, limited \n     coordination, ambiguous language, and lack of clarification \n     and followup at higher levels''; and, that ``together, these \n     characteristics resulted in failure . . . to appreciate fully \n     and to convey to the commanders in Hawaii the sense of focus \n     and urgency that these intercepts should have engendered''.\n       (16) On July 21, 1997, Vice Admiral David C. Richardson \n     (United States Navy, retired) responded to the Dorn Report \n     with his own study which confirmed findings of the Naval \n     Court of Inquiry and the Army Pearl Harbor Board of \n     Investigation and established, among other facts, that the \n     war effort in 1941 was undermined by a restrictive \n     intelligence distribution policy, and the degree to which the \n     commanders of the United States forces in Hawaii were not \n     alerted about the impending attack on Hawaii was directly \n     attributable to the withholding of intelligence from Admiral \n     Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.\n       (17) The Officer Personnel Act of 1947, in establishing a \n     promotion system for the Navy and the Army, provided a legal \n     basis for the President to honor any officer of the Armed \n     Forces of the United States who served his country as a \n     senior commander during World War II with a placement of that \n     officer, with the advice and consent of the Senate, on the \n     retired list with the highest grade held while on the active \n     duty list.\n       (18) Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General Short are the \n     only two eligible officers from World War II who were \n     excluded from the list of retired officers presented for \n     advancement on the retired lists to their highest wartime \n     ranks under the terms of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947.\n       (19) This singular exclusion from advancement on the \n     retired list serves only to perpetuate the myth that the \n     senior commanders in Hawaii were derelict in their duty and \n     responsible for the success of the attack on Pearl Harbor, a \n     distinct and unacceptable expression of dishonor toward two \n     of the finest officers who have served in the Armed Forces of \n     the United States.\n       (20) Major General Walter Short died on September 23, 1949, \n     and Rear Admiral Husband Kimmel died on May 14, 1968, without \n     the honor of having been returned to their wartime ranks as \n     were their fellow veterans of World War II.\n       (21) The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Pearl Harbor \n     Survivors Association, the Admiral Nimitz Foundation, the \n     Naval Academy Alumni Association, the Retired Officers \n     Association, and the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Committee, \n     and other associations and numerous retired military officers \n     have called for the rehabilitation of the reputations and \n     honor of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short through \n     their posthumous advancement on the retired lists to their \n     highest wartime grades.\n       (b) Advancement of Rear Admiral Kimmel and Major General \n     Short on Retired Lists.--(1) The President is requested--\n       (A) to advance the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel to \n     the grade of admiral on the retired list of the Navy; and\n       (B) to advance the late Major General Walter C. Short to \n     the grade of lieutenant general on the retired list of the \n     Army.\n       (2) Any advancement in grade on a retired list requested \n     under paragraph (1) shall not increase or change the \n     compensation or benefits from the United States to which any \n     person is now or may in the future be entitled based upon the \n     military service of the officer advanced.\n       (c) Sense of Congress Regarding the Professional \n     Performance of Admiral Kimmel and Lieutenant General Short.--\n     It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the late Rear Admiral Husband E. Kimmel performed his \n     duties as Commander in Chief, United States Pacific Fleet, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on\n\n[[Page S6900]]\n\n     the naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, and other targets on \n     the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not a \n     result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by \n     the then Admiral Kimmel; and\n       (2) the late Major General Walter C. Short performed his \n     duties as Commanding General, Hawaiian Department, \n     competently and professionally, and, therefore, the losses \n     incurred by the United States in the attacks on Hickam Army \n     Air Field and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and other targets \n     on the island of Oahu, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, were not \n     a result of dereliction in the performance of those duties by \n     the then Lieutenant General Short.\n\n     SEC. 577.

REPORT ON SPARE PARTS AND REPAIR PARTS PROGRAM OF \n                   THE AIR FORCE FOR THE C-5 AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There exists a significant shortfall in the Nation's \n     current strategic airlift requirement, even though strategic \n     airlift remains critical to the national security strategy of \n     the United States.\n       (2) This shortfall results from the slow phase-out of C-141 \n     aircraft and their replacement with C-17 aircraft and from \n     lower than optimal reliability rates for the C-5 aircraft.\n       (3) One of the primary causes of these reliability rates \n     for C-5 aircraft, and especially for operational unit \n     aircraft, is the shortage of spare repair parts. Over the \n     past 5 years, this shortage has been particularly evident in \n     the C-5 fleet.\n       (4) NMCS (Not Mission Capable for Supply) rates for C-5 \n     aircraft have increased significantly in the period between \n     1997 and 1999. At Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, an average \n     of 7 to 9 C-5 aircraft were not available during that period \n     because of a lack of parts.\n       (5) Average rates of cannibalization of C-5 aircraft per \n     100 sorties of such aircraft have also increased during that \n     period and are well above the Air Mobility Command standard. \n     In any given month, this means devoting additional manhours \n     to cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft. At Dover Air Force Base, \n     an average of 800 to 1,000 additional manhours were required \n     for cannibalizations of C-5 aircraft during that period. \n     Cannibalizations are often required for aircraft that transit \n     through a base such as Dover Air Force Base, as well as those \n     that are based there.\n       (6) High cannibalization rates indicate a significant \n     problem in delivering spare parts in a timely manner and \n     systemic problems within the repair and maintenance process, \n     and also demoralize overworked maintenance crews.\n\n[[Page S6929]]\n\n       (7) The C-5 aircraft remains an absolutely critical asset \n     in air mobility and airlifting heavy equipment and personnel \n     to both military contingencies and humanitarian relief \n     efforts around the world.\n       (8) Despite increased funding for spare and repair parts \n     and other efforts by the Air Force to mitigate the parts \n     shortage problem, Congress continues to receive reports of \n     significant cannibalizations to airworthy C-5 aircraft and \n     parts backlogs.\n       (b) Reports.--Not later than January 1, 2001, and September \n     30, 2001, the Secretary of the Air Force shall submit to the \n     congressional defense committees a report on the overall \n     status of the spare and repair parts program of the Air Force \n     for the C-5 aircraft. The report shall include the \n     following--\n       (1) a statement of the funds currently allocated to parts \n     for the C-5 aircraft and the adequacy of such funds to meet \n     current and future parts and maintenance requirements for \n     that aircraft;\n       (2) a description of current efforts to address shortfalls \n     in parts for such aircraft, including an assessment of \n     potential short-term and long-term effects of such efforts;\n       (3) an assessment of the effects of such shortfalls on \n     readiness and reliability ratings for C-5 aircraft;\n       (4) a description of cannibalization rates for C-5 aircraft \n     and the manhours devoted to cannibalizations of such \n     aircraft; and\n       (5) an assessment of the effects of parts shortfalls and \n     cannibalizations with respect to C-5 aircraft on readiness \n     and retention.\n\n     SEC. 1028.

COMMEMORATION OF THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                   UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The American military justice system predates the \n     United States itself, having had a continuous existence since \n     the enactment of the first American Articles of War by the \n     Continental Congress in 1775.\n       (2) Pursuant to article I of the Constitution, which \n     explicitly empowers Congress ``To make Rules for the \n     Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces'', \n     Congress enacted the Articles of War and an Act to Govern the \n     Navy, which were revised on several occasions between the \n     ratification of the Constitution and the end of World War II.\n       (3) Dissatisfaction with the administration of military \n     justice in World War I and World War II led both to \n     significant statutory reforms in the Articles of War and to \n     the convening of a committee, under Department of Defense \n     auspices, to draft a uniform code of military justice \n     applicable to all of the Armed Forces.\n       (4) The committee, chaired by Professor Edmund M. Morgan of \n     Harvard Law School, made recommendations that formed the \n     basis of bills introduced in Congress to establish such a \n     uniform code of military justice.\n       (5) After lengthy hearings and debate on the congressional \n     proposals, the Uniform Code of Military Justice was enacted \n     into law on May 5, 1950, when President Harry S. Truman \n     signed the legislation.\n       (6) President Truman then issued a revised Manual for \n     Courts-Martial implementing the new code, and the code became \n     effective on May 31, 1951.\n       (7) One of the greatest innovations of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice was the establishment of a civilian court of \n     appeals within the military justice system. That court, the \n     United States Court of Military Appeals (now the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), held its first \n     session on July 25, 1951.\n       (8) Congress enacted major revisions of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice in 1968 and 1983 and, in addition, has \n     amended the code from time to time over the years as practice \n     under the code indicated a need for updating the substance or \n     procedure of the law of military justice.\n       (9) The evolution of the system of military justice under \n     the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be traced in the \n     decisions of the Courts of Criminal Appeals of each of the \n     Armed Forces and the decisions of the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Armed Forces. These courts have produced a \n     unique body of jurisprudence upon which commanders and judge \n     advocates rely in the performance of their duties.\n       (10) It is altogether fitting that the fiftieth anniversary \n     of the Uniform Code of Military Justice be duly commemorated.\n       (b) Commemoration.--The Congress--\n       (1) requests the President to issue a proclamation \n     commemorating the fiftieth anniversary of the Uniform Code of \n     Military Justice; and\n       (2) calls upon the Department of Defense, the Armed Forces, \n     and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces \n     to commemorate the occasion with ceremonies and activities \n     befitting its importance.\n\n     SEC. 1052.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NAMING OF THE CVN-77 \n                   AIRCRAFT CARRIER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over the last three decades Congress has authorized and \n     appropriated funds for a total of 10 ``NIMITZ'' class \n     aircraft carriers.\n       (2) The last vessel in the ``NIMITZ'' class of aircraft \n     carriers, CVN-77, is currently under construction and will be \n     delivered in 2008.\n       (3) The first nine vessels in this class bear the following \n     proud names:\n       (A) U.S.S. Nimitz (CVN-68).\n       (B) U.S.S. Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69).\n       (C) U.S.S. Carl Vinson (CVN-70).\n       (D) U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71).\n       (E) U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72).\n       (F) U.S.S. George Washington (CVN-73).\n       (G) U.S.S. John C. Stennis (CVN-74).\n       (H) U.S.S. Harry S. Truman (CVN-75).\n       (I) U.S.S.

AEROSPACE INDUSTRY BLUE RIBBON COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States aerospace industry, composed of \n     manufacturers of commercial, military, and business aircraft, \n     helicopters, aircraft engines, missiles, spacecraft, \n     materials, and related components and equipment, has a unique \n     role in the economic and national security of our Nation.\n       (2) In 1999, the aerospace industry continued to produce, \n     at $37,000,000,000, the largest trade surplus of any industry \n     in the United States economy.\n       (3) The United States aerospace industry employs 800,000 \n     Americans in highly skilled positions associated with \n     manufacturing aerospace products.\n       (4) United States aerospace technology is preeminent in the \n     global marketplace for both defense and commercial products.\n       (5) History since World War I has demonstrated that a \n     superior aerospace capability usually determines victory in \n     military operations and that a robust, technically innovative \n     aerospace capability will be essential for maintaining United \n     States military superiority in the 21st century.\n       (6) Federal Government policies concerning investment in \n     aerospace research and development and procurement, controls \n     on the export of services and goods containing advanced \n     technologies, and other aspects of the Government-industry \n     relationship will have a critical impact on the ability of \n     the United States aerospace industry to retain its position \n     of global leadership.\n       (7) Recent trends in investment in aerospace research and \n     development, in changes in global aerospace market share, and \n     in the development of competitive, non-United States \n     aerospace industries could undermine the future role of the \n     United States aerospace industry in the national economy and \n     in the security of the Nation.\n       (8) Because the United States aerospace industry stands at \n     an historical crossroads, it is advisable for the President \n     and Congress to appoint a blue ribbon commission to assess \n     the future of the industry and to make recommendations for \n     Federal Government actions to ensure United States \n     preeminence in aerospace in the 21st century.\n       (b) Establishment.--There is established a Blue Ribbon \n     Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace \n     Industry.\n       (c) Membership.--(1) The Commission shall be composed of 12 \n     members appointed, not later than March 1, 2001, as follows:\n       (A) Up to 6 members appointed by the President.\n       (B) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (C) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (D) One member appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     Senate.\n       (E) One member appointed by the Minority Leader of the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (2) The members of the Commission shall be appointed from \n     among--\n       (A) persons with extensive experience and national \n     reputations in aerospace manufacturing, economics, finance, \n     national security, international trade or foreign policy; and\n       (B) persons who are representative of labor organizations \n     associated with the aerospace industry.\n       (3) Members shall be appointed for the life of the \n     Commission. Any vacancy in the Commission shall not affect \n     its powers, but shall be filled in the same manner as the \n     original appointment.\n       (4) The President shall designate one member of the \n     Commission to serve as the Chairman.\n       (5) The Commission shall meet at the call of the Chairman. \n     A majority of the members shall constitute a quorum, but a \n     lesser number may hold hearings for the Commission.\n       (d) Duties.--(1) The Commission shall--\n       (A) study the issues associated with the future of the \n     United States aerospace industry in the global economy, \n     particularly in relationship to United States national \n     security; and\n       (B) assess the future importance of the domestic aerospace \n     industry for the economic and national security of the United \n     States.\n       (2) In order to fulfill its responsibilities, the \n     Commission shall study the following:\n       (A) The budget process of the Federal Government, \n     particularly with a view to assessing the adequacy of \n     projected budgets of the Federal Government agencies for \n     aerospace research and development and procurement.\n       (B) The acquisition process of the Federal Government, \n     particularly with a view to assessing--\n       (i) the adequacy of the current acquisition process of \n     Federal agencies; and\n       (ii) the procedures for developing and fielding aerospace \n     systems incorporating new technologies in a timely fashion.\n       (C) The policies, procedures, and methods for the financing \n     and payment of government contracts.\n       (D) Statutes and regulations governing international trade \n     and the export of technology, particularly with a view to \n     assessing--\n       (i) the extent to which the current system for controlling \n     the export of aerospace goods, services, and technologies \n     reflects an adequate balance between the need to protect \n     national security and the need to ensure unhindered access to \n     the global marketplace; and\n       (ii) the adequacy of United States and multilateral trade \n     laws and policies for maintaining the international \n     competitiveness of the United States aerospace industry.\n       (E) Policies governing taxation, particularly with a view \n     to assessing the impact of current tax laws and practices on \n     the international competitiveness of the aerospace industry.\n       (F) Programs for the maintenance of the national space \n     launch infrastructure, particularly with a view to assessing \n     the adequacy of current and projected programs for \n     maintaining the national space launch infrastructure.\n       (G) Programs for the support of science and engineering \n     education, including current programs for supporting \n     aerospace science and engineering efforts at institutions of \n     higher learning, with a view to determining the adequacy of \n     those programs.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than March 1, 2002, the \n     Commission shall submit a report on its activities to the \n     President and Congress.\n       (2) The report shall include the following:\n       (A) The Commission's findings and conclusions.\n       (B) Recommendations for actions by Federal Government \n     agencies to support the maintenance of a robust aerospace \n     industry in the United States in the 21st century.\n       (C) A discussion of the appropriate means for implementing \n     the recommendations.\n       (f) Implementation of Recommendations.--The heads of the \n     executive agencies of the Federal Government having \n     responsibility for matters covered by recommendations of the \n     Commission shall consider the implementation of those \n     recommendations in accordance with regular administrative \n     procedures. The Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget shall coordinate the consideration of the \n     recommendations among the heads of those agencies.\n       (g) Administrative Requirements and Authorities.--(1) The \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall ensure \n     that the Commission is provided such administrative services, \n     facilities, staff, and other support services as may be \n     necessary. Any expenses of the Commission shall be paid from \n     funds available to the Director.\n       (2) The Commission may hold hearings, sit and act at times \n     and places, take testimony, and receive evidence that the \n     Commission considers advisable to carry out the purposes of \n     this Act.\n       (3) The Commission may secure directly from any department \n     or agency of the Federal Government any information that the \n     Commission considers necessary to carry out the provisions of \n     this Act. Upon the request of the Chairman of the Commission, \n     the head of such department or agency shall furnish such \n     information to the Commission.\n       (4) The Commission may use the United States mails in the \n     same manner and under the same conditions as other \n     departments and agencies of the Federal Government.\n       (5) The Commission is an advisory committee for the \n     purposes of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. \n     2).\n       (h) Commission Personnel Matters.--(1) Members of the \n     Commission shall serve without additional compensation for \n     their service on the Commission, except that members \n     appointed from among private citizens may be allowed travel \n     expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as \n     authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in \n     government service under subchapter I of chapter 57 of title \n     5, United States Code, while away from their homes and places \n     of business in the performance of services for the \n     Commission.\n       (2) The Chairman of the Commission may, without regard to \n     the civil service laws and regulations, appoint and terminate \n     any staff that may be necessary to enable the Commission to \n     perform its duties.

Con. Res. 101, which amendment would allocate \n     $250,000,000 in long-term economic development aid to assist \n     communities rebuilding from Hurricane Floyd, including \n     $150,000,000 in community development block grant funding and \n     $50,000,000 in rural facilities grant funding.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) communities devastated by Hurricane Floyd should know \n     that, in the past, Congress has responded to natural \n     disasters by demonstrating a commitment to helping affected \n     States and communities to recover;\n       (2) the Federal response to natural disasters has \n     traditionally been quick, supportive, and appropriate;\n       (3) recognizing that communities devastated by Hurricane \n     Floyd are facing tremendous challenges as they begin their \n     recovery, the Federal agencies that administer community and \n     regional development programs should expect an increase in \n     applications and other requests from these communities;\n       (4) community development block grants administered by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development, grant programs \n     administered by the Economic Development Administration, and \n     the Community Facilities Grant Program administered by the \n     Department of Agriculture are resources that communities have \n     used to accomplish revitalization and economic development \n     following natural disasters; and\n       (5) additional community and regional development funding, \n     as provided for in amendment number 3001 to S. Con. Res. 101, \n     as passed by the Senate on April 7, 2000, should be \n     appropriated to assist communities in need of long-term \n     economic development aid as a result of damage suffered by \n     Hurricane Floyd.\n\n     SEC. 1067.

Working Group, including representatives from more than 80 \n     governments including the United States, reached consensus on \n     an optional protocol on the use of child soldiers;\n       (11) this optional protocol will raise the international \n     minimum age for conscription and direct participation in \n     armed conflict to age eighteen, prohibit the recruitment and \n     use in armed conflict of persons under the age of eighteen by \n     non-governmental armed forces, encourage governments to raise \n     the minimum legal age for voluntary recruits above the \n     current standard of 15 and, commits governments to support \n     the demobilization and rehabilitation of child soldiers, and \n     when possible, to allocate resources to this purpose;\n       (12) on October 29, 1998, United Nations Secretary General \n     Kofi Annan set minimum age requirements for United Nations \n     peacekeeping personnel that are made available by member \n     nations of

governments of member \n     nations were asked not to send civilian police and military \n     observers under the age of 25, and that troops in national \n     contingents should preferably be at least 21 years of age but \n     in no case should they be younger than 18 years of age;\n       (14) on August 25, 1999, the United Nations Security \n     Council unanimously passed Resolution 1261 (1999) condemning \n     the use of children in armed conflicts;\n       (15) in addressing the Security Council, the Special \n     Representative of the Secretary General for Children and \n     Armed Conflict, Olara Otunnu, urged the adoption of a global \n     three-pronged approach to combat the use of children in armed \n     conflict, first to raise the age limit for recruitment and \n     participation in armed conflict from the present age of 15 to \n     the age of 18, second, to increase international pressure on \n     armed groups which currently abuse children, and third to \n     address the political, social, and economic factors which \n     create an environment where children are induced by appeal of \n     ideology or by socio-economic collapse to become child \n     soldiers;\n       (16) the United States delegation to the United Nations \n     working group relating to child soldiers, which included \n     representatives from the Department of Defense, supported the \n     Geneva agreement on the optional protocol;\n       (17) on May 25, 2000, the United Nations General Assembly \n     unanimously adopted the optional protocol on the use of child \n     soldiers;\n       (18) the optional protocol was opened for signature on June \n     5, 2000; and\n       (19) President Clinton has publicly announced his support \n     of the optional protocol and a speedy process of review and \n     signature.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--(1) Congress joins the \n     international community in--\n       (A) condemning the use of children as soldiers by \n     governmental and nongovernmental armed forces worldwide; and\n       (B) welcoming the optional protocol as a critical first \n     step in ending the use of children as soldiers.\n       (2) It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) it is essential that the President consult closely with \n     the Senate with the objective of building support for this \n     protocol, and the Senate move forward as expeditiously as \n     possible.\n       (B) the President and Congress should work together to \n     enact a law that establishes a fund for the rehabilitation \n     and reintegration into society of child soldiers; and\n        (C) the Departments of State and Defense should undertake \n     all possible efforts to persuade and encourage other \n     governments to ratify and endorse the new optional protocol \n     on the use of child soldiers.\n\n     SEC. 1211.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Local Law Enforcement \n     Enhancement Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 1502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, or disability of the victim poses a \n     serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) The prominent characteristic of a violent crime \n     motivated by bias is that it devastates not just the actual \n     victim and the victim's family and friends, but frequently \n     savages the community sharing the traits that caused the \n     victim to be selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including--\n       (A) by impeding the movement of members of targeted groups \n     and forcing such members to move across State lines to escape \n     the incidence or risk of such violence; and\n       (B) by preventing members of targeted groups from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (7) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (8) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (9) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n       (10) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (11) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n\n[[Page S6949]]\n\n       (12) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (13) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States and local \n     jurisdictions.\n\n     SEC. 1503. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this title, the term ``hate crime'' has the same meaning \n     as in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note).\n\n     SEC. 1504.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Russian Nuclear Weapons \n     Complex Conversion Act of 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 3192. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Russian nuclear weapons complex has begun closure \n     and complete reconfiguration of certain weapons complex \n     plants and productions lines. However, this work is at an \n     early stage. The major impediments to downsizing have been \n     economic and social conditions in Russia. Little information \n     about this complex is shared, and 10 of its most sensitive \n     cities remain closed. These cities house 750,000 people and \n     employ approximately 150,000 people in nuclear military \n     facilities. Although the Russian Federation Ministry of \n     Atomic Energy has announced the need to significantly \n     downsize its workforce, perhaps by as much as 50 percent, it \n     has been very slow in accomplishing this goal. Information on \n     the extent of any progress is very closely held.\n       (2) The United States, on the other hand, has significantly \n     downsized its nuclear weapons complex in an open and \n     transparent manner. As a result, an enormous asymmetry now \n     exists between the United States and Russia in nuclear weapon \n     production capacities and in transparency of such capacities. \n     It is in the national security interest of the United States \n     to assist the Russian Federation in accomplishing significant \n     reductions in its nuclear military complex and in helping it \n     to protect its nuclear weapons, nuclear materials, and \n     nuclear secrets during such reductions. Such assistance will \n     accomplish critical nonproliferation objectives and provide \n     essential support towards future arms reduction agreements. \n     The Russian Federation's program to close and reconfigure \n     weapons complex plants and production lines will address, if \n     it is implemented in a significant and transparent manner, \n     concerns about the Russian Federation's ability to quickly \n     reconstitute its arsenal.\n       (3) Several current programs address portions of the \n     downsizing and nuclear security concerns. The Nuclear Cities \n     Initiative was established to assist Russia in creating job \n     opportunities for employees who are not required to support \n     realistic Russian nuclear security requirements. Its focus \n     has been on creating commercial ventures that can provide \n     self-sustaining jobs in three of the closed cities. The \n     current scope and funding of the program are not commensurate \n     with the scale of the threats to the United States sought to \n     be addressed by the program.\n       (4) To effectively address threats to United States \n     national security interests, progress with respect to the \n     nuclear cities must be expanded and accelerated. The Nuclear \n     Cities Initiative has laid the groundwork for an immediate \n     increase in investment which offers the potential for prompt \n     risk reduction in the cities of Sarov, Snezhinsk, and \n     Zheleznogorsk, which house four key Russian nuclear \n     facilities. Furthermore, the Nuclear Cities Initiative has \n     made considerable progress with the limited funding \n     available. However, to gain sufficient advocacy for \n     additional support, the program must demonstrate--\n       (A) rapid progress in conversion and restructuring; and\n       (B) an ability for the United States to track progress \n     against verifiable milestones that support a Russian nuclear \n     complex consistent with their future national security \n     requirements.\n       (5) Reductions in the nuclear weapons-grade material stocks \n     in the United States and Russia enhance prospects for future \n     arms control agreements and reduce concerns that these \n     materials could lead to proliferation risks. Confidence in \n     both nations will be enhanced by knowledge of the extent of \n     each nation's stockpiles of weapons-grade materials. The \n     United States already makes this information public.\n       (6) Many current programs contribute to the goals stated \n     herein. However, the lack of programmatic coordination within \n     and among United States Government agencies impedes the \n     capability of the United States to make rapid progress. A \n     formal single point of coordination is essential to ensure \n     that all United States programs directed at cooperative \n     threat reduction, nuclear materials reduction and protection, \n     and the downsizing, transparency, and nonproliferation of the \n     nuclear weapons complex effectively mitigate the risks \n     inherent in the Russian Federation's military complex.\n       (7) Specialists in the United States and the former Soviet \n     Union trained in nonproliferation studies can significantly \n     assist in the downsizing process while minimizing the threat \n     presented by potential proliferation of weapons materials or \n     expertise.\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\n     SEC. 3193.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 336 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Snowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 336) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate regarding the contributions, sacrifices, and \n     distinguished service of Americans exposed to radiation or \n     radioactive material as a result of service in the Armed \n     Forces.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this resolution is introduced to honor \nveterans exposed to radiation while serving in the U.S. military.\n  As many of my colleagues are no doubt aware, many veterans, veterans \norganizations, and scientists believe that exposure to environmental \ntoxins or unknown diseases during military service has left thousands \nof veterans vulnerable to an array of disabilities and medical \nconditions. Over the years, Congress has responded to the concerns of \nveterans with claims resulting from service in nuclear testing areas, \nas well as Vietnam veterans suffering from exposure to Agent Orange, \nand Persian\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nGulf veterans suffering with the Persian Gulf War Illness. Authority \nfor the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide health care for \ndiseases possibly linked to radiation has been made permanent.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs is authorized by Congress to \nprovide special priority for enrollment for health services to any \nveteran exposed to ionizing radiation while participating in the \nnuclear weapons testing program, or if he or she served with the U.S. \noccupation forces in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. These veterans are eligible \nto participate in the VA ionizing radiation registry examination \nprogram, under which the VA will perform a complete physical \nexamination, including all necessary tests, for each veteran who \nrequests it. The VA also pays compensation to veterans and their \nsurvivors if the veteran is determined to have a disability due to \nradiation exposure while in service.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, with some disorders, evidence of a \nservice-connection is simply not conclusive. That is why Congress has \nin some cases permitted a ``presumption'' of a service-connection, so \nthat veterans can be provided much-needed care, and given appropriate \ncompensation, while science endeavors to verify whether a correlation \ncan be established between military service and the subsequent \ndevelopment of a given medical disorder.\n  Authority for the Department of Veterans Affairs to provide medical \ntreatment for diseases possibly linked to radiation has been made \npermanent by Congress. In 1987, Congress found that due to the fact \nthat the evidence of exposure-level risk could not be conclusively \nverified, our national veterans benefits policy should depend on \ncorrelation of various diseases with radiation exposure. Public Law \n100-321 included language establishing a presumption that 13 diseases \nwould be presumed to be service-connected if they developed in veterans \nwhose service histories included active duty in a ``radiation-risk \nactivity.'' Since 1987, the list established under Public Law 100-321 \nhas been expanded to include additional diseases, totalling \napproximately 16.\n  Mr. President, the resolution I am introducing today would recognize \nthe contributions, sacrifices, and distinguished service of Americans \nexposed to radiation or radioactive materials in the line of military \nduty and authorize a day of remembrance for these men and women.\n  From 1945 to 1963, the U.S. exploded approximately 235 nuclear \ndevices, potentially exposing an estimated 220,000 military personnel \nto unknown levels of radiation. In addition, roughly 195,000 \nservicemembers have been identified as participants in the post-WWII \noccupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Many of these veterans \nclaimed that low levels of radiation released during the testing, or \nexposure to radiation in service in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, may be a \ncause of certain medical conditions that have developed since that \nservice.\n  Under my resolution, Sunday July 16, 2000, the 55th anniversary of \nthe first atomic explosion--the Trinity Shot in New Mexico--is \ndesignated as a ``National Day of Remembrance'' honoring veterans \nexposed to radiation in the line of military duty, and the President is \nurged to issue a proclamation observing the day and paying tribute to \nthese Americans who have had to fight so hard to get the recognition \nand benefits they deserve. The measure also expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Department of Veterans Affairs should take steps to \nensure that veterans exposed to radiation in service to their country \nare awarded the benefits and services they deserve.\n  Mr. President, the nation has a solemn responsibility to veterans who \nare injured, or who incur a disease, while serving in the military, \nincluding the provision of health care, cash payments, and other \nbenefits that may be awarded to veterans who experience disabilities \nresulting from military service. This precedent is well-established and \nshould not be undercut or weakened.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in a strong show of support \nfor this resolution and the men and women exposed to radiation in the \nline of duty.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 336) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 336\n\n       Whereas the Nation has a responsibility to veterans who are \n     injured, or who incur a disease, while serving in the Armed \n     Forces, including the provision of health care, cash \n     compensation, and other benefits for such disabilities;\n       Whereas from 1945 to 1963, the United States conducted test \n     explosions of approximately 235 nuclear devices, potentially \n     exposing approximately 220,000 members of the Armed Forces to \n     unknown levels of radiation, and approximately 195,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces have been identified as \n     participants in the occupation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \n     Japan, after World War II;\n       Whereas many of these veterans later claimed that low \n     levels of radiation released during such tests, or exposure \n     to radiation during such occupation, may be a cause of \n     certain medical conditions; and\n       Whereas Sunday, July 16, 2000, is the 55th anniversary of \n     the first nuclear explosion, the Trinity Shot in New Mexico: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) July 16, 2000, should be designated as a ``National Day \n     of Remembrance'' in order to honor veterans exposed to \n     radiation or radioactive materials during service in the \n     Armed Forces; and\n       (2) the contributions, sacrifices, and distinguished \n     service on behalf of the United States of the Americans \n     exposed to radiation or radioactive materials while serving \n     in the Armed Forces are worthy of solemn recognition.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6983-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to put all Members on notice \nthat just under 40 amendments were filed on the marriage penalty \nreconciliation bill. Those votes will occur in stacked sequence \nbeginning at 6:15 p.m. on Monday. Therefore, all Senators should \nprepare for a late night session on Monday with a lot of recorded \nvotes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I could ask my friend to yield, we have \n40 amendments filed. I hope the Senator will work on his side as we \nwill on our side. There is some duplication. It may not be necessary to \nhave votes on each amendment. There may be other things that develop \nduring Monday. We may not need all of those votes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I concur with my friend and colleague \nfrom Nevada. I think for a lot of these amendments recorded votes are \nnot necessary. A lot of these amendments will fall on procedure because \nthey won't be germane to the reconciliation bill.\n  I will work with my friend from Nevada energetically to reduce the \nnumber of amendments on this side, as I am sure he will on the other \nside, to see if we can't expedite the matter and finish this \nreconciliation bill to provide marriage penalty relief for married \ncouples, and hopefully complete it on Monday evening.\n  Mr. President, as a reminder, stacked votes are scheduled also for \n9:45 a.m. on Tuesday with respect to the Interior bill. Therefore, \nMembers should plan to stay in or around the Senate Chamber for those \nstacked votes on Tuesday morning as well. It is our intention to \ncomplete the interior bill on Tuesday and move to other matters.\n  We are going to have a busy couple of weeks. We had a fruitful week \nthis week. We passed the Defense authorization bill. We almost \ncompleted the Interior bill. We completed the repeal of the death tax \nbill. This has been a good week. We have 2 more weeks prior to the \nAugust recess, which are going to be very aggressive. Next week we plan \nto take up the energy and water appropriations bill and the Agriculture \nappropriations bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6983-2", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, since its passage in 1997, the BBA has \ndrastically cut Medicare payments in the areas of hospital, home health \nand skilled nursing care services, among others.\n\n  While the reductions were originally estimated at around $100 billion \nover five years, recent figures put the actual cuts in Medicare \npayments at over $100 billion.\n  These cuts have consequences. Beneficiaries with medically complex \nneeds face increase difficulty in accessing skilled nursing care. \nHospital discharge planners have greater difficulty obtaining home \nhealth services for Medicare beneficiaries as a result of the BBA. \nRural Hospital margins have dropped four percentage points continuing a \ndangerous trend that threatens access to care in rural America.\n  Last year, Congress acknowledged that the Medicare savings that \nresulted from the 1997 Balanced Budget Act went far beyond what we \nintended, and passed the Balanced Budget Refinement Act (BBRA) but it \ndidn't go nearly far enough.\n  With actual cuts in payment of $200 billion from the BBA, the BBRA \nreversed at best only 10% of these actual cuts in payment to providers \ncaused by the BBA,\n  My state of Minnesota has been hit very hard by the BBA cuts, and \nlast year's fix hasn't stopped the pain. As I said when I voted against \nthe BBA, the cuts are too harsh and they will hurt our health care \nsystem. Both urban safety net hospitals and rural hospitals are feeling \nthe pain. They are cutting back services, they are short staffed, like \nthe hospital in Aurora, MN are faced with closing if they can't find a \nway to restructure so that their reliance on Medicare is not so great.\n  My colleagues should be aware that in rural Minnesota typically 70% \nof the revenue for rural hospitals is from Medicare and Medicaid. \nHospitals are often the largest employers in these communities and new \nbusinesses won't locate in a community if it doesn't have a hospital. \nYou can't blame them.\n  In addition these hospitals are critical to the tourism industry, \nwhich in my state is made up largely of mom and pop resorts, \nrestaurants, lodges, canoe outfitters, fishing guides, cross country \nski lodges as well as the downhill ski areas, snow mobile trails, \nvendors who cater to hunters and fishermen and women, bicyclists who \nuse our state trails, the list is a long one.\n  When these folks become sick or are injured while out in the \nwilderness, on the water, on the ski hill or while hunting, they need a \nlocal hospital to treat their injury or illness. In our state of \nMinnesota these front line health care providers are small rural \nhospitals in communities like Cook, Grand Marais, Ely and Teo Harbors. \nWe can't fly out all the people with broken bones or heart attacks \nduring a blizzard, or in the fog. We need hospitals there to provide \nthe care.\n  Northwestern Minnesota has been hit again by flooding this year. I \ndon't know how many years in a row this has happened. We need health \ncare there in these communities for farm families who are struggling \nwith the farm economy, the weather and a health care crisis in their \nfamily. The hospitals in Northwestern Minnesota are on the razors edge \nof staying open. These BBA cuts hit them hard and hurt them badly.\n  Southwestern Minnesota is a part of my state that relies on the farm \neconomy. When families are not making any money at farming like this \nyear and last year, whether it be collapsed hog prices, milk, or grain \nprices, through no fault of their own they don't have money to buy good \ninsurance, the counties' revenue from property taxes that supports the \nrural county hospitals can't keep up and if Medicare isn't there with a \nfair level of reimbursement, they face the possibility of closing as \nwell.\n  There has been a tremendous number of closings in home health care in \nMinnesota. The cuts we made were extreme. People who could be taken \ncare of at home are now kept longer in the more costly hospital setting \nsimply because there is no one to provide the home care.\n  But let me focus on the White Community Hospital in Aurora, \nMinnesota. This is a hospital that serves an iron ore mining community \nin Northeast Minnesota. The miners in this community and others in \ncommunities across Minnesota's iron range mined the ore that was turned \ninto steel and built our cites in the twentieth century, made the cars, \nand the rails. They are the hear and soul of America. They or their \nparents came to this country, fleeing oppression in many European \ncountries, they have a strong patriotism, a powerful work ethic and a \ncommunity second to none in the United States. When I visited them last \nweek to hear about the struggle they are engaged in to keep their \nhospital open I didn't over promise, but I did promise I would do \neverything I could to help them in their fight. And I will. The BBA is \nhurting them. It is an anchor around the neck of their hospital. They \nare fighting for their hospital and we can't turn our back on them.\n  I have co-sponsored numerous pieces of legislation to restore \nadditional funds to Medicare providers, but what we need is \ncomprehensive BBA relief and our constituents, our hospitals, our \nnursing homes, and our home health agencies cannot wait.\n  When Medicare fails to pay its share, it threatens health care for \nall patients. Reduced Medicare payments are contributing to decisions \nby many providers and insurers that threaten Medicare beneficiaries' \naccess to care, including staff layoffs, reductions in services, or \neven outright facility closures or decisions to withdraw from the \nMedicare program. As we all know, entire communities suffer when such \nactions take place.\n  We need comprehensive and substantial relief for community hospitals, \nteaching hospitals, rural hospitals, home health agencies, and skilled \nnursing facilities, among others--and we need it now, before Congress \nadjourns before the August recess.\n  This amendment simply sates that it is the sense of the Senate that \nby the end of the 106th Congress, Congress shall revisit and restore a \nsubstantial portion of the reductions in Medicare payments to providers \ncaused by enactment of the BBA of 1997\n  I wish to let colleagues know that I am going to call for a vote on \nan amendment Monday evening that deals with the drastic reduction of \nMedicare payments in the areas of hospital and home health care, and \nalso skilled nursing care.\n  In 1997, we passed the balanced budget amendment, and the reductions \nin Medicare over a 5-year period were estimated to be around $100 \nbillion. The recent figure is going to be about $200 billion.\n  Last year, we tried to do a ``fix,'' and we passed what was called \nthe Balanced Budget Refinement Act. But basically what it did was \nrestore about 10 percent of the actual cuts that we have made. I could \nsay this in a more complete way, but what I want to do right now is \njust say to colleagues that my amendment is going to deal with these \ncuts. Either it is going to be a sense of the Senate that says by the \nend of the session, we have to restore some of this assistance, some of \nthis money to our providers and to our patients and to the consumers, \nand/or I could have another amendment that says if we do not do that, \nthere needs to be a freeze in the cuts.\n  I am sure the Presiding Officer has heard of this in Alabama. I think \nyou hear it in Nevada. I hear it in Minnesota. You hear it all across \nthe country. In Minnesota, especially in our rural communities, whether \nit is White Hospital in the Iron Range in the White Lakes, whether it \nis southwest Minnesota, whether it is west central Minnesota, \nespecially in our rural communities--we are going to lose these \nhospitals. They lost anywhere from 50 to 70 percent of their payment on \nMedicaid and Medicare.\n  Colleagues, in 1997, I don't know what we were thinking when we voted \nfor this. I think it was a big mistake. I did not vote for it. Others \nvoted for it in good faith. Right now, what we are hearing is that \nthese hospitals are not going to be able to provide the care. They are \ngoing to go under. These nursing homes are not going to be able to make \nit. We have seen severe cuts and cutbacks of services in home health \ncare.\n  The point is this: Yes, it is true the hospitals and nursing homes \nare important employers in these communities, so there are jobs. Yes, \nit is true the same thing could be said for home health care. But the \nworst part of it is we are talking about a dramatic decline in the \nquality of care for people.\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nIn a lot of communities, especially in rural America, this is the death \nknell for our communities. It is hard enough for people to struggle to \nearn a decent living, but people can't stay in the communities if there \nis not good health care and if there is not good education available. \nRight now, we do not have that, if these hospitals shut down.\n  This amendment is an amendment that speaks to these cuts. It will be \nan amendment based upon many meetings I have had with community people \nall across Minnesota. I think it is an amendment that all my \ncolleagues, hopefully, will support because when Medicare does not pay \nits share, it is a threat to the health care for patients and it also \nhas a dramatic negative effect on our communities as well.\n  I want to bring this to the attention of colleagues. I hope there \nwill be a strong vote for this amendment. There is some discussion we \nare not going to do anything about this. But we never should have voted \nfor cuts that are this severe. This has had just the harshest \nconsequences. It was a mistake and we have to restore this funding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6985-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6985-S6987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MASSACRES IN COLOMBIA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

They went \n     straight to the basketball court that doubles as the main \n     square, residents said, announced themselves as members of \n     Colombia's most feared right-wing paramilitary group, and \n     with a list of names began summoning residents for judgment.\n       A table and chairs were taken from a house, and after the \n     death squad leader had made himself comfortable, the \n     basketball court was turned into a court of execution, \n     villagers said. The paramilitary troops ordered liquor and \n     music, and then embarked on a calculated rampage of torture, \n     rape and killing.\n       ``To them, it was like a big party,'' said one of a dozen \n     survivors who described the scene in interviews this month. \n     ``They drank and danced and cheered as they butchered us like \n     hogs.''\n       By the time they left, late the following Sunday afternoon, \n     they had killed at least 36 people whom they accused of \n     collaborating with the enemy, left-wing guerrillas who have \n     long been a presence in the area. The victims, for the most \n     part, were men, but others ranged from a 6-year-old girl to \n     an elderly woman. As music blared, some of the victims were \n     shot after being tortured; others were stabbed or beaten to \n     death, and several more were strangled.\n       Yet during the three days of killing last February, \n     military and police units just a few miles away made no \n     effort to stop the slaughter, witnesses said. At one point, \n     they said, the paramilitaries had a helicopter flown in to \n     rescue a fighter who had been injured trying to drag some \n     victims from their home.\n       Instead of fighting back, the armed forces set up a \n     roadblock on the way to the village shortly after the rampage \n     began, and prevented human rights and relief groups from \n     entering and rescuing residents.\n       While the Colombian military has opened three \n     investigations into what happened here and has made some \n     arrests of paramilitaries, top military officials insist that \n     fighting was under way in the village between guerrillas and \n     paramilitary forces--not a series of executions. They also \n     insist that the colonel in charge of the region has been \n     persecuted by government prosecutors and human rights groups. \n     Last month he was promoted to general, even though \n     examinations of the incidents are pending.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 14, 2000]\n\n  Villagers Tell of a Massacre in Colombia, With the Army Standing By\n\n                           (By Larry Rohter)\n\n       El Salado, Colombia.--The armed men, more than 300 of them, \n     marched into this tiny village early on a Friday.

They also \n     insist that the colonel in charge of the region has been \n     persecuted by government prosecutors and human rights groups. \n     Last month he was promoted to general, even though \n     examinations of the incidents are pending.\n       What happened in El Salado last February--at the same time \n     that President Clinton was pushing an aid package to step up \n     antidrug efforts here--goes to the heart of the debate over \n     the growing American backing of the Colombian military. For \n     years the United States government and human rights groups \n     have had reservations about the Colombian military \n     leadership, its human rights record and its collaboration \n     with paramilitary units.\n       The Colombian Armed Forces and police are the principal \n     beneficiaries of a new $1.3 billion aid package from \n     Washington. The Colombian government says it has been \n     working hard to sever the remnants of ties between the \n     armed forces and the paramilitaries and has been training \n     its soldiers to observe international human rights \n     conventions even during combat.\n       ``The paramilitaries are some of the worst of the \n     terrorists who profit from drugs in Colombia, and in no way \n     can anyone justify their human rights violations,'' said Gen. \n     Barry R. McCaffrey, the White House drug policy director. But \n     he said ``the Colombian military is making dramatic \n     improvements in its human rights record,'' and noted that the \n     aid package includes ``significant money, $46 million, for \n     human rights training and implementation.''\n       But human rights groups, pointing to incidents like the \n     massacre here, say these links still exist and that \n     mechanisms to monitor and punish commanders and units have \n     had limited success at best.\n       ``El Salado was the worst recorded massacre yet this \n     year,'' said Andrew Miller, a Latin American specialist for \n     Amnesty International USA, who spent the past year as an \n     observer near here. ``The Colombian Armed Forces, \n     specifically the marines, were at best criminally negligent \n     by not responding sooner to the attack. At worst, they were \n     knowledgeable and complicit.''\n       The paramilitary attack on El Salado killed more people and \n     lasted longer than any other in Colombia this year. But in \n     most other respects it was an operation so typical of the \n     5,500-member right-wing death squad that goes by the name of \n     the Peasant Self-Defense of Colombia that the Colombian press \n     treated it as just another atrocity.\n       The paramilitary groups were founded in the early 1980's, \n     mostly funded by agricultural interests to protect them from \n     extortion and kidnapping by the left-wing guerrillas. The \n     groups were declared illegal over a decade ago, but have \n     continued to operate, often with clandestine military support \n     and intelligence, and in recent years have become \n     increasingly involved in drug trafficking.\n       Over the past 18 months, more than 2,500 people, most of \n     them unarmed peasants in rural areas like this village in \n     northern Colombia, have died in more than 500 attacks by what \n     the Colombian government calls ``illegal armed groups'' \n     involved in the country's 35-year-old civil conflict. And \n     according to the government, right-wing paramilitary groups \n     are responsible for most of those killings.\n       Since the El Salado massacre, nearly 3,000 residents of the \n     area have fled to nearby towns, including El Carmen de \n     Bolivar and Ovejas, as well as the provincial capital, \n     Cartagena. Early this month, more than a dozen of the \n     survivors were interviewed in the towns where they have taken \n     refuge under the protection of human rights groups or the \n     Roman Catholic Church.\n       Despite efforts to protect them, however, some have \n     recently been killed in individual\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\n     attacks or have disappeared, actions for which the same \n     paramilitary group that attacked their village has been \n     blamed. As a result, all of the survivors interviewed for \n     this story spoke on condition that their names not be used.\n       Their accounts, however, coincide with investigations \n     conducted by the Colombian government prosecutor's office and \n     by the Colombia office of the United Nations high \n     commissioner for human rights.\n       Members of a paramilitary unit had attacked this village in \n     1997, killing five people and warning that they would \n     eventually come back. Many residents fled then, but returned \n     after a few months believing that they were safe until the \n     death squad suddenly reappeared on the morning of Feb. 18.\n       ``I looked up at the hills, and could see armed men \n     everywhere, blocking every possible exit,'' a farmer \n     recalled. ``They had surrounded the town, and almost as soon \n     as they came down, they began firing their guns and shouting, \n     `Death to the guerrillas.' ''\n       The death squad troops, almost all dressed in military-\n     style uniforms with a blue patch, made their way to the \n     basketball court at the center of the village. The took \n     tables and chairs from a nearby building, pulled out a list \n     of names and began the search for victims.\n       ``Some people were shot, but a lot of them were beaten with \n     clubs and then stabbed with knives or sliced up with \n     machetes,'' one witness said. ``A few people were beheaded, \n     or strangled with metal wires, while others had their throats \n     cut.''\n       The list of those to be executed was supplied by two men, \n     one wearing a ski mask. Paramilitary leaders, who have \n     acknowledged the attack on El Salado but describe it as \n     combat with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known \n     as the FARC, said the two were FARC deserters who had dealt \n     with local people and knew who had been guerrilla \n     sympathizers.\n       ``It was all done very methodically,'' one witness said. \n     ``Some people were brought to the basketball court, but were \n     saved because someone would say, `Not that one,' and they \n     would be allowed to leave. But I saw a woman neighbor of \n     mine, who I know had nothing at all to do with the \n     guerrillas, knocked down with clubs and then stabbed to \n     death.''\n       While some paramilitaries searched for people to kill, \n     others were breaking into shops and stealing beer, rum and \n     whisky. Before long, a macabre party atmosphere prevailed, \n     with the paramilitaries setting up radios with dance music \n     and ordering a local guitarist and accordionist to play.\n       In addition, a young waitress from a cantina adjoining the \n     basketball court was ordered to keep a steady supply of \n     liquor flowing. As the armed men grew drunk and rowdy, they \n     repeatedly raped her, along with several other women, \n     according to residents and human rights groups.\n       As night fell, some residents fled to the wooded hills \n     above town. Others, however stayed in their homes, afraid of \n     being caught if they tried to escape, unable to move because \n     they had small children, or convinced that they would not be \n     harmed.\n       Saturday was more of the same. ``All day long we could hear \n     occasional bursts of gunfire, along with the screams and \n     cries of those who were being tortured and killed,'' said a \n     women who had taken refuge in the hills with her small \n     children.\n       Of the 36 people killed in town, 16 were executed at the \n     basketball court. And additional 18 people were killed in the \n     countryside, residents and human rights workers said, and 17 \n     more are still missing, making for a death toll that could be \n     as high as 71.\n       By Friday afternoon, however, news of the slaughter had \n     spread to El Carmen de Bolivar, about 15 miles away. \n     Relatives of El Salado residents rushed to local police and \n     military posts, but were rebuffed.\n       ``We made a scandal and nearly caused a riot, we were so \n     insistent,'' said a 40-year-old-man who had left El Salado \n     early on Friday because he had business in town. ``But they \n     did nothing to help us.''\n       Besides not coming to the aid of villagers here, the armed \n     forces and the police set up roadblocks that prevented others \n     from entering the town to help. Anyone seeking to enter the \n     area was told the road was unsafe because it had been mined \n     and that combat was going on between guerrilla and \n     paramilitary units.\n       In a telephone interview, three Colombian Navy admirals \n     said that residents of El Salado were accusing the military \n     of complicity in the massacre because they have been coerced \n     by guerrillas. The roadblock was set up, they said, to \n     prevent more deaths or injuries to civilians.\n       ``At no point was there collaboration on our part, nor \n     would we have permitted their passage'' through the area, Adm \n     William Porras, the second in command of the Colombian Navy, \n     said on the death squad unit. ``We never at any point were \n     covering up for them or helping them, as all the subsequent \n     investigations have shown.''\n       But local residents, Colombian prosecutors investigating \n     the massacre and human rights groups say there was no combat. \n     Villagers say that the armed forces had not been in the \n     center of El Salado recently, and that they had left the \n     outlying areas a day before. Residents also say they had \n     passed over the dirt road that Friday morning and there were \n     no mines.\n       ``The army was on patrol for two or three days before the \n     massacre took place, and then suddenly they disappeared,'' \n     recalled a 43-year-old tobacco farmer. ``It can't \n     be explained, and it seems very curious to me.''\n       What has been established is that the villagers were simple \n     peasants, and not the guerrillas the paramilitary leader says \n     his troops were fighting. ``It is quite clear that these were \n     defenseless people and that what they were subjected to was \n     not combat, but abuse and torture,'' said a foreign diplomat \n     who has been investigating.\n       Residents said the paramilitaries felt so certain that \n     government security forces would stay away that late on \n     Friday they had a helicopter flown in. It landed in front of \n     a church and picked up a death squad fighter who was injured \n     when a family he was trying to drag out of their house to be \n     taken to the basketball court resisted.\n       In a report published last February, Human Rights Watch \n     found ``detailed, abundant and compelling evidence of \n     continuing close ties between the Colombian Army and \n     paramilitary groups responsible for gross human rights \n     violations.'' All told, ``half of Colombia's 18 brigade-level \n     units have documented links to paramilitary activity,'' the \n     report concluded.\n       ``Far from moving decisively to sever ties to \n     paramilitaries, Human Rights Watch's evidence strongly \n     suggests that Colombia's military high command has yet to \n     take the necessary steps to accomplish this goal,'' the \n     report stated.\n       At the time of the El Salado massacre, the senior military \n     officer in this region was Col. Rodrigo Quinones Cardenas, \n     commander of the First Navy Brigade, who has since been \n     promoted to general. As director of Naval Intelligence in the \n     early 1990's, he was identified by Colombian prosecutors as \n     the organizer of a paramilitary network responsible for the \n     killings of 57 trade unionists, human rights workers and \n     members of a left-wing political party.\n       In 1994, Colonel Quinones and seven other soldiers were \n     charged with ``conspiring to form or collaborate with armed \n     groups.'' But after the main witness against him was killed \n     in a maximum security prison and the case was moved from a \n     civilian court to a military tribunal, the colonel was \n     acquitted.\n       According to the same investigation by Colombian \n     prosecutors, one of Colonel Quinones's closest associates in \n     that paramilitary network was Harold Mantilla, a colonel in \n     the Colombian Marines. Today, Colonel Mantilla is commander \n     of the Fifth Marine Battalion, which operates in the area \n     around El Salado and is one of the units said by residents \n     and human rights workers to have failed to respond to appeals \n     for help.\n       After the paramilitary unit left El Salado, the police \n     captured 11 paramilitaries northeast of here on the ranch of \n     a drug trafficker who is in prison in Bogota. Along with four \n     others who were arrested separately, they are facing murder \n     charges, but their leaders and most of the others who carried \n     out the killings remain free.\n       More than four months after the massacre, El Salado is \n     virtually deserted. Only one of the town's 1,330 original \n     residents was present when a reporter and human rights \n     workers visited early this month, and he said the village \n     remains as it was the day the death squad left, except for \n     the two mass graves on a rise near the basketball court where \n     the bodies were buried and later exhumed for investigators.\n       The tables and chairs used by the paramilitary ``judges,'' \n     smashed or overturned as they left, are still strewn across \n     the basketball court.\n       ``I don't know if the people are ever going to want to come \n     back again,'' the resident said. ``What happened here was \n     just too terrible to bear, and we didn't deserve it.''\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We just voted, with essentially no strings attached, \nto be involved in a military operation in Colombia with the money going \nfor a military operation, to a military that does not lift a finger \nwhile these paramilitary death squads go in and massacre innocent \npeople. I say to Senators, Democrats and Republicans, this is no longer \nColombia's business. This is our business because we now have provided \nthe money for just such a military, which is complicit, not only in \nhuman rights violations--I spoke about this on the floor of the \nSenate--but in this particular case in the murder of innocent people, \nincluding small children.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I sent \nto Secretary Albright.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2000.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State,\n     U.S. Department of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: I write to express my profound \n     concern over the reported murder and disappearance of 71 \n     civilians in February in El Salado and six civilians this \n     past weekend in La Union, Colombia. Both massacres were \n     allegedly committed by paramilitary groups in collaboration \n     with members of the Colombia Armed Forces. I urge you to move \n     swiftly to investigate these claims and to ensure that those \n     involved in these atrocities are brought to justice.\n\n[[Page S6987]]\n\n       According to a report today in the New York Times, on \n     February 17th a paramilitary group killed 36 people in El \n     Salado, sixteen of which were executed in the town's \n     basketball court. Another 18 were killed in the surrounding \n     countryside, and 17 are still missing. At the time of the \n     massacre, the senior military office in the region was Col. \n     Rodrigo Quinones Cardenas, commander of the First Navy \n     Brigade, who has since been promoted to general. Not only did \n     military and police units in the area not come to the aid of \n     the villagers, they allegedly set up road blocks which \n     prevented others from entering the town to provide assistance \n     to the victims. While the evidence in this case strongly \n     indicates the link between the armed forces and the \n     paramilitaries in the massacre at El Salado, it clearly \n     confirms a negligence of the duty of the Colombian military \n     and police to protect the civilian population. Similarly, on \n     July 8, helicopters and soldiers from the Colombian 17th Army \n     Brigade appear to have facilitated killings of six men by a \n     paramilitary unit in La Union.\n       Yesterday, the President signed a bill that will provide \n     approximately $1 billion in emergency supplemental assistance \n     to the Colombian government to support its counter narcotics \n     efforts. During the debate in Congress over Plan Colombia, I \n     and many of my colleagues objected to the plan's military \n     component, the ``Push into Southern Colombia,'' given the \n     detailed and abundant evidence of continuing close ties \n     between the Colombian Army and paramilitary groups \n     responsible for gross human rights violations. The final \n     package was conditioned on the Administration and the \n     Colombian government ensuring that ties between the Armed \n     Forces and paramilitaries are severed, and that Colombian \n     Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have \n     committed gross human rights violations are held accountable.\n       Instead of moving decisively to sever ties to \n     paramilitaries, some elements in Colombia's military high \n     command continue to work with paramilitary groups and have \n     yet to take the necessary steps to accomplish that goal. For \n     example, Col. Cardenas was the senior military officer \n     overseeing the El Salado area at the time of the massacre, \n     and was identified by Colombian prosecutors in the early \n     1990's as the organizer of a paramilitary network \n     responsible for the killings of 57 trade unionist and \n     human workers. Nevertheless, since the killings in El \n     Salado in February, he has received a promotion to \n     general. How does this demonstrate the Colombian \n     military's stated commitment to clean up its house? Is it \n     the policy of the Colombian military to offer promotions \n     to officers involved in incidences about which \n     investigations for human rights abuses are pending?\n       I am very concerned about the credibility of the vetting \n     process used to insure that Colombian soldiers accused of \n     human rights violations will not serve in the battalions \n     scheduled to receive training from the United States \n     military. It is my understanding that the vetting process \n     checks only for those accusations of direct involvement in \n     human rights violations and does not consider the fact that \n     soldiers may indirectly facilitate abuses. This is reported \n     to have been the case in El Salado.\n       During the debate surrounding Plan Colombia, the \n     Administration and the Colombian government pledged to work \n     to reduce the production and supply of cocaine while \n     protecting human rights. The continuing reports of human \n     rights abuses in Colombia confirm my grave reservations \n     regarding the Administration's ability to effectively manage \n     the use of the resources that will be provided while \n     protecting the human rights of Colombian citizens. To that \n     end, I respectfully seek answers to the following questions:\n       (1) How will the Administration ensure a vetting process \n     guaranteeing that Colombians indirectly facilitating human \n     rights violations, as well as those accused of direct \n     violations, will not serve in battalions being trained by the \n     United States military?\n       (2) What will the Administration do to ensure that the \n     alleged murders and human rights abuses in El Salado are \n     investigated, and that those responsible are prosecuted?\n       (3) How will the Administration address the needs of the \n     victims at El Salado, including the nearly 3,000 residents \n     displaced by the incident?\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward \n     to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul D. Wellstone,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I conclude this letter:\n\n       During this debate surrounding Plan Colombia, the \n     Administration and the Colombian government pledged to work \n     to reduce the production and supply of cocaine while \n     protecting human rights. The continuing reports of human \n     rights abuses in Colombia confirm my grave reservations \n     regarding the Administration's ability to effectively manage \n     the use of the resources that will be provided while \n     protecting the human rights of Colombian citizens. To that \n     end I respectfully seek answers to the following questions.\n       I respectfully seek answers to the following questions from \n     Secretary Albright.\n       No. 1, How will the Administration ensure a vetting process \n     guaranteeing that Colombians indirectly facilitating human \n     rights violations, as well as those accused of direct \n     violations, will not serve in battalions being trained by the \n     United States military?\n       I want an answer to that question from the Secretary of \n     State.\n       No. 2, What will the Administration do to ensure that the \n     alleged murderers and human rights abuses in El Salado are \n     investigated, and that those responsible are prosecuted?\n       No. 3, How will the Administration address the needs of the \n     victims at El Salado, including the nearly 3,000 residents \n     displaced by the incident?\n\n  Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking my colleague, Senator \nBryan, for his graciousness, but also by saying to Senators, again, \nthis front-page story--and I just wrote the administration about \nanother massacre just a few days ago in Colombia--this is our business.\n  We support this government. We are supporting the military operation \nin the south. We are supporting this military with this kind of record, \ncomplicity in this kind of slaughter of innocent people.\n  I hope Secretary Albright will respond to this letter in an \nexpeditious way. I will continue to come to the floor of the Senate and \nspeak out about what is going on in Colombia. Senator Durbin is very \nconcerned. Senator Reed is very concerned. Senator Biden is very \nconcerned. He had a different position on this Colombia aid package. \nAll should speak out, whatever our vote was on this legislation, \nbecause this is our business. This is being done, if not directly, \nindirectly, in our name.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am always pleased to yield to my friend \nand colleague from Minnesota. I know how deeply he feels about these \nissues. I was happy to provide him the time to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6987-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6987-S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MARRIAGE TAX PENALTY RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I preface my comments this afternoon by \npraising the distinguished public service of the ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee, the very able and distinguished senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan. Senator Moynihan is not only a \ntreasure for his own State; he is a national resource. This institution \nand this country will greatly miss his public service.\n  His years of experience have provided context and perspective for \nmany of the policy debates in which we have been engaged since I have \nbeen a Member of this body and, more specifically, since becoming a \nmember of the Senate Finance Committee and having had the opportunity \nto meet with him. He always acts in a gracious way, with much charm and \nconsiderable Irish wit and humor that makes every meeting of the Senate \nFinance Committee something special because of his wisdom, his insight, \nand the manner in which he presents his case.\n  I am pleased to be supportive of the alternative marriage penalty \nrelief measure of which he is the prime architect, and I will discuss \nthat more in just a moment.\n  My purpose in coming to the floor this afternoon is to oppose the \nlegislation before us today. I do so with regret because it is my view \nthat it would be possible for us to craft a bipartisan measure which \nwould accomplish the result sought by those of us who believe the \nmarriage penalty is unfair and should be eliminated.\n  Unfortunately, this measure will pass. It will do so on a partisan \nvote, and, most assuredly, the President will veto this measure and we \nwill, in effect, have missed an opportunity to alleviate a burden that \nmillions of Americans endure, that is unfair, and that we could correct \nbefore this session of the Congress concludes. I regret that very \ndeeply, and I am hopeful we may extricate ourselves from the situation \nwe face.\n\n  This measure is described as providing relief from a marriage \npenalty. Let me say that it sails under false colors. No. 1, it does \nnot provide the relief its advocates contend. No. 2, it provides \nsubstantial tax relief to those who are not facing a marriage penalty, \nwho enjoy a marriage bonus, and to at least 29 million others who are \nnot married at all.\n  Providing relief in these two other categories may be an area of \nlegitimate debate and concern, but it could\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nhardly be argued that this is providing relief from an onerous marriage \npenalty. I much appreciate the support of our distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee to provide relief to taxpayers who are currently \npaying the penalty. As I said, this does much more and, I think in \ndoing so, diminishes our effort to solve the problem.\n  My own view is that as a result of the surpluses that have accrued, \nwe ought to be paying down the national debt and taking care of the \nSocial Security and Medicare problem that is longstanding and that \nthreatens to engulf us in those outyears as more and more people become \neligible for that program. We ought to be providing a prescription drug \nbenefit as part of Medicare and, yes, we ought to be providing some tax \nrelief, but we ought to do so in a very targeted fashion. I believe \nthat appropriately one of those targets is eliminating the marriage \npenalty, and I will talk more about the specifics of the proposal in \njust a moment.\n  The proposal before us not only is not targeted and is misdirected, \nin my view, it is also enormously costly. Although we are debating this \nmatter in the context of reconciliation, a concept that I suspect is \nlost on most Americans who may be watching the proceedings of the \nSenate this afternoon, that is in a 5-year constraint. In point of \nfact, what we are talking about is a 10-year bill and a 10-year cost.\n  The proposal the majority advances would cost $248 billion. In my \nview, we squander much of the surplus that could be devoted to these \nother priorities and yet fail to achieve what the majority says is its \npriority, and that is to eliminate the marriage penalty.\n  Let me talk for a moment about what the marriage penalty is because \nnot everybody perhaps understands it. Because of certain anomalies in \nthe Tax Code, when millions and millions of married couples in which \nboth are wage earners--a situation that has become increasingly \nfrequent in recent years--combine their incomes, some married couples \npay a penalty, and that is wrong and we ought to correct that. It is \nindefensible and, indeed, one can even argue that it is morally \nimproper as well.\n  Twenty-five million Americans pay a marriage penalty, and that is the \ntarget to which I want to address my comments.\n  Because of the anomalies in the Tax Code, another 21 million \nAmericans receive a marriage bonus; that is, they benefit by reason of \nthe provisions of the Tax Code. In my view, that is not what the target \nought to be. Those married couples will, under the provision of the \nRepublican plan, receive a bonus on top of a bonus, and that, it seems \nto me, ought not be where our priorities are focused.\n  Let me point, if I may, to the chart to my right. The total cost of \nthis plan, as I indicated, is $248 billion over a 10-year period of \ntime. Note that 40 percent of those who will be beneficiaries under the \nplan--40 percent receive 40 percent of the $248 billion; 60 percent of \nthat $248 billion goes to those who are in the bonus category; and 23 \npercent do not have any penalty at all, no impact by virtue of the \nmarriage penalty.\n\n  Of the total amount we are providing in the form of tax relief, only \n40 percent--substantially less than half--actually is targeted to the \nmarriage penalty. That is on what we ought to be focusing our \nattention. Sixty percent of the tax relief provided in this measure has \nnothing to do with the marriage penalty at all.\n  Moreover, under the bill that is offered by the majority, we have \nindividuals who will be affected. Some 5 million additional taxpayers \nwill be caught up under what is referred to as an alternative minimum \ntax. The Republican proposal does not reduce the tax rolls of the AMT, \nor the alternative minimum tax; it greatly expands it. That is why I \nhave called this proposal something that masquerades as marriage \npenalty relief because it is much more than that and, at the same time, \nmuch less.\n  The proposal the majority has advanced in terms of its ostensible \nclaim of providing a marriage penalty relief is, at best, a half \ntrillion dollars.\n  Earlier in my comments, I praised the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, the able Senator from New York. His approach, it strikes me, \ndoes what we are trying to accomplish: It eliminates the marriage \npenalty, but it does so in a very targeted and specific way, and that \nought to be the guiding principle. If we are serious about eliminating \nthe marriage penalty and providing relief for those taxpayers, 25 \nmillion in America, that ought to be the focus. It is simple and is \nmore targeted.\n  The reconciliation bill before us relies on a complex scheme of \nbracketed extensions, deduction increases, and allowance of personal \npreference.\n  One would have to have a Ph.D. from MIT to figure how the \ncalculations are made. I thought, in the waning days of the 106th \nCongress, if there was one thing on which we could agree--both those on \nthe other side of the aisle and those on our side of the aisle; those \nwho find themselves to the right of center, to the left of center, and \nthe moderates--we ought not to do anything to make the Tax Code more \ncomplicated.\n  Each summer, as I know a number of my colleagues do, I spend the \nentire recess doing townhall meetings across my State. Not \nsurprisingly, there are different views as to what we ought to be \ndoing. But no one has argued: You know, what you need to do, Senator, \nis, return to Washington and try to make this Tax Code more \ncomplicated.\n  May I say that the proposal advanced by the majority will add \ndozens--maybe hundreds--of new pages of regulations. By contrast, the \nDemocratic alternative provides simplicity.\n  Taxpayers would be allowed a choice, not a difficult concept for us \nin America: If you benefit under the Tax Code, as a married person, by \nfiling as a single person, that is your option, and you can do so--no \nifs, ands, or buts. And conversely, if you benefit as a married person \nby filing a joint return, that is your choice as well. It is that \nsimple. Whatever fits your individual need. It is tailored, it is \nspecific, and it is simple.\n  That is what we are talking about. And I believe that is what we \nshould be all about. Moreover, it is far less expensive than the \nproposal offered by the Republican majority--much less expensive.\n  It leaves monies to deal with the priorities I have outlined that I \nthink most Americans support: Providing extended solvency to Social \nSecurity and Medicare and a prescription drug benefit, and, yes, to pay \ndown that enormous national debt that exploded during the 1980s and \nearly 1990s.\n  Moreover, the proposal that we advance, the one that Senator Moynihan \nhas so ably crafted, completely wipes out the marriage penalty--\ncompletely wipes it out--without irresponsibly awarding cash bonuses to \nthose who already receive a break under the Tax Code.\n  While the majority's proposal only addresses a grand total of three \nmarriage penalties in the entire Tax Code, the proposal that we offer \nwould address every single one of the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax \nCode. It is understandable, it is simple, it is targeted, and it is \ncomprehensive. It does the job.\n  I will illustrate this point of simplicity with an example, if I may.\n  I have asserted that under the plan the majority has advocated, it \ndoes not wipe out the marriage penalty relief for many. This chart I \nhave here shows an example. Under this example, a married couple--wife \nand husband--each earn $35,000 a year. Their joint return reflects \n$70,000 in joint income.\n  As individuals, they would pay a tax of $8,407. But if they were \nfiling a joint return, they would pay $9,532. Under the current law, \nthey must file jointly. That is the marriage penalty. That is what we \nare talking about, probably not a situation that is too dissimilar for \nthousands of married couples--perhaps hundred of thousands. By virtue \nof being married, they pay $1,125 more than two single individuals with \nthe identical incomes--the woman earning $35,000, the man \nearning $35,000, who are able to file individually as opposed to a \njoint return.\n\n  Under the bill before us, only $443 of relief is provided. That is \nonly 39 percent of the penalty. So to those couples who are in the \nsituation of being led to believe that if the bill that has been \nadvocated by the majority is passed, they are going to get relief, they \nare going to be very disappointed because they are not getting all the \nrelief; they are only getting 39 percent.\n  Under the Democratic plan, crafted by the distinguished Senator from \nNew\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\nYork, Mr. Moynihan, 100-percent relief is achieved, the full $1,125. \nAnd how is that done? Not through a convoluted approach of either \ncompressing or enlarging the brackets, or adjusting the deductions, or \nfrom some other kind of incantation in the Tax Code, with which we are \nall so familiar making our Tax Code such a complicated burden for the \naverage citizen to fill out. By the simple provision--one line in the \nTax Code--it is your choice. You may file individually or you may file \na joint return.\n  Obviously, this couple would choose to file individually and in so \ndoing would reduce their tax liability by $1,125. That is real relief. \nThat is targeted relief. That is what our proposal is all about. It is \neasy to understand. It provides the virtue of simplicity. It does the \njob, and it is targeted.\n  I am going to conclude because I know the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer has other matters to attend, and this Senator does as well.\n  I am hopeful that we can extricate ourselves from this abyss into \nwhich we are about to fall. Most of us in the Chamber agree that the \nmarriage penalty is fundamentally wrong. We can solve it with a \nbipartisan approach, less expensively, simply, and completely by \nadopting this choice. I certainly hope that we do so.\n  I pledge to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I look \nforward to working with them and hope that we can accomplish it. The \ncourse of action that we are pursuing is a collision course. The wheels \nare going to come off this train. This proposal will not become law, \nnor should it, because it does not provide complete relief from the \nmarriage penalty, but it does provide extraordinary tax relief to those \nwho are unaffected in any way by it, for those who already receive a \nbonus. That is not the kind of targeted tax relief we ought to be \nproviding.\n  Mr. President, I think from a parliamentary point of view, all I need \nto do is yield the floor, and under the previous unanimous consent \nagreement, we are in adjournment; am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I notice the enthusiastic response by the distinguished \nPresiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, you will be pleased to hear, and our colleagues who \nare listening will be pleased to hear, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2000/07/14/senate-section/article/S6989-1", "month": "07", "year": "2000", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 17, 2000\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
