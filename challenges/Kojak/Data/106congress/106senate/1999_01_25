What You desire, You inspire. \nWhat You guide, You provide.\n  This is Your Nation; we are here to serve You. Just as Daniel Webster \nsaid that the greatest conviction of his life was that he was \naccountable to You, we press on with a heightened awareness that You \nare the unseen Lord of this Chamber, the silent Listener to every word \nthat is spoken, and the Judge of our deliberations and decisions.\n  Bless the Senators with the assurance that Your work, done with total \ntrust in You and respect for each other, will not lack Your resources. \nSurpass any impasse with divinely inspired solutions. You are our Lord \nand Savior. Amen.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Sergeant at Arms will make the proclamation.\n  The Sergeant at Arms, James W. Ziglar, made proclamation as follows:\n\n       Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are commanded to \n     keep silent, on pain of imprisonment, while the Senate of the \n     United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of \n     impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against \n     William Jefferson Clinton, President of the United States.\n\n\n                              The Journal\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. If there is no objection, the Journal of \nproceedings of the trial are approved to date.\n  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 16, there are 6 hours \n33 minutes remaining during which Senators may submit questions in \nwriting directed to either the managers, on the part of the House of \nRepresentatives, or the counsel for the President.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. As is obvious by the absence of the managers and counsel, \nand a number of the Senators, the two parties are still meeting in \nconference at this time. I believe we are close to reaching an \nagreement which would outline today's impeachment proceedings. It will \nprobably be an hour or so before we can complete that because we need \nto explain it in detail to our respective conference, and also make \nsure that we reduce it to writing so we understand exactly what we are \nagreeing to.\n  I will in a moment ask that the Senate stand in recess until 2 p.m. I \napologize for any inconvenience to Senators and the Chief Justice. But \nI think that what we are discussing in the long run would save some \ntime and lead us to a fair procedure through the balance of the day and \nhow we begin tomorrow.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Therefore, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in \nrecess until 2 p.m.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. Chief Justice, reserving the right to object----\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. Chief Justice, I have a parliamentary inquiry that I \nwould like to share.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian says it takes unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to----\n  Mr. LEAHY. Reserving the right to object, I believe that if it is \ngoing to be made, Mr. Chief Justice, if it requires unanimous consent, \nthat it would be wise if it can be done at a time when both leaders are \non the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. I withdraw the unanimous consent.\n  There being no objection, at 1:08 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n2:06 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, it is my understanding that the question \nand answer period is now completed. In a moment I will propound a \nunanimous consent agreement that will outline the next steps in this \nprocess.\n\n[[Page S962]]\n\n                      UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In the meantime, I would ask unanimous consent that \nSenators be allowed to submit statements and introduce legislation at \nthe desk today. I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate \ncompletes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 1 p.m. on \nTuesday to resume the articles of impeachment.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object, I note that the \nDemocratic leader is not in the Chamber.\n  May I inquire, has this been cleared?\n  Mr. LOTT. I just want to observe, Mr. Chief Justice, that there are \nstill some discussions underway. You will note that Senator Daschle is \nnot here, and unless there is objection to what I just did, I am \nprepared to note the absence of a quorum so that we can have time for \nSenators to return to the Chamber.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Point of clarification for the majority leader. Did the \nSenator say that we would come in tomorrow at 1 p.m.?\n  Mr. LOTT. I did. If I might respond, Mr. Chief Justice, there had \nbeen some discussion about coming in earlier, but because of a number \nof conflicts, I understand, from the House managers and concerns that \nwe would need that time to continue to have discussions, we thought we \nwould go ahead and come in at 1. But let me add that if during the \nprocess of the day there is a decision that we need to change that to \neither earlier or later, we could revise that request. This is just to \nmove the process forward, as we have announced each day we would come \nin at 1 except on Saturday. But if there is a need to change the time, \nwe will certainly be prepared to consider that request.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I had earlier asked a couple of \nunanimous consent requests, but the Democratic leader was not on the \nfloor, and it was not officially objected to or officially ruled as not \nhaving been objected to. So I am going to assume that is all null and \nvoid, and we are going to start over again.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The requests are withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. Now, to repeat what we had earlier discussed and to make \nsure Members understand it, it is our understanding and our agreement \nthat the question and answer period is now completed.\n\n\n   Order for Submission of Statements and Introduction of Legislation\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that Senators be allowed to submit \nstatements and introduce legislation at the desk today.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. With regard to the time that will be involved today and the \ntime that we will come in on Tuesday, we will have further discussions \non that, and we will have a consent request on that later in the day or \nat the close of business.\n  Now I have a unanimous consent request that will allow us to have a \nclear understanding and an orderly procedure for the balance of the \nday. I have discussed this with my counterpart on the other side of the \naisle, both conferences have had a chance to talk about it, and I think \nit is a fair way to proceed, where we would have a chance to discuss \nthe issues that are before us and get us to a conclusion of this part \nof the impeachment proceedings in a logical way.\n\n\n                       Unanimous-Consent Request\n\n  Mr. LOTT. First, Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the conclusion of the arguments by the managers and the \ncounsel today on the motion to dismiss--and I note that the next order \nof business is 2 hours equally divided, 1 hour on each side, on a \nmotion to dismiss when and if it is filed by any Senator--and after \nthat, it be in order for Senator Harkin to make a motion to open all \ndebate pursuant to his motion timely filed and that the Senate proceed \nimmediately to the vote pursuant to the impeachment rules.\n  I further ask that following that vote, if defeated, it be in order \nto move to close the session for deliberations on the motion to \ndismiss, as provided under the impeachment rules, and the Senate \nproceed to an immediate vote.\n  I further ask that if the Senate votes to proceed to closed session, \nthat those deliberations must conclude by the close of business today, \nnotwithstanding the 10-minute rule allocated under the impeachment \nrule.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, does he reserve the right to object or \ndid he object?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Parliamentarian tells me the Senator does not \nhave the right to reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just have a modification that I would like to discuss \nwith the leader, a brief modification of that, that would not engender \nan objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, so we can proceed with this in an \nappropriate manner, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I renew my request as previously \noutlined, with one change; that is, that it say in the first sentence \n``unanimous consent that following the conclusion of the arguments by \nthe managers and the counsel today on the motion to dismiss, that it be \nin order for Senator Harkin to make a motion to open that debate.'' \nInstead of ``all,'' the word is ``that'' debate.\n  With that and no other changes, I renew that request.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I reserve the right to object.\n  OK, I don't have any----\n  Mr. LOTT. The reservation is withdrawn, I believe.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Chief Justice, I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, welcome to the operations of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, was the unanimous consent agreement \nagreed to?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Not yet.\n  Mr. LOTT. I renew my request.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Chief Justice, I and Senator Collins, the junior \nSenator from Maine, ask unanimous consent that when the Senate consider \nthe anticipated motion to dismiss, that it shall vote on two separate \nquestions: First, whether to dismiss article I of the articles of \nimpeachment; and, second, whether to dismiss article II.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. There is a pending request for unanimous consent \nby the majority leader, who has not surrendered the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Under his reservation, if the Senator would yield to me, I \nbelieve if we can get this agreed to, he can make his request and then \nit can be ruled on.\n  Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the floor if the Senator would like to \nproceed in that fashion.\n  I renew my request, again, for the unanimous consent as outlined \nearlier.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Is there objection? In the absence of an \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S963]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. Chief Justice, I renew my request, along with the \njunior Senator from Maine--the unanimous consent request that when the \nSenate proceeds to vote on the anticipated motion to dismiss, that the \nquestion be divided into a separate vote on article I of the articles \nof impeachment, and then a separate vote on article II of the articles \nof impeachment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, now, if I could, I will outline the \nresult of our efforts there. I thank Senator Daschle and my colleagues \non his side of the aisle and this side of the aisle for trying to come \nup with a process that is fair and that would give us an opportunity \ntoday to debate this important issue. It is never easy to get 100 \nSenators to agree on a method to proceed, so I think this was a good \naccomplishment. I thank one and all.\n  I understand that now Senator Byrd will offer the motion to dismiss. \nFor the information of all Members, once that motion is offered, there \nwill then be 2 hours for debate. The House managers will be recognized \nto open the debate, and following that will be the White House \narguments. Then the House managers will be recognized again for closing \nremarks. At that point, the consent agreement would apply.\n  I anticipate taking our first break at the conclusion of the first 2 \nhours of arguments by the managers and White House counsel, unless \nthere is an urgent need to do so earlier. Then we will go forward with \nthis agreement, which will require a vote on the Harkin motion to open \nthe debate; the vote on the amendment to close debate on the motion to \ndismiss; and then the debate which would go on, the 10-minute rule \nnotwithstanding, until the close of business today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n\n                           Motion To Dismiss\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a motion in writing to the desk.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The clerk will read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, moves that the \n     impeachment proceedings against William Jefferson Clinton, \n     President of the United States, be, and the same are, duly \n     dismissed.\n\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to Rule XXI of the Senate Rules on \nImpeachment, the managers on the part of the House of Representatives \nand the counsel for the President each have up to 1 hour to argue the \nmotion.\n  The Chair recognizes the House managers.\n  Mr. Manager CANADY. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, on \nbehalf of the House of Representatives, I rise to speak in opposition \nto the motion to dismiss. During the hour allotted to the managers, I \nwill offer a few introductory comments concerning why adoption of the \nmotion would be inconsistent with constitutional standards and harmful \nto the institutions of our Government. Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Graham, and \nMr. Gekas will present arguments concerning the facts and the law, and \nthen Mr. Hyde will close.\n  At the outset, I must urge you to consider the fact that this motion \nto dismiss is without precedent. The Senate has never--not once in the \nmore than 200-year history of our Constitution--dismissed a proceeding \nagainst an official who remained in office after impeachment by the \nHouse of Representatives. I humbly urge you not to depart from the \nSenate's well-established practice of fully considering cases of \nimpeachment and rendering a judgment of either conviction or acquittal.\n\n  In the midst of the great differences between the President's counsel \nand the House managers, there actually is at least a little common \nground. Both sides agree that the impeachment and removal power is \ndesigned to protect the well-being of the institutions of our \nGovernment. But there is a critical difference that divides us, as is \nobvious from the argument that has gone before.\n  The managers have argued that this power--the power of impeachment \nand removal--is a positive power granted by the Constitution to \nmaintain the integrity of Government, a power to preserve, protect, and \nstrengthen our constitutional system against the misconduct of \nofficials that would subvert, undermine, or weaken the institutions of \nour Government.\n  The President's lawyers, on the other hand, advance a much narrower \nview of the role of the impeachment power in protecting our \ninstitutions. Their case rests on the argument that it is a power to be \nused only in response to conduct threatening devastating harm to the \nsystem of Government--at least when it is used against a President.\n  But I submit to you that Alexander Hamilton did not contemplate that \nthe impeachment process would be so restricted when he spoke of it as a \n``method of national inquest into the conduct of public men.'' And \nJames Iredell did not have such a narrow view in mind when he spoke of \nthe accountability through impeachment of anyone who ``willfully abuses \nhis trust.'' Iredell did not have such a limited view when he spoke of \nthe impeachment of a President who, as he said, ``acted from some \ncorrupt motive or other.''\n  Under the standards urged by the President's lawyers, the misdeeds of \nRichard Nixon would not be the threshold for impeachment and removal. \nWhat he did was corrupt. The legal rights of citizens were treated with \ncontempt. President Nixon showed an egregious lack of respect for the \nlaw. But all these misdeeds did not threaten the sort of ruinous harm \nto the system of Government that the President's lawyers argue would be \nrequired to justify conviction and removal. After all, the core charges \nagainst President Nixon related to the coverup of a third-rate \nburglary.\n  Members of the Senate, as you consider the motion to dismiss, I ask \nyou to pause and reflect on the consequences of the standard advocated \nby the President's lawyers. Consider the consequences for the system of \njustice of allowing the President's dangerous example of lawlessness to \nstand. Consider the consequences for the Presidency itself.\n  I respectfully submit to you that the standard advocated by President \nClinton's lawyers will debase and degrade the institution of the \nPresidency. I know that is not the intention of the President's \nlawyers, but it is the necessary consequence of their position.\n  Only 42 men have held the office of President of the United States. \nSome of them have been ordinary men of limited talent. A handful of our \nPresidents have been great men. Most have been capable men who brought \nspecial skills to the office. No matter what our individual judgments \nmay be concerning President Clinton, it is clear that he is one of the \nmost intellectually gifted and politically skilled men to hold the \noffice of President.\n  He was raised to this great eminence--the most powerful office in the \ngreatest Nation in the history of the world--an unparalleled \nopportunity, honor and privilege. And in this position of eminence and \nhonor, and in this position of trust, what did he do? He made a series \nof choices that has brought us to this day. He made the choice to \nviolate the law--and he made that choice repeatedly. He knew what he \nwas doing. He reflected on it. Perhaps he struggled with his \nconscience. But when the time came to decide, he deliberately and \nwillfully chose to violate the laws of this land. He chose to turn his \nback on the very law he was sworn to uphold. He chose to turn his back \non his solemn oath of office. He chose to turn his back on his \nconstitutional duty.\n  As you deliberate on this motion, I ask you to consider what William \nJefferson Clinton has done to the integrity of the great office he \nholds as a trust. I ask you to consider the harm he has caused, the \nindignity he has brought to the institution of the Presidency.\n  Some have asked of us, ``Where is the compassion and where is the \nspirit of forgiveness?'' Let me say that I, for one, believe in \nforgiveness. Without forgiveness, what hope would there be for any of \nus? But forgiveness requires repentance; it requires contrition. And so \nI must ask, where is the repentance? Where is the contrition?\n\n  It is true that the President has expressed regret for his personal \nmisconduct. But he has never--he has never--accepted responsibility for \nbreaking the law. He has never taken\n\n[[Page S964]]\n\nthat essential step, as the argument advanced so vigorously by his \ncounsel makes clear. He has refused to accept responsibility for \nbreaking the law. He has stubbornly resisted any effort to be held \naccountable for his violations of the law, for his violations of his \nconstitutional oath, and his violation of his duty as President. To \nthis day, he remains adamantly unrepentant. And, of course, under our \nsystem of justice, even sincere repentance, which is so lacking here, \ndoes not eliminate all accountability.\n  In the discussion thus far, the debate has brought the concept of \nproportionality to the fore from time to time. You have been urged to \nreject your own precedents--the clear precedents establishing that \ncrimes such as lying under oath justify conviction and removal. The \nprinciple of proportionality, it has been urged, requires that the rule \nyou have applied to Federal judges not be applied to the President of \nthe United States.\n  I will be the first to concede that removing a President of the \nUnited States is, without doubt, a more momentous decision than \nremoving one of the hundreds of Federal judges who hold office in this \ncountry. When the Chief Executive is removed, the gravity of the matter \nundeniably reaches a higher level. But it is also true--and it must not \nbe forgotten--that when the President engages in a calculated and \nsustained course of conduct involving obstruction of justice and \nperjury, the gravity of the consequences for the Nation also reaches a \nfar higher level. Such lawless conduct by the President does \nimmeasurably more to subvert public respect for the law than does the \nmisconduct of any Federal judge or any other Federal official.\n  As has been pointed out more than once, the Constitution contains a \nsingle standard for impeachment and removal of all civil officers; \nthere is not one standard for the President and another standard for \neveryone else. There is nothing in the Constitution that requires you--\nor allows you--to set a lower standard of integrity for the President \nthan the standard you have set for other officials who have been \nconvicted and removed by your solemn action.\n  Although they can point to nothing in the Constitution, the \nPresident's lawyers assert that the President is simply different \nbecause he is elected. So let me say this. The Senate itself has \nestablished a standard of integrity for its own elected Members that \nPresident Clinton could not meet. As recently as 1995, an elected \nSenator resigned under imminent threat of expulsion for offenses that \nincluded acts similar to the acts of obstruction of justice committed \nby President Clinton.\n  Senator Robert Packwood was elected, yet he was on his way to certain \nexpulsion. Listen to what the Senate Select Committee on Ethics had to \nsay about Senator Packwood's conduct. He was guilty, the committee \nfound, of\n\n     * * * withholding, altering and destroying relevant evidence \n     . . . conduct which is expressly prohibited by 18 United \n     States Code, section 1505. . . . Senator Packwood's illegal \n     acts constitute a violation of his duty of trust to the \n     Senate and an abuse of his position as a United States \n     Senator, reflecting discredit upon the United States Senate.\n\n  The statute referred to by the committee in the Packwood case is \nclosely analogous to the obstruction of justice statute the President \nhas violated. Senator Packwood unlawfully sought to impede the \ndiscovery of evidence. President Clinton has done the same thing. For \nhis violation of the law, Senator Packwood, an elected Senator, was \njudged worthy of expulsion from the Senate.\n  But the President's lawyers argue the President should be held to a \nlower standard of integrity than the standard you have set for \nyourselves as Members of the Senate. According to them, the \nConstitution establishes a lower standard of integrity for the \nPresident than the standard for Senators, a lower standard than the \nstandard for Federal judges, and a lower standard than the standard for \nmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I submit to you that the \nPresident's lawyers, honorable as they are, are simply wrong. They \nadvocate an arbitrary standard that would insulate the President from \nthe proper accountability for his misconduct under our Constitution. \nOur Constitution does not establish a lower standard of integrity for \nthe President of the United States.\n  The Senate, I respectfully submit to you, should follow the well \nestablished precedents. The Senate should reject the motion to dismiss.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Hutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, how much time has expired?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Twelve minutes.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of \nthe Senate, in my former life, when I tried cases, the defense counsel \nwould routinely offer a motion to dismiss and my clients would always \nask me how they could argue to dismiss a case before we had a chance to \nput on our evidence. I would always explain that there was more than \nsufficient evidence to get this case to a jury and they didn't have to \nworry.\n  We all know that granting a motion to dismiss is a weapon that is \nrarely used in court. It is a severe remedy that cuts off an \nindividual's right to seek justice in court. For that reason, a motion \nto dismiss must fail if there is any substantial evidence to support \nthe case. In addition, as you evaluate evidence under a motion to \ndismiss, the facts are to be considered in a way that is most favorable \nto the respondent--in this case the House managers.\n  For example, if there is a dispute between the testimony of Ms. \nLewinsky and the President in consideration of this, I would urge you \nto--and believe that under proper rules you should--consider that in \nthe favor of the theory of the articles of impeachment.\n  It has been explained to me many times that standard courtroom rules \ndo not apply in the U.S. Senate. But, still, granting a motion to \ndismiss by the Senate has the same effect--to cut short the trial and \navoid the development of the facts--as it would in any State court \ncase. In this case of impeachment, the House of Representatives found \nthat there was substantial evidence to support these articles. And the \nSenate should not summarily dismiss the charges.\n  I might add that, despite Mr. Ruff's references, the House standard \nfor the articles of impeachment was not simply probable cause. My \ncolleagues on the Judiciary Committee looked at a much higher standard \nof clear and convincing evidence.\n\n  But, coming back to the Senate, to dismiss the case would be \nunprecedented from a historical standpoint, because it has never been \ndone before; it would be damaging to the Constitution, because the \nSenate would fail to try the case; it would be harmful to the body \npolitic, because there is no resolution of the issues of the case; but, \nmost importantly, it would show willful blindness to the evidentiary \nrecord that has thus far been presented.\n  An appropriate question, you might ask, is: How should you decide \nwhether this motion should be granted? I would contend that you should \ndecide this issue based upon the facts that you have before you in the \nrecord and not on any other criteria. A motion to dismiss should not be \ngranted because you do not think there are presently enough votes for \nconviction.\n  Let me assure you that I want this over. As Bruce Lindsey, sitting \nover here, will probably attest, this is bad for me politically. I am \nfrom Arkansas, the State Bill Clinton dominated politically for years, \nand certainly its most influential politician. But we do have our \nresponsibilities, and I happen to believe that we should follow the \nprocess which is dictated by the Constitution and the facts.\n  I know I am making legal arguments to this Court of Impeachment, in \nwhich I understand you make your own rules, and I respect that. But, as \nopposing counsel pointed out on many occasions, there are reasons for \nthese rules of procedure and they have relevance to your deliberations \ntoday. Again, your decision should be based upon the facts, and so \nlet's discuss the facts.\n  Does the record support the charges of obstruction of justice and \nperjury? To look at this from a different angle, because we talked \nabout it at length, let's examine how the President responded to \ncritical developments in the Federal civil rights case in which he was \na defendant.\n  First, how did he handle those people he knew to be witnesses? The \nPresident did not want them to testify, and, if\n\n[[Page S965]]\n\nthey did testify, he did not want them to testify truthfully. Two of \nthose witnesses were Monica Lewinsky and Betty Currie.\n  Clearly, he did not want them to testify in the Federal civil rights \ncase and, likewise, his lawyers today do not want those witnesses to \ntestify before this body.\n  Now, let's look at what happened when the President learned that \nMonica Lewinsky was on the witness list. Very quickly, it was December \n5 that the witness list came in. He learned about it probably the next \nday, December 6. Monica Lewinsky visited with him and said Vernon \nJordan was not doing very much on the job front. The President's \nresponse is, okay, I will talk to him. I will get on it.\n  Now, Ms. Lewinsky assumed that was a brushoff, but he was serious \nabout it because he later learned that day that at the latest--he \nlearned later that day that Monica was on the witness list when he met \nwith the lawyers.\n  After that, the next day, he meets with Vernon Jordan at the White \nHouse. And even though Mr. Jordan says he thinks it was unlikely that \nthe job situation was discussed, Mr. Jordan makes it clear that he \nultimately went to work to get Ms. Lewinsky a job at the direction of \nthe President. According to Mr. Jordan's grand jury testimony on June \n9, he testified, ``The President asked me to get Monica Lewinsky a \njob.'' That is undisputed. He had testified to the same grand jury, \n``He,'' referring to the President, ``is the source of it coming to my \nattention in the first place.''\n  And so as the result of the President's request, Vernon Jordan got to \nwork, met with Ms. Lewinsky, assisted her in securing key job \ninterviews and kept the President informed. The job search became \ncritical when she was put on the witness list on December 5, and the \nDecember 11 order of Judge Wright served to reinforce the urgency of \nthe matter.\n  Now, all of this was happening when the President knew she was a \nwitness in the civil rights case, but the individuals affected by the \nPresident's unlawful scheme of obstruction may not have been privy to \nhis plans. He kept Ms. Lewinsky in the dark about her being a witness \nuntil he had the job search well underway. And Mr. Jordan indicates \nthat he was simply trying to get Ms. Lewinsky a job at the direction of \nthe President without any clue that she was a witness until she got the \nsubpoena on December 19.\n  Now, the President kept his information about Ms. Lewinsky being on \nthe list away from her until he called her at 2 a.m. in the morning on \nDecember 17 to let her know the news.\n  So how does the President handle witnesses in the judicial system \nthat are a danger to him? He wanted to make sure that they were taken \ncare of and cooperative in concealing the truth from the courts.\n  The next critical step for the President to assure that Ms. Lewinsky \nsticks with her predesigned cover stories was that she would not \ndeviate from that even though they were now in the court system. Vernon \nJordan testified in the grand jury that ``it didn't take an Einstein to \nknow when she was under subpoena the circumstances changed,'' and, of \ncourse, that is clear.\n  When Ms. Lewinsky was placed on the witness list, the truth became a \nthreat to the President. He tried to avoid the truth at all costs and \nwas willing to obstruct the legal processes of the judicial system in \norder to protect himself. The obstruction started with the job favors \nand then continued through the December 17 conversation with the \nPresident when the President encouraged her to keep using the cover \nstories even though she would be under oath as a witness, encouraged \nher to sign a false affidavit, and then on December 28, according to \nthe testimony of Ms. Lewinsky, the President sent Betty Currie to \nretrieve items of evidence for the purpose of concealment and with the \nobvious effect of obstructing the truth.\n  Despite the concerted effort of the President in keeping Monica \nLewinsky from being a truthful witness, the President was not yet home \nfree. He still had to go through the hurdle of his own deposition on \nJanuary 17. And even though he knew there were going to be questions \nabout Monica Lewinsky, he was hopeful that the false affidavit, the \nrepresentations of his attorney, Robert Bennett, and the President's \nown affirmation of the false affidavit would be sufficient to prevent \nquestioning about Ms. Lewinsky. But it didn't work. Despite this \neffort, the Federal district court judge ordered the President to \nrespond to the questions. At that point he had a choice. He could tell \nthe truth under oath, or he could provide false statements. He chose \nthe latter, and that decision forced a continued pattern of \nobstruction.\n  During the deposition, he asserted the name of Betty Currie at least \nsix times, and by doing so he dared the plaintiff's lawyers to question \nMs. Currie as a witness. They knew it, and he knew it. When the Jones \nlawyers returned from the deposition, they immediately set about \nissuing a subpoena for Betty Currie. And what did the President do? He \nimmediately set about attempting to assure that Betty Currie would not \nstate the truth when called as a witness.\n  They defended that she wasn't a witness, she wasn't a prospective \nwitness, but yet we produced the subpoena that she was a prospective \nwitness, and they wanted her to testify and everyone knew it. The \nPresident called her at home, arranged for her to come in the next day, \nand put her through the questioning: He was never alone with Monica, \ntrying to establish that; that Monica was the aggressor and that the \nPresident did nothing wrong. That is what he was trying to accomplish \nthrough his questioning of Betty Currie.\n\n  Can you imagine how uncomfortable Betty Currie was, must have felt on \nthat occasion, being called in to see her boss, then having the \nPresident recreate a fictional account in order to prevent the truth \nfrom coming out in a court of law. But once was not enough, and 2 days \nlater Ms. Betty Currie was brought in for the same series of questions. \nThe message was clear. You have got to cover for the President even \nthough the purpose was unlawful.\n  And so we see a pattern developing. When it comes to a witness, \nwhether it is Monica Lewinsky or Betty Currie, the choice is made. The \nPresident encouraged the witness to lie, and the President chose to \nimpede the administration of justice rather than assuring that the laws \nbe faithfully executed.\n  But the President had one final choice, and that was in his grand \njury testimony in August. At this point, the embarrassment of the \nrelationship was public, and that could no longer serve as an excuse \nnot to tell the truth. But, once again, the President chose not to \nabide by his oath but to evade the truth and provide false statements; \nnot to protect his family, not to preserve the dignity of the \nPresidency, but to prevent the grand jury from knowing the truth in \ntheir investigation and to continue the coverup began during the truth-\nseeking process in the civil rights case.\n  I do not have time to cover all the facts, but they are more than \nsubstantial, they are compelling, and they are convicting.\n  Let me leave you with some questions. First of all, who asked Vernon \nJordan to get Monica Lewinsky a job? The answer? It was the President.\n  Secondly, who suggested that Monica Lewinsky sign an affidavit to \navoid testifying in the civil rights case, which by its nature had to \nbe false? The answer? It was the President. Who obstructed the truth \nwhen Monica Lewinsky was subpoenaed as a witness? It was the President. \nWho impeded the gathering of evidence when the Federal court subpoena \ncalled for the production of gifts? The answer? It was the President. \nWho tampered with the testimony of Betty Currie when it was clear she \nwas a witness in the case? It was the President. Who took an oath and \nfailed to tell the truth before the courts of our land? It was the \nPresident.\n  I state these facts with sadness, but these facts are true. The \nmotion should be defeated.\n  I thank the Senate. On behalf of the managers, Mr. Chief Justice, I \nreserve the remainder of the time.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Very well. The Chair recognizes counsel for the \nPresident.\n  Ms. Counsel SELIGMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, ladies and gentlemen of the \nSenate, distinguished House managers, good afternoon. My name is Nicole \nSeligman. I am a member of the law firm\n\n[[Page S966]]\n\nof Williams & Connolly here in Washington, DC. I have been privileged \nto represent President Clinton as personal counsel since 1994.\n  I am honored to stand before you today to argue in support of the \nmotion to dismiss the impeachment proceedings that has been offered by \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd.\n  The Constitution reposes in this body and nowhere else the sole \nauthority to try impeachments. It has placed in your hands alone the \ndecision whether to dismiss now or to go forward. There is no judicial \nreview. There is no judicial guidance other than that which each of \nyou, in your wisdom, may choose to apply by analogy from judicial \nexperience. There are no particular rules of civil or criminal \nprocedure that you must follow. The Constitution has freed you from \nthat. It has wisely placed in your hands alone the ability to make a \nsound judgment in the manner you think best for the reasons you think \nbest, based on your wisdom and experience, as to what is best for this \nNation at this moment in the proceedings.\n\n  We submit to you that the moment has arrived where the best interests \nof the Nation, the wise prescription of the framers, and the failure of \nthe managers' proof, all point to dismissal. You have listened. You \nhave heard. The case cannot be made. It is time to end it.\n  Without presuming to infringe on the constitutional authority that is \nyours alone, and without repeating at undue length the arguments that \nyou heard over the past few weeks, I do want to set out briefly the \nreasons that we believe to be some of the grounds on which an early and \nfair disposition of this difficult matter might rest. There are at \nleast four such grounds. Each one stands by itself as sufficient reason \nto vote for the motion of Senator Byrd.\n  The first ground is the core constitutional issue before you, the \nfailure of the articles to charge impeachable offenses. They do not do \nso. They do not allege conduct that, if proven, violated the public \ntrust in the manner the framers intended when they wrote the words \n``treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.'' For absent \nan element of immediate danger to the state, a danger of such magnitude \nthat it cannot await resolution by the electorate in the normal cycle, \nthe framers intended restraint. There is no such danger to the state \nhere. No one has made that claim, or could, or would. A vote for the \nmotion is a vote for constitutional stability.\n  Impeachment was never meant to be just another weapon in the arsenal \nof partisanship. By definition, a partisan split like that which \naccompanied these articles from the House of Representatives creates \ndoubt that makes plain a constitutional error of the course that we are \non. As Senator William Pitt Fessenden wrote 130 years ago on a great \nand decisive historical occasion, the impeachment trial of Andrew \nJohnson:\n\n       Conviction upon impeachment should be free from the taint \n     of party and leave no ground for suspicion upon the motives \n     of those who inflict the penalty.\n\n  His words echoed those of Alexander Hamilton who, in the much quoted \nFederalist 65, had warned, in his words, of ``the greatest danger that \nthe decision''--that is the decision by the Senate--``will be regulated \nmore by the comparative strength of the parties than by the real \ndemonstrations of innocence or guilt.''\n  Now, Mr. Manager Graham has candidly acknowledged that reasonable \npeople could disagree about the propriety of removal. He said they \nabsolutely could. We suggest to you that there can be no removal when \neven the prosecutor agrees that such reasonable doubts exist. If \nreasonable people can disagree, we suggest to you that reasonable \nSenators should dismiss. The constitutional standard for impeachment is \nnot met here.\n  The second and third grounds we offer to you relate to the deeply \nflawed drafting of the articles by the House of Representatives. They \nhave left the House managers free to fill what Mr. Ruff described as \n``an empty vessel,'' to define for the House of Representatives what it \nreally had in mind when it impeached the President. But that is not a \nrole that the Constitution allows to be delegated to the House \nmanagers. It is not a role that the Constitution allows them to fill. \nIt is a role that is explicitly and uniquely reserved to the full House \nof Representatives which, under our Constitution, has the sole power to \nimpeach.\n\n  The articles also are unconstitutionally defective for yet another \nreason, because each article combines a menu of charges, and the \nmanagers invite the Members of this body to convict on one or more of \nthe charges they list. The result is the deeply troubling prospect that \nthe President might be convicted and removed from office without two-\nthirds of the Senate agreeing on what the President actually did. Such \na result would be in conflict with the requirement that the President \ncannot be convicted unless two-thirds of this body concurs. The \nrequirement of a two-thirds supermajority is at the core of the \nconstitutional protection afforded the President and the American \npeople. The Founding Fathers were wise to guarantee that protection, \nand it has protected the Presidency for more than two centuries. The \nHouse must not be allowed to erode that protection today. The articles, \nas drafted, are unconstitutional.\n  The fourth ground for the motion is based on the facts. Mr. Manager \nMcCollum has twice asserted that this body must first determine whether \nthe President committed crimes, and then move on to the question of \nremoval from office. Recognizing that each Senator is free to choose \nthe standard of proof that his or her conscience dictates, we submit \nthat if the question is, as the managers would have it, whether the \nPresident has committed a crime, that standard should be proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt. And it is clear that such a standard, that is, proof \nto the level of certainty necessary to make the most significant \ndecisions you face in life, cannot possibly be met here. The \npresentations last week demonstrated that the record is full of \nexculpatory facts and deeply ambiguous circumstantial evidence that \nwill make it impossible for the managers to meet this standard or, in \nfact, any standard that you might in good conscience choose to apply \nhere.\n  Now, the managers have with great ingenuity spun out theories of \nwrongdoing that they have advanced repeatedly, persistently, \npassionately. But mere repetition, no matter how dogged, cannot create \na reality where there is none. The factual record is before you. We \nsubmit that it does not approach the kind of case that you would need \nto justify the conviction and removal of the President from office. And \ncalling witnesses is not the answer. All the evidence you need to make \nyour decision is before you, documented in thousands of pages of \ntestimony given under oath or to the FBI agents and Mr. Starr's \nprosecutors under penalty of law.\n  These, then, are the four grounds for the motion to dismiss. I know \nmany of these arguments are not new to you, and I will try to be brief \nas I review them.\n  The question before this body requires solemnity on all of our parts. \nIt inevitably creates no small measure of apprehension. In our Nation's \npolitical history, in our legal history, it is fair to say that few \ndecisions of such overwhelming magnitude have been confronted by this \nbody. There could be no matter more clearly placed in your hands alone \nby the Constitution, and on its resolution rests more than the \npolitical fate of William Clinton; there rests the course of our \ndemocracy in the coming years of the new century and for untold years \nthereafter.\n  Constitutional history confirms that the decision before you was \nmeant to be significant and difficult to make. It demonstrates that \nonly the most extraordinary of charges warrants the most extraordinary \nof outcomes. Any question, any doubt, must be resolved in favor of the \nelectoral will, for it is the will of the people, the people who have \nall sovereignty in our law, that in the end is the foundation of our \ndemocracy. And we submit that the doubt here is pervasive: Doubt about \nwhether the charged conduct, efforts to conceal a private personal \nembarrassment, could reasonably be deemed a violation against the state \nat all, let alone a violation so severe as to compel removal; doubt \nabout the constitutionality of the articles as drafted; doubt about the \nsufficiency of the managers' case; and that doubt upon doubt upon doubt\n\n[[Page S967]]\n\nmakes a vote to dismiss the only fair choice.\n\n  Let me turn then to the fundamental constitutional argument.\n  The impeachment power was meant to remove the President of the United \nStates from office only for the most serious abuses of official power \nor for misbehavior of such magnitude that the collective wisdom of the \npeople would compel immediate discharge. One of America's leading \nprofessors of constitutional law, Professor Akhil Amar of the Yale Law \nSchool, has framed the problem poignantly and concisely, stating:\n\n       The question to ask is whether [President Clinton's] \n     misconduct is so serious and malignant as to justify undoing \n     a national election [and] canceling the votes of millions.\n\n  We know the answer. It was provided by Charles Black in his classic \nbook on impeachment when he wrote that:\n\n       Impeachment and removal should be reserved only for \n     offenses that so seriously threaten the order of political \n     society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in \n     power of their perpetrator.\n\n  James Madison made much the same point two centuries earlier, stating \nthat an impeachment provision of some kind was ``indispensable'' \nbecause a President's ``loss of capacity or corruption . . . might be \nfatal to the Republic.''\n  The statements and writings of the framers of our Constitution and \ncenturies of scholarship and the meaning of that brief but so \nsignificant phrase, ``high crimes and misdemeanors,'' enable us to \nestablish with solid assurance that the conduct charged against the \nPresident does not amount to an impeachable offense.\n  Our argument today is a simple one: Ordinary civil and criminal \nwrongs may be addressed through ordinary civil and criminal processes, \nand ordinary political wrongs may be addressed at the ballot box or by \npublic opinion. Only the most serious public misconduct, aggravated \nabuse of Executive power, is meant to be addressed through exercise of \nthe Presidential impeachment power.\n  The conduct here arises out of a private lawsuit. Let me talk for a \nmoment about that lawsuit which is the backdrop for these proceedings.\n  The Jones case arose out of an alleged incident that predated the \nPresident's first term as President. The charges at issue here arise \nout of the President's conduct in that lawsuit. No charge relates to \nhis official conduct as President. Indeed, as we know, the Supreme \nCourt told President Clinton that he could not delay defending the \nJones lawsuit until he was out of office. And when it ruled that way, \nthe Court emphasized just this very point. It made clear that he might \nhave been able to delay or avoid the lawsuit if it had related to his \nofficial conduct, because the law provides various immunities for such \nlawsuits; but precisely because it related to his private actions, it \nwould be allowed to go forward.\n  In drawing that conclusion, interestingly, the Supreme Court actually \nlooked to the wisdom of James Wilson, a framer, a Supreme Court \nJustice, and a constitutional commentator, and cited the distinction he \ndrew between a President's acts performed in his ``public character,'' \nfor which he might be impeached, according to Justice Wilson, and acts \nperformed in his private character, to which the President is \nanswerable, as any other citizen, in court.\n\n  We agree that there might be extreme cases where private conduct \nwould so paralyze the President's ability to govern that the \nimpeachment power must be exercised, where the certainty of guilt and \nthe gravity of the charge would leave no choice. But charges arising \nout of the President's efforts to keep an admittedly wrongful \nrelationship secret are, by no analysis, of that caliber.\n  Some have suggested that making this argument is the same as arguing \nthat the President is above the law. That simply is not so. The often \nrepeated statement that no man--or woman, I should add--is above the \nlaw is, of course, true. Once he leaves office, the President is as \namenable to the law as any citizen, including for private conduct \nduring his term of office. As my colleagues Mr. Ruff and Mr. Craig \nargued to you last week, if a grand jury should choose to consider \ncharges against this President, his status as a former President will \nnot prevent that consideration.\n  But here is the point: Impeachment is not meant to punish an \nindividual; it is a protection for the people; in Alexander Hamilton's \nwords, a remedy for great ``injuries done to the society itself.'' It \nis, as your 19th century predecessor, Senator Garrett Davis, pointed \nout in the Andrew Johnson proceedings, ``the extreme remedy . . . \nintended for the worst political disorders of the executive \ndepartment.''\n  The House managers appear to argue that the President must be removed \nnonetheless, because to do otherwise places him above the law. But \nthere is one thing that can be said with certainty about the \nimpeachment power. Although it may have that result, it is not meant to \npunish the man, to set an example, or to provide a ``cleansing'' of the \npolitical process; it is meant to protect the state. If it is \npunishment the House managers seek, they are in the wrong place, in the \nwrong job, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons.\n  A question has arisen whether, as a general matter, any violation of \nlaw demands removal because it would be a violation of the President's \nduty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed or a breach of \nthe public trust. But, again, the history of the clause makes clear \nthat the framers intentionally chose not to make all crimes or even all \nfelonies impeachable.\n  I suggest we would all agree that, in the broadest possible sense, a \nproven violation of criminal law is a violation of a public trust. But \nthe framers consciously elected not to make impeachment the remedy for \n``all crimes and misdemeanors.'' When the framers wished to address all \ncrimes, they knew how to do it, and they did it. In article IV, section \n2, the Constitution states that, ``A Person charged in any State with \nTreason, Felony, or other Crime'' is susceptible to extradition--``or \nother crime.'' The framers knew how to say it, but they didn't say it \nabout impeachment, because that is not what they meant.\n  Some also have argued that the experience of judicial impeachments in \nthis body undermines this argument. They claim that judges have been \nremoved for purely private conduct and that a President should be \ntreated no differently. This argument completely misses the mark as \nwell.\n  By constitutional design, judges are very different from a President. \nPresidents are elected for a fixed term, while Federal judges serve \nwith life tenure. Presidents are elected by the people in one of the \ngreat periodic exercises of national will, and their tenure is blessed \nas the choice of the people.\n  Judges, on the other hand, are appointed and confirmed by the \nrepresentatives of the people, but their selection does not represent a \ndirect expression of the will of the people. Judges' tenure is \nconditioned on good behavior, while that of a President is not. And \nthere is an obvious reason for this distinction. Life tenure, which was \ndesigned to assure judicial independence, plainly becomes a problem in \nthe event of a judge who is not fit to serve. A President may be voted \nout by the people, a judge may not; hence the good behavior requirement \nand the duty upon the Congress to enforce it in those exceptional cases \nwhere it must be enforced.\n  It is possible to debate forever whether the good behavior clause \nrepresents an independent basis for impeachment or whether, in the case \nof judges, it is a factor to be weighed when this body exercises its \nsound judgment to decide what constitutes a high crime or misdemeanor. \nBut there is no need to resolve that dispute here. Either way, it is \nclear, as the Watergate impeachment inquiry report established, that \nthe term ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is given content by the \ncontext of the charge and the office at issue. Because of issues of \nlegitimacy, accountability, and tenure, the framers decided that \nFederal judges needed the additional check of the good \nbehavior clause--language they left out of the articles creating \nCongress and the Presidency.\n\n  And the Presidency is, of course, different. Alexander Hamilton said, \nin Federalist 79, that a judge could be impeached for malconduct. But \nin the words of the Watergate Impeachment Inquiry Report--a report I \nremind you\n\n[[Page S968]]\n\nthat Mr. Manager Canady has commended to your consideration--\nPresidential impeachment is distinctive. The report stated--and I \nquote, because it is an important quote--``Because impeachment of a \nPresident is a grave step for the nation, it is to be predicated only \nupon conduct seriously incompatible with either the constitutional form \nand principles of our government or the proper performance of the \nconstitutional duties of the presidential office. . . . The facts must \nbe considered as a whole in the context of the office,'' the report \nconcludes. The office matters. For judges, the good behavior standard \ncomes in one way or the other. For the President, the standard is \ndifferent.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. Manager Graham candidly acknowledged last \nSaturday that reasonable people could disagree as to whether this \nPresident should be removed from office, even if they believe he acted \nas charged--reasonable people could disagree. In this connection, \nconsider, if you will, the words of Senator William Pitt Fessenden, \nwritten 130 years ago. Senator Fessenden was one of the seven brave \nRepublicans who crossed party lines to vote against the conviction of \nPresident Johnson in his 1868 impeachment trial. He wrote--and I \nquote--``the offense for which a Chief Magistrate is removed from \noffice . . . should be of such a character as to commend itself at once \nto the minds of all right thinking men as, beyond all question, an \nadequate cause.'' Think about that phrase--``beyond all question.'' \nWhere there is room for reasonable disagreement, there is no place for \nconviction.\n  If many in this Chamber and in this Nation believe that these charges \ndo not meet the bar of high crimes and misdemeanors, then the question \nmust be asked, Why prolong this process?\n  I would like to turn briefly now to two grounds for dismissal based \non the manner in which the House drafted these articles. The first is \nthat each of the articles contain several quite different charges. The \nHouse compounded its charges. It is tempting to ask how, in a matter of \nsuch importance, we can urge what might appear to be a procedural, \nhighly technical argument like this one.\n  There are several answers to that. The first is that it is neither \n``procedural'' nor ``highly technical.'' It goes to the very heart of \nour constitutional protections and raises concerns about fairness and \nthe appearance of fairness in this proceeding as so many Senators have \nso eloquently noted in the past when the issue has arisen.\n  As Senator Kohl stated in the Judge Nixon impeachment matter, in \nwhich a similar omnibus article was defeated--and I quote:\n\n       The House is telling us it's OK to convict Judge Nixon on \n     Article III even if we have different visions of what he did \n     wrong. But that's not fair to Judge Nixon, to the Senate, or \n     to the American people. Let's say we do convict on Article \n     III. The American people--to say nothing of history--would \n     never know exactly which of Judge Nixon's statements we \n     regarded as untrue. They'd have to guess. What's more, this \n     ambiguity would prevent us from being totally accountable to \n     the voters for our decision.\n\n  As the Senator said, that is an unacceptable outcome, one that was \n``not fair to Judge Nixon, to the Senate, or to the American people.''\n  Judge Nixon was acquitted on this article. We suggest to you that the \nHouse is now asking this Senate to convict President Clinton on just \nsuch articles. And that is not fair either to President Clinton, to \nthis Senate, or to the American people.\n  The second response is that--even if this troubling problem were \nprocedural--fair, constitutional procedures go to the heart of the rule \nof law. As the Supreme Court has stated, ``The history of liberty has \nlargely been the history of observance of procedural safeguards.'' It \nwould, indeed, be ironic if, in the course of this proceeding in which \nthe vindication of the rule of law has so often been invoked, this body \nwere to ignore an important procedural flaw.\n  The legal basis for this argument is by now well known. Article I, \nsection 3 of the Constitution provides that on articles of impeachment \n``no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two-thirds of \nthe Members present.'' This requirement is plain. There must be, in the \nlanguage of the Constitution, ``Concurrence,'' which is to say, \ngenuine, reliably manifested agreement among those voting to convict.\n  Without clarity on exactly what the President would be convicted for, \nthere can be no concurrence. These requirements of concurrence and a \ntwo-thirds vote are the twin safeguards of the framers' plain intent to \nassure that conviction not come easily.\n  And let there be no doubt, these articles present textbook examples \nof a prosecutorial grab bag. Look at article II, which, by its terms, \ncharges obstruction of the Jones litigation. It presents six topics \nrelated to the Jones litigation and one related to the very separate \nissue of grand jury obstruction. The first six acts alleged are \nunrelated in time or alleged intent to the seventh. Under no \nconceivable theory are they part of the same scheme, and no one ever \nhas claimed them to be. But as it is drafted, and as it must be voted \non by this body, under the Senate rules, the article would allow \ncertain Senators to convict on obstruction of the Jones case and others \non grand jury obstruction. That is not concurrence in a vote on an \narticle, as the Constitution demands it. An indictment against any \nAmerican drafted like these articles could not go near the jury. It \nwould be dismissed. And no lesser standard should apply here.\n  A second fatal flaw in the drafting is their complete lack of \nspecificity, which makes it impossible to know precisely what the \nPresident is alleged to have done wrong. This defect is most \ntroublesome in the article I perjury charges, which never simply state \nwhat the President said that was allegedly perjurious. The defect is a \nplain and obvious constitutional one: The House of Representatives has \nunconstitutionally neglected its ``sole'' power to impeach and \ndelegated to the House managers that which cannot constitutionally be \ndelegated--the power to decide what the House meant. The result has \nbeen what can charitably be described as a fluid approach to the \nidentification of charges against the President. The House majority and \nits managers have sought to add, delete, amend, expand and contract the \nlist as this matter has proceeded from Mr. Starr, to the committee, to \nthe full House, to this body.\n  They also, mystifyingly, have insisted on couching their charges as \nexamples. How on Earth can an accused defend against examples? Where is \nthe notice? Where is the due process? And no sooner was this very \nconcern raised here by Mr. Ruff than they did it again. This is quite \nextraordinary.\n  In response to Mr. Ruff's challenge, the managers put out a press \nrelease, on January 19, purporting to list allegedly perjurious \nstatements on which you are to vote. And what did they say? They \noffered more examples. They said in response--and I quote--``Here are \nfour examples of perjurious statements made to the grand jury:''\n  Ladies and gentlemen, almost 40 years ago, the Supreme Court made \nclear that this kind of charging is unacceptable. When an indictment \nleaves so much to the imagination of individuals, other than the \nconstitutionally designated charging body, it must be dismissed. Again, \nno lesser standard should apply here.\n  Our fourth ground for dismissal is based on the facts. The evidence, \nin the tens of thousands of pages before you, establishes that the case \nagainst the President cannot be proven with any acceptable degree of \ncertainty. The record is filled with too much that is exculpatory, too \nmuch that is ambiguous, too much from the managers that requires \nunfounded speculation.\n\n  A very brief look at the articles and the facts makes clear that in \nlight of the uncontested exculpatory facts, such as the direct denials \nfrom Ms. Currie, from Mr. Jordan, and from Ms. Lewinsky of various \nalleged misconduct, the managers cannot possibly meet their burden of \nproof here. Look briefly at article I. Much of it challenges the \nPresident's assertions of his own state of mind, his understanding of \nthe definition given to him, his understanding of the meaning of a \nword, his legal opinion of his Jones testimony, his mindset during \nstatements of his lawyer, Robert Bennett. The managers offer \nspeculation and theories about these matters, but you are not here to \ntry speculation and theories. You are here to try facts. And the facts \ndo not support their theories.\n  Other claims in article I are so insubstantial as to be frivolous and \nunworthy of the time and attention of this\n\n[[Page S969]]\n\nhistoric body. Certain answers about the particulars of the admitted \nintimate relationship between the President and Ms. Lewinsky--whether \ntheir admitted inappropriate encounters were properly characterized as \noccurring on ``certain occasions'' is but one example--could not \npossibly have had any bearing on the Starr investigation. These answers \nwere even irrelevant, immaterial, to Mr. Starr.\n  Remember, in the grand jury the President admitted to the \nrelationship, admitted it was improper, admitted it occurs over time, \nadmitted he had sought to hide it, admitted he had misled his wife, his \nstaff, his friends, the country. But how it began, exactly when it \nbegan, how many intimate encounters there were, whether there were 11 \nor 17 or some other number and with what frequency, these are details \nirrelevant to the Starr investigation, and I must say, irrelevant to \nyour decision whether to remove the freely elected President of the \nUnited States.\n  There has been much discussion about the Jones deposition here and \nwhether it, too, is a part of article I. The point is a simple one. The \nHouse of Representatives exercised its constitutional authority, and in \na bipartisan vote defeated an article of impeachment based on the \nanswers in the Jones deposition. Those answers are not before you and \nthe managers' sleight of hand cannot now put them back into article I. \nThe article charges only the statements made in the grand jury about \nthat deposition. The managers ask you to look at one response: The \nPresident's lawyerly assertion that the Jones deposition was not \nlegally perjurious, however frustrating or misleading, and to read that \nas an affirmation of every answer he gave. But the grand jury testimony \nmust be read as a whole.\n  What did the President convey during that testimony? Certainly not \nthat he was standing behind every word in the Jones deposition as the \nwhole truth. He spent 4 hours in the grand jury explaining that \ntestimony--adding to it, clarifying it, discussing the confusing \ndeposition questions and answers, and pointing out his efforts to be \nliterally truthful, if not forthcoming, explaining what he had tried to \ndo, the line he had tried to walk, however successfully or \nunsuccessfully. He laid it all out. He was not asked by Mr. Starr to \nreaffirm or adopt the earlier testimony, and he did not reaffirm or \nadopt it.\n  This brings us to the last issue in article I, the so-called touching \nissue. My colleague, Mr. Craig, has talked at length about the legal \nand practical obstacles to a case based on an oath against an oath. \nWhether compelled by law or practice, the rule reflects the commonsense \nproposition that there will always be a reasonable doubt as to the \ntruth when the case rests merely on an oath against an oath. That is \nwhy seasoned prosecutors said in the House of Representatives that they \nwould never bring such a case. That is why you need no more information \nto conclude that conviction on that basis will not be possible.\n\n  The evidence also undermines the allegations of article II. My \ncolleagues, Ms. Mills and Mr. Kendall, made a detailed review of the \nallegations in each of the seven subparts of article II. They went over \nthe evidence in great detail, and I am certainly not going to repeat \nthat here. They pointed to the significant amount of direct evidence in \nthe record that controverts the claims made in this article, most \nnotably the consistent statements by Ms. Lewinsky that no one ever \nasked, suggested, or encouraged her to lie, and that no one ever \npromised her a job for her silence.\n  They demonstrated that with regard to the transfer of gifts, the \ntestimony of Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Currie has consistently been \ninconsistent, but that even Ms. Lewinsky has acknowledged it was she \nwho was concerned about the gifts and who raised the issue with the \nPresident. And the fact that the President gave Ms. Lewinsky more gifts \non December 28 simply cannot be reconciled with any theory of the \nmanagers' case.\n  Ms. Mills reviewed the evidence concerning the President's \nconversation with Ms. Currie on the Sunday after the Paula Jones \ndeposition. However ill-advised that conversation might have been under \nthe circumstances, it was not criminal. The President was motivated by \nhis own anxieties and by a desire to find out what Ms. Currie knew in \nanticipation of the media storm he feared would break, as it surely \ndid. Contrary to the suggestion of Mr. Manager Hutchinson, Ms. Currie \nhad not yet been subpoenaed at the time of that conversation. Ms. \nCurrie was not on any Jones case witness list at the time of the \nconversation. She testified that she felt absolutely no pressure to \nchange her account during that conversation. She never testified that \nshe felt uncomfortable--again, contrary to the suggestion of Mr. \nManager Hutchinson. She was not a witness. There was no pressure. There \nis a completely reasonable explanation.\n  Let me be clear here: There is no evidence that the President ever \nasked Ms. Lewinsky to file a false affidavit or told her to give false \ntestimony if she appeared as a witness. Both believed Ms. Lewinsky \ncould file a limited but true affidavit that might--might--avoid a \ndeposition in the Jones case. While the two had discussed cover stories \nto explain Ms. Lewinsky's visits, Ms. Lewinsky never testified that \nthey discussed the cover stories in the context of the possibility of \nher testifying personally, as article II alleges.\n  Now you have heard in detail from Mr. Craig and Mr. Kendall about the \nfleeting moment in the Jones deposition when Mr. Bennett tried \nunsuccessfully to prevent the President being questioned about Ms. \nLewinsky by citing her affidavit. The judge immediately overruled the \nobjection. It did not obstruct in any way the Jones lawyers' ability to \nquestion the President.\n  The statement had no effect. And the tape of the President cannot \ndisprove the President's testimony that he wasn't paying attention. He \ndoesn't comment, concur, or even nod. With a weak case at hand, the \nmanagers have tried to turn a blank stare into a high crime.\n  The last subpart of article II is flawed in many respects: The \narticle alleges obstruction of the Jones case, but the President's \nmisleading statements to his White House aides about Ms. Lewinsky had \nno effect on that case at all. In any event, the effect of the \nPresident's statements on his aides was no different than on the \nmillions of Americans who had heard and seen the President make similar \ndenials on television.\n  And finally, the subpart claims obstruction of the grand jury, \nwhereas the whole point of article II is alleged obstruction of the \nJones case. As I asked before, what is it doing here?\n  As to Ms. Lewinsky's job search, all the managers have presented it \nis a theory, a hypothesis in search of factual support.\n  The direct evidence is clear and uncontradicted. Ms. Lewinsky, Mr. \nJordan, the President, and people at the New York City companies Ms. \nLewinsky contacted all testified that there was no relation of any of \nthe job search activity to the Jones case--none. Not a single witness \nsupports the managers' theory. As we demonstrated, their core theory \nthat the job assistance intensified after the Court's December 11 order \nwas based on plain and simple error. And without that support, the \ntheory collapsed.\n  No doubt, the managers' response will be that that is why witnesses \nare needed, to help the managers make their case. But witnesses will \nnot fill the void in the evidence:\n  First, because the evidence, as we have shown, is overwhelmingly \nuncontested. If there is no dispute, why do witnesses have to be \nquestioned at all? House Majority Counsel Schippers himself made this \npoint when speaking of the very same transcripts and FBI interviews \nthat you all have before you. He stated to the Judiciary Committee: \n``As it stands, all of the factual witnesses are uncontradicted and \namply corroborated.''\n  Second, because the actual disagreements--for example, what was in \nthe President's mind in his deposition?--are about conclusions that \nmust be drawn from the undisputed evidence, not disputes in the \nevidence itself. More evidence will not inform a judgment on the \nPresident's state of mind.\n  Third, because those witnesses with testimony pertinent to the \ncharges have already repeated their testimony again and again and \nagain--in some instances, 5 or 10 times--over and over and over to FBI \nagents, to prosecutors, to grand jurors. Experienced career \nprosecutors, trying to make their best\n\n[[Page S970]]\n\ncase against the President, questioned scores of witnesses. They \ncompiled tens of thousands of pages of evidence. They questioned Ms. \nLewinsky on at least 22 separate occasions. They questioned Mr. Jordan \non at least five occasions. They questioned Ms. Currie on at least \neight occasions. On one day alone--July 22, 1998--prosecutors asked Ms. \nCurrie more than 850 questions, and that was only 1 of her 5 \nappearances before the grand jury or FBI agents. And they did, in \nfact--contrary to the suggestion of the managers--question witnesses, \nincluding Ms. Lewinsky, after the President's testimony to the grand \njury.\n  These witnesses whom I have mentioned, who were questioned \nrepeatedly, are not alone. They could not possibly add to their \ntestimony, or amend it, in any significant way that could alter the \njudgment you could make today. Yet, it is the hope that these witnesses \nwill be forced to change their testimony, to provide evidence where \nthere now is none, that drives the current desire to question them.\n  Let me make a few final points about this witness issue. ``Bringing \nin witnesses to rehash testimony that's already concretely in the \nrecord would be a waste of time and serve no purpose at all.'' That is \nour argument, but those are not my words, they are the words of Mr. \nManager Gekas, spoken just last fall, talking about this same factual \nrecord you have before you.\n  And Mr. Manager Gekas was correct. ``We had 60,000 pages of testimony \nfrom the grand jury, from depositions, from statements under oath. That \nis testimony that we can believe and accept. Why re-interview Betty \nCurrie to take another statement when we already have her statement? \nWhy interview Monica Lewinsky when we had her statement under oath, and \nwith a grant of immunity that, if she lied, she would forfeit?''\n\n  Again, that is our argument, but, again, those are not my words, \nthose are the words of Chairman Hyde. He, too, was correct. Those words \napply with equal force today. The witnesses are on the record. Their \ntestimony is known. There is no need to put them through the ordeal of \ntestimony again.\n  The House managers, no doubt, will answer that that was then, this is \nnow. But that is not good enough. The House had a constitutional duty \nto gather and assess evidence and testimony and come to a judgment as \nto whether it believed the President should be removed from office--not \nto casually and passively serve as a conveyor belt between Ken Starr \nand the U.S. Senate, not to ask this body to do the work the House \nfailed to do.\n  The actual power to remove the President resides here, of course. But \nthe power to take that first step rests with the House. And the House \nexercised it: The articles explicitly find that certain conduct \noccurred and that that conduct warrants ``removal from office and \ndisqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or \nprofit under the United States.'' If there was any doubt about the \ntestimony on which they based their judgment in reaching that \nconclusion, such doubt should have been resolved before any Member rose \nto say ``aye'' to an article of impeachment calling, for the first time \nin 130 years, for the Senate to decide on the removal of the President.\n  The President did not obstruct justice. The President did not commit \nperjury. The President must not be removed. The facts do not permit it.\n  Now, ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I hope I have outlined \nclearly for you some of the many valid grounds on which you might base \na decision to vote for the motion offered by Senator Byrd.\n  On constitutional grounds, the matters simply don't meet the test of \nhigh crimes and misdemeanors, as specified by the framers or \ninterpreted by hundreds of historians. As a matter of law, these \narticles are defective. In a court, they would be dismissed in a \nheartbeat for vagueness and for being prosecutorial grab bags.\n  The evidence itself, after being gathered in what may be one of the \nlargest criminal investigations in this country's history, fails to \noffer a compelling case and is based largely on weak inferences from \ncircumstantial evidence. Each of these is reason enough to end this \ntrial now, without further proceedings.\n  As Senator Bumpers said more personally and eloquently than I could \nhope to, the President has been punished; he is being punished still--\nas a man, as a husband, as a father, as a public figure. Beyond his \nfamily, you have been reminded that the criminal law will still have \njurisdiction over Bill Clinton the day he leaves office. And while I am \nconfident the case would have no merit in a court of law, that is the \nvenue in which justice may be sought against an individual.\n  So the sole question you are faced with is the most important one: Do \nyou, for the first time in 210 years of our freedom, set aside the \nultimate expression of a free people and exercise your power to remove \nthe one national leader selected by all of us?\n  If you don't believe this body should remove the President, or if you \nbelieve that no amount of requestioning of witnesses or torturing facts \nwill change enough minds to garner the two-thirds majority necessary to \nremove the President, or if you simply have heard enough to make up \nyour mind, then the time to end this is now.\n  The President has expressed many times how very sorry he is for what \nhe did and for what he said. He knows full well that his failings have \nlanded us in this place, and he is doing all he can to set right what \nhe has done wrong.\n  The entire Nation--indeed the world--is now looking to this body, to \nthis Chamber, to this floor, for sound judgment, and we are asking you \nnot to answer a serious personal wrong with a grievous constitutional \nwrong. When we ask you to vote for Senator Byrd's motion to dismiss, we \ndo not mean that nothing ever happened, that this is no big deal--and \nthat is where we lawyers have done a disservice to the language--\nbecause this is a big deal. It is a very big deal. Punishment will be \nfound elsewhere. Judgment will be found elsewhere. Legacies will be \nwritten elsewhere. None of that will be dismissed. None of that can \never be dismissed.\n  We ask you to end this case now so that a sense of proportionality \ncan be put back into a process that seems long ago to have lost all \nsense of proportionality. We also ask you to end the case now so that \nthe family members and others who did no wrong can be spared further \npublic embarrassment.\n  We also ask you to end this case now so that the poisonous arrows of \npartisanship can be buried and the will of the people can be done--\nallowing all of you to spend your full days on the most pressing issues \nof the country.\n  You have heard the charges in full; heard the defense. Now is the \ntime to define how the national interests can best be served by \nextending this matter indefinitely or ending it now. We submit that it \nis truly in the best interest of this Nation to end this ordeal in this \nChamber at this time and in this way.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire? Is there further presentation from the \nWhite House counsel, or will the time be used for concluding remarks by \nthe House managers?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The White House counsel has 6 minutes remaining; \nthe managers have reserved 36 minutes.\n  Mr. Counsel RUFF. There will be no further presentation, Mr. Chief \nJustice.\n\n\n                                 Recess\n\n  Mr. LOTT. In view of that, Mr. Chief Justice, I understand the White \nHouse counsel will have no further presentation to make, so what is \nleft would be the concluding remarks by the House managers. I would \nlike for us, when that is concluded, to go right into the votes.\n  In view of that, I think it would be a good idea to take a 15-minute \nbreak at this point. And I ask for that.\n  There being no objection, at 4:12 p.m., the Senate recessed until \n4:38 p.m.; whereupon, the Senate reassembled when called to order by \nthe Chief Justice.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. Chief Justice, I believe we are ready now for the \nclosing part of the argument by the House managers on the motion to \ndismiss.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the House managers. Mr. \nHutchinson.\n  Mr. Manager HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators. My\n\n[[Page S971]]\n\nfellow Manager Graham has extended me a few minutes before he comes up \nhere just to allow me to respond to a couple of factual assertions by \nthe White House counselors during the recent presentation. I know that \nthere was a reference made to the impeachment proceedings of former \nPresident Nixon, and there were various articles that were considered. \nBut one of them that I don't believe was talked about was obstruction \nof justice, and I believe that the Senators in this Chamber would agree \nthat obstruction of justice has historically been a basis for \nimpeachment of public officials because of the impact that it has on \nthe administration of justice. And that was historically true during \nthe time of the impeachment of President Nixon. It was an issue during \nthat time and it should be no less of a concern this year, in 1999.\n  Now, when I listen to a defense attorney make a presentation, \noftentimes I will listen to what they didn't cover as much as what they \ndid cover. And you always have to go back to that because many times \nthat points to a big gap of something they just can't explain. As I \nlistened to the presentation, of course they addressed the assertion \nthat Ms. Currie, Ms. Betty Currie was, in fact, not a witness at the \ntime the President called her in and went through the questioning of \nher after his deposition on January 17. But, yet, it has been clearly \nestablished that she was a known witness at the time. Now, they hoped, \nthey prayed, they wished, they counted for the fact that that subpoena \nwould never be uncovered. But the subpoena was uncovered. The fact was \nestablished that she was put on the witness list and that she was a \nknown witness at the time. But the fact is, it does not matter. She was \na prospective witness, and that was what the President did when he came \nback and talked to her.\n\n  But what has never been addressed--has never been addressed--is why \nin the world did the President believe he needed to talk to her a \nsecond time. It was one time the questioning, but 2 days later she was \nbrought in and taken through the same paces. The answer was, ``Well, he \nexplained it.'' Well, he tried to explain why he did it the first time, \nhe was trying to get information. There could be no explanation for the \nsecond instance of which she was called in and questioned. She was a \nwitness, she was a known witness and she had to be talked to, and it \nwas done twice.\n  Another thing that I do not recall ever being mentioned, they argue \nthat, ``Well, there is no evidence of favors on a job search,'' and I \nbelieve that is not supported by the record. How many times has the \nPresident's attorneys discussed the description and the report by Mr. \nVernon Jordan to the President, ``Mission accomplished''? I do not \nbelieve they have ever discussed that particular terminology. I do not \nbelieve they have ever discussed the terminology, the call from Mr. \nVernon Jordan to Mr. Perelman saying, ``Make it happen if it can \nhappen.''\n  So I think there are some gaps in their defense and, clearly, you \nunderstand that the facts have supported each of the allegations of \nobstruction that we have set forth.\n  They argue that, ``Well, there was no evidence of any false \naffidavit.'' Whether it is evidence that an affidavit was encouraged by \nthe President of the United States, he suggested the affidavit and, as \nof necessity, it would have to be false if it was going to be \naccomplishing the intended purpose.\n  They are asking you in this motion to dismiss to ignore the evidence \nthat we have presented, to ignore the testimony, the documentary \nevidence, to ignore the common sense and simply to accept the denials \nof the President of the United States. That is not what a motion to \ndismiss is about. We ask that we move forward to consider the full \ndevelopment of these facts.\n  I yield to Mr. Graham.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Mr. Graham.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. How much time do we \nhave left?\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The House managers have 32 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. To my colleagues, \nmy chairman wants 11 minutes. So, for my own sake, please let me know \nwhen we get close.\n  (Laughter.)\n  We meet again to discuss a very, very important event in our Nation's \nhistory. To dismiss an impeachment trial under these facts and under \nthese circumstances would be unbelievable, in my opinion, and do a lot \nof damage to the law and to the ultimate decision this body has to \nmake: whether or not Bill Clinton should be our President.\n  As I understand the general nature of the law, the facts and the law \nbreak our way for this motion. What I would like to discuss with you is \nwhether or not a reasonable person could believe that Bill Clinton \nshould not be our President and the facts that have been presented rise \nto the level of creating serious doubts about whether he is a criminal, \nnot just a bad man who did bad things. For he is a good man in some \nways, as all of us are, and he has done some things that everybody in \nthis body will condemn roundly.\n\n  America needs no more lectures about Bill Clinton's misconduct, about \nhis inappropriate relationship. We need no more lectures about his \nsins. We all have those. We need to resolve, Is our President a \ncriminal? That is harsh, but the facts bear out those statements.\n  When you dismissed the judges for perjury and filing statements under \noath, some of you said some very harsh things about those judges, not \nbecause you are harsh people, but because their conduct warranted it.\n  One thing I am not going to say, and I will quit this job before I do \nthis, is, I am not going to run over anybody's conscience when they are \nexercising it as they deem appropriate for the good of this Nation. My \nname has been brought up a couple of times about whether or not \nreasonable people can disagree with me and still be reasonable about \nwhat we should do in this case. I have told you the best I can that \nthere is no doubt these are high crimes, in my opinion. This is a hard \ndecision for our country, but when I first spoke to you, I thought we \nwould be better off if Bill Clinton left office, and I want the chance \nto prove to you why. Give me a chance to prove to you why I believe \nthat, why my colleagues voted our conscience to get this case to where \nit should be, not swept under a rug, but in a trial to a disposition.\n  I have lost no sleep worrying about the fact that Bill Clinton may \nhave to be removed from office because of his conduct. I have lost tons \nof sleep thinking he may get away with what he did. But the question \nwas: Could you disagree with Lindsey Graham and be a good American, in \nessence? Absolutely. You can disagree with me on abortion, and Mr. \nHyde, and I am not going to trample on who you are, because I know that \nthe liberal wing of the Democratic Party and the moderate wing of the \nRepublican Party have different views than I do.\n  But I didn't come up here to run you down. I came up here to build my \ncountry up the way I think it needs to be built up.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, if you will listen to our case, \nif you will let us explain why we have lost no sleep asking for this \nPresident to be removed and why we voted to get it here and you \ndisagree with me at the end of the day, I will never ever say you don't \nlove your country as much as I do. That is what that statement was \nmeant to convey, and it will convey that until I am dead and gone.\n  The idea that 130 years ago a Senator took a vote and made a \nstatement that the only way you can remove a President is it has to be \nunquestionable in anybody's mind tells me he sure thought a lot of \nhimself. I am glad to see that stopped in the Senate. One hundred \nthirty years later, we don't have people like that anymore. What that \nconveyed to me was that a person made a hard decision and tried to \ncreate a standard that slams somebody else who came out differently.\n  I hope that is not what this is all about. He goes down in history, \nbut I wouldn't want that as part of my epitaph, that when I voted my \nconscience, I reached a level that if you didn't go where I was, there \nis something wrong with you.\n  What did Bill Clinton do, and why are we all here? Are we here \nbecause of Ken Starr, because of Lindsey Graham, because of--why are we \nhere? We are here because William Jefferson Clinton, in my opinion--we \nare here because on our watch in the House, the President\n\n[[Page S972]]\n\nof the United States, when he was a defendant in a lawsuit, instead of \ntrusting the legal system to get it right, did everything possible, in \nmy opinion, to undermine the rule of law, including going to a grand \njury in August of last year and committing perjury after people in this \nbody and prominent Americans said, ``Stop it.'' And now we are here to \nsay, ``Well, we really didn't mean it. The motion to dismiss means \nwe're sort of just kidding, Mr. President.''\n  If you believe he is not guilty of these offenses based on this stage \nof the trial, then you ought to grant the motion to dismiss, but you \nwill be changing the law as we know it today. We haven't had a chance \nto present our case, really, and all the facts should break our way. \nYou can believe this if you would like. They stood up here and argued \nthat the conversation between President Clinton and his secretary, \nBetty Currie, was to find out what she knew to refresh his memory. If \nyou think that when the President goes to Betty Currie and makes the \nfollowing statement, ``Monica wanted to have sex with me and I couldn't \ndo that,'' that he is trying to figure out what she knew and is trying \nto refresh his memory, you can do that. I would suggest that ``ain't'' \nreasonable. If you believe that he wanted to figure out whether he was \nalone or not with her and he had to ask Betty, that is not reasonable. \nThat is a crime.\n\n  Let me tell you the subtleties of this case, things that really tell \nyou a lot about why we are here--William Jefferson Clinton. Before we \nget into the subtleties of this case, Senator Bumpers made a very \neloquent speech about the ups and the downs of this case and about his \nrelationship with the President and how close it was, and the human \nnature of what is going on here. But here is what he said:\n\n       You pick your own adjective to describe the President's \n     conduct. Here are some that I would use: indefensible, \n     outrageous, unforgivable, shameless.\n\n  How about illegal?\n  And he says:\n\n       I promise you the President would not contest any of those \n     or any others.\n\n  When you put in the word ``illegal,'' everything is a big \nmisunderstanding.\n  Take this case to a conclusion, so America will not be confused as to \nwhether or not their President committed crimes. There will be people \nwatching what we do here, and they will be confused as to whether or \nnot the conversation between President Clinton and Ms. Currie was \nillegal or not. Let us know. That is so important.\n  Let us know--when he went to Monica Lewinsky and talked about a cover \nstory--if that is what we want to go on here every day. And a trial 20 \nmonths from now does us no good, because this happened when he was \nPresident, ladies and gentlemen. This happened when he raised the \ndefense, ``You can't sue me because I'm President.''\n  And what did he do after that defense was taken away from him by the \nSupreme Court? He went back to somebody who is very loyal to him, \nsomebody who admires him, somebody whom you and I pay her salary--his \nsecretary. And he put her in a situation, through misleading her, that \nshe was going to pass on his lies. That is not what we pay her to do. \nHe put her in a situation where she was going to incur legal costs \nbecause he cared more about himself than he did his secretary. He put \nhis Cabinet Members, he put the people who work for him, in a horrible \nspot.\n  The subtleties of this case. Let me tell you one of the subtleties of \nthis case. And this was read by the defense in this case:\n\n       The President had a followup conversation with Mr. Morris \n     during the evening of January 22, 1998, when Mr. Morris was \n     considering holding a press conference to blast Monica \n     Lewinsky out of the water. The President told Mr. Morris to \n     be careful. According to Mr. Morris, the President warned him \n     not to be too hard on Ms. Lewinsky because ``there's some \n     slight chance that she may not be cooperating with Starr and \n     we don't want to alienate her by anything we're going to put \n     out.''\n\n  And they were trying to tell you that ``ain't'' bad, that is a good \nthing. The best you can get from that statement is the President, when \napproached with the idea of blasting her, said, ``Let's wait.''\n  The subtleties in this case. Who is this young lady? His consensual \nlover. But this case started not about consensual loving. This case \nstarted about something far from consensual loving. This case started \nabout something like a Senator who ran into problems with you all. And \nif you will let us develop our case, you may have a hard time \nreconciling those two decisions. But that is up to you.\n\n  Please don't dismiss this case. For the good of this country, for the \ngood of the law, let us get to what happened here.\n  John Podesta--the subtleties of this case--he talked to him about \nwhat happened, and he said, ``I had no relationship with her \nwhatever.'' Everybody who went into that grand jury, who talked to Bill \nClinton, was lied to. And they passed those lies on to a Federal grand \njury. You know what? In America that is a crime, even if you are \nPresident. And you need to address whether that happened or not. Don't \ndismiss this case.\n  But you know what is even more subtle is that John Podesta, somebody \nwho is very close to him, once he said nothing happened, felt the need \nto ask one more question--and pardon me for saying this--``Does that \ninclude oral sex?'' That says a lot about what Mr. Podesta thinks about \nMr. Clinton, because he felt he had to go one step further, and in his \ngrand jury testimony he tells us the President took that behavior off \nthe table.\n  Some of you are worried about the perjury charge in this case. Let me \ntell you right now, you should have no worries, because you have a \ndilemma on your hands that is easy to resolve in terms of whether or \nnot the President committed perjury in the grand jury. If you believe \nthat he said that he was truthful when he said, ``I never lied,'' or, \n``I was always truthful to my subordinates, to the people that work for \nme, to my aides,'' then when he told John Podesta, ``Our relationship \ndid not include oral sex,'' he was being truthful. If he was being \ntruthful to John Podesta, he lied through his teeth about everything \nelse in the grand jury when he considered or when he approached the \ngrand jury with the idea that, ``Our relationship was of one kind of \nsex but not the other.'' He told John Podesta it wasn't there at all.\n  You pick the lie, but it is there. And if you can reconcile that, you \nare better than I am. That is up to you all. And does it really matter? \nSo what? I think it matters a great deal if you are suing for sexually \nharassing somebody, and they are on to the fact that you can't control \nyourself enough to stop it 4 or 5 years after you are sued, and you are \ndoing it in the White House with somebody half your age. I think that \nwould matter. Maybe that is the difference between getting bamboozled \nin court and having to pay $850,000.\n  People are going to be confused if we don't bring this case to a \nconclusion. I suggest to you, it matters a great deal, that any major \nCEO, any low-level employee of any business in the country, would have \nbeen tossed out for something like that. But I know he is the \nPresident. Electing somebody should not distance them from common \ndecency and the rule of law to the point that, when it is all over \nwith, you don't know what you have got left in this country.\n  Is that what you want to do in this case? Just to save this man, to \nignore the facts, to have a different legal standard, to make excuses \nthat are bleeding this country dry?\n  The effect of this case is hurting us more than we will ever know. Do \nnot dismiss this case. Find out who our President is. Come to the \nconclusion, not that it was just bad behavior, it was illegal behavior. \nTell us what is right. Tell us what is wrong. Give us some guidance. \nUnder our Constitution, you don't impeach people at the ballot box, you \ntrust the U.S. Senate. And I am willing to do that. Rise to the \noccasion for the good of the Nation.\n  Thank you very much.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Do the House managers have any additional \npresentation?\n  Mr. Manager GRAHAM. Yes. I am sorry. Mr. Chief Justice, I now yield \nto Manager Hyde.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes Manager Hyde.\n  Mr. Manager HYDE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.\n  Mr. Ruff, and counsel, and distinguished Senators, I want to be very \ncandid with you, and that may involve diplomatic breaches because I am\n\n[[Page S973]]\n\nparliamentarily illiterate. But nonetheless, I looked at this motion to \ndismiss and I was astounded, really. If the Senate had said something \nsimilar to the House, it would certainly have received such treatment \nas comports with comity, and I don't know enough about comity to wave \nthat flag, but I don't want to waive my rights to raise that issue, \nanyway.\n  I know Black's Law Dictionary is a resource book for all of us, but I \nlooked in the Thesaurus about ``dismiss'' and I came up with \n``disregard, ignore, brush off.'' I just was surprised that this motion \nis here now before we conclude the case.\n  Some years ago when I was trying lawsuits, I appeared before a judge \nin Chicago. My opponent was an oldtimer who was just mean--a good \nlawyer, but he was mean--and the judge interrupted him in one tirade \nand he said, ``Counsel, I have a lot of respect for you. I wish you had \na little respect for this court.'' I sort of feel that way. I sort of \nfeel that we have fallen short in the respect side because of the fact \nthat we represent the House, the other body, kind of blue-collar \npeople, and we are over here trying to survive with our impeachment \narticles.\n  The most salient reason for defeating this motion is article I, \nsection 3 of the Constitution which says that the Senate shall have the \nsole power to try--to try--all impeachments. Now, a trial, as I \nunderstand it, is a search for truth, and it should not be trumped by a \nsearch for an exit strategy.\n  It seems to me this motion elevates convenience over constitutional \nprocess and by implication ratifies an unusual extension of sovereign \nimmunity. If these articles are dismissed, all inferences in support of \nthe respondents, in support of us, the managers, should be allowed; and \nif you allow all reasonable inferences in our favor, what kind of a \nmessage does it send to America to dismiss the articles of impeachment? \nCharges of perjury, obstruction of justice are summarily dismissed--\ndisregarded, ignored, brushed off. These are charges that send ordinary \nfolk to jail every day of the week and remove Federal judges. But I can \nsee this President is different. But if the double standard is to \nflourish on Capitol Hill, I don't think we have accomplished a great \ndeal.\n  Yes, it is cumbersome. These proceedings are archaic in many ways. \nThe question period was something out of the Old Bailey, I guess. I \ndon't know. But democracy is untidy. I will stipulate that. It is \nuntidy. But it is also a blessing. Impeachment and trial by the Senate \nwere devised by our framers to make this difficult process as \ndefinitive as possible.\n  ``Let's get the matter behind us.'' That is a mantra. That is a \ncliche. We all say it. You won't get it behind you if you dismiss this \nwithout voting on the articles. You guarantee contention. You will \nnever get it behind us. Vote these articles up or down. That is the \nonly way they really get it behind us.\n  What this is--this motion--is a legal way of saying, ``so what'' to \nthe charges that we levied here. Now, look at what these charges are. \nSo what that the President violated his oath of office and willfully \ncorrupted and manipulated the judicial process for his personal gain \nand exoneration. So what that President Clinton willfully provided \nperjurious, false, and misleading testimony to the grand jury on \nseveral topics. So what that the President corruptly encouraged a \nwitness in a Federal civil rights action brought against him to execute \na sworn affidavit in that proceeding that he knew to be perjurious, \nfalse, and misleading. So what that the President encouraged a witness \nto lie to the grand jury and conceal evidence. So what that the \nPresident has undermined the integrity of his office, has brought \ndisrepute on the Presidency, has betrayed his trust as President, and \nhas acted in a manner subversive to the rule of law and justice, to the \nmanifest injury of the people of the United States.\n\n  That is an awful lot to dismiss with a brushoff, to ignore with a \nmere ``so what.''\n  No, it may be routine. We certainly don't have enough experience in \nthese impeachment matters, and thank God for that. It may be routine to \nfile a motion to dismiss. But I take very seriously a motion to \ndismiss, especially when it is offered by the very distinguished \nSenator who did that. But I hope in a bipartisan way, I would hope some \nDemocrats would support the rejection of this motion, as difficult as \nit is, because I don't think this whole sad, sad, drama will end. We \nwill never get it behind us until you vote up or down on the articles. \nAnd when you do, however you vote, we will all collect our papers, bow \nfrom the waist, thank you for your courtesy, and leave and go gently \ninto the night. But let us finish our job.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LOTT. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Chief Justice Rehnquist.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. If it is appropriate at this point, I ask the Senators if \nthey would remain at their desks so we can go through this vote, and I \nask unanimous consent, since we are all here, to reduce the time for \nthe vote from 15 minutes to 10 minutes.\n  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there objection to the Senator from Iowa modifying his motion?\n  Without objection, it is modified.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read the motion, as modified, as follows:\n\n       I move to suspend the following portions of the Rules and \n     Procedure and Practice in the Senate When Sitting on \n     Impeachment Trials in regard to debate by Senators on a \n     motion to dismiss during the trial of President William \n     Jefferson Clinton:\n       (1) The phrase ``without debate'' in Rule VII;\n       (2) The following portion of Rule XX: ``, unless the Senate \n     shall direct the doors to be closed while deliberating upon \n     its decisions.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enhance the \nability of direct broadcast satellite and other multichannel video \nproviders to compete effectively with cable television systems, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                  the satellite television act of 1999\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the past several years some \nsatellite TV companies routinely broke the law by selling customers \ndistant network stations when they weren't authorized to.\n  These customers bought the service in good faith. For many, \nespecially those in rural areas, these distant network stations are the \nonly source of decent network TV reception. For others, they provide a \nwindow on life in a distant city.\n  Despite the fact that these satellite TV customers had no intention \nof breaking the law, and despite the fact that many welcome the added \ndiversity these distant network stations provide, and despite the fact \nthat the law prevents satellite TV companies from transmitting local \nnetwork stations, many of these customers--perhaps as many as two \nmillion of them--are within weeks of losing their distant network \nstations, thanks to a court order secured by local TV stations, and TV \nnetwork broadcasters. And the way the law is written, there's not much \nthe FCC or anybody else can do to stop it--unless we change the law.\n  Mr. President, that's what I propose to do. Today, with the \ncosponsorship of Senator Conrad Burns, I am introducing the Satellite \nTelevision Act of 1999. Together with legislation introduced earlier \nthis week by myself and Senators Hatch, Leahy, DeWine, Kohl,\n\n[[Page S977]]\n\nand Lott, this legislation will settle, in a fair and rational way, the \nongoing dispute between broadcasters and satellite TV companies about \nhow and when satellite TV customers can receive local and distant \nnetwork TV stations.\n  It should come as no surprise that telecommunications law, like the \nnotoriously failed 1996 Telecommunications Act, often seems to work \nagainst the interests of the average consumer: the plain but sorry fact \nis that the interests of big telecommunications companies, not average \nAmericans, are the ones that the laws are really drafted to serve. And \nwhy is that? because these companies often successfully argue that \nserving their interests is serving the consumer's interests.\n  That just doesn't wash in this case, however. For example, how can \nanybody argue with a straight face that it's really serves the \nconsumer's interests to keep satellite TV companies from carrying local \nstations? Or to allow broadcasters to force satellite TV companies to \ndrop all their distant network stations--even if local broadcasters \naren't suffering any meaningful loss of audience or revenue as a \nresult, and if the local market doesn't even have a station that \nbroadcasts the same network shows?\n  This legislation will change the law and avoid these unfair results. \nIt would allow satellite TV companies to carry local signals, and to \ncontinue carrying distant network stations in three situations: when a \nlocal network affiliate doesn't exist, when a local affiliate can't be \nreceived off-air, or when carriage of the distant signals will not \ncause local stations any significant loss of revenue. The FCC would be \nordered to determine, on an expedited, bipartisan basis, those \nsituations in which the lack of adverse impact would justify continued \ncarriage of distant network stations, and whether any program blackout \nrules should be applied to their carriage. In the interim, satellite TV \nsubscribers located at a greater distance from the local stations would \nbe permitted to continue carrying the distant network stations they \ncurrently offer. Those located close to the core of the local station's \nmarket, however, would be subject to having their distant network \nstations withdrawn by the broadcasters' enforcement of their \noutstanding judgment. This will appropriately punish the satellite TV \ncompanies that most likely deliberately broke the law, and these \nconsumers are highly likely to receive full network service from local \nnetwork station affiliates.\n  Mr. President, this bill attempts to strike a fair compromise between \nthe warring corporate interests of the satellite TV and broadcast TV \ninterests, so that we can, at least this time, avoid having consumers \nbear the consequences of bad law and corporate selfishness.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 303\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Satellite Television Act of \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting competition in cable services and making available \n     to the public a diversity of views and information through \n     cable television and other video media.\n       (2) In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress stated \n     its policy of securing lower prices and higher quality \n     service for American telecommunications consumers and \n     encouraging the rapid deployment of new telecommunications \n     technologies.\n       (3) In most places throughout America, cable television \n     system operators still do not face effective competition from \n     other providers of multichannel video service.\n       (4) Absent effective competition, the market power \n     exercised by cable television operators enables them to raise \n     the price of cable service to consumers, and to control the \n     price and availability of cable programming services to other \n     multichannel video service providers. Current Federal \n     Communications Commission rules have been inadequate in \n     constraining cable price increases.\n       (5) Direct Broadcast Satellite service has over 8 million \n     subscribers and constitutes the most significant competitive \n     alternative to cable television service.\n       (6) Direct Broadcast Satellite Service currently suffers \n     from a number of statutory, regulatory, and technical \n     barriers that keep it from being an effective competitor to \n     cable television in the provision of multichannel video \n     services.\n       (7) The most prominent of these barriers is the inability \n     to provide subscribers with local television broadcast \n     signals by satellite.\n       (8) Permitting providers of direct broadcast satellite \n     service to retransmit local television signals to their \n     subscribers would greatly enhance the ability of direct \n     broadcast satellite service to compete more effectively in \n     the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (9) Due to capacity limitations and in the interest of \n     providing service in as many markets as possible, providers \n     of direct broadcast satellite service, unlike cable \n     television systems, cannot at this time carry all local \n     television broadcast signals in all the local television \n     markets they seek to serve.\n       (10) It would be in the public interest for providers of \n     direct broadcast satellite service to fully comply with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules at the earliest possible \n     date. In the interim, requiring full compliance with the \n     mandatory signal carriage rules would substantially limit the \n     ability of direct broadcast satellite service providers to \n     compete in the provision of multichannel video services and \n     would not serve the public interest.\n       (11) Maintaining the viability of free, over-the-air local \n     television service is a matter of preeminent public interest.\n       (12) All subscribers to multichannel video services should \n     be able to receive the signal of at least one station \n     affiliated with each of the major broadcast television \n     networks.\n       (13) Millions of subscribers to direct broadcast satellite \n     service currently receive the signals of network-affiliated \n     stations not located in these subscribers' local television \n     markets. In those cases where cable service is not available \n     and where conventional rooftop antennas are not effective \n     distant network signals may be these subscribers' only source \n     of network television service.\n       (14) There is a direct link between the widespread carriage \n     of distant network stations in local network affiliates' \n     markets and a local affiliate's loss of audience share and \n     revenues, which could in turn harm the station's ability to \n     serve its local community.\n       (15) Abrupt termination of satellite carriers' provision of \n     distant network signals could have a negative impact on the \n     ability of direct broadcast satellite service to compete \n     effectively in the provision of multichannel video services.\n       (16) The public interest would be served by permitting \n     direct broadcast satellite service providers to continue \n     existing carriage of a distant network affiliate station's \n     signal where--\n       (A) there is no local network affiliate;\n       (B) the local network affiliate cannot be adequately \n     received off-air; or\n       (C) continued carriage would not be likely to materially \n     harm local television service.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to permit subscribers of Direct \n     Broadcast Satellite service who currently receive distant \n     network stations to continue to receive this service to the \n     extent that the Federal Communications Commission \n     affirmatively finds that no local station would be likely to \n     sustain audience and revenue loss that would materially \n     affect that station's ability to continue to serve its local \n     audience.\n\n     SEC. 4. MUST-CARRY FOR SATELLITE CARRIERS RETRANSMITTING \n                   TELEVISION BROADCAST SIGNALS.\n\n       Part I of title III of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end thereof \n     the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 337.

A bill to regulate commercial air tours overflying the Great \nSmokey Mountains National Park, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the great smokey national park overflights act\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces \nof aviation legislation that I believe will improve the quality of life \nfor Tennesseans. First, I would like to introduce ``The Great Smoky \nMountains National Park Overflights Act.''\n  Last year, I was an original sponsor of the ``National Parks \nOverflights Act'' along with my colleague and Chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, Senator John McCain. I was proud to have my name associated \nwith this legislation. But, in spite of overwhelming bipartisan support \nfor this legislation in the Senate, an unrelated dispute in the \nconference committee with the House of Representatives led to its \ndemise in the 105th Congress.\n  Last year's legislation would have affected many National Parks from \ncoast to coast and even Hawaii. The legislation I am introducing today \nwill only affect the Smokies. I am advancing a more limited approach \nbecause I believe the preservation of the Smokies and the safety of \npark visitors are far too important to include with other more \ncontentious legislative efforts.\n  As the air tour industry in many parks continues to grow, safety \nconcerns also increase. By addressing safety now, before tragic \naccidents occur, we can assure the public that we have taken every \nprecaution to protect visitors in our parks. Under this legislation, \nthe Federal Aviation Administrator will work in tandem with the \nSecretary of the Interior to ensure public health and safety goals are \nmet while concurrently maintaining the natural beauty and serenity of \nour Smoky Mountains National Park. This bill makes park overflight \npassenger safety a paramount concern for the Federal Aviation \nAdministrator, who, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, \nwill set minimum altitudes for overflights and will prohibit\n\n[[Page S979]]\n\nflights below those minimum altitudes where necessary to meet safety \ngoals.\n  This legislation also takes a crucial first step toward restoring and \npreserving a vital resource within the Smokies--natural quiet. The \nnatural ambient sound condition found in a park, or natural quiet, as \nit is commonly called, is precisely what many Americans seek to \nexperience when they visit some of our most treasured national parks. \nNatural quiet is as crucial an element of the natural beauty and \nsplendor of certain parks as those resources that we visually observe \nand appreciate.\n  I believe that this critical environmental legislation strikes a \ncareful balance between the reasonable concerns of those in the air \ntour industry and the environmental necessity of preserving the natural \nquiet of the Smokies. I am a pilot and I know well the beauty and \nthrill of flying low. The Smokies beg for more restraint. They must be \nenjoyed from a responsible altitude where the noise of our aircraft \ndoes not disturb the life and majesty below our wings.\n  The second piece of legislation that I would like to introduce today \nis the Air Service Improvement Act of 1999. As many of my colleagues \nknow, I have spent considerable time working with airport managers, \nairlines and many others attempting to solve the problems of \nunderserved small communities. It became clear to me early on that \nthere is no silver bullet solution. Rather, a learning process has \ntaken place where we have discovered what has worked best for the \nindividual communities in question. Moreover, the problems of small \ncommunities are related to the competition issues at larger, well-\nserved airports. Tennessee is experiencing both problems.\n  In Memphis, there is certainly adequate service, but limited \ncompetition results in high fares. In the Eastern part of our State, \nthere are several communities that have little competition and limited \nservice. We can do better.\n  It is critical that we remember that deregulation has been remarkably \nsuccessful in spite of the ``pockets of pain'' in some communities. \nTherefore any changes must be made with an emphasis on the free market \nand not be reregulatory in nature. Deregulation has served most \nAmericans well and should not be dismantled.\n  With that prologue, I would like to go through some of the provisions \nof the Small Communities Air Services Act. For most small and medium \nsized communities that are underserved, access is the key. These \nairports must have access to major hubs that provide network benefits. \nWhen travelers in the Tri-Cities have jet service to Chicago they can \nconveniently connect to nearly any city in the world. And indeed, much \nof the improvements the underserved markets of Chattanooga and the Tri-\nCities have seen over the past two years has been from the Department \nof Transportation adding slots that created additional access to \nChicago.\n  With access to the Nation's four slot-controlled airports as a \nprimary goal, I am proposing that the Secretary of Transportation be \nrequired to approve all applications from underserved small and medium-\nsized communities that partner with an air carrier that is willing to \nserve their market. The Secretary will retain the right to deny \napplications only if the Federal Aviation Administration certifies that \nthe increase in operations is unsafe or if increase in operations \nviolates the National Environmental Policy Act. In short, if an \nadditional flight from an underserved area is safe and does not have \nadverse environmental effects the slot shall be awarded.\n  Additionally, I am introducing provisions that I worked closely with \nChairman McCain on last year. These include a grant program for small \ncommunities, an in-depth study on market-based incentives using \nregional jets, and numerous safety programs affecting small communities \nincluding an FAA tower program. It is my belief that collectively, this \ninitiative will diminish many of the challenges that underserved \ncommunities now face.\n  Again, it is my strong belief that both the Overflights legislation \nand the Air Service Act will improve significantly the quality of life \nfor Tennesseans. I thank my colleagues for their consideration of these \nproposals, but I would especially like to thank the Majority Leader \nTrent Lott and Chairman John McCain for their considerable \nassistance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Bryan):\n  S. 305. A bill to reform unfair and anticompetitive practices in the \nprofessional boxing industry; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n\n\n                     muhammad ali boxing reform act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Muhammad Ali \nBoxing Reform Act in the 106th Congress. This legislation would \nestablish a series of practical reforms to reduce interstate restraints \nof trade in the industry; protect boxers from exploitative business \npractices; reduce arbitrary practices by sanctioning organizations; and \nincrease financial disclosure requirements to prevent misconduct by \npromoters and sanctioning bodies. The legislation I am introducing \ntoday is the same version of the Ali Act that was reported out of the \nSenate Commerce Committee and passed by the Senate last year.\n  I am pleased to again have the cosponsorship and sound counsel of my \ncolleague from Nevada, Senator Richard Bryan. He has a strong interest \nand long record of promoting responsible oversight of the professional \nboxing industry. Boxing is of course a major industry in Nevada, and \nSenator Bryan has worked closely with his State's athletic commission \nto assess and propose effective measure to make boxing a more respected \nand healthy industry.\n  I have attached a summary of the Ali Act to concisely describe its \nmajor provisions. The bill is a modest and practical proposal which \nwould simply curb some of the most egregious and anti-competitive \npractices which have exploited athletes and undermined the integrity of \nthe boxing industry. Senator Bryan and I worked with state \ncommissioners and credible boxing industry leaders from across the U.S. \nto develop the Ali Act. It requires no public funding and would create \nno new bureaucracy at any level of government. This legislation instead \nrequires adherence to fair business practices and public disclosure \nrequirements designed to significantly reduce abusive practices in the \nsport.\n  It is worth noting that the public response to the Ali Act has been \ntremendous. We have received strong praise for this legislation from \nevery sector of the industry and, most importantly, from boxers \nthemselves. It is to be expected that certain vested interests in \nprofessional boxing industry will not welcome any reforms of anti-\ncompetitive and confiscatory business practices in the sport. However, \nthe Ali Act will clearly improve the sport in the public interest, and \nwill not inhibit any legitimate business practices. If enacted, the \nprofessional boxing industry will not only be free of certain types of \nabusive and unethical business practices, but competition should surely \nincrease. Competition is the heart of any sport, and fair, open \ncompetition is the key to a sport's success. I look forward to the day \nwhen boxing achieves the reputation of credible competition and fair \nbusiness practices for its athletes.\n  I will work with members of the Senate Commerce Committee to promptly \nbring the Ali Act before the full Senate this year. With the Ali Act \nalso being introduced in the House of Representatives in the near \nfuture, I am hopeful that 1999 will be the year the professional boxing \nindustry in America embarks on a new path of fair business practices, \nlegitimate rankings, and enhanced integrity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act\n\n\n                  Protecting Boxers From Exploitation\n\n       (a) Declares that all contracts between boxers and \n     promoters must contain specific terms regarding the length of \n     time it covers, and the minimum number of bouts per year for \n     the boxer.\n       (b) Limits certain ``option'' contracts between boxers and \n     promoters to one year. (Those where a boxer is forced to \n     provide options to a promoter, as a condition of getting a \n     particular bout. Prevents promoter from controlling a weight \n     division by coercing options from all boxers.)\n       (c) Prohibits a promoter from forcing a boxer to hire an \n     associate, relative, or any\n\n[[Page S980]]\n\n     other individual, as the boxer's manager, or in any other \n     employment capacity. (This stops a promoter from grabbing \n     another 33% of a boxer's purse; mirrors the regulation of \n     most state commissions.)\n       (d) Prohibits conflicts of interest between managers of a \n     boxer and the promoter. (Managers should be an independent \n     advocate for the boxer--not serve the financial interests of \n     promoter.)\n\n\n               Sanctioning Organization Integrity Reforms\n\n       (e) Sanctioning organizations (abbreviation: ``SO'') \n     conducting business in the U.S. must establish objective and \n     consistent criteria for the ratings of professional boxers.\n       (f) Each year, SO's must provide the following information \n     either on a publicly accessible website, or to the FTC; their \n     bylaws, ratings criteria, and roster of officials who vote on \n     their ratings.\n       (g) When an SO changes their rating of a U.S. boxer, it \n     must inform the boxer in writing of the reason for the \n     change.

Mr. President, I rise today with bittersweet \nfeelings to pay tribute to a dear friend, Leo Cherne. Leo died on \nJanuary 12, 1999 at the age of 86. What a huge loss we mourn, but what \nan exemplary life we commemorate. Indeed, I think it safe to say Leo \nCherne's life helped to redeem the 20th century.\n  I met Leo in 1954 when I became director of public relations for the \nInternational Rescue Committee (IRC). Leo, an enormously successful \nlawyer, economist, and businessman, had become chairman of the IRC in \n1951 (after joining the board of directors in 1946). He took over for \nReinhold Niebuhr, one of this century's greatest theologians. Leo \nserved as chairman for over forty years. Then, indefatigable as he was, \nhe served as chairman emeritus until his death.\n  Under Leo's stewardship, the IRC grew into the largest refugee relief \nand resettlement organization in the world. His commitment to refugees \nand human rights was steadfast, and made a difference in the lives of \nhundreds of thousands of forsaken people over the last half century. I \nguess he took to heart Niebuhr's observation that ``Life has no meaning \nexcept in terms of responsibility.''\n  Leo co-founded the Research Institute of America in 1936; it grew out \nof his efforts to advise businessmen on how to comply with the new \nSocial Security law. He served as its executive director for \napproximately 50 years. At the end of World War II he accompanied \nGeneral Douglas MacArthur to Japan to assist with economic recovery \nthere. In 1953, Leo--a fierce anti-Communist--excoriated Senator Joseph \nMcCarthy for his demagoguery and disregard for civil rights. In 1956, \nwhen Soviet tanks rumbled into Budapest to crush the Hungarian \nuprising, Leo was at the border to help desperate Hungarians flee their \ncountry, and to bear witness. He advised presidents from Franklin \nRoosevelt to George Bush. He served as a member of the President's \nForeign Intelligence Advisory Board from 1973 to 1991.\n  In 1984, President Reagan conferred upon Leo the highest award a \ncivilian can receive: the United States Medal of Freedom. President \nReagan's citation stated,\n\n       Since the 1930s, Leo Cherne has stepped forward with \n     brilliance, energy and moral passion, and helped this nation \n     overcome countless challenges. His lifetime devotion to \n     aiding his country and to serving the cause of human freedom, \n     especially through his work on behalf of refugees, reflects \n     the strong and generous character of a man who deserves the \n     respect and gratitude of all Americans.\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\nIn 1989 Elie Wiesel nominated Leo for the Nobel Peace Prize; he \ndeserved that too. He did receive France's Legion of Honor award, \nGermany's Commander Cross, and the United Nations' Gold Medal of Peace.\n  All the while he was an accomplished sculptor! His bust of Abraham \nLincoln was in the White House. His bust of Eleanor Roosevelt is in the \nWhite House. His bust of John Kennedy is in the Berlin square Kennedy \nmade famous with his ``Ich Bin Ein Berliner'' speech. One bust, of \nRobert Frost, resides in the Department of the Interior, while another, \nof Albert Schweitzer, is in the Smithsonian.\n  How fondly I recall, when I was with the IRC, the evenings Leo and I \nwould spend at the White Horse Tavern after work! We recited the poem \nDylan Thomas wrote to his father, who was dying, ``Do Not Go Gentle \ninto That Good Night'':\n\n                 Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night\n\n     Do not go gentle into that good night,\n     Old age should burn and rave at close of day;\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     Though wise men at their end know dark is right,\n     Because their words had forked no lightning they\n     Do not go gentle into that good night.\n\n     Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright\n     Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,\n     And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,\n     Do not go gentle into that good night.\n\n     Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight\n     Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n     And you, my father, there on the sad height,\n     Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.\n     Do not go gentle into that good night.\n     Rage, rage against the dying of the light.\n\n  Leo did not ``go gentle into that good night.'' He fought pronounced \nillnesses for many years while he continued to live a productive life. \nHe raged against the ``dying of the light'' with the same tenacity he \nshowed fighting totalitarianism as one of our very best ``Cold \nWarriors''.\n  My wife, Liz, and I miss Leo dearly. Leo is survived by his his \nbrother, Jack Cherne, and by his daughter, Gail Gambino, and his \ngranddaughter Erica Lynn Gambino. All are in our thoughts and prayers. \nThe contributions he made to society cannot be overstated and are not \nlikely to be duplicated. He was a giant among men.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S986-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  IN HONOR OF THE 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GATESWORTH AT ONE MCKNIGHT \n                                 PLACE\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nthe Wellstone/Harkin motion. This motion would allow open Senate debate \nduring the Impeachment trial. Mr. Chief Justice, the American people \nshould not be excluded from one of the most important Senate \ndeliberations in United States history.\n  The result of the debates and discussions over the next days or weeks \ncould require the removal of the President of the United States for the \nfirst time in our nation's 222 year history. In our deliberations, my \ncolleagues and I will contemplate no less than reversing the outcome of \nan election in which nearly 100 million Americans cast their vote. Such \na significant decision, a decision with such profound consequences, \nshould not be reached behind closed doors.\n  I believe my constituents and all Americans deserve to hear Senate \ndeliberations from Senators--not leakers and speculators and \ncommentators.\n  From my earliest days as a Baltimore social worker to my tenure as a \nUnited States Senator, I have lived by the principle that the public \nhas a right to know and a right to be heard. This principle is no less \nimportant when a Presidential Impeachment trial is underway. It is more \nimportant than ever.\n  Now, some of my colleagues have said that these deliberations should \nbe closed because we are jurors and jurors' deliberations are kept \nsecret in a court of law. But let me tell you that this Senate tribunal \ncannot be compared to a simple court of law. Of course, the law is the \nfoundation for our work in the Senate. But as my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin, noted during the trial, we are more than jurors.\n  We are representatives of our nation. We are given responsibilities \nto deliberate on matters of public importance and vote in the public \ninterest. Never was that more true than in the Senate Trial in which we \nare now engaged.\n  The United States Senate is, ultimately, the public's institution--\nnot ours. It is for them we work and it is to them we owe our continued \nservice. I hope and believe we serve the institution well and that our \nstewardship gives credit and credence to the wisdom of our Founding \nFathers. By keeping our deliberations open, we will do service to the \nAmerican public we serve, this institution we cherish, and those \nFounding Fathers we revere.\n  I absolutely will not support closing the doors to the public and \nhope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the Sunshine \nmotion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S987-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S987-S988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                INCREASING U.S. MARITIME COMPETITIVENESS\n\n Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, Congressional and Administrative \naction is needed to strengthen the U.S. maritime industry and level the \nplaying field in the international shipping arena.\n  This vital industry serves our nation's security by providing \nessential elements of our sealift capability--loyal crews and \ncommercial ships. This sealift capability is required to project and \nsustain power abroad and preserve U.S. access to world trade. Two \nhundred years ago, protecting the U.S. merchant marine was one of the \nNavy's important missions. Today, the threat to the U.S. maritime \nindustry is just as real. It may not come not from Barbary pirates, but \nthe competitive disadvantages imposed by both this country and other \ncountries are just as dangerous.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. maritime industry has been the world leader \nin innovation over the last 30 years. It had to be, because it competes \nin the world arena with one hand tied behind its back. International \nmaritime trade has become increasingly dominated by foreign flags-of-\nconvenience. A number of small countries have decided to generate \nrevenue by creating ship registries and tax havens that impose few \nresponsibilities or costs on their users. Unfortunately, this has also \nresulted in poor compliance with international safety standards and \nevasion of pollution liability.\n  America's fleet meets the most stringent safety standards and \noperates in a higher tax environment, and has steadily lost ground to \nthese flag-convenience fleets. This situation is reaching the point \nwhere the U.S. commercial fleet's ability to meet our national security \nrequirements may soon be in jeopardy.\n  Mr. President, the solution to this problem has two parts. First, we \nmust hold other countries accountable for providing reciprocity in \naccess to maritime trade and meeting international standards for vessel \nsafety, crew training, and preventing pollution. The\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nUnited States places very few restrictions on the use of our ports to \nfacilitate international trade. Some countries, such as China, however, \nhave imposed unfair burdens on United States and other foreign vessels \nconducting business there in an effort to protect their own businesses. \nThe FMC, under Chairman Hal Creel's leadership, appropriately moved to \nhead off problems in Japan's ports during the 105th Congress and is \nincreasingly concerned about the situations in China and Brazil.\n  While our Nation encourages open competition in the commercial \nmaritime sector, America only demands that it be fair and meet minimum \nstandards for protecting our environment and our citizens. However, as \na January 3, 1999, New York Times article reported, flag-of-convenience \nship are using their foreign status and the lax oversight of their flag \nstates to escape punishment for their intentional dumping of oil in the \nocean not far from our coast. America should not allow the unscrupulous \noperation of unsafe ships with ill-trained crews to threaten the \noceans, our coastlines, or our citizens.\n  I challenge the Administration to aggressively combat these actions \nto the fullest extent of U.S. law. Under the leadership of Senators Kay \nBailey Hutchison and John McCain, the 105th Congress provided the FMC \nwith increased authority to address unfair foreign shipping practices. \nI invited the Administration to work with the 106th Congress to provide \nincreased legislative authority to counter attempts by foreign-flag \nships to escape punishment for such unconscionable behavior.\n  Second, we must level the playing field for U.S. companies competing \nin the commercial maritime arena. On the financial side, U.S. shipping \ncompanies provide equal or higher quality service than their foreign \ncompetitors at a similar cost, yet foreign shipping companies are \ngrowing and U.S. shipping companies are shrinking. This happens \nbecause, unlike U.S. shipping companies, most foreign shipping \ncompanies pay little or no income taxes. In this capital intensive \nbusiness, investments are flowing to those companies which provide a \nbetter return on investment, and the tax differential tilts this flow \ntoward foreign shipping companies. This is why foreign shipping \ncompanies are buying their U.S. counterparts instead of the other way \naround. This Nation's tax policies should promote business growth, not \nstifle it. We need to level the playing field for U.S. shipping \ncompanies in the international marketplace. I look forward to working \nwith Senator John Breaux to develop specific provisions. My colleague \nand friend shares an interest in maritime policy, and together we serve \non both the Commerce Finance Committees. This provides us with an \nability to shape maritime policy in the regulatory, tax, and trade \nenvironments.\n  Mr. President, U.S. shipping companies can compete and succeed in the \nworld's international trade marketplace when competition is \nfair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S987-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            U.S.S. ``PHAON''\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me \nin commending those brave Americans who served aboard the U.S.S. Phaon.\n  During World War II, the Phaon  compiled an outstanding record as a \nbattle damage repair ship. She was part of three major battles and \nhelped the U.S. fleet to remain in action throughout the Central \nPacific campaign.\n  The Phaon was an important part of mobile Service Squadron Ten, whose \nbattle role was to remain within the battle area and conduct repairs--\nkeeping fighting vessels in action, preventing the loss of damaged \nvessels by making them seaworthy, and returning repaired vessels to \naction as soon as possible. To accomplish this, the Navy converted tank \ntransports into battle damage repair ships.\n  The Phaon  was one of the original mobile service squadron vessels \nthat arrived in the Central Pacific in late 1943 to test new concepts \nin naval logistics and mobile repair. Their work began under fire at \nMajuro with restoration of all types of craft from the invasion of \nTarawa and repairs to the battleships Washington and Indiana.\n  By early 1944, the Phaon's crew was skilled, experienced, and ready \nto participate in the campaigns to advance across the Pacific. In \nMarch, she was with the fleet at Kwajalein and Eniwetok. In June, she \njoined the invasion of Saipan. In July, she was at Tinian. She was \nsubject to more than sixty air raids while working.\n  Time and again, the Phaon heroically entered the fray to repair a \ndamaged ship. At Saipan, the destroyer Phelps was hit while engaged in \nground support shore bombardment. She called the Phaon, and the two \nships tied bow to stern. While the Phelps continued to bomb the shore, \nthe Phaon repaired her damage and replenished her ammunition. At the \nsame time, the Phaon dispatched several off-ship repair crews to other \nvessels and had alongside for repairs a tank landing craft, a \nminesweeper, and the destroyer U.S.S. Shaw. One month later, at Tinian, \nthe Phaon performed similar feats to repair the destroyer Norman Scott \nand the battleship Colorado.\n  By the war's end, the Phaon had repaired at least 96 ships and more \nthan 2,000 vessels and crafts of all types. She played a major role in \nthe success of Service Squadron Ten, of which Rear Admiral W.R. Carter \nsaid:\n\n       Had it failed, the war would have lasted much longer at \n     much greater cost in blood and dollars.  . . . It was a \n     never-ending job, and the men and officers . . . were as much \n     a part of the fleet which defeated Japan as were . . . any \n     battleship, carrier, cruiser, or destroyer.\n\n  Admiral Raymond A. Spruance, Commander of the Central Pacific Force, \ncalled the record of the Phaon  and Service Squadron Ten achievements \nof which all Americans can be justly proud, but about which most of \nthem have little or no knowledge.\n  Mr. President, I hope that these remarks increase our knowledge and \nrespect for the critical role that damage repair ships played in the \nPacific campaigns. I know you will join me and every American in \nsaluting the brave crew of the U.S.S. Phaon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S988-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE 1999 MISS USA PAGEANT\n\n Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, it is an honor and privilege to \nrise today to acknowledge and honor the nearly 400 Missouri volunteers \nof my home state who have donated countless hours and resources to the \n1999 Miss USA pageant being held in Branson, Missouri, in February.\n  The volunteer corps is made up of many talented people who have \nworked in food services, secretarial and administrative positions, \nprovided transportation, medical and emergency services, salon \nservices, and entertainment. The ``behind the scenes'' efforts of these \nvolunteers have done much to make this pageant a great success.\n  The people of Branson and the surrounding area have come together \nwith their many diverse talents and abilities to assure the success of \nthe 1999 Miss USA Pageant. Millions of people around the world will \nfocus their eyes on Branson and Missouri on Friday, February 5, 1999 \nwhen the new Miss USA is crowned.\n  The people of Branson have made a significant contribution to the \npageant, and deserve recognition and gratitude for their efforts. These \nvolunteers embody the best of the American spirit. Mr. President, I ask \nthat members of the Senate join me in recognizing and honoring the \ngreat work of these volunteers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S988-2", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S988-S989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO LT. GEN. NORMAND G. LEZY, USAF\n\n Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \ncontributions of Lieutenant General Normand G. Lezy of the United \nStates Air Force, who will retire on March 1st after more than three \ndecades of outstanding service to our nation. Norm Lezy is an \nextraordinary officer whose leadership skills, professionalism and \nservice before self are a tribute to our country's military.\n  General Lezy is a native of Rhode Island, and was commissioned into \nthe Air Force in November 1964 through the Reserve Officer Training \nCorps program. Throughout his career, General Lezy has earned a well-\ndeserved reputation as a leader who truly cares about people. Whether \nhe was commanding his student training squadron, a Minuteman I combat \nmissile launch crew, an air base squadron, a combat support group or \nworking in his many key staff assignments, Norm Lezy made people his \npriority.\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\n  In addition to his many tours of duty around the world, General Lezy \nhas served as Director of Administration and Information Management for \nthe Secretary of the Air Force; the Deputy Chief of Staff for \nPersonnel, Headquarters Pacific Air Force; and the Director of \nServices, Headquarters U.S. Air Force. Many here in the Senate first \ncame to know Norm when he was the Director of Legislative Liaison for \nthe Secretary of the Air Force. With his exceptional knowledge of all \naspects of Air Force operations and his keen awareness of the \nlegislative process, General Lezy dramatically improved communication \nbetween the United States Congress and the United States Air Force. He \nwas the driving force in gaining Congressional support for critical Air \nForce programs such as the C-17, B-2, and F-22 weapon systems, all of \nwhich will have a significant impact on the future of the United States \nAir Force and the security of our nation.\n  In his most recent assignment as the Deputy Assistant Secretary of \nDefense (Military Personnel Policy), General Lezy was directly \nresponsible for the establishment of all policies concerning military \npersonnel matters. Specifically, he focused on accessing and retaining \nmilitary personnel in all services; pay, compensation and benefits; and \nthe classification, assignment, and career development for the 1.4 \nmillion service members of the Department of Defense. True to his \nreputation, General Lezy fought for increased support for service \nmembers and worked to develop personnel policies that will successfully \nguide our armed forces well into the next century. Some of the more \nsignificant efforts he undertook include conducting a complete review \nof the military pay and retirement system, improving recruiting \npolicies and advertising programs, enhancing Professional Military \nEducation, and streamlining the Department of Defense Disability \nEvaluation System.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, General Lezy's tireless and \nsincere dedication to the men and women in uniform has vastly improved \ntheir quality of life and mission readiness. As General Norm Lezy \nretires from the United States Air Force, he will leave behind a \ntremendous legacy.\n  Mr. President, General Norm Lezy is a great credit to the Air Force \nand the Nation. He will certainly be missed by many, both in the \nPentagon and in Congress. I salute him for his many years of selfless \nservice to our country, and offer my gratitude to Norm, his wife \nPrudence, and their son Chip on the occasion of his retirement from the \nUnited States Air Force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S988-3", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}, {"day": "25", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  WISHING MICHAEL O'HURLEY-PITTS WELL AS HE DEPARTS ST. PATRICK'S OLD \n                         CATHEDRAL AND NEW YORK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ngratitude to a constituent, Michael O'Hurley-Pitts, for his \ndistinguished record of public service and to wish him well as he \nventures North to Toronto in pursuit of new challenges and \nopportunities.\n  As a young man, Michael served admirably as a paratrooper in the 82nd \nAirborne Division and as an Airborne Ranger with the 1st Battalion \n(RANGER), 75th Infantry. No ordinary soldier, Michael was decorated \nwith the Bronze Star Medal for Valor in combat and received numerous \nawards, including the Army Commendation Medal and the Army Achievement \nMedal with Three Oak Leaf Clusters.\n  Following his tenure in the military, Michael continued to devote \nhimself to the service of others. He became the Executive Director of \nthe Children's Rights Council, contributed to parenting education \nprograms in Washington DC, and championed the cause of peace and \njustice in his native-born Ireland. He also came to Capitol Hill, where \nhe established himself as a respected congressional aide and counsel.\n  It was through his work on behalf of two venerable New York \ninstitutions, St. Patrick's Old Cathedral and St. Patrick's Old \nCathedral School, that I first learned of Michael's talents and \ncommitment to public service. As St. Patrick's Old Cathedral \nDevelopment Officer, Michael has been hugely successful in ensuring \nthat its rich history is preserved and that the School's tradition of \nexcellence continues into its third century.\n  Saturday, January 16, 1999, marked the culmination of those efforts--\na grand celebration of the famed Irish Brigade soldiers of the Civil \nWar, many of whom were immigrants and first-generation Irish-American \nparishioners of St. Patrick's Old Cathedral. The event included a \nRequiem Mass, a reenactment of their 1861 march to join Union forces, \nand a benefit concert by Irish legend Tommy Makem to be broadcast to a \nnational audience by PBS on St. Patrick's Day weekend. While detained \nand unable to attend as I had hoped, I have learned that the \ncelebration was magnificent and that there is strong interest in making \nit an annual event. Mission accomplished.\n  I was saddened to hear that New York will soon lose the gifts of \nMichael O'Hurley-Pitts, but I wish him the best as he prepares for new \nchallenges in Canada. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1999/01/25/senate-section/article/S989-1", "month": "01", "year": "1999"}]
